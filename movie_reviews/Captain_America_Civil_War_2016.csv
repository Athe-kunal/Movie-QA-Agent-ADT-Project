30 July 2021,A master class in screenwriting,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",9
30 May 2021,Captain America: Civil War is one of the best in the MCU,"This movie has a fantastic plot and brings all these characters perfectly on screen. The conflict between Steve and Tony is written so well. Zemo is also a good side villain in this movie. The action scenes were well-made.

31 March 2021,I could do this all day...,"Captain America: Civil War was a great sequel to Winter Solider. It does take some minimum inspirations from the comics. The elements and plot devices and had outstanding cinematography. A great addition to the MCU.

Solid story with some minor flaws. The writing was good and the acting was great. The characters are well written. We are introduced to two new characters such as Black Panther and Spider-Man, even in their minimum screentime they were amazing. It takes time and depth to understand Tony's decisons, during the final moments of the final battle he was consumed by vengeance and his emotions and not guided by his intellect. And lastly with fantastic CGI and music.

Overall an enjoyable film.

Memorable: No Rewatchable: Unlikely.

24 July 2021,Huge amount of spectacle & character moments,"When an incident involving Wanda Maximoff causes a deadly explosion in Lagos, the UN want to regulate the use of the Avengers.

'Captain America Civil War' is an enjoyable but slightly overlong MCU movie that has some fantastic spectacle and strong character moments.

The plot has an excellent premise with a plausible world reaction to the exploits of a group of people with superpowers and a good villain. Where it slightly falters as a stand-alone movie is the introduction of several new characters that somewhat bogs down the proceedings, but for the wider franchise narrative (and expansion) it is necessary. Several characters have emotional arcs to go through in this story and there is only so much time to do it all.

All that being said it has some of the best moments of the franchise, particularly during the scenes of internal conflict amongst the central characters. Iron Man, Black Panther, Captain America and the Winter Soldier are involved in some very compelling scenes, as are Wanda and Vision.

Some of the visuals are incredibly well done. The early Lagos action scenes hit like a sledgehammer and you can almost feel the impact of what is being shown. The airport showdown is excessive but so much fun you can imagine the writers planning a fanboy's ultimate fantasy. The final confrontation is well made from a spectacle and character perspective.

The first time I saw it was my first sight of the digital effect that makes actors appear younger. This is a very impressive use of CGI that feels like real movie magic.

All performances are strong especially Robert Downey Jr and Daniel Bruhl.

It's a 7.5/10 for me but I round upwards.",8

27 March 2021,#TeamCapWin,"""Are you Tony Stank?""

Ahhh the actions just keep getting better and better. But now we had more superheroes fighting each other. Of course the best was Spiderman who was both funny and charismatic.

As entertaining as the action, I felt the story wasn't as strong as in Winter Soldier. However, it's still a good story that led to awesome fight scenes.

For sure one of the best trilogies. 9/10.

23 November 2020,Excellent character dynamics,"Captain America: Winter Soldier was everything I wanted from a superhero movie. It was well directed, written and acted, and I was very excited for the next Captain America movie. And this movie most definietly delivered in quality. Is it as good as its predecessor? No, definietly not. There are a few flaws, which I'll talk about later. With that being said, this movie gets 4 things right for every one thing it does wrong. The plot is engaging and for the most part easy to follow and the pacing is solid. The characters all feel very 3-dimentional and fleshed out, and none of them feel different from what we already know. The movie's biggest strength is the interactions between the characters, and the different arguments presented by both sides. I love that despite obviously wanting us to side with Cap's team, the movie doesn't really make one side the ""correct"" one. Both sides present reasonable and logical arguments, and there is no right answer to what the Avengers should do. The new characters such as Black Panther and Spiderman are both very interesting and compelling, and both feel like a natural inclusion to the character list. All this is of course helped by some excellent performances as usual. The direction and cinematography are also both really good, and the action scenes are almost just as good as in Winter Soldier, even though some feel a little meaningless. And, while it might not be a big deal, MAN was it good to see a truly great antagonist in Zemo. He's well written and very well played by Daniel Brühl, and he challenges the ideological perspectives of our hero in a way no other villain in the MCU has done before. With that being said, his plan is somewhat ridiculous, and felt a little too complicated. The movie also feels a little dumb sometimes. It feels like Cap and Stark could've solved the issue much sooner had they just communicated better. Those are my main complaints, and while there are a few other things I could nitpick, nothing really ruins the film by any means. It's a more mature take on the Marvel formula, and while it's the best movie in the franchise, it's still more than good enough for me to recommend it.",8
30 August 2020,I am proud that Sebastian Stan had the chance to speak Romanian and was a nice introduction of Chadwick Boseman,"I am proud to have a fellow Romanian in the States that represents us, our language and values. I am also super happy that I had seen Chadwick Boseman in this movie, because he was a very good actor. I feel shocked that he died so young.

24 November 2021,Best fight scenes yet,"I'm not a big fan of long choreographed fight scenes. I usually think they are filler. That fight at the air port was top notch! Spider-Man needs an origin story. I haven't seen his newer films, I hope one is it. They just touched on Hydra in this movie. I hope we get more information on them in future films.

20 May 2016,"""I'm doing what has to be done... to save us from something worse.""","Superhero fatigue is a problem that many people think is starting to settle in. Fantastic Four was an abysmal film and it made less than Spy Kids 3D: Game Over. Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice received terrible reviews and had one of the biggest Friday to Sunday drops. Are people sick of these films? Well, not if you're in the Marvel family it seems. For one thing, Marvel actually takes pride and careful attention to detail with their films, both the previously mentioned titles are rush jobs for specific reasons. Civil War is proof that the good guy vs good guy aspect of superhero films can be done right.

The world wants to hold the Avengers accountable for all the death and destruction they've caused over the years, so the United Nations put together the Sokovia Accords, which means the Avengers would work for them. Tony Stark supports this. Steve Rogers does not. Things get more complicated when Bucky turns up again and is the prime suspect in a bombing that kills dozens of people. With two prominent members of the Avengers on opposing sides of the issue, will the team ever be the same again?

Civil War has a lot going for it. Stellar cast, great characters, top-notch special effects, excellent action sequences, comedic relief and...well the list goes on. The Russo brothers have delivered a slick action film that makes me comfortable with the fact that they seem to be at the helm of the Marvel franchise now. When The Avengers was first announced, I thought it was going to be dreadful, then they said these guy named Joss Whedon was going to be directing it and my expectations instantly changed. Whedon delivered a great superhero film that set up the rest of the films to come. The Russo brothers now have the task of juggling all these characters and they do an admirable job.

Each character has their shining moments, but the core of the story is Stark vs Rogers. So while it's fun to have Rudd come in and have a few laughs, I don't think anyone is expecting huge things from his character. Same with Spider-Man, who is forced in here to set up his future films within this weird shared universe with Sony. Those are not complaints, they both work wonderfully in the film. If I were to find a complaint it would be in the thought process of the villain, Zemo. His plan is so painstakingly convoluted that I wonder how it even worked at all. Too many things need to fall in place for him to get what he wants and it distracts from the emotional power of the climax. The actors and the history with the characters manage to save it a bit and do raise the stakes, but I had my problems nonetheless.

The grand spectacle at the airport between these characters was indeed a highlight. When you have characters like Vision and Scarlet Witch, who are so powerful they could end the fight instantly, it's a good idea to have them simply do damage control. I wondered how they would handle these two, they did a decent job of it. After this film, I can only hope that Infinity Wars goes this route and gives each Avenger a worthy foe to fight and not a hoard of mindless foot soldiers, which is exactly what the previous two Avengers films did.

Fans of the series will be pleased, the action is great (a bit shaky at first, but they let it breath later on) and some great introductions of new characters that will bring a fresh perspective to the franchise. Black Panther for one, steals a lot of the scenes he is in. Bold move to have such a big character ""show up"" in the film without a solo movie to set him up, but it works here. The cast is diversifying as more and more characters come into these films and I'm glad to see it. Tony Stark is great, RDJ does a great job with him, but we've seen the guy have a big role in these films 6 times now. I get that Marvel is scared to let some of these characters go because they are so integral to everything, but I honestly believe something along these lines needs to happen to bring more emotional depth to the franchise. For a studio willing to take chances are projects like Guardians of the Galaxy, they need to take a chance on this aspect as well.",8
27 April 2016,"""Captain America: Civil War"" Pits Two of MCU's Biggest Heroes in One Epic Confrontation","The Marvel universe gets tenser with the most-awaited ""Civil War"". For what fans clamor to be a storyline that the MCU is building towards, here comes a showdown of Marvel's biggest properties.

""Captain America 3"" starts off where ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" ended, when the New Avengers, led by Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), are cornered by international concern in response to continuous collateral damage. As a result, a governing act is proposed to the Avengers, fracturing the team to two sides, one led by Rogers and another led by Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). But when a new threat is on the horizon, the team has to face the repercussions of their brawls.

It is a huge help that the Russo Brothers returned to hold the weights of Marvel's Phase Three, after their spontaneous effort in ""The Winter Soldier"". Though ""Civil War"" may not be as solid as its predecessor, it is still a worthy addition to the Avengers storyline and Captain America's saga. Yet, it excels for taking a mature route that brings a compelling character study, a token from the first Avengers movie. Out of such character study is the major theme of vengeance. I am not going to give any more details about it. It is best to be seen and be enamored by how such themes are delivered with an affecting yet entertaining vibe.

Kudos to the cast ensemble that all brought their A-game, even though some characters are not that fleshed out, or feeling shoehorned. Evans is at his most moving as the fading patriot who wishes the best for his team and loved ones. Downey Jr. is still what we expected from RDJ. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow has a neutral but affectionate presence, despite her rather little involvement. The rest of the cast is great to see, with notable breakout performances from Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man/Giant-Man, Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa/Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man/Peter Parker. And Daniel Bruhl as Helmut Zemo is a better addition to Marvel's lacking lineup of antagonists. But despite the cast's collective efforts, there is an obvious battle for screen time with all characters. Thankfully, it was all salvaged as the two parties brawl in a cleared airport, in an exhilarating action sequence that will surely make every audience member cheer.

For all the makings of a summer blockbuster, ""Captain America: Civil War"" gets it all started right. Besides being a loyal companion to the comic book storyline, it is a worthy setup to Marvel's other properties and one that truly can hold on its own, courtesy of its consistent superhero action scenes, the Russo brothers' tense direction, the excellent cast, its thought-provoking themes and its exciting story with its signature Marvel snappy dialogue. Let us hope for the best for MCU's future, including Tom Holland's ""Spider-Man"".",9
12 April 2016,Now this is a good superhero movie!!,"Hi, I saw civil war and I come with good news; it's AWESOME! Im not gonna spoil one single thing, since this movie should be seen by only the two trailers you probably saw. Don't watch any tvspots after the second trailer or whatever! Im gonna touch a few aspects and rate them. Acting: Of course it's amazing. The characters we were waiting for were black panther and of course SPIDERMAN! Both were done amazing! Spiderman has a bigger role than I personally expected and it's done with grace. Love it. Black Panther was such a good character with great motivation why he's doing what he's doing. The acting per usual from the other characters were great! 10/10 Story: Now where another (let's leave it) unnamed superhero movie failed this year, and no I'm not talking about dead-pool.., was the story. Now this story is what I expected from the other unnamed superhero movie. I didn't know what side I wanted to be on; cap's or iron man's. I was so conflicted and even while they're fighting you don't know who to root for. The villain in this movie felt a bit, not really out of place, but unnecessary in my opinion. But Marvel always struggles to find a good fleshed out villain except for Loki & kingpin in the series. 8/10 Action/Cinematography: O boy..If you're an action freak you will love this, if you're a comic book fan.. you're gonna LIVE these amazing action set pieces. The much anticipated airport scene is AMAZING. You've seen nothing, literally nothing of the amazing action that will bestow upon you guys. The airport scene is in complete imax and has a runtime of around 17 minutes. Just let that sink in! The Russo brothers know how to create great action and film it great as well. I can go on record and say this is by far the best superhero action scenes ever. 20/10. Verdict: Was it a perfect movie? No. But for me as a fan it came darn close. The only thing that bothered me were the villains, well actually one of the few that are in there. Was it better than... Batman v superman.. yes by far. I mean we're in a comic book movie year, so we might as well compare it. Batman v superman lacked in a lot of places and civil war just did it better. Just the conflict in ideologies made it so much more believable why the characters fought and because this whole story arc is happening now after 2 cross over movies, 3 iron movies and 2 cap movies.. the stakes are so incredibly high. I tried to compare dead-pool with it as well, but it's a different movie in terms of it being a solo movie and setting something up, instead of showing a conflict between good and good instead of good and evil. 9 out of 10! Near Perfect movie for the fans(9.5) and a good solid action film for the general movie go-ers(9)",10
14 May 2016,Marvel are on a roll.,"Captain America Civil War is the thirteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely. In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions - one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. Civil War is definitely one of the best Marvel movies to date, and absolutely on par with The Winter Soldier which was also great. They are both on top in the Marvel Cinematic Movies ranking of mine so far. The conflict between these well beloved characters is done in a brilliant and fantastic way by the amazing Russo brothers who took the cheese out of the first Captain America movie , made one serious and great second movie, and build upon them both with the third outing. Everyone does a great job here, Chris Evans has made Captain America his own same as Robert Downey Jr for Iron Man. It features a very big ensemble cast and not one of them is anything less than great on the role. The fight scenes are also some of the best ever made in a comic book movie, even better than in The Winter Soldier. Especially the airport scene is just mesmerizing and totally stands out from everything else that's going on. Spider-Man is also unbelievably well done and Tom Holland is just fantastic. I am one of the few people who actually loved The Amazing Spider Man movies, and really got mad to hear that they are going to reboot the character again but I can see now that it was worth it. The visuals are great from beginning to end, the music is also good as usual. The villain is something that most people though it was the weakest point but I strongly disagree with that. He had reasoning as to why he is doing those things, and he pushes the other characters in new directions which is also necessary. I generally adored this movie, and even though I am a DC fan, there's just no denying that Marvel knows what they're doing and that is why they are much more successful right now.",10
15 May 2016,The Winter Soldier has competition.,"The Winter Soldier has competition for being the best Marvel movie. There's no other way to say it: Civil War is phenomenal. Marvel continues the trend of upping the stakes by pinning our favorite heroes against each other: Captain America and Iron Man. There are a lot of other characters, so much so that it feels more like an Avengers movie than a solo movie, but the story is told in such a way that the spotlight is always on Cap and Bucky.

Civil War is tonally different from Winter Soldier in that it's more bombastic in its storytelling. Again, there are a lot of Avengers in the movie (more than the freaking Avengers movie). While Winter Soldier was a relatively grounded, dark political thriller, Civil War is a louder, more colorful take on the political theme, and a much more personal one as well. This time it's a matter of morals and ethics, and it's amazing how the movie pulls off giving each side of the argument weight and credibility so you could argue about who's right and who's wrong all day.

Steve wants to protect his best friend Bucky who was brainwashed by Hydra and is now a fugitive from the law. He doesn't trust any form of government faction. He saw how far up corruption goes and he's not willing to lose jurisdiction of the Avengers to yet another corrupt governmental body. Tony wants everyone to sign an agreement for the UN so they won't be seen as a threat by the world governments due to their track record of leaving behind messes and casualties. It's a terrific plot, very thrilling and character driven. At its core it's a very personal story between Steve and Tony. The other characters are written as complimentary pieces to one puzzle. It's not gratuitous at all. You understand everyone's ideologies - why they disagree with each other, why they're on the sides that they're on, why they're fighting for what they're fighting for - and they're each given enough screen time for us to care. And the action scenes are TWS level. Nothing quite beats the first confrontation between CA and WS, but the end of the second act of this movie has an action sequence that is absolutely mesmerizing. It's the civil war. Seeing all of these superheros go against each other is exhilarating, and their interactions are hysterical, especially since a lot of them are meeting each other for the first time.

The new characters are excellent - Black Panther makes a hell of an impression as a sophisticated Wakandan diplomat, and Spider-Man is easily the best live action interpretation of the character; major props to Tom Holland for sounding exactly how you'd expect Spider-Man to sound like. It's an absolute joy to watch. One aspect of Civil War I find especially fascinating is the use of its villain, Zemo. You have no idea what he's plotting for a good chunk of the movie. He shows up intermittently as the first couple of acts are playing out doing cryptic stuff vaguely involving Hydra, and finally the third act converges on Zemo and why he's doing what he's doing, and it's about the simplest thing: vengeance. It's incredible to watch this ordinary man - no powers or abilities - just a smart, patient man, have a conceivable shot at destroying the Avengers. And the actor is excellent too. It's a nice change of pace from the invincible demigods and dull dark elves we've been getting in previous installments.

Civil War is an expertly made film all around. The acting is top notch as always, the directing and the writing are masterful, I can go on and on. It's a political, personal, and powerfully conveyed story with tons of popcorn blockbuster appeal, rivaled only by The Winter Soldier in the MCU. Highly recommended.",8
13 May 2017,"Too much contrivance, insults the viewer's intelligence","What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",6
9 May 2016,Used to be Black Hats vs White Hats. Now its No Hats,"Since it is increasingly important in these reviews to appeal to all readers, and not offend anyone, I am offering two reviews. Simply pick the one you like.

1. Great Production Values, Two and a Half Hours of Action, Whats Not to Like?

This, the shorter review, simply states the obvious. Marvel is getting progressively better at delivering action and most people today go to these films for the action, so this is win-win. Yeah. Everyone smile and wait for the next Marvel release. Have your wallets ready.

2. As Marvel increasingly monopolizes the Superhero space, the themes get darker and darker.

The early 1920s believe it or not were a lot like today. Everyone sensed a growing unease in the collective gestalt, so they compensated by more partying, less critical thinking, and going to more movies. Interestingly, movies both before and after the Great Depression offered pure escapist entertainment. You went to the movies to get anything BUT reality.

A century later, that paradigm has shifted. Ever since the ""graphic novels"" started to tackle serious adult themes, there seems to be a race among superhero writers to see who can put his (her) hero through the most angst, and drag the audience along for the ride.

I am not sure this is a good thing but I seem to be in the minority. I have seen a Spiderman movie where Spidey's main squeeze was killed because Spidey was a few seconds late. I have seen Superman movies where the main goal seems to be to discover how many buildings you can smash with Superman's head. And now, picking up on the same thread, I am seeing Avenger movies where governments -- these would be the same governments spying on your emails and trying to ban cash -- are trying to tell the ""enhanced"" humans what to do and not do.

Now, the suits at the studio would argue this must be what the audience wants because they are making money. This reviewer would argue that when you have a monopoly on a product line that people want, they will see it regardless. Only one of us is right.

In my view, the best superhero films are the ones that are the most humanistic. Superman comes out of a coma to be with the child he did not know he had. Iron Man rewards a boy who helped him when no one else would. Hulk drops out of an airplane not knowing if he will change or not, but he has to stop the bad guy and protect Betty.

My attitude is, if I want adult themes that badly I don't need to go the theatre, I can simply try to renew my license or wait in a hospital emergency room. I ""get"" this is how they are making superhero films these days. I suggest that in a year or two someone will rediscover the older, more sentimental, story lines, the audience will love it, and people of the future will look back at the films of today and wonder, what were they smoking?

Comment added 2021 -- With hindsight, the last ""legit"" Avengers movie before the suits decided to burn all the old franchises to the ground and go politically correct, and non-binary. A piece of history.",7
23 March 2021,my opinion,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",10

13 April 2016,Outstanding! Marvel is unstoppable!,"CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is the best Marvel movie yet. It's superhero conflict done right! Spectacular action sequences, it's well thought out, it's got nicely placed humor here and there, the plot and the motivations make sense, all the characters have fair share amount of screen time, and may I just say that the new Spider-Man is totally awesome! Even if you didn't grow up reading comic books, you will geek out every step of the way. This film is every bit as fun as 2012's ""The Avengers."" One of the many brilliant things that Marvel's Kevin Feige and his creative team and writers and directors did is that they already mapped out Marvel Cinematic Universe, they already know what A through Z will be and how to connect the dots in between. And so when Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) shows the Avengers the disastrous consequences of their saving-the-world efforts, we the audience feel the impact as well because we remember those individual movies which lead up to this installment, they're still fresh in our memories. And in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR, the repercussion of Cap vs. The Winter Soldier continues to be force that drives the story forward, because it's actually more layered than we think.

I know what you're going to ask me. What do I think of the new Spider-Man? Fair enough. Before we get to that, let me just say that my initial concerns that this movie would end up just being some kind of Avengers 2.5 instead of a Cap movie, because of the inclusion of so many characters, my initial concerns subside because again, by this time, Marvel already knows what they're doing, they know how to balance fun and intense action, they know that they have to showcase the skills and traits of each character instead of applying one size fits all. Screenwriters Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely with directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo are all master storytellers. OK.. so Spider-Man. He's alright. I'm kidding. He's awesome! And I truly mean that. Actor Tom Holland is perfect in this role. No offense to Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, but Holland's version is the Spidey that we the fans have been anticipating and I'm not talking just about his wise-cracking sarcasm, Holland owns it, he embodies it, he has some of the coolest lines in this film. And this whole idea of picking up the character from the middle and putting him into the mix, is absolutely brilliant because Spider-Man's time in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is as significant and as scene-stealing as Quicksilver was in ""X-Men: Days Of Future Past,"" he's the one most fans will talk about long after this movie's done.

Another great addition is Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther, and wait till you get a load of the surprise that Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) will have for you in the well-choreographed airport scene which is the part where both teams ultimately clash. That said, there is an underlying secret, there is a common enemy so smart that he doesn't even have to get his hands dirty, that's how clever this script is, because it's more than just about Sokovia accords or putting superheroes in check, and the reason the characters clash makes sense, it's more than just about a simple payback. That ability to keep itself fresh at every turn is one of the many, many strengths of CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR. The story ends with you wondering if your favorite heroes would ever join forces again when a greater threat like Thanos finally comes to town. What an outstanding film with great performances across the board. In this year where Daredevil is fighting Punisher on TV, Superman is fighting Batman on the big screen and apparently Charlize Theron's Ravenna is fighting Emily Blunt's Freya in ""The Huntsman: Winter's War,""... CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR trumps all.

18 January 2021,One of the best Marvel Superhero movie,"Captain America: Civil War is an action superhero movie directed by Joe Russo, Anthony Russo and stars Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Late Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland and Daniel Bruhl.

This is one of the best Marvel series movie and one of my Favorite. Great cast and characters, superb action scenes with a pinch of humor, commendable VFX and an memorable ending.

The team has surely worked on the script and plot of the movie and this is a different plot altogether. The point which is to be noted is that the villain of the movie doesn't has any super power still he created the havoc amongst all the superheroes.

Screenplay of the movie was superb and keeps you engaged through out the movie. Acting is the another strong aspect of the movie with some of the best Hollywood actors this department never disappointed. Climax of the movie is good.

One of the best Marvel movie with a great plot and good execution",9
5 May 2016,"A Smarter, More Complex Superhero Film","I'm going to be honest in saying that over the past few months, I've slowly become bored with the constant superhero releases, the current box office seems rife with them, not that that's a bad thing, it's just a tad repetitive. But then there's the Captain America series of the MCU films which seem to venture away from the typical action-packed, over-the-top aesthetics of other superhero films and instead focus more on the drama, the plot, the characters, and instead form a thriller in the style of 'The Manchurian Candidate' or the 'Bourne' films.

Personally I was a huge fan of 'The Winter Soldier', abandoning the action to instead create a political thriller was a fantastic idea, and it seems that the Russo's have yet again gone down a similar route in creating a more complex film (that does unfortunately contain plot holes here and there) that instead leaves the audience thinking rather than just presenting mindless action, however 'Civil War' is definitely more ""actiony"" than 'Winter Soldier' was, and unfortunately I dislike the overuse of CGI which this film does contain, but thankfully the interwoven smart plot allowed for some material that'll hopefully be an influence towards other superhero movies, to actually create clever content instead of dumbed-down footage. Definitely one of the stronger Marvel films!",
6 September 2016,Finish up already!,"There isn't enough story for this plot to be stretched out over so many movies and so many years. This movie should have been the end of it. They have taken this Bucky story which isn't that interesting and made several movies around it. Enough!

Liked Emily Van Camp here need more of her. Not sure about Tom Holland as Spiderman. A bit too puny for a superhero even Spiderman.

The so called civil war was surprisingly watchable even if it didn't really make much sense. At least you could understand who was fighting who. Still it's grandly made and not too headache inducing.

Please wrap it up!

1 May 2016,Downright awesome.,"Marvel Studios have done it yet again. Just when they appeared to be running out of steam after Age of Ultron and Ant-Man sat comfortably in the middle of the MCU canon, they strike back with this enormously entertaining series-booster. Essentially Avengers 2.5, this movie is crowded with so many well-known characters it's a miracle it's a movie at all, let alone a coherent and consistently exhilarating one. When the end credits roll there's disappointment rather than relief, unlike other recent superhero vs superhero efforts. The plot mechanics don't completely hold up under scrutiny – especially the antagonist's scheme – but it is the pitch-perfect character interaction that propels the story in between the multitude of kick-arse action sequences. And what kick-arse action sequences they are! Bookended with an impressively gritty Bourne-esque set piece and a seriously personal (and intense) punch up, each battle is cleverly given it's own spin to avoid feeling repetitive. Nothing tops the truly remarkable showdown amongst superhero friends though; with everyone fighting everyone, a web-slinging newbie stealing the show and a HUGE surprise, it confidently challenges the New York alien beat-down for MCU's greatest set piece. It doesn't quite reach Guardians levels of humour but there's a wonderful levity maintained throughout and the quip-filled dialogue is often laugh-out-loud funny, strongly aided by the rock-solid cast (both familiar and new). Picking a standout amongst such an electrifyingly diverse group of players is impossible; series regulars – Cap (Evans), Iron Man (RDJ), Black Widow (ScarJo), et al – are always excellent, whilst newcomers Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) are both downright awesome. Somehow fresh despite having a dozen films come before it in the MCU, Civil War is a near-perfect popcorn flick that galvanises enthusiasm for the upcoming onslaught of Marvel adventures.",9
17 December 2021,The Avengers 3: Civil War,"It's basically the Avengers 3 but directed by the Russo brothers that did Cap 2: The Winter Soldier. I guess that's why it's called Captain America instead of avengers. Anyway the movie was the best Marvel movie I had watched at the time in 2016, (I saw it at the cinema when it came out). It's made by the Russo brothers so basically anything Russo bros + Marvel is just amazing. The action and direction was very good. The addition of Spider-Man also very good. I couldn't wait to see Black Panther in live action and I wasn't disappointed at all. He was really cool. But I got a little disappointed by his own movie, it was full of bad cgi.

27 April 2016,"Best Marvel film, Yet.","Cynically speaking, the whole mold that the latest Marvel movie creates, is a colossal set up that engenders subsequent sequels and solo outings in the ever expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe. The third for titular Captain America, ""Civil War"" is essentially the third Avengers film, starting with events happening a year after ""Age of Ultron"". That is not to say the film is mistakenly titled, because it still is, in all important aspects, a Captain America movie. It's just that, he isn't alone. The sheer size of this potential billion-dollar movie calls for an equally mammoth effort from sibling directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, who also both helmed Cap's previous film, Winter Soldier. Their deft maneuver results in a beautifully crafted cinematic piece, whose towering bravura, bestows the entire proceedings with striking depth and sentimentality, which may not be the first for the genre, but enough to make it Marvel's best film, to date.

In ""Civil War"", the brewing enmity between Steve Rogers/ Captain America (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) inevitably arises and turns bitter in the wake of their relentless campaigns to save humanity. The irony emerges amidst of their efforts, when greater authority finally asked who should be held accountable for the collateral damages brought both by their offensive and defensive operations. The motion begins to roll when a mission in Lagos resulted to unexpected amount of destruction and deaths.

Differences in views divide the once solid group into two colliding factions. With Stark and his allies resigned to submit under the Sokovia Accords, Captain and the rest of his team, move away with staunch stand to operate freely under no greater force's jurisdiction. There is an intelligent attempt from both sides to meet halfway, but battle line is imminently drawn as a result of another attack which Cap's best buddy, Winter Soldier— now simply, Bucky Barnes— is believed to orchestrate. Doctrinal contrasts force heroes to pick sides, and the resulting chaos ensues a much bigger damage than what came in the missions they've previously pulled off together.

While Joss Whedon's ""Age of Ultron"" is as massive as a superhero movie could be, Russo's Civil War is colossal in its own right, maintaining the former's size as it shifts to a more character- driven narrative, with its emotional weight heaviest on Steve Rogers' shoulders. There is a striking hint of effort to not overpopulate the proceedings with relentless chaos and destructions, but the ones inevitably allowed, are delivered in immaculate visual glory, each explosive action set- piece captured with breathtaking panoramic ingenuity.

Even with all the intersecting plot lines laid out for every important character of this superhero extravaganza, they all eventually converge at one point, in which Captain Rogers and his connection with Stark, plays a key part. There is a visceral profoundness in how his character is written that finally places him at the center of his own film, and Evans has his commitment fully deployed for the role. And for a film whose own size seems to undermine its very own titular hero, the accomplished feat is truly massive for Captain, himself.

A film of this size naturally gets devoured by its very own ambitions. Character-wise, Civil War is as big as the last two Avengers movies. And while Thor and Hulk are both missing in action here, newcomers are welcomed to fill in their shoes. The film facilitates the solid introduction of Chad Boswick's Black Panther, whose stand-alone film is due in 2018. But perhaps, as most people who've seen it, will say, the entry of the amazing web- slinger is the film's most anticipated highlight. Tom Holland's Spider- Man is a breath of fresh air, and it delivers some hope for the character's looming third big screen incarnation, next year. His comic timing may have been at par with that of Paul Rudd's Ant- Man, who shares one of the most genuine fanboy moments in the movie. This lightness comes amid the political tensions and philosophical differences between the opposing forces, one that is utterly missing in DC's Batman v Superman's messed-up attempt to pull off an essentially similar drama, last month.",10

8 May 2016,"My Personal Favorite Marvel Film To Date, Topping All Expectations","Captain America: Civil War is directed by both Anthony and Joe Russo and is a sequel to 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, also directed by the Russo brothers. After an accident occurred while the new Avengers were on the hunt for Crossbones, the United States government proposes that the Avengers be government controlled. Captain America disagrees with the idea, and Iron Man is all for it. This conflict in decision begins to rip the Avengers apart, starting a civil war.

I was really on the edge over Captain America: Civil War. I loved both the previous two Captain America movies, and the two Avengers installments as well. Walking out of the theater, I got all I had wanted and more. Captain America: Civil War is now my favorite Marvel film to date. I loved everything about it, and was so happy to see just how amazingly well everything worked out.

The Russo brothers did absolutely amazing with this movie. Not only are all of the characters flawlessly well rounded, but the direction and script are fantastic as well. The direction perfectly captured all of the action throughout the film, and was handled very nicely. Many wide shots were used, and the action was without shaky cam or quick cuts. All of the dialogue was near flawless as well. The audience is very subtly introduced to the conflict between Captain America and Iron Man, and dives deeper into it as the film progresses. The points presented by both sides are both right in there own ways, and that adds so much to this movie.

The characters in Civil War are as close to perfect as it gets. I cared for every character in the film, whether they be a superhero or not. Black Panther's introduction into the Marvel Cinematic Universe was great, and I can't wait for his solo film in 2018. Spiderman in this film is, in my opinion, the best on screen Spiderman of all time. I like Tom Holland as the web head a bit better than Tobey Maguire, and way better than Andrew Garfield. His suit was great, and he delivered a lot of quips while fighting, just like the fans wanted. Lines such as ""You have the right to remain silent!"" or ""You have a metal arm? That's awesome, dude!"" made Spiderman near perfect in this movie. I loved the characters of both Spiderman and Black Panther.

Besides the fact of the new characters, the Russo brothers also went deeper into the characters that we've already seen. Vision was given a lot more depth through Civil War, as was Scarlet Witch. The relationship between the two was great, and was given the attention it deserved. Both Hawkeye and Black Widow got a lot of screen time, and Hawkeye's relationship with Scarlet Witch, which he inspired to become an Avenger at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), was explored more deeply, and played off very well. Black Widow's internal conflict with which team she truly supported was shown neatly, however not distracting from the main plot.

Both Iron Man and Captain America were fleshed out much more than they have been before, despite how long the two have been in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Their struggles with each other was astounding at how well it was used. Falcon and War Machine were both given a lot more attention than they have been before, and that worked amazingly. As seen in the trailer, War Machine gets injured, and that gave his character a lot more depth. Falcon's friendship with Captain America was expressed more heavily, now that they know each other better. Cap's relationship with Bucky was also incredible. The exploration dealt to Bucky's character was high, and appreciated very much. And, without spoiling anything, Ant Man's character was, simply put, flawless all throughout Civil War.

All of the acting was great as well. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Sebastian Stan, Chadwick Boseman, Jeremy Renner, Tom Holland, Paul Rudd, William Hurt, and Daniel Bruhl all did fantastic. Each performance was unique in its own way, and all of the characters were played greatly. Each actor's portrayal of his or her character was amazing, and each and every character was given the depth they deserved.

Overall, Captain America: Civil War is my favorite Marvel movie to date, and my second favorite comic book movie, topped only by The Dark Knight (2008). The Russo brothers have made a true masterpiece of a film, heightening all expectations for Avengers: Infinity War Parts I and II (2018-2019).",10

In many places it seemed like these 'friends' are trying to crush or blast the other 'team' with no mercy. Then one of the more generic ones gets injured and oh no, it's such a crying shame. What did you EXPECT you idiot superheroes?? Wasn't that what you were trying to do? This is every bit as nonsensical as Batman v Superman but got critical acclaim piled on it because it's Marvel.


The characters honestly act so infantile it's infuriating. Their fighting could have been avoided if an actual adult like Nick Fury was there to deal out corner time.",2
4 February 2018,"Could have been a game changer, but they opted not to....","I've come to this late, as I seem to now with all comic book movie. I'm tired of them, and probably this was impacted by that.

The premise to this seeing the superheroes go head to head is really interesting, and a geek's fantasy come to life. However, that all seems to get lost soon after, but Captain America is the show stealer but not helped by the creators trying to ram everyone in possible like a big fancy dress party, in order to advertise their new films to come (Black Panther, new Spiderman etc).

Shame really, this could have been so much more. The comic book films are becoming tired and repetitive, despite the genuine efforts of some. There's a lot of life in them, but they need to divert a bit more. They aimed for that and then seemed to just divert back.

Disappointed.",4
5 June 2016,"No One Dies, Who cares","What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

10 May 2016,"With two big sides taking place, Captain America: Civil War sets up for an awesome superhero movie and story about friendships.","Though we're still a few weeks into the release, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice seems to be setting itself into the position on ""how to NOT make a superhero crossover film"". While I didn't hate the movie as much as some are really making it out to be (some are even calling for director Zack Snyder to be booted from the upcoming Justice League movie that is still good to go), it was still overstuffed with a ton of stories that either needed to be their own movies or cut entirely. Warner Brothers will need to try and model Disney with what the latter has been doing with Marvel Comics and their heroes.

Not only does Marvel allow their stories to pace themselves over several movies and bring in a more playful tone, but they seem to try and actually bring in modern day issues that have been controversial. Captain America: The Winter Solider managed to mirror the real life events that have surrounded the NSA and their surveillance on the general public. The American people are split over the upcoming election with extreme rights and extreme lefts about to burst into an electoral civil war. The Avengers too burst into their own struggle in Captain America: Civil War.

It seems that the events of The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and The Avengers: Age of Utron have become a bit of a nuisance to the Untied Nations with the amount of damage caused by our heroes. While Captain America (played by Chris Evens) is leading some of the avengers on a mission in Lagos, an accidental explosion strikes a building, hurting many people. This seals the deal for U.S. secretary of state General Ross (played by William Hurts) to set up a UN panel that would oversee the Avengers and decide when to be called upon. This is called the Sokovia Accords.

This puts the entire team in a divide. Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) feels that U.N. intervention is necessary as that they need boundaries and that this could prevent further villains from emerging. Steve Rogers sees the Accords as a bureaucratic headache that would keep them from helping everyone. When the Captain rescues Bucky Barnes (played by Sebastian Stan) from UN's arrest for a bombing in Vienna, this creates sides. The Captain gets the Falcon, the Winter Soldier, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, and Ant-Man to join his side while Iron Man gets War Machine, Black Widow, Black Panther, Vision, and Spider-Man to join his side. Both sets of heroes fight while a Sokovian terrorist Helut Zemo (played by Daniel Brühl) plans for a bigger attack.

With all the heroes shown in Captain America: Civil War, there is a lot of hype to deliver. Amazingly, it manages to both satisfy those that wanted to see an all superhero melee and paints a great story about friendships. There was a huge risk trying to put in all of these heroes yet remain a story for Steve Rogers.

The focus is where it needs to be as it shows a guy who's got to figure which friendship is more important; Bucky or Stark. Both newcomers Black Panther and Spider-Man are welcomed warmly into the Marvel Cinematic universe as they get plenty of scenes. The actual battle in the civil war is twenty five minutes of pure joy that show why movies were made; to see moments like that come to life!

Now how is the rest of movie supposed to go on after that scene? It's difficult to say because the third act does falter towards the end. We get one more big fight between Captain America and Iron Man that's great, but does not top the civil war sequence. I'm not sure if the solution is to make the final fight bigger or tone down the middle fight. I think that after such a rush of amazing, it's difficult to even continue.

I'll give this nine battling heroes out of five. Captain America: Civil War makes for a great start to the next phase of Marvel movies. If not uneven, it's at least exciting. I'd hate to be the one that misses this hero epic in theaters, so don't miss out and pick a side.",9

3 May 2016,The idiocracy dictated by movie tickets,"This latest chapter in the never-ending ""Disney Secure IP Investment"" saga has the usual cartoon characters (such as Captain Return of Investment, Iron Rehab Man and Sony-Deal-Man) quickly moving and jumping through the screen to amuse millennials who are bored with their current smart phone for 150 minutes. This ""film"" adds up a new lineup of heartbreaking sell outs such as Martin Freeman, Daniel Bruhl and William Hurt, all whose their threshold between dignity and bank account have finally been crossed, joining previous familiar sell outs such as Paul Bettany, Scarlett Johansson and, inexplicably, Don Cheadle.

The nonsensical, incomprehensible plot follows Formula 1 pilot Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl, reprising his role from ""Rush"") arranging an elaborate, over-the-top revenge scheme against the cartoon characters, forcing them to fight for our enjoyment, like a 21st century Mandingo fight for children, a plan only vaguely possible due to uncontrollable and unforseable events such as the United Nations resolution. Under a man-child prism of the world's politics, the script takes the cartoon characters to move between exposition scenes and action storyboards, all in the very awkward dichotomy of juvenile writing and over-expensive ""film making"".

Any little enjoyment that can come from this movie requires accepting the dooming idiocracy that controls our world, economy, politics and fate; embrace your inner idiot and laugh at a giant cartoon character holding a small, tin-man character.

How many insightful, meaningful and intelligent films we could have produced, under the realms of real talents, with this ""film's"" budget? How many excellent pieces of cinema, inspiring and motivating, touching and thought-provoking, could have been made if the masses preferred content over shiny objects? Ten? Twenty? Fifty? We may never know; we may only cry for the lost art that will never be.

Watch it in the unnecessary headache-inducing half-assed-converted 3D.",3
20 May 2016,The Best Word I Could Use to Describe this Movie is Idiotic,"Captain America: Civil War follows the Avengers after the events of Age of Ultron. The government wants to control the Avengers because people die whenever they save the world, so they want to be able to try to limit that. Steve Rogers doesn't want to be controlled, but Tony Stark thinks that they should, and so everyone picks a side they start fighting over it.

I'll start with what I liked about this movie. The fights were a big improvement over those in The Winter Soldier, which I found to be incredibly fake and boring. In one particular fight I liked what they did with Ant-Man's powers, and Iron Man's new suit looks pretty cool.

Now what didn't I like about this movie? Oh, where to start. The characters, I guess. They're terrible. It's not that they aren't well developed (although they aren't), but they're all just incredibly stupid. They weren't dumb in the previous movies most of the time, but it was as if between movies everyone except Steve Rogers developed some mental disability. In the first fifteen minutes a character contains a bomb, then un-contains it and throws it at a building, killing a few people inside. Then she cries about it and everyone tells her that it wasn't her fault and she shouldn't worry. What? That could have easily been avoided if she simply didn't do anything else. Apparently she was even too stupid to not do anything. This is only one example of this, however.

The whole movie is just fueled by idiots, and the plot only works because of said idiots. Whenever the Avengers save the world a few people might die instead of, you know, seven billion. Which would you prefer? Seriously, no one in this movie thinks anything over. No one ever points out that they'd rather have a couple people die over the entire human race, either. So are we just supposed to act like this idea doesn't exist? Or is every character actually retarded?

I was kind of excited for the new Spider-Man, everyone seems to like him a lot so far. Why, I don't know. Tom Holland plays easily the worst Spider-Man I've ever seen. Sure, his suit is pretty cool, but him as a character? Stupidly annoying. He won't shut his mouth. And it's not like he's saying anything funny or clever, he's just being a waste of space for the sake of being a waste of space. He doesn't capture the funny side of Peter Parker, and he doesn't capture the geeky side of him either. He references Star Wars, and maybe some people think that's geeky, but that's about it. Now I don't really care about the source material for movies, but everyone says that he does these things when he really doesn't. I just thought he was obnoxious. And his character didn't even need to exist. Without him the movie would have been the exact same, only Tony Stark's team would briefly have had five people while Steve Rogers had six. ""We need to make it fair, so let's force in a character simply for the sake of getting people excited for another pointless solo movie!"" quote Marvel. Yeah, great idea.

I liked Black Panther better. As in I liked his costume and the way he fought. His character was about as flat as everyone else. At least he had a believable and more interesting reason for being where he was. His introduction was a lot better than Spider-Man's, who was pretty forced.

By the time the parking lot fight scene ended I was done. But there was still forty-five minutes left, and they weren't fun or enjoyable at all. The forced conflict with the 'villain' wrapped up, and that was that. Now let's talk about the 'villain'. I put that in quotations because he doesn't do anything really. All the characters act like he's a big deal (and so does he), but he doesn't actually do anything. He gets unimportant characters who normally wouldn't have been involved involved in the fight, and that's it. You'd think his motivation would be deeper or bigger than it is in the end, but it isn't.

Finally, when I reached the after-credits scene I was pretty disappointed. Not because the scene was lame (although it was) but because it had to do with the actual plot instead of just being a tease at the next movie, which is what these scenes are supposed to be considering the fact that not everyone sits around for the after credits scenes or even knows they exist. You wouldn't put the climax of a movie in the after credits scene right? So why put plot in it?

Overall Captain America: Civil War is idiotic. The characters are so indescribably stupid, the plot itself is stupid and relies stupid characters, Spider-Man is annoying and pointless, Black Panther is okay, and the 'villain' is just an excuse to make it a longer movie like Batman v. Superman, the other superhero versus superhero movie that came out this year. Don't listen to this review if you don't want to. If you love Marvel you'll love the crap out of this movie because you people eat this garbage up. But if you're like me and able to see flaw in stuff you like then hopefully you at least see where I'm coming from with this. And in the end there is not a shred of any part of me that would recommend this movie. I would if it were shorter (because it's the new big thing and you should see it to form your own opinion), but two and half hours were stolen from me, hours that I could have used to watch something that would have sucked less, so don't watch this movie if you think these things that I have mentioned will bother you.",2
29 May 2016,Very solid fun if not quite the spectacular extravaganza expected,"The first Captain America film was a lot of fun, and 'Winter Soldier', taking a bigger, bolder and darker approach while not forgetting the entertainment value, was even better.

'Civil War' is not quite as good as 'Winter Soldier' but it's a little better than the first film, in my opinion. It may not be quite the spectacular extravaganza that this reviewer was expecting from reading the critics' reviews, but it is very solid fun still, great entertainment and in the top end of Marvel's output even with its faults.

Granted, 'Civil War' is not perfect, so the detractors can think again before accusing me of being someone paid to write a positive review. This is actually somebody who saw the film, enjoyed it thoroughly but realises that it has flaws. Is anybody going to point out to Marvel detractors that people can enjoy Marvel's films without feeling like it's a criminal offence to and have been giving good reasons for doing so, so parroting out ridiculous and easily disproven conspiracy theories that have often come close to violating terms and conditions is only making them look like the idiots and the ignoramuses? Sorry to point out that irrelevant note, but this attitude keeps cropping up in the increasing user and critical condescension wave that IMDb is facing, and IMDb who seem shockingly oblivious to it should come down harder on it.

As with what was not quite right with 'Civil War', there is an over-stuffed and occasionally under-cooked feel at times. 'Civil War' has many subplots and characters, and while actually it deals with a vast majority of the subplots and characters are dealt with incredibly well there are a few subplots that appear (a couple of them abruptly introduced as well) and not enough is done with them, as far as being completely forgotten about after ten minutes or being rushed through to get to the next one. Zemo's story is lost within everything else and would have fared better within a film all on its own, because the potential was there. A vast majority of the characters are all interesting with engaging, in-depth personalities, but War Machine is somewhat side-lined, while one appreciates the complexity given to Zemo there was the sense that he wasn't as completely crucial to the main story as he could have been and while Spiderman really grows on you his entrance is a bit clumsily done and makes one think does he really belong?

However, 'Civil War' also does a huge amount right. It looks amazing for a start, the gritty but audacious look of 'Winter Soldier' makes a welcome return while the cinematography is stylish, the editing crisp (if slightly and occasionally confused in the airport action sequence) and the special effects as extravagant as they should, helped by thunderously authentic sound. Despite really not being a fan of shaky cam usually, it is not abused here, doesn't cause visual discomfort and gave certain scenes even more raw tension than they already had. The music again has much rousing excitement and haunting intensity while being no less memorable than the music in the previous two outings.

The action sequences in 'Civil War' are strong too. The opening sequence starts the film with a bang, with its tragic consequences being genuinely affecting, while the airport scene is tense, enormous fun and thrilling (though because with so much going on, the camera/editing does at times struggle to keep up). Best of all is the climax, which had much more intensity and was surprisingly rich in conflict and emotion. The direction is astute and deftly balances all the different conflicts and tone shifts, while the script is very smartly written with the light-hearted moments like with Spiderman and Ant-Man being witty and hilarious while not once being at odds with the more thought-provoking and serious elements (which never get bogged down in too much talk). The story, while a bit over-stuffed and under-cooked in places, is never dull, never feels too stretched or thin, always makes sense (even with parts that needed more development) and is endlessly riveting right up to the end, which is an achievement for a two and a half hour film with this much going on. Likewise, while some characters are more interesting than others (which is standard for any film with a cast as large as this), the characters are very intriguingly and engagingly written with distinct personalities and realism.

There are great performances across the board, with the one oddity being Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, not a big role but not small enough to give the impression that Tomei in age and manner did not fit the character. Much of the film however is dominated by Robert Downey Jnr and Chris Evans, both of whom are note-perfect as Iron Man and Captain America. Elizabeth Olsen is flawed but sympathetic, Scarlett Johansson is wonderfully fearless, Paul Rudd is a breath of fresh air with his introduction actually feeling like a character who belongs, Tom Holland brings endearing enthusiasm to Spiderman, Paul Bettany and Sebastian Stan are authoritative presences, Daniel Bruhl has the right degree of arrogance and is able to convey menace while only doing as little as a whisper and Chadwick Boseman characterises Black Panther's wounded pride with dignity and gravitas.

Overall, very solid fun if just missing out on being the spectacular extravaganza expected. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8
8 May 2016,Captain Iron-Man,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

14 May 2016,Two Words: Airport Battle,"While watching Civil War, I couldn't help but think of DC / Warner Bros.'s desperate failures to catch up with Marvel's unstoppable success, specifically the recent disaster Batman v. Superman. Both films are about allies finding themselves on opposing sides, only Marvel actually succeeds on every level DC fails. Where BvS botched everything from the basic setup (why are these guys so angry with each other?) to nearly everything else that followed, Civil War soars with nuanced clarity: allegiances will fall / form, friendships will break / build, and summer entertainment will be had. Civil War finds tentpole-heroes Captain America and Iron Man at odds, each coming to grips with their power and position on the global scale on starkly different sides. Neither side is clearly right-or-wrong. Instead, we are presented with a familiar world, in which ""good-and-evil"" are not black-and-white, but largely grey. Even the de facto villain, one of the better in the MCU, finds sympathy through his heartbreaking and understandable motivations. These disparate sides are each so nuanced and logical, I found my loyalty swinging back-and-forth like Peter Parker at an air show. Speaking of which, Holland's turn as the webbed-crusader is easily the greatest in cinema: young, witty, wiry, and wide-eyed. Our first view of him is a standout, even while placed within the larger context of the marquee ""airport battle"", maybe the greatest superhero melee ever. The Russos, who have taken Whedon's place as go-to directors for Marvel, have such a strong control of humor, story, character, and action, they've even managed to better their fantastic Winter Soldier here. With them at the helm, any assemblage of Avengers is one to anticipate.",8
28 April 2016,Magnificent,"I lost count of the times I gasped or whispered 'wow' to myself.

Story-driven and character-driven right to the bitter end, but it also has many amazing action sequences.

Remarkably, all of the characters are well-served. Old favourites get moments to shine, and new kids on the block are put in the spotlight as well. One in particular basically steals the film.

Weighty and serious, thought-provoking and intelligent, but also joyful and funny in almost every scene.

Rapid-pace storytelling. Blink and you miss the next story development.

Great, great performances from Robert Downey Jr., Sebastian Stan, Daniel Brühl and Chris Evans.

19 January 2017,Civil War: What is good for,"For some apparently the answer is absolutely nothing. But if you bought into the Marvel Universe thing, then you know how they roll. It doesn't mean the movies are all the same. Quite the opposite, as Dr. Strange showed us. But even here you get political statements. And if it didn't do that the movie probably would have been seen as just another Comic Book movie that didn't take it's role model position to also have a message for the viewers.

But do not despair, there is plenty of action in there. It's just that the movie does try to make you think about things and challenge you a bit. Also it does want to show that there are consequences to actions taken. Whether you agree with that approach or not is up to you. And again, there is enough action and fun to be had. You can take anything apart if you really want to and make it look bad, but you would take away a lot of fun that you can have.

Speaking briefly of the movie, it is an emotional roller coaster with an absolutely beautiful end. Spidey had a satisfying screen time. As for the acting, by the time the movie ended, I was a happy man. Russov's are handling Infinity War, and after watching this movie, how they did justice to characters, I'll not worry.

5 July 2016,Captain America and the Falcon and The Avengers,"Released in 2016, ""Captain America: Civil War"" chronicles Cap (Chris Evans) leading an Avengers mission that results in the loss of many innocents. As a result, the Federal government and UN, represented by Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman), want to take the reins of The Avengers. While Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and a few others reluctantly support this measure, Cap, Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and some others categorically oppose it, which naturally pits the team against one another. Meanwhile, villains like Zemo (Daniel Brühl), Crossbones (Frank Grillo) are on the loose, creating further problems.

I'm a big fan of Steve Englehart's outstanding run on the comic in the '70s, which was the precursor to Mark Gruenwald's notable work 10-20 years later (his run lasted a whole decade!). What I loved about the comic was the relatively realistic tone, the interesting relevant issues and the fact that Cap & Falcon were the perfect representation of the USA. You'll see these elements in ""Captain America: Civil War."" The occasional interludes with Cap's babe, Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp), are reminiscent of the comic. Speaking of The Falcon, I like the way the writers took the basic concept and made him better; for instance, the way his wings deflect bullets and the nature of his 'pet falcon' Redwing.

Since the plot ties into Cap's leadership in The Avengers we get numerous guest stars in addition to the ones already mentioned: Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), The Vision (Paul Bettany), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). As if that wasn't enough we also get Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), The Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and, believe it or not, freakin' Spider-Man (Tom Holland), with a glorified cameo of a hot Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), lol. How the movie can juggle all these characters and keep it from getting out of hand is uncanny.

Lastly the core question of the titular 'civil war' is interesting and timely: Should the government usurp control over The Avenger's autonomy? Should this incredible team of superhumans become the pawns of the government? Captain America rightly says ""No way.""

The movie runs 147 minutes and was shot in Puerto Rico, Atlanta, Germany, Iceland and Brazil.

GRADE: A (8.5/10)",9
27 April 2016,Comedy saves an otherwise weak movie,"I saw this in IMAX 3D, and my first advice would be to consider watching it in 2D. I don't know if it will help, but the version I saw was almost unbearable half of the movie due to lagging, choppy fight scenes. There is actually only one truly good fight scene in the whole movie, but it is sadly dragged out past its expiration date as well.

The plot is a run of the mill thing that could be fully explained in about 1 minute, yet they drag it out for hours without adding new layers to it.

The camera work ranges from terrible like in most close combat scenes to average for a high budget movie.

The sound track is completely forgettable to the point that I can't remember if there was one.

Acting however is good throughout the whole movie and you get what you expect from the characters.

Where the movie really shines is in the comedy. Most of the characters aren't funny, but the ones who are (Tony Stark and a few surprises) give this movie a well needed injection boost in the middle of the movie that keeps me from dozing off after a really weak start.

Should you see this movie? Yes if you are a real comic movie junkie, otherwise there is pretty much one thing you need to know to be able jump right to the next one, and it is easier to get that tidbit by googling than watching through the whole movie.",4
20 September 2021,Arguably Marvel's best installment,"Civil War is perhaps the most compelling film within the MCU. A lot of the franchise's future also hinges on what happens in this movie. It is a pivotal point in the timeline for several characters and events.

It also holds some of the best action, particularly Black Widow's sequences are at their peak. There are several other great elements; the introduction to Black Panther is fantastic, and the introduction to Tom Holland's Spider-Man is rife with good lines.

Happy to have re-watched this movie, and will be happy to re-watch it many more times.

2 May 2016,Very good,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",7

6 May 2016,"Civil War was about a family being torn apart, and this movie gives you that, AMAZING","Let's make it clear here that I'm not biased with either Marvel or DC, I enjoy both and I gave Batman v Superman the benefit of the doubt. You can read more of my thoughts on my review of the film. I'm a huge fan of DC and felt that the movie suffered many problems with it's story and character development. That's where Marvel has the upper hand for many years now, by setting up all these movies and stories we get well developed and likable characters that we already identify with. Once you get to a movie like Civil War, you've laid out the groundwork for an epic movie. Sure Marvel doesn't follow their story lines exactly like the comic but it approaches it in a very respectful way. The thing that always stuck out to me about Civil War in the comics was how personal the fight felt. The characters were all part of a team and were like a family, they loved each other and cared about one another. It felt like a realistic take on what really happens when you argue with the people you love, you see things one way, but they see it differently, and you both struggle to find a middle ground. This element I was pleased to see made it into the film, the motivations were different than the comic but the intentions still felt the same to me. We've seen the Avengers grow together as a team and as a family, but now we see them forced into this situation nobody wants to be in. These characters that were friends, partners, brothers, get torn apart by different circumstances, and you really feel the weight of it all. Especially between Tony and Steve, the Russo's have talked about betrayal being a theme in the film and I can see what they mean, Tony and Steve have such great dynamic in it all I'd hate to give away what draws the line between them but it sank my heart into my stomach to see their friendship being shredded to pieces. The Russo brothers did a spectacular job with the Winter Soldier and this film is no exception. The action was just phenomenal, every set piece was timed right, and the story didn't drag by any means. One of the strong points of the Russo's that me and a friend of mine agreed on was the fact that they have a good understanding of character arc, they added so many new characters in this movie, and they were used perfectly, each one had a shining moment. Black Panther and Spider-Man rocked it the most in my opinion, both are just a hoot to watch and I can't wait to see them star in their own solo films. I think many people were disappointed with Age of Ultron because it didn't really feel like anything new, or improve on what we've seen before, it was the first Avengers just a little bigger. This movie is what Age of Ultron should have been, emotional, conflicting, and epic in it's own way. I was worried this movie would be black and white, making Tony the antagonist and Steve the ""good guy"". I felt conflicted and didn't know who to side with, and you know the movie's done it's job when you don't even know who's right, and who's wrong. A 10/10 for me, and easily one of the best Marvel movies to date. I've only given Marvel a 10/10 for the first Iron Man, the first Avengers, The Winter Soldier, and Guardians. If you love their films, this one you'll easily love. Great way to start the summer and a perfect way to kick off phase 3!",9
6 May 2016,Popcorn Entertainment It Is!,"The sequel to 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger & 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, 'Captain America: Civil War' is Popcorn Entertainment! Its fun, engrossing & watching the Superheroes fight it out between them, is a sight to be seen. This is how a Superhero Film should be.

'Captain America: Civil War' Synopsis: Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man.

'Captain America: Civil War' is not perfect, its not even close to it. But what it is, in totality, is an arresting Superhero film, that shows Marvel's most prolific Good Guys fight it out. And I'm gonna say it again, the Sequence involving Team Capt vs Team IronMan, is exhilarating. Just a month ago we saw a STINKER involving Superheroes, but the real gift for fans like me, is this one.

Screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely is mostly arresting. Although, its a bit too long & a bit too busy. I did not particularly enjoy the final 20-minutes, I felt the ""final showdown"" could've been sharper. But otherwise, I ain't complaining. The narrative slowly builds up & the reason why the good-guys go against each other, makes sense. Its involving & undoubtedly entertaining. Anthony & Joe Russo's Direction is superb. They have handled this blockbuster, with flourish. Cinematography is top-notch, while the Editing could've been crisper. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Action-Sequences & Graphics are FANTASTIC. Henry Jackman's Score is great.

Performance-Wise: Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, delivers a committed performance, but its Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, who steals the thunder. This is a more serious Stark we see here & its a welcome change. Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier, is in form. Daniel Brühl as Helmut Zemo, is solid. William Hurt as Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, defines command. But The Highlights, however, are Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man & Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther. Holland is scene-stealing good, while Boseman is electrifying. I personally can't wait to see their standalone films in the coming future! And Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man, shines. Others lend good support.

On the whole, 'Captain America: Civil War' is great fun! Do Watch!",7
18 May 2016,"People want heroes, not laughing stocks. This movie delivers the latter.","A bunch of cartoon characters making a lot a noise and fuss for reasons that remain a mystery. There's a lot of fighting and mayhem, along with the usual dose of high-tech special effects. The problem is that the story is so shallow as to render it almost nonexistent. Good guys fighting good guys for reasons that are so contrived that even for comic-book characters it simply is not enough to justify all the mayhem. Would be like the Lone Ranger fighting Tonto over politics. Who cares? The formula just does not work. Plus, the movie has a lot of silly dialog, which provoked unintended laughter. There is little attempt at character development. Soon it becomes apparent that there are no good guys or bad guys, just a bunch of guys flexing their high-tech muscles. The use of flashbacks just adds to the confusion. The Spiderman character is incredibly mushy, even for a comic book story. The only character that has some depth is Iron Man, played by Robert Downey Jr. It seems that much of the plot centers around him. But he does not carry the story. The movie failed to engage the audience's attention. Even a story based on comic book characters has to have some dramatic content. Otherwise, as in the case of this movie, the entire story becomes stagy, shallow and noisy. Noise is no substitute for drama. The audience wants characters they can care about, not laugh at. Listen Hollywood: people want heroes, not laughing stocks. Have Captain America fighting Nazis, not his friends. Have Tony Stark save people in distress. Have the beautiful Black Widow show the world that she is great. Have these super heroes do superb things that win them real acclaim. If it wants to, Hollywood can write those kinds of stories.",4
9 May 2016,This film gets everything right that 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN' did!,"'CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR': Five Stars (Out of Five)

The third installment in Marvel Studios' 'CAPTAIN America' film franchise. The sequel also features many other superhero characters from the 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' (especially the 'AVENGERS' films), and the story deals with Captain America taking on Iron Man; in order to protect his friend Bucky Barnes. The movie stars Chris Evans (reprising the title role) and it costars Robert Downey Jr. (as Iron Man), Sebastian Stan (as Bucky, AKA The Winter Soldier), Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Chadwick Boseman, Daniel Bruhl, Scarlett Johansson, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Jeremy Renner, Emily Van Camp, William Hurt, Paul Rudd, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, Marisa Tomei and Martin Freeman. The film also introduces the classic comic book characters Spider-Man and Black Panther (Holland and Boseman), in their Marvel Cinematic Universe feature film debuts. Anthony and Joe Russo returned to direct the movie (they also helmed 'CAPTAIN America: WINTER SOLDIER') and Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely returned to write the script (they also wrote 'WINTER SOLDIER' and co-wrote 'THOR: THE DARK WORLD'). It's received rave reviews from critics and fans alike, and it's (of course) a huge hit at the Box Office. I loved it as well.

Due to the large number of civilian deaths, as a result of The Avengers' battles with various super-villains (over the years), the United Nations wants to form an international governing body, to control the superheroes' actions. Captain America (Evans) is against it, since he thinks they have better judgment than corrupt government officials, whereas Iron Man (Downey Jr.) supports the supervision (due to guilt over creating Ultron, and other tragedies he's responsible for). Other Avengers divide in the conflict, forming two different factions. At the same time Bucky Barnes (Stan) is framed for a bombing in Vienna (which kills a Wakanda King). Captain America wants to protect his friend, while government officials want to kill him. A civil war between the superheroes erupts.

This film gets everything right that 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN' did (one of my other favorite movies this year); it's very dark, dramatic and full of rich character development (all things 'AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON' got wrong). The plot is involving and the action actually serves the story; rather than vice versa! The action scenes are also really cleverly done, and exciting; something increasingly hard to pull off, in modern blockbusters. Downey Jr. actually gives a really good performance again (and he doesn't deliver any horrible jokes, for a change). It's also interesting to see his character as the antagonist; I know he was more of a villain in the comic book, but I think it was smarter for the filmmakers to make the drama (in the film) more nuanced. The movie's politics are also timely and complex. It's just a grade A film all around; I think it's my second favorite Marvel Studios film (after 'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY'). It's one flaw is that they got Spider- Man wrong though; they made some major changes to the source material, that any fan should be mad about. I think his character is the worst of the three movie adaptations (and he deserves his own freaking movie to debut in, he's not second banana to 'THE AVENGERS')! Overall the film is fantastic though.

1 May 2016,"""The Opening to Marvel: Phase Three is a simple: Oh, by God!""","""There was no way more perfect and majestic to start Phase Three of Marvel Cinematic Universe""

This ""Captain America: Civil War"" Review contains some spoilers. If you have not seen ""Civil War"" film, please, do not read, this could destroy it.

A few years ago, approximately, five or six years, Marvel had in its hands one script and one proposal that possessed enough unknowns. That project would receive the name of ""Avengers"". The biggest concern for the owners of the company was supposed to make a film where not only a hero was the protagonist, may break the story, be boring and completely commercial. Two years later, on May 4, 2012, ""Marvel's The Avengers"" landed in all movie theaters, solving each and every one of those unknowns on just the first day at the box office. Today, Mayo 2016, ""Civil War"" increases its number of participants to 12 heroes and 3 villains. Will this be the film event of the year? I don't know, I can only assure, Marvel has lost the fear and perhaps in the next few years its projects could reach total perfection (Avengers: Infinity War Part:1 or 2).

Based on the Comic of 2006-2007, movie serves as a sequel to ""Age of Ultron"" and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". After all the fighting and disaster in ""Ultron"", the Avengers return to discuss issues still more violent than in 2015, the death of innocents (something very, very similar to what we saw in ""BvS"", with Superman, and then say that they are polar opposites) and the dilemma, Does our help really help?

Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt, reprising his role from The Incredible Hulk) immediately ordered a conference to bring together to acclaimed heroes. After showing the dramatic and terrible consequences of their actions, it opens way for the culprit of this civil war. Sokovia Accords established by the United Nations. That treaty, aims to put each of the actions and missions of the Avengers in the hands of the United Nations for so, take care of each human life, taking into account that it will be them who decide if the heroes can act or not. As expected, not everyone agrees. They needed something for fight, here is their reason. After discussions, different thoughts, ideologies and equations, the decisions are made. 36 hours, two teams, a objective, an end, and Russo Brothers, Civil War has begun!

I affirm with all security and respect that ""Civil War"" has the best sequences of action of Marvel films so far, with sophisticated and perfect choreographies and training. A true example, and personally one of the best parts of the movie, the fight at Berlin airport. The presentation of both sides, literally, made me cry, its class, its style, its elegance and its professionalism to mix and combine each of the specific abilities (physical and emotional) of the old and new heroes, to create a scene of entertainment, quality and long, long fight makes that truly the public continues to support to ""Marvel"" for continue, (Curious fact: Directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski (""John Wick"") are part of the second unit of the film).

""Spider-Man is the equivalent to Wonder Woman in Civil War""

Special relevance has the presentation of Spider-man and Black Panther. Their inclusion is appropriate, the first is introduced in way more relaxed and comic, who along with his fight and jokes makes this be the best performance in the Peter Parker story.

Another hero who had appointment was a Black Panther, an heir to the throne full of hatred and pain, perfect for his own movie and with a fresh and innovative appearance. In addition, other friends already seen previously are incorporate to the group as ""Ant-Man"", associating the world of past facts (seen in the films) with the present, something that really strengthens and gives coherence to the Marvel Universe. While many characters used this as a springboard for their own films (Spider Man - Black Panther), all boils down to the personal conflict revealed at the end between these three men, it is something that goes beyond policies, laws, treaties or rules, this is personal. Russo brothers take the decision after pleasing to the public with that magnificent fight, they there will be no more effects, flying planes, cobwebs, or CGI, for that moment, they weave meticulously a narrow path to focus on the three real protagonist of the story, Tony, Steve and Bucky.

And then, arrive the final fight, ""Iron Man"" vs. ""Captain America"" a dispute of friends. The fact that Bucky was defeated and they could fight each other was really fantastic, this is not a trick more to win more money, it is the destiny. Personally, I felt like the final fight between Batman and Superman, that anger but at the same time love, that hate but at the same time forgiveness , it created a swirl of emotions and thoughts that ended in fatalism. ""CW"" had all the unimaginable, and even the enigmatic and traditional cameo appearance of Stan Lee.

Phase three has begun. If Marvel offers us more equal or better products that this, will sound crazy but, they could reach the level and love of critics and fans to ""Star Wars"" . Goodbye to the cliché about Marvel films are cheap fiction and paste sh_t, quality exists. ""Civil War"" gives us a true contrast of ""BvS"", but is just as tasty, fruitful and exciting. ""CW"" is the best film of ""Marvel"" so far. It plants strong and resistant foundations to the future to come, leaving a hard and impossible work for Warner Bros. with ""Suicide Squad"" and Fox and Marvel (again) with ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" in May and ""Doctor Strange"" in November.",8
12 May 2016,"No, ""Civil War"" isn't the Best Marvel Movie Ever Made","When early word had it that Captain America: Civil War was the best film Marvel's done to date, I should have known better. I guess having the privilege to see big blockbusters in advance does make one want to overpraise them into oblivion, even if it's something like Batman v Superman. But don't worry. Civil War is at least better than that, but it's certainly not the best Marvel film to date. Far from it.

I have so many thoughts regarding this film that it would be too much to write out in a review, so I'll boil it down to this: Marvel will be Marvel, and that's what kept Civil War from being great. Like most of their films, Civil War follows a certain formula that we've come to expect from Marvel flicks, and it doesn't stray away from that path. Its unwillingness to take risks is ultimately disappointing but not all that surprising. While the trailers for Civil War promised something dark, serious, and challenging, where lives and relationships between the characters we love are at stake, the film is anything but. In fact, Civil War has a surprising amount of humor, so much so that it severely undercuts the tension and central conflict between Iron Man and Captain America. Why call it a CIVIL WAR when there are one-liners and quips spoken every minute? Since when were Falcon and Bucky buddy-buddy towards each other? Their scenes, among many others, felt like something out of a freaking sitcom. Despite the many flaws BvS suffered from, the film at least had a consistent tone and the climactic battle itself felt significant and crucial to a point where someone could die.

That's the biggest weakness of this film. Everything felt so trivial and inconsequential. Calling it a Civil War is an overstatement when the war itself never amounts to anything more than a bunch of kids fighting together on a playground. There are no real casualties in this film, despite the fact that the film tries so very hard to convince you otherwise. ""You've caused so many civilian casualties!"" our heroes are told, but just wait until the next scene when there are some jokes thrown in to lighten up the mood, because you know, talking about endangering lives and having security vs. freedom shouldn't be *too* serious a discussion. You can't have your cake and eat it too, Marvel, and that's exactly what Civil War wanted: to be sincere about the very real and relevant issues it's tackling but also make it fun and entertaining for the whole family to enjoy - because more $$$. Even during the climax when motivations and reveals come into play and you feel like someone could die, it ends in such a whimper that you feel what occurred won't have any meaningful effect in future films.

And that's just it. Civil War is entertaining and watchable for what it is - and again, a whole lot better than BvS - but it could have been so much more.",6
1 June 2016,Warning - boring,"Walked out after 45 minutes. Sheer boredom.

80% of screen time was devoted to violence. Loud noises (crashes and explosions) and the destruction of cars, doors and buildings.

Luke Evans had center stage and he has zero 'magnetism'. Did not make a good case for his side of the debate. Downing looked tired. The Bucky character was okay.

Plot was paper thin. It is logical that the human world would want to rein in the superheroes after they conduct epic battles in population centers. But, the humanism is overridden by the violence and the negative motivations.

My conclusion is that this movie was made solely for teens. For adult fare, look elsewhere.

18 May 2016,Avengers Disassembled,"Marvel's ""Captain America: Civil War"" is a film so sincere in its aspirations, so determined to stand out from the superhero crowd, that to see it collapse under the strain of its ambition is quite underwhelming. The film pits Avengers Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) against each other in a clash of ideologies, and to see them fairly debate in lieu of individuality and regulation, respectively, is nothing short of compelling and thought-provoking, especially since both sides have their own set of consequences.

The action sequences and fight choreography are top-notch, probably the best in the Marvel crop, with the Russo brothers proving themselves the studio's golden goose. They (with mightily impressive stunt choreography from the John Wick directors) direct with a slick, brutal efficiency and perfect comic timing that can make action junkies sigh with relief, which aides greatly in that big, highly-hyped superhero throwdown.

But the villainous cog behind the conflict nearly collapses the entire film. It becomes increasingly preposterous the more I think about it. To pit Cap'n and Iron Man against each other, there has to be a plausible catalyst towards their tension to bring any real emotional weight to the film. This villain, all by his lonesome, uses preparations and tactics that would make Bane and MacGuyver blush in comparison, resulting in plot/continuity holes so big a dozen helicarriers combined can fly through them. However, and this doesn't spoil the plot, what he does at the end of the film ditches the core of the film and resembles a Saturday morning cartoon.

It's still a better film than Batman vs. Superman.",6
5 May 2016,Marvel don't miss a step,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

6 May 2016,Yes! Civil War is the one you got to see!!!,"It's rare that the sequels can out do the original, but the first Avenger does not hold a candle to the Winter Soldier and The Winter Soldier is nothing compared to Civil War.

A superhero movie with some real depth to it, Civil War is not so loosely based on the Marvel comics event. All the Events since the first Avengers movie are being called in check, when the UN forces a political policy on the Avengers that would allow them to regulate how superheroes battle the forces of evil. Captain America is not for it, while Iron Man is, putting them on different sides.

Just like Winter Soldier, what makes this movie so good is that it is basically an Avengers movie, having pretty much all of them in the same film at once, with some extra added surprises, like The Black Panther making his debut on the screen, Spider-Man joining the marvel cinematic universe and Ant-Man showing off his full capability.

I was a little nervous that Cap would get lost in the shuffle of his own picture. He does, kinda, but thankfully the movie is about him being the leader of the Avengers so he does get some screen time. I love Cap, he has the flair of a a comic book, but the moves of the greatest action hero, and even though Chris Evans gives his best performance as the Star Spangled Avenger, we all did not come to see him.

Civil War has the same appeal of X2, Just so many superheroes in the film, and it was done right. It's hard to say which is cooler, watching the spark happening between the Scarlet which and the vision. Seeing the origin of the Black Panther, or watching Tony Stark having a heart to heart with Peter Parker. Definitely the latter, because I though that Spider-Man's appearance in the film would be overkill, but you could not help but to clap when he comes on the screen. Tom Holland is going to do for Spider-Man what Christian Bale did for The Dark Knight.

For those of you who hate how these movie superheroes don't seem to go up against a proper villain, I have to say that Helmut Zemo does not have the flamboyance you expect from a villain, like if you compare him to Loki (he does have the hate of Magneto, however), he was the perfect Villain for Civil War and adds well to everything the movie is.

It's big and Epic,and action packed, and within all that is some serious drama that gets to you. Darker than you'd expect these Marvel movies to be, but still a ton of laughs and entertaining fun.

It's what Avengers: Age of Ultron could have been and what Batman Vs. Superman really (really) should have been. Sorry Deadpool, but you've been replace as my favorite superhero movie of the year!

No matter what side you pick, you win if you go see Captain America: Civil War.",9
1 May 2016,Yet another one boring and predictable superhero movie.,"The new Marvel blockbuster ""Captain America - Civil War"" is precisely the kind of movie that we've all NOT been waiting for, namely - stodgy, packed with every superhero that that the directors Anthony and Joe Russo could get their hands on. What were the writers thinking when they included Natasha Romanoff, or the so called Black Widow in the script? Is she really a superhero? Or maybe being a double agent is considered as some kind of a super power?

Why was it so cool to pick as many superheroes as they could and put them in the movie? This kind of philosophy does not add any positive points to the movie, even the opposite - it makes it look like a stage audition for teenagers possessing superpowers, which each one of the teens want to boast with. I went into the local cinema hall with the belief that this movie will not be like the others prior to it, namely the two Marvel's The Avengers and the two Captain Americas. Alas it did not meet my expectations. It happened to be just another predictable superhero- based movie with all its no-twists-and-turns and especially the trade mark of all movies of this type - the unique score that is present during the climax scenes, when your favorite superhero is looking into the wander, with his hands on his waist and saying some really inspirational words about the prior battle or the upcoming future (just like SAN ANDREAS). The ONLY suspense that I had to be kept in was when the Black Panther was on his way to remove his helmet.

Sorry to say it, but this is yet another dull high-budget movie that is probably designed only for teens and kids that could stay all the 2 and a half hours watching a dozen superheroes fight with each other.",6

28 April 2016,Captain America: Civil War,"Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man.

As the third Captain America entry jump-starts the summer movie season, and so called Phase 3 of the MCU, its box-office muscle is beyond question. When the Avengers first assembled four years ago, it felt like a grand culmination, THE Ultimate Marvel superhero event. Since then, the studio's ever expanding Cinematic Universe has delivered sequels or varying quality and introduced new heroes in stand-alone movies, but it has never quite matched the ensemble-balancing finesse and Earth- quaking action scale of Joss Whedon's initial assembling. Not until now. This is not some hastily assembled battle to sell more movie tickets; these two have been quarreling over the course of two Avengers movies - one of their first conversation includes Captain America telling Stark ""Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds"". It's all been building to this; with hashtag-powered marketing campaign, prompting True Believers to pick a side.

This film is build around a bigger conflict that, despite the title, does place it as a direct sequel to Age of Ultron. While Bucky and Cap friendship being the core of the film, makes it Captain America Three rather than Avengers Two and a Half. Captain America: Civil War might be the best Marvel Studios move yet. There, I said it. It does what the best Marvel films do: juggling between characters so each is allowed to shine in a story that pushes forward the series continuity and while also forming and concluding its own plot.

Forget Batman v Superman. Here you get Ant-Man v Spider-Man, Hawkeye v Black Widow, Scarlet Witch v Vision, The Winter Soldier v Black Panther and Captain America v Iron Man, all rolled into one film. And that is what you call THE Ultimate Marvel superhero event. What could serve as the detriment to some hero-stuffed movies, actually works to the advantage of Civil War. Part of what is so delightful is how easily the characters, the majority of which we've come to know over the course of thirteen Marvel Studios movies, interact and play off each other. However, it all comes to these two characters, ultimately Captain America v Iron Man and their own beliefs, personalities, neuroses and paranoia coming out to play. For both of them, the bonds of friendship are shown to run deeper than any commitment to the greater good.

Steve defense of Bucky is questionable: he may be his childhood friend, but now he's a lethal, robot-armed killing machine forever in danger of being reactivated. Sebastian Stan remains, for the most part, as blank and frosty as he was in Winter Soldier. Chris Evans meanwhile, further hones a role he has effortlessly owned for five movies now; pushing Rogers to impressive new depths and reminding us that his straight arrow still has a dangerous edge. He's perfect. The stoic heart and soul of the MCU. There's little doubt why anyone would risk being branded as fugitive to follow him into battle (I VOLUNTEER!). And as perfect is Robert Downey Jr., who shows a completely different side of Tony Stark. He's more the elder statesman here than the witty merchant; reflecting on the consequences of his actions and looking to make amends. The brilliance of Downey Jr. sympathetic performance is that even if (like me) you are resolutely #TeamCap you can still (obviously) feel for him.

As you might expect, it's one of the MCU's more serious entries, tonally a world away from Age of Ultron. But that doesn't mean it's humorless; far from it. Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson can be relied upon for laugh-out-loud one-liners wherever he's on screen, Vision stylish new wardrobe is comedy gold and Paul Rudd's Scott Lang is ""HUGE"" fun in relatively brief appearance. Moreover, Black Panther gets a lot of shine too. Going in I didn't know much about the character, so this bing my strong introduction to the character, I really liked him. He works for this story and situations in many ways ( I can't reveal in a spoiler free review). Now let's get into what everyone seem to be waiting for - except me, because I've never really been a huge fan - 19-year-old Tom Holland's Spider-Man. he might be the best Spidey so far. His Peter Parker is great: nervy, goofy and instantly endearing. In the airport fight, in which he's truly spectacular, using his webs in entertaining and creative ways; while his wit couldn't be better. I have to admit that I'm in love and I can't wait to see more of Holland's Spider- Man. And no Loki or Ultron equivalent this time. Who needs a villain when you have Steve and Tony? Both protagonists. Both antagonists.

Civil War is rises above the series' greatest weaknesses. In a movie that has an almost literal army of superheroes, it's remarkable that a film this big can still feel intimate. Reflecting the material's comic book roots, the Russos keep the film's action heavy. ""It always ends in a fight"", says > You could read more on my blog",10

2 May 2016,The front-gate of marvel cinematic universe. Marvel gives an intense depiction how superheroes movie could be.,"By far, this is the widest, deepest, most-detailed, and best- choreographed of marvel movies. In this movie, marvel distinctly send message that superhero genre is not on the fringe of degradation. It erase all the cynical and doubts feeling from people. Of course if we seek for the realism action, there are no such thing in superhero genre. In my opinion, a superhero genre needs to be rated in different perspective than a normal action film. Thats also happens for CGI. Still, civil war (which solely captain America franchise, not avengers or bigger context) is complete as a film. It consist of well-directed storytelling, good character performance (especially Downey), good jokes, and very good choreography (especially airport scene). Russo brothers did well to made choreography for captain America winter soldier and he did it again in civil war. This director develops in a nice way.

Civil war got some good rating from metacritic. Its not a surprise, because to be honest this movie is good in such way even as superhero genre. Definitely, its not overrated or underrated, it is correctly rated. There are some strong-point that makes civil war is one kind of movie that given so many applause by audience at the end. First, i highlights the team work choreography. Even with so many character casted, there are no wasted superhero. Everybody takes their part precisely with an accurate duration given by the director. Each superhero contains their unique characterization so the character development is greatly well-done. Some funny, some charismatic, and some cool. One thing that prove this statement is at the airport fight. Intense, tough, and hilarious. The superhero combination was marvelous. The fights full of surprise and good choreography, everybody express their unique.

The second was its balance. Russo successfully add good portion of jokes, intrigues, and their character development duration. Superhero genre also can be something that beautifully made if brewed by a right formula. Imagine if there are no spiderman, maybe there are no jokes or cool moments right. Russos brave enough to add spiderman and black panther even without their solo movie before and it gives a huge impact to the film itself. Yes, this movie keeps making surprise to audience as the duration goes on. This also one of the strong point of civil war.

Third, civil war carried so much by the charisma of Robert Downey JR. We should give credit to this talented actor. To play the role as a superhero is not easy, because you need to be balanced between physical, imagination, and acting skill. You need to be agile in fighting scene, have a good body, and deliver good acting. Yet, you need great portion of imagination because superhero basically using CGI shots, so you need to imagine how the final editing could be from raw green screen shots. Thats why we never met such a good characterization of superhero before. But today, i found one person that truly pass it, yes the iron man by Downey. His acting skill always evolving since his three iron man movies. In civil war, Downeys performance was on the apex level. He successfully mastering the character of tony stark the iron man with rich-man gesture, intellectual person, and funny. The expression and charisma he had is so striking.

Objectively, i can say Civil War was marvels best. This is how superhero genre movie could and should be. Maximizing their characters with a balance of storytelling and amazing superheroes teamwork choreography. Even a little bit too dragging, I truly recommend this movie.",8
4 May 2016,Honest Review (No fanboyism.) of Captain America.,"This was a movie that had an intriguing story, and since I own the Civil War comic, I was curious to see how this movie would play out. I had hoped it might right the wrongs made by Avengers 2: Age of Ultron. Well guys, I was wrong.

No bias, completely honest. Captain America: Civil War is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

This entire film is nothing but rabbit trails, it is leading up to a film that never happens, Baron Zemo is one of the worst villains in a comic book movie to date (Next to Dr. Doom.) This movie is a complete cashgrab, the fight scenes look so fake, it has absolutely no emotional weight.

The fight scenes have no stakes or consequences whatsoever. They are making quips every other second, and it's super cringeworthy. The Ant-Man stuff (No spoilers.) in the movie is so laughable, I could not take the fight serious whatsoever.

The things in this movie that are supposed to make it feel epic, is total complete garbage. A lot of the characters come off whiny in this movie (Stark, Romanoff, Black Panther.). Black Panther, i will admit did have some cool moments, and he was one of my only positives of this.

Movies are supposed to make you care, feel the heat of the battle, and feel the suspense of what's going on. I felt absolutely nothing for these characters, and the fact they kept deflating the movie with their stupid jokes made it even more difficult to feel the intensity of the battle.

At least I felt it with Batman and Superman. That movie may have had a lot of problems, but I like it more because it was bold and I felt for Batman and Superman in the battle (Like the mother scene, it felt really emotional, but the movie kinda smothered the premise.) And every punch thrown in that movie, you felt it. Like the Warehouse scene, it felt real and I could feel the heat of the battle because every punch thrown could be felt. And with that movie, at least they had the balls to do bold things. This movie had no balls, let alone a spine.

The main hero of the movie; Captain America, his reasons and logic to fight is completely stupid, and he was the most annoying character next to Stark.

This is a Captain America movie, but I did not care for him. This was my issue with them doing Civil War with this movie, I knew they would not do that story justice, and it was a mistake from the beginning to include ALL the avengers. And regardless of whether you agree with me now, you probably will agree with this 2-3 years from now.

Spider-Man, all I can say is, this guy will not shut up. I hated his suit and found him totally annoying (I liked Andrew Garfield more than Tom Holland.). Yes, I realize that's what he's like from the comics, but he comes off so over the top in this movie. At least Andrew Garfield balanced it to a point where he's not annoying, the movie just didn't do him justice (Both TASM and this.)

Do not believe in the hype of this movie at all, cause you are being deceived (Like that moron Chris Stuckmann giving this movie an A+? What the heck is he smoking thinking that?)

Don't buy into the lie about seeing it just because it's fun and entertaining. Cause your setting yourself up for disappointment.

I'm going to give this movie a 3/10. I'm sorry Marvel fans, I just did not like it. As a matter of fact, I hated it.

If you love or enjoy this movie, that's fine and I'm glad you guys enjoy it. But you have to acknowledge sooner or later that Marvel has no spine, and this fun and light tone is extremely cringeworthy and them smothering powerful stories is just wrong (Civil War was a total game changer in the comics, people died, consequences happened, this was no where near that.)",3
4 May 2016,Great acting and visuals with a pretty well developed narrative,"The movie dives right into action which sets the drive of the entire film. It is action packed and there is never a dull moment. As well, the movie is a cohesive whole and is very well made. Usually with these many characters and A-list actors, there is unequal screen time between each, and the narrative of each character is separate from each other. An example would be to compare this to Batman v Superman. Even with just two characters the narratives could not interweave, and were very distinct from the other.

In Captain America: Civil War, even though the overall narrative mainly focuses on the dispute between Iron Man and Captain America, the rest of the cast isn't left out. Everyone gets screen time and though some inevitably get more than others, it isn't noticed much in the context of the film. So much like how the narrative is about team segregation, the film itself did very well in creating a cohesive, well-rounded portrayal of all characters.

This is also probably because most of the actors and actresses are reprising their roles and know their characters inside out. Thus, the acting and chemistry between them aided in creating this cohesive unit of the film. Everyone played their parts well and I was completely absorbed into the world of the movie.

The action scenes and visual effects are great once again. Marvel films have established that they know how to create visually stunning action effects. The action too shows some impressive fighting scenes. Both Black Widow and Sharon Carter display kick-ass moves.

Overall, this film is greatly entertaining and the narrative well established. The appearance of Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) is a bit sudden and random, but in the overall context is a good addition and necessary to the plot.",9
6 May 2016,What can you say? The MCU's batting average is pretty solid,"The Marvel films have come a long way now. First they started with movies establishing the characters. Then they all crossed over to fight threats. Now the only sensible thing to do is to start having them come into serious conflict with each other.

The MCU films have so far been solid. You have had great ones like Iron Man, The Avengers and Winter Soldier. And you've had meh ones like Iron Man 2, Thor the Dark World. For me personally, the worst of the bunch is Iron Man 3 but even that is somewhat well made.

I will say Civil War is the more appropriate Avengers sequel. Ultron somewhat gave me a headache as it was all over the place. And its no surprise Joss Whedon just quit after that. This film is surprisingly contained despite being based off of Mark Millar's very extensive storyline. Having removed Hulk and Thor really helped contain the story.

The action set-pieces, while not as all over the place as Ultron was, were still sometimes difficult to watch. I like that the Russo brothers introduced some grit in the Winter Soldier, but they introduced a mild form a shaky cam in Civil War. Yes the camera jolted up and down at times during a frenetic action sequence with some quick cuts.

The best set-piece though had to be the airport throwdown. And unlike Batman v Superman earlier this year, there was a proper build-up to the throwdown between the two disagreeing factions. Not only that, the airport was empty so you can watch the fight with maximum comfort and not worry about civilians or wanton destruction.

And with the build-up to the fight, you can definitely see the characters really develop, not only in this film but the preceding ones as well. Tony Stark started off as basically a neo-con in the first film, then to a guy who opposes the government to now believing in accountability therefore being surprisingly in favour of the superhero registration accord. Steve Rogers a guy who is a relic from a different time is basically someone who always wants to do the right thing and working for the government that looks out for its own self interests may not be the right thing. Both have equally valid points.

There are two new additions. Black Panther or T'Challa is the first. And I'm so glad he finally got his big screen treatment. He is such an awesome character and adds to the diversity sorely lacking in superhero films. His costume is amazing as well. With the director of Creed making his film, it will kick a lot of ass.

The second addition is Spider-Man. And this is one of the better adaptations of the character as they really embellished on his youth. We keep forgetting that Spidey is in his teens. Although I am concerned now that the Marvel films have an over-abundance of quippy characters: Iron Man, Starlord, Ant-Man and now him.

As usual in an MCU film, the villain is forgettable. In this case however, you can excuse that because the main conflict is between the heroes. The revelation in the third act really helps to reinforce that.

So yes this film was really enjoyable. More focused than Ultron and better story telling than the DC films. The only gripe is just with the filming and editing of the action sequences. Marvel, you done it again.",9
21 December 2021,The battle that we want to see in MCU.,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point.

7 November 2016,An Honest Review,"The Bad: For those of us that were fans of the comic book, there was a bit to be disappointed with. Captain America was always the liberal super hero, the one the protested Nixon, that protested Regean, and that led a Civil War under Bush. Sure it was all thinly veiled in comic book style, but everyone knew what he was doing, everyone knew what it meant.

He was Iron Man's political foil.

And then there was the epic feel of the Marvel Civil War, we wanted a movie that didn't start and end with Cap, but effected at least a movie per character in the MCU.

Then there was the Black Panther. He is supposed to be cold, calm, logical. In the comics you got the feel that both you and Panther knew that he was smarter than you are. In the movie he was driven by revenge. It was a disappointment. We wanted the Black Panther to act like the Black Panther.

Not to mention, especially in 3D, some of the scenes were jumpy.

The Good: It felt like another Avengers movie and that is not at all a bad thing.

Anthony Mackie got a lot of screen time and, I may be in the minority here, especially since his Falcon has diverged so much from the comics...but he does an excellent job in his role and deserves a Falcon movie of his own.

The MCU got Spider-Man back and, after Andrew Garfield's depiction of a Spider-Bully, it seriously needed a reboot. It's hard to surpass Tobey Maguire. For a lot or people he nailed the role...until Tom Holland took over and became the best Spider-Man yet to grace the silver screen.

Ant-Man returned. It wasn't as shocking as the fact that Paul Rudd is a super hero, but it's a welcome addition. He brings a sense of humor to the role and even in a small part he's a pleasure to watch.

And then we have the story itself, it didn't have the wonderfully tight beauty that Winter Soldier had, but that is excused. Civil War was really an Avengers movie and one that brought the MCU together again. It was a fun ride and it gave you the sense that the MCU is expanding faster than the big bang.",10

14 April 2016,a wonderful character study to go along with the BEST action I've ever seen!,"At the start, the film finds Captain America yet again adjusting to working under the increasingly morally ambiguous ways of the new Avengers structure. The set up is masterfully done. This is the fifth time we've seen the character and it's remarkable how complex and how much depth has been layered on to developing this icon. The Avengers film touched a bit with his feelings of what it was like to be in the modern era, and Winter Soldier drove the point home. Following that classic sequel, Civil War is a wonderful character study to go along with a purely thrilling plot. This was exactly the perfect vehicle to deliver a film to advance the character of Captain America but also give Tony Stark a perfect finishing arc and more development himself. What makes BOTH Steve and Tony interesting aren't their abilities or weapons but the men themselves. Steve's moral code and ""man out of time"" elements are tested in this film but not in a way anyone saw coming. The viewer that normally would trust that Cap is doing what's right can look at his actions in a different light. He is still coming to terms with a past that is long gone and he is still longing for a better more decent era. Putting Bucky back in the mix clouds his judgment. Dealing with the shades of grey of the modern era and being part of any controlling organization after the events of the Winter Soldier movie has changed him. It's exactly like all the epic events and decisions Tony Stark has made over five films has changed the character of Iron Man. The resulting conflict between the two is as epic as can be.

Like in Steve's last solo movie, his past comes back and explodes all throughout his new life. Tracking down his old pal Bucky, who was once an amoral assassin and a mind controlled Russian thug, proves to be a catalyst to everything that happens. Everything happens and unfolds in a believable and an intelligent manner. Every single ultimately cool character gets a chance to shine including Bucky but also incredible new characters like Black Panther and Spider-Man. Each one is fleshed out wonderfully for their supporting roles. Again, beyond cool.

I really enjoyed both previous Captain America films but this movie is as dark and exciting as Winter Solder but also adds a degree of depth. This movie has a whole new flavor and that's exactly what was needed and what Marvel does so well. The 1940's romance and even the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" tone fit the first film quite nicely. The conspiracy thriller vibe of the second film was refreshing and so well done. Here, just like the Cap character, adaptation is a key. What they deliver with this Civil War feels fresh and is certainly amazing. Steve is still a patriot but he's continuing to question authority. His old-fashioned values pay off in many cases but here, are they leading him astray? Questioning what is wrong and questioning what is morally cloudy is a test of true character. Yet, being old school stubborn can result in missing key points and can result in bad consequences. That is exactly why the character of Steve Rogers is so interesting. He's so much more than a super soldier boy scout. There's depth, angst and pathos and we all can relate to him. He is out-of-place and he is old-fashioned but proud of that in a way. In a movie like this, pride comes before the fall. Tony Stark is ahead of him on that curve. Tony knows the price of arrogance and even the price of acting unilaterally with the best of intentions. He knows the road to hell is paved with those best of intentions. When these two philosophies and life lessons collide, that's as cool as the superhero brawl that accompanies it.

The story itself is an amazing action thriller with a ton of intrigue and psychological issues. Honestly, I didn't expect it to be this clever and this deep. I did expect it to be exciting and it certainly delivers on that. Each new character and each hold over Avenger character works in to the story perfectly. Everything about this movie is a joy to watch. The cast is perfect and everyone is used exceptionally well. This IS the best sequel the genre has ever seen and I know tat's saying a lot. It could be Marvel's best effort ever.",

28 April 2016,One of the most epic superhero movies ever made,"Yesterday it was premiere and time for the second big superhero film this year, Captain America Civil War. I really like Captain America as a superhero, mostly due to his lack of over powerful strength. He is a soldier who during WWII, was subjected to experiments intended to make him a super soldier. The result was superhuman powers but nowhere near the likes of Superman or the Hulk. Frozen down and later awaken in present day earth, he struggles to adapt in modern society where everyone he has known or loved, is gone. In Civil War he is pinned against Iron Man. The government of the USA, forces the Avengers to sign a contract stating that they have to obey and work under supervision of the leaders of the world. Iron Man is convinced that it is the right thing to do while Captain claims that they will be forced to do things they don't want to.

I really liked Captain America Civil War and I would say that it is one of Marvel's and overall among the best superhero films ever made. Forget Superman's or the Avenger films' extremely over powerful enemies that practically can erase the earth with a wind blow. Here it is brains before muscles and I like it. The film practically has more in common with James Bond and the Mission Impossible films, than with other superhero films. The spy theme is pretty constant throughout the film, with for example a hunt for a terrorist through several countries. There is also focus on terror acts which feels both modern and disturbing considering today's world situation. The other thing that the film does really well is balancing the characters. Civil War contains a lot of superheroes and it is at times hard to keep track on everyone. But with finesse and a prioritized focus, they choose which ones will run the story and which ones will figure as background characters. Very smart and thought-out. With most focus on Captain America and then Iron Man, they succeed much better than the previous Avenger films and most of all the latest Batman V Superman.

The biggest question we all had before the film was, how will they put Captain America against Iron Man? Where Batman V Superman totally failed to motivate why those two giants would even fight each other, here they succeeded better from an even more difficult position because Captain America and Iron Man are friends that becomes enemies due to ideological and psychological differences. Overall the characters' actions are really well motivated. They have worked hard on giving every character a believable back story that drives them forward. Aside from the main conflicts and the superheroes, it is an incredibly well made film. The battle between the superheroes is so good looking and well choreographed that I can't think of an equal. Also the tempo and editing of the film works well towards it pretty long but still good runtime. The film constantly moves closer to the truth with small surprise moments and turning points along the way. It is perhaps necessary to have watched some of the other Marvel films before this one, but I still think that this works well on its own and that you should definitely take the chance to watch it in the cinemas because it is really exciting, good looking and well made

6 May 2016,Wheels come off,"After watching this I feel that at long last the wheels have finally come off the Marvel bandwagon.

It's not a bad movie by any means..it's just overdone and there's nowhere to go.

all the crew seem as fed up with this as the audience is.

We have ANOTHER Spiderman origin story and I think Bob Downey Jrs character is getting sillier by the day.

Action scenes are OK but try to be too big to make . The lead actor is OK as an extra but he cannot act to save his life.

Time to hang up your boots guys...nowhere left to go!",3
6 May 2016,"Action Packed, Exciting and Visually Stunning,","Captain America: Civil War is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. Just one year after Avengers: Age of Ultron, Marvel manage to deliver another movie that is just as big and just as bold. As we see the Avengers split sides, no one is an antagonist, we get to see both sides and determine who we think is right for ourselves, but neither are portrayed as villains, you can understand both, which I really liked, it was well written politics.

The only thing I felt the film was lacking in was suspense. The last twenty minutes are very intense and somewhat traumatic, and I wish there were more moments like that. Though I love Marvel's sense of humour, there were certain scenes that I felt should have been handled in a more serious manner. I also found the Vision and Scarlet Witch underused, they are introduced in Ultron and I was looking forward to seeing them in action even more. However, their unique powers are never properly showcased, although they clearly have plans for them for future films, which is exciting.

The cast shines, delivering the goods as always. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. face off after much friction since the first Avengers, their chemistry as foes is irresistible, its very personal, like two brothers fighting. They are joined by long time members Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle and Anthony Mackie, recent additions Sebastian Stan, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany and newcomers Paul Rudd, Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland, all shining in their roles. There may be a lot of characters and a lot to get out of the way, such as the main story and setting up future movies, but the film never manages to feel overstuffed, all thanks to the talented Russo Brothers, who will hopefully do just as well with the Infinity War. All characters have an established arch.

Action packed, funny, engaging, filled with likeable characters and a fast paced story, Captain America: Civil War is one of the must see movies this summer, I would recommend it to Marvel fans and to anyone looking for a good action or adventure.

Captain America and Iron Man end up splitting sides between the Avengers after a superhero initiative comes in, putting all superheroes in control of the government.

Best Performance: Robert Downey Jr.",9
3 May 2016,More of the same,"Aren't you getting sick of seeing the same characters doing the same things? How many Marvel movies do we need this year? Maybe its just me but I'm getting bored seeing the the same old stuff.

The first half of the this movie was extremely dull as they set up the premise for the civil war. You'll know exactly when it starts getting exciting. Its moment you saw in the previews when they introduce Spider-man. In fact, Spider-man was my favorite part of the movie and the only reason I didn't hate it. His lines are funny and his interaction with the other characters is very entertaining. Tom Holland will become your favorite Spiderman.

The only other part of this movie that I found entertaining was the other new character Black Panther. Without these two new characters this movie would just be same old characters doing the same old stuff. Yes, Marvel has great characters and great actors to play those characters, but that doesn't mean I want to see a movie with them every other week.

P.S. If you haven't seen all the other Captain America, Avengers, and Ironman movies you'll probably be lost. I believe all movies should be able to stand alone, even in a trilogy, but if you haven't seen those other movies you're not going to understand a lot of whats going on.",6
1 April 2020,Stage set for THANOS.,"With superheros growing, they collateral damage they do, the immunity they have, the world govt want them to sign an accord. But it creates a rift in the group. and it just goes deeper and deeper. The plot fails why all the way down for seeing the video. Otherwise good. Manipulative mastermind,Zemo, who lost his family, did all this in vengeance. Superheroes fighting each other(for a change). But revenge is not good. But will the heroes learn it or will the vengeance consume them? It sets stage for THANOS because the team that can stop him is broken and now is the perfect time for his plan.

The big question everyone asks? Who won civil war? IronMan or CaptainAmerica? But actually BlackPanther won the Civil War.

7 May 2016,"""Have you seen that old movie, The Empire Strikes Back?""","What are 'stakes' when it comes to super-heroes? How do they function when it comes to protecting people over the world and saving us from the enemies? What if there's destruction? How can people be trusted? Or, more philosophically, can the heroes trust themselves if they have to live with the deaths at their hands (or can they)? So many questions are at the heart of Captain America: Civil War, the sort of sequel-cum-culmination of a lot of plot threads and emotional stakes that have been set up since Iron Man 1 in 2008. It feels earned, and it's hard to not think of the immediate comparison of the other big super-hero beat-down of this year, Batman v Superman. Those comparisons could last all day, but I think it's also apt, even more-so, to think of this as a criticism of X-Men Last Stand, which was another film that had super-hero ""registration"" as far as being under control and the different factions that pop up and sides taken as far as who is right and wrong and the grey areas.

But where that film felt too cluttered by characters, Civil War is not. It very easily could've been, and it's easy to see it as not only are characters from the Iron Man and Captain America series here (Pepper Potts is out and Peggy Carter passes on early in this film, but that's fine, less potential clutter). But there are also additional characters from other movies (Ant-Man) and even a new character, a friendly neighborhood kid from Queens (you know him if you saw any images in the past month for even a nano-second, it's not as if the internet does a good job of keeping things on the low-down, it's Spider-Man), and yet everyone has a purpose, every character of some significance is given time to have a conversation and to talk about things so we know where they're coming from (i.e. Scarlet Witch and the Vision even do, which is a great couple of scenes), and so on.

The Russo brothers do a fantastic job of keeping things emotionally speaking with Rogers and Stark clear and yet complicated; we know that the deaths of so many in an explosion at the start of the film weighs down on Rogers (though perhaps we don't see it as much), while for Stark it's thrown in his face every other moment of every day, and the turmoil is there on his face all the time (though Downey Jr is such a gifted actor as to show it just enough and to modulate the turmoil so that it comes at striking times, all of it in the eyes, it's really one of his best performances of his career). So as this goes on the plot keeps going as well, with Daniel Bruhl playing a variation on a character in the comics (who I'm not familiar with but it doesn't matter) named Zemo.

This is an interesting villain and one of the better ones in the series (not Loki or Ultron level great but close), as he is *just a guy*. He's not some ultra criminal mastermind - though he certainly knows how to set up a mass explosion - but he is also someone who is another person who has the vast well of grief and vengeance from people he's lost (family but also just, as he says, ""everyone"") from his home in Slovakia. It's a good performance from Bruhl too, not too over the top (close to it but more realistic), and it's a play on past conflicts from other MCU movies. Yet here it makes its mark more because, well, this time it's more about how to tear up the super-heroes by doing it from the inside, which itself is reflective of SHIELD being taken down by Hydra in Winter Soldier and the seeds of doubt already there in 'Ultron'. It's a pretty strong creation for this particular movie.

This is a very operatic type of movie - The Empire Strikes Back gets name-checked and it almost feels like a bold statement, like 'really, did you just make that even in a jesting manner in this big bad-a** action sequence at this airport - but damn if it doesn't try and possibly does live up to that standard of blockbuster excellence. It's a lot of fun though, there's lightness and quips and jokes and moments visually, filmmaking wise, that makes this something that will entertain you if you're only looking for surface thrills. And at the same time I found a lot underneath, and what it all leads up to makes things devastating for the characters. It's not perfect - I have parts I can pick at as far as a particular character's fate following the battle, and a speech given at a funeral scene is so on the nose that there's barely a nose left to see - but it's about as good as mainstream action spectacle gets.",10
29 November 2016,"Like all Wars, Civil War is a Tragic Waste","You might as well shoot your bow & arrow off at Godzilla than disparage a film that made a billion dollars in its first ten days, but here goes. Anyone, I guess, can make up an IMDb Trivia entry, but this one has the ring of truth:

""Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's original idea for Captain America 3 was a vastly different and much smaller film without the other Avengers, but Kevin Feige suggested they adapt Civil War instead.""

Shame on you, Kevin Feige. Markus and McFeeley, of course, are the writing duo who did such near-genius work on the first two Captain America films: ""The First Avenger,"" with its rich period feeling, its great rationale for Steve Rogers donning his ridiculous name and suit, and its characterization of a superhero who ultimately, just wants to be a normal guy in a world where everyone gets a fair shake. ""The Winter Soldier"" took Captain America to a whole new level, in a modern day USA where the strongest, nicest, handsomest, most fair- minded guy in its dystopic Washington, DC, is fated to be a perennial outsider that the system will do its best to destroy. These are the two superhero movies to recommend to people who don't like superhero movies, and given the chance to make the kind of ""vastly different and much smaller film"" that Markus & McFeely could have done so well, it's a pity that Captain America: Civil War, instead of letting the writers do what they wanted, warps and inflates the narrative in order to repeat the worst mistakes of the latest Avenger movie.

Where the first Avengers film contrasted its characters with a world of normal humans, and put them head to head with an alien invasion – exactly the sorts of things superheroes do best – in Age of Ultron, everyone was a superhero. In the film, the Avengers' penultimate task was not to tackle some malign and hideous Other, but to evacuate a city, putting the Hulk and the God of Thunder to work making sure everyone fastened their seatbelts.

Civil War makes similar mistakes. With everyone a superhero, the differences between the characters become simply a matter of degree, and genuine conflict is submerged under an endless series of fanboy mixes-and-matches: golly, who's fighting who in the next scene? Certain episodes emphasize a legitimate central conflict – now that he knows that the Winter Soldier is his long-lost best friend, Steve Rogers will do anything to protect him, while both Iron Man and the Black Panther want to take him out. In these segments, a worthwhile sequel to the first two films peeks out of a script overstuffed with superpowered and technically augmented humans.

A welcome addition is the return of Brock Rumlow, the corrupt Shield agent from The Winter Soldier: near death at the end of that last movie, he returns as the hydraulically augmented Crossbones. Thirsting for revenge against the good guys, Crossbones is a scary and highly motivated villain who - Spoiler Alert – doesn't even make it through the first act, when – played as ferociously as before by Frank Grillo - he could have sustained an entire film (admittedly, the character is under-used less egregiously than Paul Giamatti's Rhino in Amazing Spider-Man 2).

Similarly, the plot reveals that a coven of unbeatable bio-engineered super- villains has been waiting for decades to wreak havoc on the world, but when our heroes track them to their arctic retreat, instead of the fight of their lives, they find  oh, that there's no menace after all, leaving the good guys only to battle each other. So, having engaged us with these characters in the first Iron Man, Captain America, and Avengers films, Marvel now buries them in a mass of superhero overproduction, with a dangling story line that we know won't be continued until the next Avengers movie. Markus and McFeely are writing that; if they're allowed to follow their instincts, maybe they'll be able to redeem themselves. But that's a good two years down the line. With the comic books, you only had to wait a month.",5
21 April 2016,This Is Literally One Of The Best Action/Adventure Movie Ever Made! 10/10 Perfection.,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",
27 April 2016,"Everything you want from a superhero movie, and more.","Once in a while there comes a movie that fits everything just right, it boasts lofty expectations and delivers it in every aspects, ""Civil War"" is undoubtedly such movie. With such large pool of characters and subplots, it's impressive that these larger-than-life characters are presented with great narrative and the right amount of spotlight as well as humor for all.

The story revolves around Sokovia Accord, a treaty to handle Avengers as they are causing too much collateral damage on their missions. The main strong point of this movie is how it manages to gather these dozen of characters and give each of them an engaging narrative, even the newcomers. It mainly plays with the clash of Iron-Man and Captain America, but none of the other superheroes feel left out, they all find their respective place.

The struggle feels approachable as the movie shifts between the heavier tone for Winter Soldier or Scarlet Witch, yet it allows space for new members to establish themselves. The addition of Black Panther and Spider-Man are refreshing, they fit like gloves to the already large cast, and Black Panther even takes on a quite large portion of the narration as he asserts his presence incredibly well.

It also benefits from good twists, this time it's not an alien force or robot invasion, but a real rift between the members, a more depth than previously done. Eventually they end up in small and large skirmishes alike. There's ample choreography to enhance the fights, the ones who rely on their fists are treated with amazing intense scuffle, while the others are done with good deal of CG.

The two elements work wonderfully together, shifting between them with ease and fluid transition. Each character has their own style, their signature which translates well into the humor, they trade punches and banters with equal measure. The movie has reached the balanced between cracking jokes and presenting a riveting story.

""Civil War"" is everything you want from a superhero movie, and more. It's a display of excellence on all fronts.",9
30 April 2016,Another Great Marvel Movie,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",8
3 October 2021,One of the most underrated movies of movie,"I really enjoyed this film and would highly recommended anybody to watch this part as it one of tue beat Captain America films and the airport action scene that was too brilliant and we also introduced by two new main characters in this film that are black panther and spider man.

30 April 2016,A psychological super-hero movie,"Yet another masterpiece from the Marvel film franchise. Some people went in the theaters being on either Team Cap or Team Iron Man, but by the end of the film, it's clear no one was sure which side to be on.

The film presents events, people and confrontations that justifies each and every Avenger's motivations for choosing a side. They are all valid and understandable. Tony Stark wants to make amends for the damage he and his fellow Avengers have caused other people, worried that he won't be able to stop. Which leads him to sign over his suit to the government to control when they decide.

Steve Rodgers, on the other hand, is distrustful of the government, which can be manipulated and corrupted by criminals, like the Hydra, and maintains that ""the safest hands are still their own.""

After a series of disasters involving Steve's friend Bucky, the two camps get into a confrontation at an airport. This is one of THE best fight sequences ever, as we get to see all of the Avengers (plus two new faces, Black Panther and Spiderman) use their various and unique skills against each other.

The psychological aspects, betrayal, friendship and revenge and lessons on morality make this a unique film - and with each Avenger given enough screen time.

This is a blockbuster you do not want to miss!",9

5 May 2016,I'm not that impressed,"To be honest I expected more, but Marvel does what Marvel does. Before going to cinema I read lots of reviews that the movie is awesome, that it's far better than BvS, because here you can finally see a great Super-hero versus clash unlike BvS and so on. But in fact I didn't see anything that great. Sure, the movie was fine, but it was nothing more compared to the rest of the Marvel products. They just continue the trend. Nothing new, nothing extraordinary. The scenario is not that great, it's kinda predictable, it has flaws, the fightings are in the typical unrealistic Marvel style, the CGI is crappy at some points, etc etc. Don't get me wrong. The movie is good, but I'm pointing some of the flaws, similar flaws that have been pointed for the BvS movie, but here no one dares to criticise. Before calling me a DC fanboy I'd say that I'm trying to be objective here - the movie is not perfect, in fact it's not even great, because there's nothing that can impress you unless you're 14-16 years old. Sure, it might entertain you a bit, but it won't impress you, definitely.

My score is 6/10",1
6 May 2016,Fun superhero action adventure goes out with a bang,"It's that time of the year again when the theaters flood with the mega-budget summer blockbusters that scale the mountain at the box office, and Marvel superhero flicks are no strangers to this. After the successful but disappointment of DC's 'Batman Vs Superman' early this spring, many fans were hoping to see a comeback in the superhero genre, this third installment of the highly successful Captain America franchise pays off not only defying expectations but even improving upon its predecessor. With Joe and Anthony Russo turning to the directors' chairs, this superhero action flick sees Chris Evans reprising the role of the titular character along with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Anthony Mackie as Falcon, Don Cheadle as War Machine, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Elizabeth Olson as Scarlet Witch, and Paul Bettany as Vision. Taking the place after the events of 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron', the team has fallen under massive political scrutiny by the government for all the damage resulted in their battles against the threats. In response, the government passes a bill that puts limits on the superheroes actions requiring them to work under government surveillance. Tony Stark (Iron Man) and the team agree with bill and sign it, Steve Rogers (Captain America) in the other hand disapproves of it and chooses to go outside the law. When Steve Rogers refuses to turn in Bucky Barnes (played by Sebastian Stan) who is wanted by the government, this leads an all-out conflict between the team. Newcomers joining the cast include Tom Holland as Spider-Man, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther.

The film bears strong similarities to Batman Vs Superman in terms of plot as deals with the tension between two heroes, only Civil War manages to execute the plot more effectively and cohesive. As the plot sets in, the heroes come face-to-face with government officials who give an disheartening inside look of all the damage caused by their actions and the lives lost in result of the battles. In many superhero flicks, mass destruction of a city has become a gimmick in the genre. But the first time in the genre, this gimmick is actually acknowledged by our heroes who grow genuine sympathy for the damage that costs. From there on, the story dives deep into the politics of managing the team and the debate that ensues when Captain America develops a cold shoulder against the government's decisions and the team's agreement. In the end, whether you agree with the government's plan to impose the limit on the superheros' action or Captain America's disapproval for the plan becomes the question. Thanks to our brilliant writers, the story does a great job at balancing the dispute between the heroes and the inference of the political actions to the point where many will find it easy to see both sides of the argument. Furthermore, the film strives some incredible, prolonged action sequences while leaving enough room to flesh out most of the characters. The humanity in the characters is put on the spot, and made to be believable. Yes, this film is a bit crowded in its roster of characters but with it's smart screenplay it manages to work.

When comes a superhero actioner comes some of exciting, pulse-pounding action sequences sparkled with not only tense special effects and CGI but powerfully choreographed stunt work. As viewers come expectations, the action scenes are fun to play watch, and serve as the biggest eye-catchers. And no one should the forget the incredible special effects or even the outstanding fight choreography featured in a scene with Black Widow in one scene at the beginning. No one can argue the stunt doubles' amazing talent in some of the fight scenes. Arguably the best scene in the film takes place at an airport where all our heroes engage in an all-out battle filled outstanding FX and some hilarious dialogue thrown out by the characters, particularly Spider-Man who is given much more comedic portrayal than in the previous Spiderman entries. The actors are quite clever in their roles as ever, and do almost nothing to disappoint. Tom Holland is surprisingly good as Spider-Man considering the roles in his last filmography. Whether his portrayal is better than Andrew Garfield's or Tobey Maguire's is debatable. Nonetheless, he nails it.

Captain America: Civil War is a fun and outstanding start to this summer of big-budget blockbusters, and another astounding achievement in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This film is destined to reach massive numbers at the box office, even by those who may not be grown fans of the Marvel superheroes.",9

15 April 2016,Another winner from Marvel!,"I pretty much like or love all the Marvel Studios movies, starting with Iron Man through last year's Ant-Man. So there was virtually no chance I wouldn't enjoy Civil War. But this might be my favorite Marvel movie yet. So many characters are in it, yet I felt like every one of them got at least one memorable moment, even lame ol' Hawkeye! At the end of Act 2, there's a 20-minute battle scene that involves a dozen super-heroes, and it's amazing, probably the best of this genre. I went in rooting 100% for Cap, but by the end, I was feeling really badly for Iron Man and kinda wanted to see him kick Steve Rogers' butt. We get a couple of new heroes – Spider-Man and the Black Panther – and they are both just about perfect translations from comic book to film. This Brit they have playing Peter Parker is probably my favorite Spidey yet, even though he's only on screen for maybe 15 minutes. He's exactly as Spidey should be: a nervous kid who handles his anxiety by being a nonstop motormouth during his battles. And the Panther is just so cool. Ant-Man plays a big part in that huge battle I mentioned, getting some of the best moments during the fight. But really, this movie is Cap's, Bucky's, and Tony's story. What helps make it so great is how Marvel has built up their saga over multiple movies – we're already familiar with and invested in these characters. And the filmmakers use that to great advantage here. It's sad to see them pitted against each other, but completely understandable in the context of the film. Bottom line: if you've enjoyed some or all of the Marvel movies, you'll have a great time with Civil War. It's a blast! And it might even draw a tear or two",10
16 July 2017,Meh - your usual CGI-based action and nothing more,"After an unfortunate incident in Africa, the UN decides that the Avengers require oversight and sets to passing a resolution that a UN entity control the Avengers. Tony Stark is for this, Captain America against it. When the UN meeting where the resolution is about to be debated is attacked, and several UN representatives killed, it appears to be the work of Winter Soldier. Captain America is convinced of his innocence, Tony Stark is convinced that he is guilty. This sets the two against each other, with the other Avengers choosing sides.

I'm not a fan of comic book movies, though did enjoy the three Iron Men movies and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The better ones have more to offer than just your usual CGI-action. Unfortunately, this is not one of those. Pretty much CGI-action and nothing else, made for the kids who wonder who would win in a fight between Iron Man and Captain America.

Basic plot, with new super heroes introduced simply because the producers can. One such character is Spider Man, who is incredibly irritating. Certainly a reason to skip the Spider Man movie.

One for fans of comic book movies only.",4
29 August 2021,Perhaps the best MCU-film of all,"#MCUrewatch. Cap 3 is truly a great, great film. Its greatest strength: pitting Captain America against Iron Man. These two man have been opposites right from the first Avengers film. And here they have different opinions regards the Sokovia Treatment. And the great thing is: you can understand both their opinions on this difficult matter. This film doesn't have a simple black and white storyline. It is grey and all the more grown up. By this time, the MCU films were critized for their weak antagonists. This film is brilliant in the fact that is has no clear antagonist. Another criticism it tackled: the predictable climaxes where entire cities get destroyed while our heroes fight uninteresting villains and their emotionless minions. This film ends (after the ultimate superhero showdown that is both spectacular and funny) with an emotional climax and a battle of wills between Cap and Iron Man. They made the criticism of Avengers ruining entire cities the core of the plot...brilliant. And if that isn't enough: the directors also deliver on the action, the pace of the story is perfect and it introduces two new great characters (Black Panther and especially Spider Man). A truly great action film and perhaps the best of the entire MCU franchise.",9

19 November 2021,Enjoyed,"I enjoyed seeing my favorite marvel characters fighting each other in a dispute about the destruction after Avengers 2. Super hero movies don't often talk about the mass about of destruction they create after messing up the villain. Such as the Superman movies. I really like how they went about it. 8/10.

10 May 2016,Magnificience by Marvel,"One of the most awaited movies of 2016, I watched this movie in Imax 3d for better experience and damn it was too awesome. The movie was full of superheroes including Black Panther and Spidey. With great plot line and fantastic effects, Civil War exceeded my expectation and didn't disappointed the way BvS did. Star studded movie with fantastic dialogues and actions make this movie an outstanding achievement for Marvels. The only thing missing in the movie was a villain. The movie shouldn't have been a part of Captain America Franchise, rather it should have been next chapter of Avengers considering the Superheroes featured in the movie. Nonetheless the movie was an outstanding experience in IMAX 3D. It is one of the best superheroes ever made by Marvel Studios.

30 September 2016,Captain A Bad Writing Movie,"CA:CW is one well produced piece of trash, a tuxedo on a turd. The core of this film is so completely void of substance, this film actually implodes in a series of poorly conceived scenes.

Seriously? Was this move written by someone with English as their second language? Civil War is a clinic on bad writing: Dialog? flat and uninspired. Pacing? completely inconsistent and dictated by action scenes. Characters? superficial in ways that made likable characters in previous movies pale shadows of their former selves - i.e. this movie adds Nothing to these characters. Story??? a complete jumble of mismatched ideas, threads, and twists that ultimately results in a preposterous/(literally)unbelievable conclusion.

Which brings me to my ultimate rant on a subsection of popular film that I have despised from the beginning: Comic Book Movies. I love comic books - and everything is already in place for great movie making. I mean FOR GODS SAKE comics not only give you the story arc & characters - comic books do the STORYBOARD FOR YOU!!! Comic books give all the content for great movies on a platter, so what do Hollywood producers do? Re-write! Re-imagine! Draw shadows of ideas from brilliant source material? It's pathetic, and insulting that this source has been mutilated, exploited, and perverted into what are generally nothing better than 2 hour TV episodes! Complete with *incomplete* story arcs where film makers have apparently forgotten what a movie IS!

OK, this movie is for the most part pretty, and the action is often stunning - both in how it was conceived and executed. But even the quality of action drops off as the movie unfolds - the one thing this movie has to do well, it can't maintain.

These reviews... its breaks my mind. What are people watching? What are they looking at? There isn't even a mirage of greatness here! The Spiderman character (for example) is an astonishing example of pointless exposition, throw away characters (complete with idiot, pull string dialog), and a troubling too common 'insert character' technique... that again, is actually a characteristic of bad film making! --and happens multiple times in this one movie!

slick veneer and excellent action can't hide all the things this movie does wrong - the best 2/10 movie you will ever see",2

6 May 2016,"""Captain America: Civil War"" is an exciting and very satisfying entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","Marvel sure has things figured out (which is a statement likely made in recent years by many a Movie Fan – and the folks at DC – with a few expletives thrown in for emphasis)! If there were any lingering doubt, it has certainly been erased by ""Captain America: Civil War"" (PG-13, 2:26). While the DC Extended Universe has had moderate success with their early films featuring and bringing together their stable of comic book characters, the Marvel Cinematic Universe began Phase Three of its grand plan with ""Civil War"" (the 13th MCU movie) and is making money almost faster than the government can print it. While the first two ""Avengers"" movies sit comfortably in the top 10 on the list of all-time box office champs worldwide, DC's ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" doesn't even make the top 40. ""Civil War"" made over $250 million worldwide before its first full day in U.S. theaters – and even before opening in huge countries like China and India! The film's opening week receipts in several countries is second all-time only to ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", and its trailer is second only to ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" in online views. But does this Captain America film deserve such attention and success? ""Captain America: Civil War"" is the third (and planned to be the final) Captain America feature, but also feels a lot like a third Avenger's movie, with its many characters – and its plot, which continues story lines from the most recent installment of each of those film series. This film picks up about a year after the Avengers defeated a populicidal sentient computer program which Tony Stark accidentally unleashed in ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"". Captain America / Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) are in Lagos, Nigeria trying to stop Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo) from stealing and making off with a dangerous biological weapon. In the ensuing melee, one of the Avengers, trying to save the life of one of the others, accidentally causes the deaths of several foreign aid workers.

After all the death and destruction inadvertently caused the last time that the Avengers were out saving the world (from Ultron), Lagos proves to be the proverbial last straw for worried world leaders, and their planned remedy bitterly divides the Avengers. The U.S. Secretary of State, Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), presents the group with an ultimatum – sign the newly-negotiated ""Sokovia Accords"", putting the Avengers under the control of the United Nations – or retire. As they discuss their options, this disparate group of superheroes quickly divides into opposing camps. Tony Stark / Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) speaks for Lieutenant Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and others who believe they should submit themselves to this international oversight. Cap speaks for Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and those who believe that they can only effectively protect people when they can operate unfettered. So, the battle lines are drawn.

Almost 200 nations (and some of the Avengers) sign the agreement, but it's quickly put to the test when a bombing compels some of the Avengers to act. The accused terrorist is none other than Cap's old (very old) friend, Bucky Barnes, aka The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). Cap wants to bring Bucky in safely before any of Bucky's trigger-happy pursuers catch up to him. Cap gets just enough help to accomplish his goal, but it turns out that Bucky is merely a pawn in a much larger game run by Baron Zemo (Daniel Brühl). As the plot unfolds, the Avengers duke it out with both old friends and new ones joining the fray.

""Captain America: Civil War"" is an exciting and very satisfying entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie has plenty of high-stakes, globe-trotting, hero-on-hero action, and it also has a lot of heart. If you think back to the first individual MCU films with Iron Man and Captain America, it may seem counterintuitive for Stark to support restrictions on the Avengers while Cap refuses to ""be a good soldier"" and get with the program, but we see that each of them have very clear and very personal motivations for taking the positions that they take. The same is true for the other frenemy combatants, some of which elicited cheers from the audience when they first appeared on screen. Of course, if you paid attention to the film's ubiquitous trailers and/or took a good look at its posters, you know which Avengers are present, which are missing and which are new, but just in case you don't know I won't spoil it. All I'll say is that Marvel has cast and established all of these characters exceptionally well.

The action, acting and directing are all top notch, but this film's main strength is its smart script. The characters' personalities, powers and previous activities are remarkably consistent in their presentation and are seamlessly blended in a big, but simple story which makes sense and gives each character his or her due. The dialog is a great combination of insightful, fun and funny. The movie seems to borrow from the ""Bourne"" movies, certain revenge flicks, and ""Escape Plan"", while the story is similar to DC's 2016 hero-against-hero film ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"", but ""Captain America: Civil War"" does it better and has a dynamic and tone all its own. It'll entertain fanboys and average Movie Fans alike. ""A""",9
19 November 2016,Great Characters and Action,"Captain America: Civil War (2016)

*** (out of 4)

Politics enter The Avengers as they are asked to sign an agreement, which would basically put them under control of the U.N.. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) wants them to sign but Captain America (Chris Evans) believes it's a bad idea and soon the two are divided and a civil war breaks out among The Avengers.

CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is another high-powered and fast entry into the Marvel series that is hands out the best thing out there in regards to comic book movies. I've honestly never read a single comic book in my life so I might not be the main audience for a film like this but it's very easy to see why this series has been such a hit with critics and fans. This is yet another highly entertaining film and it's certainly a lot of fun, which is something missing from so many comic movies today.

Of course, the greatest thing about this is that there are so many super heroes gathered up in one movie. Not only is there Iron Man and Captain America but we've also got Black Widow, Winter Soldier, Falcon, War Machine, Black Panther, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man and yes, Spider Man makes an appearance. I won't spoil the divide that happens in the film but there's a lot of great characters here and thankfully the ""story"" is kept to a minimum and instead we're just given one great action sequence after another.

As you'd expect, by this time all the actors are perfectly fit in their characters and there's no question that the studio being able to get the right actors for the parts is one reason this franchise has succeeded so greatly. The film certainly looks great but once again I've only got one real complaint and that's the fact that the film ran on way too long. I'm sorry, but 147-minutes for a movie like this just isn't really needed.",
15 May 2016,SuperHero Movie with Heart,"I like the what the makers of the Marvel movies have done with the Captain America series.  While most of the other movies in the ""Marvel Universe"" are big, expansive, special effects driven explosion- fests, the Captain America movies have been a bit more character-driven.  Make no mistake, there is still plenty of special effects and explosions, but these movies takes their time to delve into characters and this is what sets them apart.

Such is the case with CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR.  This could easily have been called AVENGERS: CIVIL WAR for it follows a rift in the Avengers over the freedom to do what they need to do as they see fit with no oversight.  And while the movie inevitably leads to a battle between the two factions, as big a part of this film is the human cost of these battles and the internal battles some of these heroes wage over the cost of keeping the planet safe.

And, for the most part, this film succeeds in telling both tales - the smaller ""personal"" film wrapped inside a big, special-effects laden summer blockbuster.

At the core of this film is the conflict between Chris Evans' Captain America and Robert Downey, Jr's. Iron Man.  Consequently, this film will fail or succeed on the performance of these performers and the tone that they need to set.  Fortunately for us, both Evans and Downey know these characters and the tone very well so it was like watching two veteran boxers duking it out in the ring.  It was fun to see them put back on the costumes and go at it.

It was also VERY fun to see almost the entire gang back on screen, if it is on opposite sides.  Black Widow (Scarlett Johannsen), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olson), Falcon (Anthony Mackey), War Machine (Don Cheadle) Vision (Paul Bettany) and even Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) are all back at it.  They are ably joined by newcomers Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spiderman (Tom Holland) and the scenes where all of these are together was liking watching a great jam when the band got back together.  There is going to be standalone Black Panther, Black Widow and Spiderman films and I am looking forward to each of them.  Of course, I'd be up for a Hawkeye stand alone film, so I guess that makes me a fan.

Is it a perfect movie?  Well...no.  

The plot, as is often the case in these types of films, is paperthin.  The franchise, rightfully, takes Thor and Hulk out of the picture (they will be together in the next THOR movie) for if either of those characters were around (especially THOR), then you would have a strong 3rd party to break the tie.

But they aren't and the Civil War raged on.  I liked that there were consequences to the actions (one SuperHero ends up with life changing injuries) and the central dispute remains somewhat unresolved at the end.  It would have felt false for it to be tied up in one nice, neat bow.

I do have a few quibbles.  William Hurt's Secretary of State is too heavily written and acted and the first hour (of this 2 1/2 hour epic) drags in spot.  But in the end, the movie does it's  job and is very entertaining with parts action, parts human emotions and parts FUN (hear that BATMAN vs. SUPERMAN?) and that makes it well worth seeing, if you like these sorts of film.

And, I do.

8 May 2016,A Marvel Cinematic Masterpiece,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",9

6 May 2016,"A really well put together movie, on par with quality we expect of Marvel","This movie does everything right. All the things that BvS struggled with are handled beautifully here.

The movie takes the time to develop all of the many characters in this series and introduce new characters. Two previously known additions to Avengers namely, Spiderman and Antman, and a brand new badass character, Black Panther, who proves once and for all that you can intro a new character without a damn origin story and have them play just fine.

Every character gets screen time to develop an opinion on the issue that divides the ranks of the Avengers. Their conclusions feel natural to the character's experiences and therefore their motivations feel genuine. As such we are easily able to associate with characters on both sides. When the fights happen it's hard to know who to root for, you feel like you are watching your friends have a falling out. Even when you pick a side on the issue itself from your own perspective, you feel like the characters on the other side reached the ""wrong"" decision based on logic that makes sense to them.

The characters on screen also act the same way. They love the avengers that oppose them, but they see no way out. They try to pull their punches, but eventually things escalate. This is brilliant, and makes you as the viewer much more invested in the fighting.

The movie manages to get the pacing right also, the entire thing feels like it's 40 minutes long. When it was over I couldn't believe that all that time flew by.

In conclusion this was an extremely enjoyable action movie. All the fights and effects are extremely well done and very exciting as we've come to expect from Marvell in recent years. But most importantly you care for the fights because the characters are likable and well developed, this lets you get invested in the universe and the conflict that it presents. Really well done.",10
9 May 2016,"The Hulk of the MCU, Civil War is a relentless powerhouse that entertains once the wheels start turning","The cinematic equivalent to tossing dozens of awesome comic books in a blender with a heavy budget and pouring it out into celluloid, Civil War is not only a superb sequel and improvement to the Avengers films, but just might actually become the best MCU flick yet. And yes, the movie is extremely bloated. Yes, the movie becomes a bit of a downer especially after funnier offerings like Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy. But once the wheels start turning and the conflict shifts into the second act you will be enthusiastically entertained up until the final scene.

Civil War is honestly Avengers 2.5, but the half is only in terms of chronological order. In the third Captain America installment, the events from past Marvel offerings has the world afraid of the superheroes, and over a hundred nations want to be able to monitor and control where the Avengers goes and what they should do after an espionage mission gone wrong. This creates a rift between all the heroes, especially with Winter Soldier being a fugitive and another threat lurking within; and differing opinions on how to handle the situation. Civil War's biggest strength is the sheer amount of characters; as they bring back all the Avengers, and then threw in some new additions.

Black Panther was flawless in performance, visuals, and execution. Second-billing favorites like Ant-Man, Falcon, Black Widow (who deserves her own movie) and Hawkeye make an appearance and also greatly deliver. Lastly, Spider-Man undoubtedly steals the show and he barely makes an appearance here. After 14 years of cinematic Spider-Man appearances, Marvel truly gets it right this time. Unlike what happened with Age of Ultron (entertaining yet forgettable), you will be excited for future features based off the new characters you meet within the 150 minute timeframe----especially Spider-Man. Sadly not all the Marvel personas get enough screen time, but it's part of the sacrifices made when there is such a long guest list to the motion picture party.

The chemistry within the MCU is off the charts, and Civil War raises the bar even higher. What DC films are missing is this key element; mostly because we barely see any character development and consistent cast from sequel to sequel. The interactions between each of the heroes is what really allows this movie to go to the top tier of comic book mayhem, as even Bucky has his moments when involved with the others, especially (surprisingly) Falcon. The complicated relationship between Iron Man and Captain America is front and center, and both deliver spectacular performances as two guilt-ridden heroes desperately trying to avoid conflict even though all signs point to a clash.

Helping Civil War maintain its bite is a strong (and rather gloomy) script and flawless direction from the Russo Brothers, who have impressed mightily since their debut with The Winter Soldier. The film honestly has it all: deep themes, lots of loss, plenty of surprises, tons of drama, tons of action, controversial decisions, and a good amount of humor to mix it all together---even though we really could have used more jokes in the first act. The action scenes range from clever to intense to downright entertaining. The Airport Battle will become a part of Marvel movie history, I promise you. The scene will be embedded in your memory if you are a fan of the comics. Then there's the incredible Bucharest Chase that's the best chase since Raid 2. At the same time, the final fight will break your heart.

Painstaking amount of effort is given to not only making these characters come to life, but also making them likable and relatable. Marvel does a fantastic job picking the right staff behind the scenes, and does even better picking the actors and actresses to represent the MCU. Combine that with a proper budget and an extremely tight structure that connects all the films together and always leaves room for the upcoming sequels and you have a systematic series of films that resonates with the worldwide audience. Captain America: Civil War is now the peak result of this formula, as this is the first mega Marvel film since the original Avengers to appear to not pull any punches and maximize the content with the pieces allotted.

As a comic book fan, there's no way you can walk out disappointed. And as a summer blockbuster fan, you will also have a lot of fun while simultaneously think about the events that occurred long after the final punch is thrown. Civil War is absolutely fantastic, and among the best comic book movies of all-time. DC, you need to watch this and take notes.",9
28 April 2016,A dark and emotional chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"Captain America: Civil ͏Wa͏r is the first Marvel superhero film of 2016 (second if you count Deadpool). Last year, I said that Avengers: Age of Ultron was the darkest and best Marvel film so far, however, after seeing Civil War, I think we have a new contender. It represents a dark and emotional chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

After the Avengers fail to stop a terrorist plot in Nigeria, a superhero regulation act is set up by the United Nations that restricts the heroes from taking matters into their own hands. The team is divided over whether or not they should go along with this act or protest its restrictions. Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is strongly against it while Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) strongly supports it. This causes a major rift in the team and could possibly bring an end to the Avengers initiative altogether.

So far, this is the darkest, most emotional and best acted film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I feel that it covered a lot more ground than Avengers: Age of UItron and gave the heroes a more solid reason to fight one another, unlike in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Despite its darker tone, there were still some hilarious scenes of comic relief throughout the film, mainly from Ant-Man and Spider-Man. The new heroes were all great as well; Chadwick Boseman was bad-ass as T'Challa/Black Panther and newcomer Tom Holland was youthful and witty as Peter Parker/Spider-Man.

I rate it 8.5/10. Just like with most other Marvel films, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes.",9
6 May 2016,Most Impressive,"Captain America: Civil War

Captain America and Iron Man have to very different ideals about how the avengers should work. Iron Man wants everyone to be in check since they've killed so many people and he feels bad. Captain America knows what happens when good people do nothing and doesn't want government telling him who to save and who to not.

The Russo brothers directed both this movie and Winter Soldier, the precursor to this movie. I've only see that and The Community, and so far they've done nothing wrong for met yet. The direction of this movie must have been a massive undertaking and for that I applaud them.

Christopher Markus must have done a ton of research into the Civil War event because there are so many amazing shots in the film that he must have wrote in. I can't wait for Infinity War since he's also writing the screenplay.

The cast in this film is a mile long and a mile deep. Each character gets their own screen time but not without taking away from this being Captain America's movie. It all felt like this was his story and yes there are other characters and here are what they're doing. It didn't feel like a three act movie but more like 4 or 5 almost. Leaving the film I felt almost exhausted with details to think about.

Newcomer Black Panther, played by Chadwick Boseman. I first saw this young actor in Draft Day and man he played that part well, he's showing his range and why he deserves to be in the avengers.

Tom Holland was by far the definitive and best Spider-man we've had. I say this having loved Andrew Garfield's performance, but he felt too old and not funny enough. Tom Holland encapsulated what I felt was a genuine performance and quotable spider-man.

Emily VanCamp kinda disappointed me. I don't want to say this film is flawless and she along with Daniel Bruhl also were some of the downfalls that keep this film from being the best Super Hero movie. I kept waiting for Sharon Carter (VanCamp) to do something and it all felt mute in the end.

The Easy list. Best Captain America. Best Winter Soldier Best Falcon Best Scarlet Witch A great Iron Man A great Ant-Man Meh Black Widow Meh War Machine Meh Hawkeye Disappointing Vision Disappointing Crossbones.

Verdict: Everyone should watch the film. There's barely any cursing and the violence is not over the top. Some scenes are: ""what's the importance of this?"" few scenes later, ""Oh, okay well that makes sense.""",9
20 January 2021,What an absolute joy,"Awesome! My new favourite, so far at least.

What an absolute joy 'Captain America: Civil War' is! It made 147 minutes feel like so much less. Great action, enthralling story, sharp humour and some impeccable use of the many, many characters; even introducing two new faces to the MCU. I won't spoil who, but they are massive additions and I love what they give to this.

It gives the perfect amount of screen time to all involved, there is no-one I wanted to see more or less of - it all felt very natural too, big kudos for that. Chris Evans is terrific, this is his best performance as Captain America thus far in my opinion. Robert Downey Jr. continues to impress, as expected.

Sebastian Stan as Bucky also sticks out, I didn't love that character in his preceding appearances but in this I really did connect with his story. Anthony Mackie and Don Cheadle remain good fun, while Daniel Brühl plays his role very nicely. Elsewhere, Paul Rudd's inclusion is amusing.

The whole film, as is normal in these productions, looks stunning. They are incredibly well made. As noted at the top, this is more new favourite from the MCU - surpassing 'Captain America: The First Avenger'. I guess there's no hiding who my standout avenger is, eh?

The only 'but' I have for this is the title. It's practically an avengers film. I'm not saying it's an ill-fitting title, I get it's the titular character's arc, but I feel like it does the film a slight disservice - it's impacts much more than Captain America.

That's not a big deal, at all, though. No doubt in my mind: this is superb!",9

28 May 2016,Horrible,"This movie didn't know what it wanted to be, it was like this amorphous blob that was trying to be 12 things at once and it failed at all of them.

The movie pacing is terrible, it will slow down and speed up just to get the next scene and the character running around shouting plot.

Some of actors really phone in their performance and it shows.

Finally it seems that black widow can never get hurt, ever.

I like female heroes, (Xena, Alice from resident evil, captain Janeway, Scully, lora croft, )

3 May 2016,Loads of fun,"9.3/10 ""Oh what's this? Another comic book movie? Oh well. Wait, is it just Captain America v. Iron Man? I bet it'll be just as bad as that Batman v. Superman movie."" I may be a little tired of comic book movies, as I am sure other people already are and I do not really approve Marvel has planned films until like 2023. However, if they continue to deliver movies of this caliber, they are very welcome to do so. Civil War is a pretty good movie. It has some great action, good stunt work and some pretty good performances and introductions to some secondary characters.

First, the things I liked. You're constantly switching teams. I was ""Team Iron Man "" when I went into the movie theater, but the movie presents both sides with great, understandable motivation and you identify with both sides. You never grow to hate anyone but you kind of know where they're coming from and that's a sign of a well written film. It's funny when it need to be, serious when the story demands it and just badass all around. Also, these movies are actually fun and don't feel like the most depressing thing in the world. Yep, I'm looking at you Zack Snyder. Most of the action is pretty good, especially the airport fight which is simply phenomenal, I would even say perfect. The movie also addresses some heavier themes, which are thought provoking and the movie isn't afraid to do so. Another thing I love about these Marvel films is that, sure they are a part this massive MCU, however, most of these films you could watch, without having any previous idea what the other films were about or about who these characters are, and you could still completely follow what is going on. And this is something to be praised: Civil War stands alone as its own movie. This is the first we see of Black Panther and not knowing anything about him I liked his intro to this universe. Spider-Man was the best part of the movie, at least for me. Tom Holland really captured the character of Peter Parker like no one else has and was a great Spider-Man. I can't wait to see more of him.

Now, for the things I did not like. The first thing is the villain. The whole movie you're wondering what his plan is but he never feels like a real threat amongst our heroes. He's just kind of there and does bad things. There is a point in the movie where I even forgot he was in it. His motivation was clear and in the end your questions are answered, but overall I think his plan was a little too ""Dr. Evilish"" if you catch my drift. Upon further thought, I realized everything of importance in the film could have easily happened if he wasn't in the film. Sure, the catalyst for the actions would have been different but the outcome would have been pretty much the same. The action was great for the most part, but particularly at the beginning of the film it did get a bit shaky at times, maybe even a little too shaky. You could almost always follow what was going on but it made me kind of dizzy. I've said this several times for the Marvel movies and it does take some points away for me, but the score in these movies is inexcusably mediocre. It always (or at least most of the time) feels like generic superhero music in these Marvel films and it is something that needs to be addressed. No spoilers, but I was disappointed with the way the movie ended and it felt kind of dumb to be honest. It involves a letter so you know exactly what I'm talking about.

But overall, Marvel has really done a great job once again with Civil War. The best thing about this film is that every character has something to do and every single one of them has a certain depth to them and you can identify with their actions. No one feels out of place (Well, maybe Hawkeye a little bit, but you can identify with him and you know where he's coming from) and in a movie with as many characters as this, it should be praised. Civil War is action packed and loads of fun.",9

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

29 April 2016,Marvel at it's best...,"**Warning may contain major spoilers**

I'm gonna compare Civil War to a few things here as I feel it's only right to. Especially as the year has opened with hero against hero which creates a good base for any superhero movie. There has always been that debate, #whowillwin when matching heroes against one another and I believe the hype over Batman V Superman was greater with regard to who wins but Civil War had more hype overall.

Is it really a Captain American movie? Robert Downey Jr. has been quoted saying it's Iron Man 4. In my opinion it's another Avengers movies which centres around Rogers and Stark disagreement to be put into check. Only Thor and the Hulk are missing and you can understand their absence. Though the Russo brothers have done something rather incredible, and that's a perfect balance between all the characters. It's a super busy line-up yet each and every character gets decent pieces, each having their own moments. It's almost like Vision has devised a formula calculating the percentage each character should have and divided the 147mins perfectly.

The debates between Rogers and Stark creates an unnerving tension which eventually tears them all apart. There's a basic agenda there but understanding both sides of the argument it's hard to pick a side, even when knowing certain truths you can still sympathise with the other. As a whole, it's like they've stripped everything back to basics and built it back up whilst letting the heroes tear it back down again.

It's not just the characters they balance so well either, but the action versus downtime and comedy. This has some of the best fights out of all the marvel movies put together and I believe that to be as a result of it being mostly hand to hand combat and some web to shield. The staircase fight was Bournish but with super strength, the airport showdown is epic beyond measure again, everyone getting their piece of the action. The foot-come-car chase was clever too and just when you thought you've seen Natasha kick-ass before, she goes and throws all that about. A lot of very imaginative action without it going silly; in fact it's the most believable fight scenes I've seen in a Marvel movie.

The comedy element is there and yet again, everyone else having their moment giving the audience so much to talk about, which I reckon most of would be unfortunately lost during the adrenaline rush. It isn't just Stark that throws the witty one-liners and cheesy comebacks, Sam, Clint gets some in and even Bucky shows his sense of humour for a brief moment. This is down to excellent script writing and there's a lot of clever dialogue to go about.

We see the familiar heroes, Rhody, Sam, Wanda and Scott Lang having a small BIG part with his quirky uncomfortableness. Clint obviously returns and it seems he has a lot more to say. Or it feels that way; I'm not doing any word counts here. But they introduce two more characters from the marvel universe, one of which is already a major player on the field and the other being T'Challa, the Black Panther.

Chadwick Boseman does an superb Black Panther and really makes his presence known. He can punch and kick with the best of them. And what is really great about the introduction of both these characters is that there really isn't one. No origin story for either so not to derail and insult the audience. Like Spider-Man needs a background story. (He's always been one of my favourites)

Your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man is recruited in comic fashion and what he brings to the arena is nothing short of amazing. Not sure if Tom Holland has the Peter Parker look but it's refreshing and his boyish chatter is brilliant, actually complimenting on his enemies abilities and attributes whilst giving them the slingshot and web bashing. It was his part I was most worried about hoping they wouldn't ruin him or just give us a hint. It works. Thank You.

I'm not sure about Martin Freeman and as much as I love him as an actor I'm not sure he fits in. I don't think his part was wholly necessary or to have him play it. Maybe they should have dressed him up to be more like Agent Coulson. William Hurt's character yes but Emily VanCamp's Carter could be seen as a weak link though she has more than one purpose in this fight.

Now, it does lack the major bad-ass super villain but there's no need and even though there's a hint of one or a squad of them, there's a clever twist and like Batman V Superman, it involves mothers. (Hmm, was that one below the utility belt?) It totally works and allows the story to finish with the ending it deserves

Other things to note are the baseball cap disguises everyone seems to wear and of course everyone being on first name terms. You can't see everyone going about calling each other by their superhero names when sat around desk. It actually adds some humility to each of them. And yes Stan Lee makes his usual comical cameo with some lasting effect thanks to Rhodes.

Is it to comic book lore? Well, after consulting my comic hero expert it's better than the comics ""fleshing out their storyline"". Is it better than Dawn of Justice? Yes. So much better on so many levels. Is it better than Avengers? Definitely better than Age of Ultron, it's like a separate movie all together and my current mood is saying it's even better than Avengers Assemble. I think it's because this time it's personal and not so over the top. It's marvel at ground level and at it's best.

10 July 2022,the best movie that i ever watched in the MCU,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character.

14 April 2016,"Certainly not one to miss, another knock out of the park by Marvel","As visually impressive as it striking and powerful. Captain America: Civil War does an outstanding job of juggling a multitude of moving and important parts that it's absolutely ludicrous that the movie is as coherent as it is. But somehow it just works. I'm at a loss for words, as to how the Joe and Anthony Russo were able to craft something so compelling and thematically respectable, using superheroes to tell a serious and heavy story, while understanding and being more than willing to provide levity throughout the film. The fight scenes and choreography are tight and extremely well done, and while they do lose a little edge do to some fast editing, I won't knock how exhilarating certain scenes are throughout the film. They took big leaps with this movie and it sure paid off. And I'm very much taking into account that I just saw the movie, and I'm still dealing with the rush of anxiety that came with almost not getting in. But as I cool down I'm definitely feeling that excitement lifted. Not that you weren't already gonna see it, but if you weren't, I highly recommend it, based purely on it's wow fact, enjoyment, and great storytelling. I can't wait to see this again opening night.",9

4 December 2021,Avengers vs Avengers,"If you can't beat them, let them beat themselves.

That seems to be the motto of this movie and damn it was cool! I'm so glad that it didn't fully focus on Captain America because I personally find Captain America quite boring, but rather on all Avengers.

Political disagreements made the Avengers split apart. I was already skeptical of the Avengers' actions: Whenever they were in a large city fighting monstrocities, there would be so much destruction and so many casualities but it was mostly just put aside since it was done for the greater done. I'm not used to this from many classical animes where the protagonist is always this superbly righteous guy making sure that everyone stays alive - even the enemies.

But this issue was thematisized in this movie. Some Avengers themselves feel at fault. What shall it be? Controlled by the UN to try to ensure public safety but not be able to act whenever they deem right?

With friendship issues and family issues at hand, a civil war unfolds. Which is freaking cool. Surely many fans were wondering who would win a fight if certain Avengers crashed. We got this in an all-out 5v5 which was incredible! They even got Ant-Man!

I was also surprised that this was the introduction of Spider-Man. Quite a funny addition actually.

All in all, I'm more than pleasantly surprised, though I'm not sure about the resolution of the enemy's actions. Nonetheless, this was a great movie for sure.",9
27 April 2016,one of if not the best,"One problem that Marvel will start to face is not one to be easily solved, more and more characters and egos. Sometimes it gets hard to track every character but indeed civil war does it extraordinarily in amazing 'Marvel' fashion. Characters had quite balanced screen times and input to the overall story and the action scenes of this movie is just stunning, the airport fight scene is the best movie fight scene ever which has really proved me wrong. After seeing the trailer and what little bits we got of that scene I assumed that Marvel's attempt to transfer a comic book splash page to live action looks ridiculous since there are only what 10 people charging at each other while in the comic books we get like 100 give or take 10 people. This has actually always been my concern since the movie was first announced I honestly never thought they would be able to pull off this comic book classic this early on in the development of the cinematic universe. But, am I glad that they did. I am very interested in finding out what the repercussions of this event would be on the development of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Marvel has nailed it again.",9
6 May 2016,Marvels just cant disappoint you with a Superhero flick.,"'CAPTAIN America : CIVIL WAR' REVIEW :- We all loved Marvel's previous Superhero flicks, this is another addition to that list. Makers tried to add more fun this time and they have succeeded in it. Obviously if they are making sequel that means audience deserve more fun than the previous one, this must be the thinking of Makers when they decided to make this movie. Marvel has a separate movie for each superhero then they made Avengers to bring all superheroes together and Civil War follows same idea. Too many superheroes, 2 teams and their face off. Wow sounds great no? Movie starts with kick ass action sequence. Keeps you hooked for first 30 minutes then some necessary scenes to set a plot which gives you loo break. Then after Interval movie is bit of slow but then last 40 minutes are brilliant. Spidey's entry and his presence made it more entertaining. End is quite Emotional (not actually) and bit disappointing or exciting, depends on your choice how you take it. Film wins your heart by its special effects and those scenes are eye pleasing in 3D. Screenplay could have been better but it is not bad either, usually this kind of films are not made to entertain you for complete 150 minutes and you know it. Runtime looks 10 stretched. Story is good and bit a confusing but it ends on satisfying note. Acting is perfectly showcased by all leading stars. Sound work is good too, especially in action sequences. Cinematography is something to clap for. As a whole Film entertains you, doesn't make you feel bore and won't let you think that you wasted money on it. Go for it, enjoy this another Money making entertainer by Marvels. 7/10 stars by me.",7
24 April 2020,I love Captain,"There is no absolute right or wrong position on both sides of the civil war. The United States team is the embodiment of very justice , he believes in truth, goodness and beauty, he believes in the kindness of winter soldiers (in fact, winter soldiers are indeed manipulated by Hydra). Winter soldier is the only person in the world that the United States team has known since before he went to sleep, a spirit that no one can replace. A lot of people say the United States team is selfish, I don't think so. The Black Widow finally helped the United States team and the winter soldiers leave, so many people on the captain's side, not just a large number of people, but said that the captain's justice and salvation were accepted by more people. And Iron Man, uh, only wanted to catch the winter soldier, and his conceit in the positive film made him not see the truth of the facts. After reading the third book, it is heartache in two words. Why is the heartache? The fight between the American team, the winter soldier and the Iron Man, of course: the captain wanted to protect the winter soldier, Tony wanted revenge for killing his parents, and Tony was angry because the captain knew about it and didn't tell himself. It was a good show for a good brother to die.

At the end, when Tony was alone and lonely, he received a letter from the captain. The captain's magnetic voice softened my heart.Fight is hit, emotional injury broken, but as long as you need them to need me, we will be with you to fight with you.

That's how heartache it is. I like the United States team.",8
30 April 2016,Finally. Marvel movies grow up and tackle mature themes.,"Following a series of battles and a fatal error in a Mission that saw much collateral damage, the world finally calls for regulation on the superhero team known as the Avengers. Facing an uncertain future, the avengers are split on ideological grounds with captain America aka Steve rogers opposing regulation and iron man aka Tony stark supporting it. What begins as arguments soon morphs into rivalry, then escalates into conflict and ultimately battles. Into this conflict comes The Black Panther, a superhero from Africa who is after Captain America's Friend the Winter Soldier for involvement in an assassination attempt. As opposing sides deal with this new development, a young man gifted with the powers of a spider is recruited into the fight.

What comes across as amazing is the directors' way for tying all these plot threads together. You have the black panther situation, the growing differences between Tony and Steve, the overarching political debate on accountability, then you have Spiderman being reintroduced into the marvel cinematic universe. With all these characters and subplots, the film never lets us forget this this is primarily a Captain America movie. Steve Rogers is the main focus with Tony Stark as his foil. With a little thinking by the audience to connect the dots, the plot threads fall into place nicely and the stories fit along parallel themes. Our tale is fast paced, going from tense conversation to awesome action and back again.

The tone is, finally, more serious and more grounded, a much welcome departure from the increasingly comedic tones of most marvel movies. There is a true sense that the stakes are high, and the potential for loss is great. The Russo brothers crafted a serious political thriller in CAPTAIN America WINTER SOLDIER, and now they up that ante in writing, characters and action. Though some of the fights have that ""sped-up-in-post-production"" look, it is grittier, more brutal and less ""dance-like"" than most of other marvel movies. The final battle between Tony and Steve stands out as the best marvel movie fight ever not only because of the perfectly shot scenes but in the emotional aspect as well. Conflicts are framed in a ""no nonsense"" approach, rather than the cartoon-like quip filled play battles of before. Not that there aren't quips but these are from characters defined as such in their original comics, namely Tom Holland's Spiderman.

Easily the freshest aspect of the movie, Tom Holland embodies the youthful wall crawler that comic fans love. His introduction foregoes the usual overly long origin tale and gets him right into the action. Everything is perfect, the way he moves, the way he talks, his emotional journey through the movie that runs parallel to that of the Robert Downey jr's Tony stark and Chris Evan's Steve Rogers. Everyone brings their best to the roles both new and familiar, with the two veterans conveying the emotional anguish and turmoil of two brothers-in-arms forced to opposing sides.

This movie's emotional weight relies heavily on continuity and would be more effective if one had been following these characters from their first movies, through avengers and marvel phase two, right up till now. Without the 8 or so preceding movies, it is difficult to get a grasp on Captain America's or Iron Man's differing ideologies and unresolved interpersonal tension. Their motivations seem propelled by stubbornness and ego which would seem shallow without their relational context as provided by past movies.

Thankfully the magnificent chemistry between this cast who have co-starred together for so long, shines. Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr. And the rest all truly become their characters, drawing the audience into this fantasy world where secret Organisations, spies, superheroes and people with powers co-exist. There are some ill timed comedy, especially those that come in the middle of intense scenes. It kills the drama and the serious mood. Thankfully, these are few and lesser in number than previous marvel movies.

The big downside, especially as a fan of the comics, is how different this is from the original civil war miniseries. The original was a tragic tale of good intentions carried out in bad ways, it deconstructed super hero feuds, touched on politics, delved into the philosophical question of freedom or security; themes that resonate with the world deeply entrenched in the war on terror. The movie version downplays a lot of that. Message to marvel: if you are going to use a title, at least respect the source material. This does have a few fleeting similarities but all in all feel like a completely different story which had no business using the name of an existing one. The political themes, touching on the accountability of those in power, are present but never at the forefront. By the movie's end, it does not even feature within the climatic showdown. What could have been a physical and metafictional ""fight"" between two friends representing opposing sociopolitical ideologies suddenly descends into a weak excuse for revenge.

As a whole this is a tremendous improvement in every aspect over previous marvel team up movie AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON. Comic book movies will be hard pressed to match up to this standard set by CAPTAIN America CIVIL WAR. Yes there is ill placed humour, yes they kill a certain amount of the drama with cheap comedy and yes the relatively generic musical score by Henry Jackman seems wasted on such an epic. But the few flaws aside, this is finally the kind of movie that marvel should be making. One that takes its superheroes more seriously, tones down the jokes, and delves into deeper themes both social and political. More focus could have been given to those themes, but this is a very pleasing start to what I hope is the maturing of the marvel cinematic universe.",7
30 April 2016,A wonderful piece of cinematic choreography,"It's always fun to see super-heroes ranged against each other - somehow it makes it more of a fair fight than creating some arch-villain who ultimately doesn't really stand a chance. In the X-Men movies, we've always had this conflict with the mutants led by Professor X constantly opposed by those following Magneto. In the DC Comics universe, we have very recently seen Batman versus Superman in ""Dawn Of Justice"".

Now we have the mother of all civil wars with a team led by Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) battling it out with a squad alongside Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) which presents the largest collection of superheroes ever assembled on the screen. The Winter Soldier, Falcon, Hawkeye, War Machine, Ant-Man, Spider- Man, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Vision - they're all there. Plus newcomer Black Panther.

The great success of this immensely enjoyable movie is that all these superheroes have a decent amount of screen time with good lines and exciting action. When the two tribes go to war, the result is a wonderful piece of cinematic choreography. So what's the argument between them? Well, as in ""Dawn Of Justice"", it's dawned on politicians that, when superheroes smash up cities, there is collateral damage - innocent people are killed.

So 117 nations come together to draft the Sokovia Accord which requires them all to operate under the ultimate control of the United Nations. Both ""Dawn Of Justice"" and ""Civil War"" can be seen as metaphors for contemporary debates in our own world: should our security services and our global corporations be subjected to more regulation and restraint?

As with all the superhero franchises, there are many allusions to previous films, so here it helps if you've seen all the earlier movies in the Marvel cinematic universe and can remember exactly what happened (I have and I don't).

Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have scripted all three ""Captain America"" movies and Anthony and Joe Russo have directed the last two and they have set a high bar for the promised ""Avengers: Infinity War - Part I"" (2018) and ""Avengers: Infinity War - Part II"" (2019) by which time I'll have forgotten even more but no doubt be just as excited and welcoming.",
13 May 2016,Marvel's finest to date,"'Superhero fatigue' is a phrase commonly batted around amongst critics and forum lurkers whenever a new caped crusader is unleashed into cinemas. Cries of Hollywood running out of ideas are often heard too. Despite all of this, the likes of Spider-Man, Batman and the Avengers crew have Hulk-smashed the box office for years. Most impressively, Marvel's ever-increasing 'Cinematic Universe' has been building now for 8 years and 13 films, films that occasionally claw in over a billion at the box-office. This is not down to audiences simply flocking to the promise of CGI explosions and wise-cracks, but Marvel's insistence on keeping the formula fresh.

After a few years churning out average to above-average (and one excellent in 2008's Iron Man) origin stories for the individuals that would, in 2012, reluctantly team up to become The Avengers, producer Kevin Fiege was obviously wary of wavering interests. Marvel's work since 2014, since the mediocre Thor: The Dark World in 2013, has been exceptional, placing their heroes and villains in a variety of cinematic genres. Captain America: The Winter Soldier played out like a 70's spy thriller, casting Robert Redford to reinforce the tone, Guardians of the Galaxy often felt like bizarre B-movie with a bigger budget and a more talented cast, and Ant-Man, a movie many predicted to be a disaster, was a full-on comedy, bolstered by the presence of an effortlessly charming Paul Rudd.

The latest - and by far the best - is the third and possibly final entry into the stand-alone Captain America series. Retaining The Winter Soldier's directors Anthony and Joe Russo and also much of the same tone, Civil War pits its second most popular superhero against its first, Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man. Also along for the ride is almost every other hero on the roster, along with a couple of new ones. But what makes Civil War very much a Captain America film and not The Avengers 3 is the Russo's remarkable grasp of their characters. With Bucky Barnes aka The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) back on the scene as a very wanted man, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) finds himself torn between his loyalty to an old friend and being held accountable for his superhero actions. It is the friendship between the two that remains at the heart of the film.

When Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) accidentally causes mass destruction in Lagos on a mission led by Captain America, the Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) informs the Avengers that the United Nations are passing a bill known as the Sokovia Accords, which will see them under the control of a UN panel. Full of guilt over his balls-up with creating Ultron, Tony Stark backs the bill, as do War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Vision (Paul Bettany). With little confidence in the government, Steve opposes the bill, and is followed by Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Ant- Man. Tensions are raised higher when The Winter Soldier is accused of bombing the UN conference in Vienna and becomes a wanted man all over the world.

What makes Civil War such a gripping film is its refusal to offer any easy answers. Depending on your own political and personal views, Captain America could be the antagonist of his own movie, causing a war between friends over his blind loyalty to a friend he knows is a mass-murderer, albeit a brain-washed super soldier experiment. On the flip-side, the character Downey Jr. has now immortalised and the hero to always receive top billing could become a knee-bending traitor seeking accountability for his own irresponsible actions during the events of Age of Ultron. More likely, and more interestingly, you will come to realise that there is simply no right answer.

So it all comes down to who wins the fight. And what a fight it is. One of biggest flaws of Batman v Superman was its failure to come up with a believable scenario that would cause the good guys to beat on each other only to come to realise they are on the same side. Not only does the brawl feel organic, taking place at Leipzig airport with each character allowed more than one moment to shine, but it also refuses to offer any easy solution or a big bad for the team to unite against. The motivation and plan of the film's villain, Helmut Zemo, played with a remarkable subtlety by Daniel Bruhl, is kept a mystery until near towards the end. And just when you think you finally know where it's all heading, it side-steps you and goes in a completely different direction.

The film's biggest flaw is the introduction of Spider-Man, who is finally back in the hands of Marvel after Sony's failure to re-boot the franchise with Andrew Garfield. Played by Tom Holland, who is the best Peter Parker yet, his entry into the fold feels shoe-horned and slightly awkward. But when he is let loose during the airport fight, he damn near steals it until Ant-Man shows his new friends just what he can do. The other newbie, Black Panther aka the Wakandan T'Challa (a gravelly Chadwick Boseman), plays a bigger role than you might expect, still learning and developing into the king he will become. Above all else, Civil War is simply a blast. With such care taken with its army of characters, each getting their own arc, its easy to become emotionally invested. So when Cap and Iron Man really get down to business, it becomes unbearable to think that one of them may not walk away. Bravo, Marvel and the Russo's.",9
23 July 2021,Great Fun,"As in other stories, society is concerned with the collateral damage done by superheroes and there is a movement to rein in the Avengers. Specifically, the Avengers would work under the authority and supervision of the United Nations--a concept immediately rejected by Captain America (Chris Evans). This conflict parallels the real-life struggle between globalism and nationalism.

Those who align with Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) accede to the popular demands, while Captain America heads the group that rejects the proposal, making them outlaws. Tony Stark agrees to apprehend the rogue Avengers, setting up a battle between the two groups of superheroes.

A significant development is the introduction of Spider-Man (Tom Holland) to the conflict. Marisa Tomei plays Peter Parker's Aunt May, which is a welcome addition.

The antagonist in the film appears to be Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), but Captain America has doubts. Is he unduly influenced by his decades-old relationship with Bucky?

The story about the dissension in the Avengers team paired with great action scenes makes this a strong entry in the canon of the MCU. There is something very elementary about imagining which superhero can beat another superhero, so the battle between the two factions in this film scratches an itch of all fans.",8
10 May 2016,Getting tired with superhero movies.......,"I don't know about you but i'm starting to get tired with so many superhero films they release almost each month.

I don't know why marvel have so much success with those films but for me it's time to withdraw from those kind of films especially the superhero vs superhero films like avengers and this captain America film.

in those kind of films we most experience video games cgi effects as a superhero fights another superhero.......feeble minded boy stuff.

At least solo superhero films are more serious than the S.H vs films.

as for this movie it was not bad at all...it had fights...plot...action but like i said we get too much of these movies lately AND IT'S KINDA BORING.

I think as long as those films will be in fashion we will always get new ones plus TV series.

next similar film in line to be released is the new X-MEN film and a dozen more were announced including characters like DR. STRANGE who are not well known to the public.

don't know bout you.........but for me it's getting boring.",6
8 May 2016,Should have been named Captain America : Little Dispute,"The movie was decent. It was too funny. It shouldn't have been. Too many jokes during the fight distracted me the hell out the movie. Cheesy and lame jokes. This movie is so overrated. It deserves 5/10 at the least, but for me its a 1/10. There many similarities between BvS and Civil War. Everybody acted nicely, the pacing was decent too. The introduction of Spiderman was rushed and felt badly written. There are many continuity errors in certain scene. The actual 'Civil War' battle was too short. Like 6-7 minutes of the fight. The story is really boring with some action scenes added to it. The action scenes were bad. It had too many cuts. Lots of cuts for an action scene, it felt weird. And so much shaky cams. Couldn't see what was happening. Then there is another movie that was released few weeks ago named BvS which was so much better than this. This is one of the many disasters of Marvel. Avengers Assemble still stands as my favorite MCU movie. Watch Civil War once, but don't watch it again because you won't feel like watching again.

21 May 2016,Headache Inducing Mess,"Like all too many productions lately, this one is barely a story, loud to the point of being obnoxious but lavish in its CGI production values.

We again have people who seem to have super human abilities but no explanation of how that may have happened or what limits they have on their capacities. At least one of them, a flea sized human, sprouts another capacity in the middle of a fight - again no explanation of how this happened or if this is the end of it. Also their capacity to take punishment seems greatly enhanced.

Each of the gets thrown around bouncing off of hard surfaces experiencing no trauma, fatigue or even getting dirty. That is until one of them does get terribly injured from suffering an impact no more than he has suffered countless times in the immediate past. Again, no explanation why this acceleration seriously injured him while the previous 500 similar ones did not.

The one saving aspect of this movie is the recognition by the crew and public that them performing their feats leave behind a terrific amount of damage which seems to be a plot point usually ignored in these comic book sorts of movies. I was hoping that they'd consider this but in fact, it only turns into another series of fights where they leave behind more damage including destroying a huge airplane just because they can.

So the movie starts to take a path more thoughtful than a typical three year old would like but abandons it almost immediately. Meanwhile there is some sort of other faction made up of Russians who are duplicates or something or other and they factor in somehow as well. Oh, then we have some mythical Edenish African Kingdom and the laughably mysterious addition of yet a new super hero just because at this point the whole thing is so utterly idiotic, well why not?

Loud, thoughtless, pitched for five year olds at best but gee, great CGI.",4
6 May 2016,Captain America:Civil War is a solid follow-up to the Avenger series and nice sequel to Captain America films. Go for it.,"""Why do we need a war to solve a problem"". The question that will pop up in your while watching the Avengers follow-up. Captain America:Civil War was entertaining with high-class 3D effects and stunning CGI along with riveting performances which turned out to be a solid follow-up to the Avenger series.

As the new Superhero Registration Act is proposed by the United Nations which lays out the plans to deploy Super-heroes only when required. This political interference by the government causes the rift between two good friends – Captain America, who believes that Super-hero should be have freedom to act and ""not obey order"", and Iron Man who believes that Super-heroes should be answerable to a neutral body based on their actions.

It would have been really challenging for Russo brothers, Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, directors of Captain America : Winter Soldier to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise they did a fantastic job and turned the comic-story into a must-see film. Of course, if you would have followed their original parts then this will be easy to continue. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half boast of some path- breaking action sequences. The opening fight scene with Scarlett Johannson's Black Widow is pretty impressive, the introduction of each super- hero character has laid out accurately and fight scenes will keep you engaged. Second half loses the steam with so many stories interwoven under the same umbrella.

Couple of scenes that easily stands out are conversation between Captain America and Iron man, the new characters like Black Panther and Ant-Man are highly likable. But the most impressive is the introduction of Spider-man which is played by a Tom Holland. Climax fighting scene is well executed. Screenplay is effective along with punching dialogues. Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects.

On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast especially. Robert Downey Jr who clearly stands out in his portrayal of Ironman and witty one- liners. The supremely talented actor goes deep inside a broken super-hero character who is left by his girlfriend. Chris Evans emotes better compared to the previous series of Captain America as if it is tailor-made for him. Scarlette Johanson does what she is best at – kick some ass. Paul Rudd will surprise you as Ant- Man.

Overall, Captain America:Civil War is a solid follow-up to the Avenger series and nice sequel to Captain America films. Go for it. Excellent 4/5

16 May 2016,"Captain America: Civil War is marvelous, indeed.","What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",9
20 November 2021,Very nice. A lot of Heroes,"The movie is very interesting. And it have a several members of the Avengers. We can see that in the movie and its very good. We can see also some tension between the heroes for the white wolf and we have a nice introduction of Black Panther. Its pretty interesting to follow the movie and have some nice revelations and an end that let us worried about some relationship between heroes but its pretty good and we dont see that often in a marvel movie. And i enjoyed the risk that Marvel took with this movie.

28 November 2016,the formula works,"In Lagos, Captain America, Black Widow, Falcon, and Scarlet Witch stop Brock Rumlow but cause collateral damage killing some Wakandans. U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross informs the Avengers that the world has come together to take control of them under the Sokovia Accords. King T'Chaka of Wakanda is killed in a bombing during the signing by apparently Bucky Barnes. Prince T'Challa intends to kill Bucky while Captain America intends to capture him alive. The situation spirals out of control to split the Avengers apart.

The MCU has become a long running serial show. The brilliance is that it works so well. They are fun. There is value in their connectivity. Sometimes, comic book movies have comic book motivations which often annoy me. The trick for this movie is that everybody's motivations work. The exception is yet another flawed MCU villain, Helmut Zemo. Taking him aside, the heroes have realistic motivations and actions. There is a great introduction of Spider-Man. Tom Holland is terrific and that franchise looks well on its way. His humor is a bit of fresh air. It didn't occur to me before but MCU humor has been mostly sarcastic cynicism. There is no cynicism in this Peter Parker and it's great youthful exuberance. Black Panther is also well-introduced and Ant-Man adds some great humor on top of Spider-Man. The conflict between Iron Man and Captain America is well developed. The romance between Scarlet Witch and Vision is intriguing. On the other hand, Cap's romance is questionable. The airport scene is something else. It may be the best comic book fight ever. This is what Marvel does and they do it well.",9
26 May 2016,Boring!,"I have to be honest: I am in general no big fan of superhero movies, but there are some exceptions. This movie, however, was not such an exception.

The movie seems to want to impress by pouring cans of superheroes at you and make them fight. Wow, I have never seen that before.

There was some sort of story line, but the basic premise is that you can't trust the UN, because superheroes themselves know better what's good for the world. Oh, the arrogance!

Because of the surplus of superheroes, I couldn't figure out which one(s) I was supposed to sympathize with. That they were all as thin as cardboard characters didn't help much either.

Perhaps if you're a comic book fan this movie contains some references to ""canon"" material (?), but for the otherwise uninformed viewer, there is not much entertainment value in it.",5

29 April 2016,Probably the greatest superhero movie so far,"The visuals and cinematic feel of this movie is amazing, although a few too many shaky cams so not top grades. The acting is absolutely amazing and the chemistry between the characters is great. Spiderman is fantastic and Elizabeth Olsen is great, and Robert Downey Jr. is one of the best actors alive today. Only the Vision that I am not so sure off, I was not sure after AoU and not sure now... I hope he is one of the characters that dies in Infinity wars.

The story/plot is also very good. You will buy the premise and the stakes are very high. The setup at the end is just brilliant, and although this is a superhero movie, it has more in-common with Winter Soldier and spy thrillers then the Avengers.

The villain is one of the best ever. His motivation, plot and execution of said plot is brilliant. A villain that actually succeeds and ""wins"" in a superhero movie, how is that for a twist?

Entertainment-wise this might be the best ever made. There is always something going on, usually with a great sense of humor, and the movie feels very short because of it. The airport fight scene alone is the best entertainment you will ever see, but personally I believe the last fight is the best of all time. Let me repeat; once you are over the fight at the airport and you go wow and think you will never see anything better, you do.... A perfect score! If you are in it for action and entertainment, you will love this movie!

In total a 9 within the genre, perhaps an 8 otherwise. Personally I believe this, all things considered, to be the best superhero movie ever made.

Captain America civil war is a must see and if you only have money for one movie this year, this is where you pay up. Great, great, wonderful movie - not just great and wonderful superhero movie.",9
1 April 2021,Exvelent clash of titans,"This movie was so much fun and heartfelt. I think this is one of the most character driven films from Marvel. Unlike the other films that rely heavily on plot this one starts right at the core of the inner world of Iron Man and Captain America. Excelent job from the writers and director.

13 April 2016,Exceeded my expectations.,"I loved every second of Captain America: Civil War. Everything was so well put and the story and plot worked very smoothly. This movie is everything Batman V. Superman should've been. Every character fit right and at no point did the movie feel crammed with superheroes. In my opinion, the two heroes that stole the show was Spider-Man and black panther. They got both of these characters right especially black panther. As much as I loved Batman V. Superman, I have to give this movie more credit. The Russo brothers did not disappoint and they delivered another marvel masterpiece just like the winter soldier. This movie was very good and I plan on seeing it again when it comes out to all theaters and maybe a couple more times! This movie made me very excited to see what comes next in the MCU.

27 April 2016,Best Superhero Movie of the Year.. yet!,"Hey everyone! (""spider-man voice"")

This is by far the best superhero movie yet. I put the word ""yet"" at the end of the sentence, because i'm still waiting and looking forward to ""Suicide Squad"" and other superhero movie that hasn't been released yet. Although i'm a DC and a marvel fan, This movie is the one i enjoyed the most.

The movie starts off nicely, building the scenes for the main event. The character's are well put together, Tom Holland as spider-man is as great a spider-man is in the comic book and black panther is also good. The CGI is also great, i really can't add any insight on this cause i've been sucked into the movie and hardly any focus on it. Although the villain is not that good, it hasn't affected the movie overall. The actions are great, the best action scene that i've seen in a movie 10/10. The airport scene is the most spectacular thing that happened, you're always at the edge of your sit. The plot is great, there's this clip that will horrendously trigger something at the end.

This is really a great sequel to the Captain America franchise, or maybe the best marvel superhero movie to date.

I'd give this MOVIE a rating of 9/10!",9
13 May 2016,As much a Captain America as an Iron Man movie,"It is amazing to me that a movie like this manages to be not just a great sequel to The Winter Soldier, but also to Iron Man 3, AND Age of Ultron, and still also be a good movie. A movie like this could easily crumble under the weight of so many characters, and yet it doesn't. Most of them get plenty of plot and an arc. Enough time is also dedicated to the new characters that this movie introduces.

This is not just a mindless action movie, like Age of Ultron. This is a pretty clever movie, with a solid plot, some red herrings, and twists. Of course not all characters get equal screen time. Thor and The Hulk aren't in the movie at all. And Hawk Eye is barely in it either. Other characters such as Vision, Scarlet Witch and Black Widow do get a decent plot. Vision struggles with human behavior, Wanda struggles with people being afraid of her, and Black Widow is caught in the middle, and struggling to pick a side. But in the end, I found myself strongly agreeing with Tony Stark. Even by the end of the movie, me and my friends had strong disagreements about which character was in the right. I find this a clear sign of a very strong plot.

Where the movie especially shines is it's first half. The movie spends a lot of time explaining the conflict at the heart of the story, and addresses the cost of all the absurd destruction from The Avengers, Iron Man, The Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron. There's really good dialogue in this film. I loved hearing every characters point of view, and it's hard to argue with any of them. They all have solid motives. The new character Black Panther isn't just thrown in at random. He is central to the plot. And the plot feels very serious, just like with The Winter Soldier. It isn't until the middle of the movie, that it embraces the over the top comic book action and the humor from The Avengers. So in a way, this movie is half Winter Soldier, and half The Avengers.

As far as comic book movies go, this is one of the best so far. It stands in stark contrast to the recent Batman V Superman. How can one movie be such a mess, and another do so much right? It honestly is some kind of miracle. Considering all the characters they need to juggle in this movie, and all the plot threads they need to tie together, this is one heck of a script.

The action is also top notch. There's a lot of really good car chases and free running action scenes in this. This makes some of the action feel very grounded in reality, just as in The Winter Soldier. I also got the feeling that they made plenty of use of practical effects. Of course there is also plenty of use of CGI and this. But at no point did anything really stand out to me. Again, this is quite a miracle, considering all the different effect studios involved with this.

Stay around till after the credits. Because the movie has both a mid-credits sequence, and an after-credits sequence.",9
17 June 2016,The first film I walked out of..,"I kinda liked MCU when it was in the phase of Iron Man - Avengers 1. Those were just good films with somewhat decent humour and sick new fighting scenes, all caked up with stunning visuals and, of course, superb acting (as in, RDJ, Mark Ruffalo and Sam Jakcson ONLY!, others were just watchable). Those films were truly good, I enjoyed them for what the were, mostly because of the fact that they didn't take themselves very seriously (note: does not mean they were dumb). That is until recently, when thing got fuc*ed up royally..

MCU is just not meant to be serious. Stick to what you are good at: fun family film - making with gloriously dumb one-liners. Let all the seriousness and darkness of the real world to the Zack Snyder's et al. DCEU vision. BvS, for all the hate and so- called, the worst plot- holes and editing bashing it received, in my eyes, handled its very idea - being dark (thus realistic) reflection of the Real world - very, very satisfyingly. It is not the best comic-book film, no (Justice League is meant to be that :D), but out of the CW and Batman v Superman, I must go with Dawn of Justice. That film is simply superior to Civil War in any aspect, especially fight scenes (airport - ehm - ""fighting"" was really a downer for me).

Finally, I do not think that the title Civil War is appropriate, when the highest number of assailants appearing on the screen in the same time is...12 or something. That-Is-Not-A-War, let alone civil.

And, yeah,..I will forever remember this film, for it made me leave my IMAX seat and walk out of a screening for the very first time in my life. If it is of an interest to you, I decided to pack my things right after the utterly shitty airport drunk brawl.",2

13 May 2016,a GREAT film and everything an adventure movie should be!,"Captain America: Civil War is everything an adventure movie should be, and more. It's the best film in any comic book movie universe.

What I liked is that there's a serious subtext to the story and it leaps out of the very first moments of the film. The movie gets just about everything right. The plot and shades of gray give much to chew on and think about. This installment perfectly picks up where we left Steve and his new team after Avengers Age of Ultron. It also follows up with Tony Stark perfectly. Yet, you need not even have seen any of those other films to enjoy this one even though it greatly adds depth to the overall story. Another huge strength is the casting. Evans again finds his pathos and his chops in this film. Robert Downey Jr. certainly has the acting chops to hang with anyone and he is again shear perfection as Tony Stark. Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther is no one dimensional character even though it easily could have been. This may also be Spider-Man's best turn on screen that we've seen and young Tom Holland is great. Sebastian Stan is again spooky perfection. Scarlett Johansson is AGAIN every bit the wise yet sexy female mainstay and a match for any male on screen. Emily Van Camp and Elizabeth Olson are smaller supporting characters but they simply shine with strength and depth. Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson certainly adds to the casting perfection. Every interaction and relationship works well and is certainly one of the many highlights of this remarkable film.

Again, this movie gets everything that matters right.",

30 April 2016,The Russo brothers deliver one of the great comic-book films to the MCU,"Back when Captain America: Civil War was announced during a Marvel Studios event in 2014, the anticipation I have had for this entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been rising with every single passing moment. Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, stood on a stage and announced the next Captain America film would be named Serpent Society and every single person was left a little underwhelmed. Then he backtracked and revealed the film's true title, as well as bringing out Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. to a deafening noise from the excited crowd.

Taking elements from the popular Civil War comic and rearranging a few things to make it fit the continuity of the MCU, Marvel turned to the Russo brothers, Anthony and Joe, who did such a good job with The Winter Soldier, to bring this story to the big screen. The Russo brothers have struck gold once again with Civil War, a film that may not only be the best entry into the MCU but one of the greatest comic-book films ever made.

After events in New York, Washington DC, Sokovia and finally, a botched mission in Lagos, the Avengers, led by Captain America (Chris Evans), are brought in by the US government to sign the Sokovia Accords, a document that states the Avengers must work under government supervision rather than their own free will.

Many people still see them as heroes yet there is a growing number of people who see them as nothing more than vigilantes who should be put on a leash, or stopped altogether. Captain America, who also has the trouble of finding his best friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) before he's taken out for good, decides against signing the document, causing a rift between not only himself and Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), but splitting the Avengers right down the middle.

While the Avengers, with the exception of Thor and Hulk, are all in Civil War, it is still most definitely a Captain America film, driven by a very personal story for the First Avenger. I have to applaud the writers, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, for the job they have done delivering a strong emotional core to Civil War. Captain America's main priority is getting Bucky, operating as the Winter Soldier for years, back at all costs and the effect it has on his friendship with Tony Stark is devastating, culminating in an emotionally fuelled finale that will leave you torn.

These are characters we've spent eight years following so to see them come to blows, especially when you can agree with why both are fighting, makes you genuinely care about the fight itself and the fallout of it all.

One of the highlights of The Winter Soldier was the action, particularly the hand-to-hand fights, and it's great to see the Russo brothers deliver brilliant action once again. The film is full of pulsating action whether it be close quarter combat or blistering chase sequences however, the stand-out action sequence in Civil War comes in the form of an all out brawl between two teams made up of various Avengers in a German airport. It's full of wonderful character moments and some brilliantly executed fun surprises, making it quite possibly one of the greatest scenes in any comic-book film.

One of my worries for Civil War was whether there would be too many characters in one film. It could have been a recipe for disaster and ended in a convoluted mess but that is definitely not the case. The Russo brothers do the characters we are familiar with justice as well as introducing new faces that I can't wait to see again in the MCU.

Both Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. have never been better in their respective roles of Captain America and Tony Stark. Downey Jr. in particular gives a really memorable performance as a guilt ridden Stark who feels the Avengers should be reined in.

All of the other familiar faces are brought to life with good performances but the real stand-outs are the new characters that we'd all been dying to see in action. First up is Chadwick Boseman in the role of T'Challa/Black Panther, a prince and warrior of Wakanda. Boseman cuts a very regal and imposing figure as Black Panther, more than holding his own against the likes of Captain America and the Winter Soldier. Then there is Peter Parker/Spider-Man, played by Tom Holland. This is Spider-Man's debut in the MCU after Sony agreed to share the rights with Marvel Studios so they had to get it right. They didn't just get it right, they nailed it with Spider- Man. This is the Spider-Man I've wanted to see for some time now, quip after quip during the airport fight and a distinct awkwardness as Peter Parker, and I can't wait to see more of him in the future. I will wait to see how his solo film pans out but we could be seeing the best Spider- Man yet here.

Take note DC, this is how you introduce new characters that will go on to shape the future of your cinematic universe.

Juggling a film of this magnitude with the vast array of characters on show is no easy challenge, yet it's one that the Russo brothers thrive on. They have delivered a brilliant comic-book film in Captain America: Civil War and, with the stakes even higher and more characters to come for the next Avengers films, they are certainly the right men for the job.",10
5 May 2016,Boring movie..,"The movie is boring, the storyline is very slow and the action scenes in general were not wow, it was great how each character was used in the main fight never the less, put the main fight aside, the rest is about Captain America and his best Bro! I was hoping to see more about the other characters and less about Bucky.

and honestly.. the reason why all this happened... is really really really stupid .. they tried to link it with other movies, but they failed badly.

on the other hand, one positive thing they did is that they kept Iron Man image and they managed to show both views equally without affecting viewers views.

Spoiler: the movie is different that the comics.. a lot

I was really hoping to see a better movie.",1
6 May 2016,a line has been drawn in the sand as politically motivated accord causes a civil unrest amongst the avengers splits the group powerful apart chose which side your on,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",10
2 October 2021,Team Cap,"I'm Team Cap but I fully get where Iron man was coming from. Cap's faith in his cause was truly admirable; to not bend, while everyone else, so easily breaks. It's the old adage of staying true to your ideals, no matter what is thrown at you. The world could be crumbling around you; everyone else giving up; Iron Man, and the other heroes wallowing in self doubt; but the faithful person, who still believes in himself (not for prideful reasons) remains, and that is Cap!.... It just so happened that he was right. His view aged well.

While I admire Captain America's faith and idealism, I probably would be more like Black Widow in this film. She understood the bigger picture. Even though she sided with Tony, her allegiance was to a higher cause; that of, understanding both sides, but at the same time, working in such a way as to bring everyone together. That kind of person, often is overlooked. The person who understands the long game, and realizes there are more important matters at hand, like not turning on your friends, and realizing that you are on the same side. Black Widow may have at times appeared like she was siding with Tony, and at other times siding with Cap. She made a concession in the first place by signing the accords; despite not necessarily believing in it for that matter; but as I have argued this was for a higher purpose. Her character embodies the nuance in the world, Sure, it is easy to pick a side. But what if both sides are right in their own ways? And what if that way of ""looking at it"" is the wrong way? Which is to say maybe one has to lose small battles for something greater in the end. Sometimes you need to bend so as to not break. Anyway.",9
7 May 2016,Little things that matter,"So, its almost summer and its MARVEL time! Who doesn't look forward to MARVEL movies these days? They have been delivering quite well in the recent past and they continue to do so with the new Captain America (or should I say Avengers?) movie: CIVIL WAR. One would have seen the trailer and promos and would clearly have gotten the point about the movie's plot. It is war. A war between two of the biggest Avengers, two of the best friends and two contrast personalities. So the movie wastes no time in creating the rift between Tony and Steve Rogers to initiate the 'war' and the remaining avengers split up conveniently in teams wit their differences of opinions on the matter of Avengers killing innocent civilians in their quest for peace. As a matter of fact one would have seen this coming, with hints about minimizing the collateral damage in Avengers, Age of Ultron. So superhero fans, bombing and crashing buildings, throwing cars are not just to boost the action sequences anymore.

Although one can argue that the story is a bit out of focus at times while trying to focus only on the rift, the directors produce something brilliant or give out a little hint twist just at the right time. That's why its the little things that matter that lifts Civil War when its down and takes it to another level. If you though the Winter Soldier played his part in Captain America The Winter Soldier think again. Because, this is more of a Winter Soldier movie than the previous one. The film slightly tries too hard to introduce all the new characters and reintroduce old characters but doesn't take anything away in the way it has balanced it all.

Chris Evans for me is Captain America all the way. He is so good every time he dons that costume and leads the way. You just can't seem to disagree with whatever the Cap says. Robert Downey Jr has a slightly darker IronMan role this time. Chadwick Boseman is impressive, Paul Rudd is once again exceptionally funny and Paul Bettany as vision is just too cool. Of course cudos to all the other actors portraying avengers as well. It has been a unique and Avenger-esque introduction for Tom Holland as spiderman and I hope MARVEL keeps the same tempo going. Daniel Bruhl is an exceptional actor and he has delivered nothing less in his role as Zemo. It was slightly disappointing to see Martin Freeman's talent waste in a role with the suit.

You cannot compare Dawn of Justice and Civil War. Both are movies of completely different tempos. I personally liked both and what makes Civil War click specially, is those little things, those moments that you will only understand if you watch the movie.",9
8 January 2017,A fictional fantasy easy to swallow,"I always check a page of previous comments, mainly to verify I'm on the right webpage but also to verify I watched the same movie and possibly to purr at shared opinions. This time I was very surprised at the vehemence of the angry dislike and scorn of most commenters to the latest Marvel offering, because as a non-purist it was basically what I expected: fantastic in the expected sense, not great as expected but I quite enjoyed it, as I'd hoped.

There's a rift in the lute betwixt Iron Man and Captain America and a spat develops when the Avengers are told by a mere 117 governments they must be officially registered to be allowed to continue saving the Earth. Iron Man and his motley crew side with the UN, the latter with his team side with Good. For a commercial work of fantasy it works. If all the Avengers had appeared in a scene singing and dancing in top hats and suspenders I would have accepted it in the same way we have to accept scenes like Bucky stopping and mounting a motorbike going by at speed one-handed and riding it away, or America mega-leaping from a building to the edge of another and continue running with no damage. Thumping whilst flying is routine and as for stopping a helicopter in mid-flight with your bare hands, well that kind of thing happens every day! I do have a minor problem with the chances of a traffic camera being nicely on hand in 1991 to record Stark's parents' brutal murders, the videotape surviving, and being suddenly available to the understandably outraged Tony 25 years later - in front of the murderer. But not much. You can appreciate that an appearance by Hulk would've made for a rather one-sided battle, but I admit I'm puzzled why Thor was excluded. The plot and acting is suitably unbelievable, the many action scenes are so superbly cartoon as to make Jason Bourne look a doddering old fool. My only worry is that it can't be long before the MCU, like the books, disappears up its own fiendishly incoherent plot vortex. Expect no ending, for there no ending in this world.

This franchise is financed by hard headed business people expecting only a profit but made by creative people who appreciate what they're doing as well. And in the main it'll be watched by people already looking forward to the next satisfactory Marvel time-filler probably including the real D. Trump too I expect.",7
15 June 2019,Blah blah blah...just why??? What the hell...??,"I'm so confused. Why is this part of the Captain America franchise and not 'The Avengers 3: Civil War'? I mean, all the Avengers are here (except for Hulk and Thor) and it follows on 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron'. After all, the first two Captain America films only featured Captain America as super-hero.

Ok, so this film was about...uhm...well... about.... what the heck was it about again?? Apart from the Avengers fighting among themselves there really wasn't much else going on in this film! (Hence the title Civil War, off course.) The fact that the film earned more than $1 billion dollars is completely beyond me. So, the audience actually enjoy seeing the Avengers fighting among themselves??? What a weird society we live in...

Let's face it, the opening scene was very good, and the Bucky chase scene was absolutely incredible. It was fast-paced, exciting and the great photography made the viewer feel he was actually part of the action. After that the film mainly revolves around conflict between the Avengers. I actually enjoyed Tony Stark in this film, who was the most sensible character. The film was dramatic until the halfway mark when Spider-Man and Ant-Man showed up, and along came the silly humor that didn't belong. Why were they in the film at all? They only had a few minutes screen time each and could easily have been replaced by some of the other characters. There were absolutely no need for them.

The fight scene at the airport was completely over the top and actually became rather silly, almost amateurish. It felt like I was watching a visualization of a child's imagination whilst playing with his toys. It honestly was cringe worthy.

There really was no need for this film...",3

2 July 2017,Very tedious and poorly made.,"The two ""Avengers"" films from ""Marvel Comics"" are good, especially the first one. This film, ""Captain America Civil War"" is a boring, confusingly plotted, poorly acted and an ending that settled nothing with regards to the Avengers being divided by a law that restricts the movements of the superheroes. There was hardly any continuity between the scenes as the narrative was as flat as a tyre. This film was all about those dreaded CGI and precious little else. The exclusion of the Incredible Hulk and Thor was a considerable mistake. The villain was almost non-descript and wasn't very interesting or menacing. In my opinion, Tony Stark/Iron Man should have been given more screen time and the plot should have revolved more around him. A huge disappointment.

8 May 2016,A step in the right direction,"I thought it really was a lot better than I had initially expected. Despite it being swarmed with characters, it never felt overwhelming or bogged down in exposition or anything. The central political conflict was given a lot of weight and significance. The first half of it was simply brilliant, very reminiscent of The Dark Knight. Then some flaws started showing up in its second half. One of the things I've gotten so tired of with Marvel is the insistence of pretty much every film of theirs to be bogged down with comedy. That's something that I appreciated about the previous two Captain America films, even if only the 2nd one was good. Here, I never felt like humor started appearing... until the build-up and the first battle scene between the Avengers in the airport. All of a sudden, all of them started giving funny one-liners and sarcastic quips. Were the lines bad? Not at all, but with everything else going on, and considering they were now in a physical battle with their own friends, it just felt like a complete betrayal to the tone and the heft of the whole thing. I loved Holland as Spiderman, but an article that is floating online said is best- he was great in it and it excites me for his own films, but he had no business being in this film or being introduced at all. He and Ant-man, among a few others, just lighten the whole thing up at the exact moment when it should have gotten even more serious. Luckily, the film goes back on track after this battle scene. The battle scene itself isn't bad at all so I don't think it hurts the film significantly, but it does sort of try to change the tone and I don't think that was the right call.

Overall, as flawed as it is and as someone who is not really a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe at all, this was really great.",
30 April 2016,A good story with Amazing fights!,"Civil War is another great Marvel's movie. The way they make the combat between Captain America and Iron Man is like Batman vs. Superman, but it is not bad. Actually, this movie has so many fight scenes among superheroes that you don't care about the story.

You may notice that Iron Man is not only 100% jokes at the movie and sometimes he is really angry. It is a good thing, because I usually like the humor in Marvel films, but sometimes they overcome a bit, and everyone knows Civil War is a movie that can be treated with more suspense.

There is no doubt about that Spider Man was the most awaited character and yes, he is the best in the movie. Just a kid in the middle of grown people and he has to fight with them. A great surprise in the screens and he is present in almost half of the movie.

As I said, the combat among superheroes is the best part of the movie. I am sure you have already thought in fights which involves superheroes vs. superheroes. In this movie, you watch great battles and you don't get tired of it because it is awesome to watch.

I think it is not necessary to compare Civil War and Batman vs. Superman. They are different movies and you can undisturbedly enjoy both of them.

Well, I highlighted the good parts of the movie and in general I liked it.

To sum up, in my point of view, the story is not one of the best, but the fights exceed the story and transform the movie in a great job.

I am anxious to watch next movies...

Thank you guys to read my review and I hope you enjoy the movie.

Bye, everybody. See you later!",8
30 August 2018,Best pre-Infinity War MCU movie!,"Captain America: Civil War is the best one out of the Captain America Trilogy.

The fact that this film tackles grown-up issues and asks a powerful question without being preachy or dramatic is nothing short of a major achievement.

It features the best action sequences you'd get to see in any MCU movies (others have great action too, but this one just blows the mind). From Cap to Black Widow to Iron Man, everyone gets stylish action sequences. Cap's shield action is even exhilarating in this one.

This film is an action-adventure, but plays out more like an action thriller. This time, Tony's look itself confirms the film to be an intense action film with intense performances. There are moments which would even leave you heartbroken. The screenplay is written with a lot of depth and perfection, making it the best MCU movie before Infinity War.

Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr deliver performances of a kind you'd have rarely seen before in a superhero film. You rarely get to feel you're watching Chris and Downey, the stars. You DO feel you're watching just Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. Scarlett Johansson impressed big time in the action scenes. Note that she has got some of the best ones in the film. Other actors do a great job as well, especially Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man.

Technically, this film is a masterpiece. From cinematography to visual effects to action sequences, this film wins in every department. The airport fight shot in IMAX is one of the major highlights of this film.

At the end of the day, Captain America: Civil War asks you a simple yet double-edged question: whose side are you on? I still don't have an answer to this question.",10

21 May 2016,I can't Take This Anymore...,"Yet another unoriginal bland superhero movie packed full of clichés blah blah blah blah.

I'll start off by saying that I'm aware that these movies are supposed to be fun and not taken all too seriously, but I'm sorry, that is not a sufficient excuse for such an effortless straight up boring script and narrative throughout many recent (and particularly this) Marvel films that have come about, aside from maybe Ant-Man and Deadpool it seems like these movies are just carbon copies of each other each more unoriginal and irrelevant than the last, and yet critics eat up this uninspired drivel over and over.

There is almost nothing unique about this film, and this is coming from someone that is relatively familiar with the civil-war comic books, this film lacks any of the depth, complexities or tension that was contained in the source material. Characters are completely one dimensional and never get seriously hurt, knowing they will never die takes any suspense away from the drawn out CGI fight-scenes completely. The narrative and dialogue is just poorly written and beyond all entirely dull, there aren't even character arks, its just damn bland badly written story with no outstanding qualities at all. I find it extremely difficult to care about any of these characters really especially given the comically black and white nonsensical positions that start this very anti-climactic ""Civil War"" to begin with.

There isn't really more to say, if you like ultimately uninteresting mindless action films I suppose you might like this, but thats all that can really be said for it.

There are many characters that aren't even one-dimensional and they borderline on figures to fill the screen and plot-devices *cough cough* Falcon and Hawkeye *cough cough*

The brand new spiderman is somehow manages to be even worse than Garfield's even with his very limited and completely unnecessary addition to the movie, his costume is Green-Lantern level bad, anyone who says differently is lying to themselves.

Thats my take, truthfully I hated this movie, and this is coming from someone who, for the most part enjoyed the last Avengers movie for what it was, but the fact that these glaring flaws continue to be ignored by moviegoers and critics alike is nothing short of maddening.",2
26 April 2016,Superb Film That's Fun Yet Textured and Intelligent!,"This movie is simply amazing. I was worried that I was expecting too much but this easily fulfilled and then exceeded all my already lofty expectations. I just loved it. The action sequences are spectacular and the story-line keeps you riveted from start to finish. The first act grabs you and eventually drops your jaw right to the floor. From there, the story has you and it's one big roller coaster ride to the heart rendering finish. I honestly believe movies like this are exactly what the cinema is for... a well structured and smart thrill ride.

I have a feeling that the writing and intelligence of this film is going to surprise those that don't know any better. They think this must be a silly ""comic book"" film and don't realize that the comics are indeed deep, textured and intelligent. This is everything that is complex and cherished in years of quality comic book runs.

Thank God literally that we all get to watch something this good.",10

6 May 2016,"My all time favorite movie, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. One of the best superhero movies, of all time.","Captain America: Civil War takes place after the events of The Avengers(2012), Iron Man 3(2013), Captain America: The Winter Soldier(2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron(2015) & Ant-Man(2015). When the Avengers cause another international incident, most of the governments of the world, think they should be held accountable for their actions. The United Nations comes up with the Sokovia Accords. According to the Accords, the American government is going to take control of the actions of the Avengers. Steve Rogers/Captain America(Chris Evans) is against it but, Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.) is for it. This causes a major confrontation between the two former allies. The rest of the Avengers, are obligated to choose sides. Meanwhile, Zemo(Daniel Bruhl) has his own nefarious plans.

Captain America: Civil War is an outstanding movie. Marvel has hit the jackpot, yet again. Directors Anthony & Joe Russo have made another masterpiece, after Captain America: The Winter Soldier(2014). In fact, this film surpasses the previous Captain America solo adventure. The future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is in good hands, with the Russo brothers. The visual effects are mind blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. The action is breathtaking. The airport set piece & the climax of the film, are some of its highlights. Before watching this movie, I was worried that Captain America would be sidelined in his own film, due to the presence of almost all the Avengers. I didn't have to bother. This still feels very much like Cap's solo adventure. Don't worry though. The rest of the Avengers like, Iron Man, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson), Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier(Sebastian Stan), Sam Wilson/Falcon(Anthony Mackie), Lieutenant James Rhodes/War Machine(Don Cheadle), Clint Barton/Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner), T'Challa/Black Panther(Chadwick Boseman), Vision(Paul Bettany), Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch(Elizabeth Olsen), Scott Lang/Ant-Man(Paul Rudd) & Peter Parker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), still get plenty of time to shine. This superhero showdown truly becomes flawless, due to its power packed performances. Chris Evans is spectacular as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Evans showcases different layers of emotions, both subtle & not so subtle, with panache. Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Downey Jr.'s supreme acting ability finally comes out, in his sixth portrayal of Iron Man. This is because, Stark showcases various emotions despite his trademark wit & sarcasm, this time around. Scarlett Johansson is superb as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Sebastian Stan is awe-inspiring as Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier. Anthony Mackie is awesome as Sam Wilson/Falcon. Don Cheadle is great as Lieutenant James Rhodes/War Machine. Jeremy Renner is effective as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. Chadwick Boseman is brilliant as T'Challa/Black Panther. Paul Bettany is excellent as Vision. Elizabeth Olsen is good as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch. Paul Rudd is hysterical as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. Tom Holland is amazing in his Marvel Cinematic Universe debut, as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. I am looking forward to Holland's solo Spidey movie. Daniel Bruhl is mind blowing as Zemo. Apart from Loki, he's the second most memorable Marvel Cinematic Universe villain. Emily VanCamp is great as Sharon Carter. Frank Grillo is effective as Brock Rumlow/Crossbones. William Hurt, Martin Freeman, Marisa Tomei, John Kani, John Slattery & Hope Davis are impressive in their small but significant roles as, Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, Everett K. Ross, May Parker, King T'Chaka, Howard Stark & Maria Stark, respectively. Captain America: Civil War is a must watch, for pretty much everyone. Whether you are a superhero movie buff, or not.",10
12 November 2021,Awesome !,"A great sequel of a great sequel ! I love the second movie and i thought that this one wouldn't be that good but i was wrong. The only one thing that i didn't like was the soundtrack, it was forgettable.

13 May 2016,Excellent Superhero movie!,"I was a little afraid going into Captain America: Civil War because many movies with a lot of strong characters tend to focus less on the story. I am ecstatic to said that this did not happen. Each opinion of the characters are shown and the story comes together nicely.

Now let's talk about the fight scenes and CGI. They were awesome! I think Black Widow had some the most intricate fight moves. Sure it was not actually Scarlett Johansson and probably her stunt double, I say this because her back is facing the camera most of the fight scenes. The CGI was so well done and the biggest CGI image is in the very beginning of the movie that involves Tony Stark. I don't want to spoil too much about it but it is very neat.

I had only one issue. The fight scenes while they were great they did go on for a while. I do not know if I was just tired that day but one fight scene I started nodding off. But like I said it may have to do more with me then the movie.

Better than the second Avenger movie, Captain America: Civil War is action packed and enjoyable for all ages.",9

29 March 2020,"It's ENTERTAINMENT allright. And it's good at that. Any bad? Yes, it lasts way too long and the storyline is disjointed. BUT it's still quite enjoyable...","It's blockbuster entertainment. And it sells well, because it IS ENTERTAINING. And entertaining is all it needs to be.

Any bad? Well, there are many storylines and many characters, which result in a somewhat disjointed, chaotic storyline. Could have been better with a more tight knit storyline and fewer characters. This story lasts too long as well, 2 and a half hour is simply TOO much for an action movie, in my humble opinion.

The good: it;s FUN. It's mindless, good fun. But it also has something few other action blockbuster have: it has great dialogues AND it has great actors. I didnt expect such great dialogues in an action blockbuster. And I am quite PLEASED with that.

This movie can be watched by adults as well. Even those adults who usually dont go see such action blockbusters. It isnt special or a must see, but you wont get annoyed or bored either, because (as I have said before), the characters and the dialogues make this into a grown up AND entertaining action blockbuster.",7
16 April 2016,Spectacular,"Once again, The Russo's have proved their prowess in making excellent superhero films. The story was magnificent! Each character had their own little arc for them to develop in, unlike in most movies, where too many characters means little development for other characters, but this movie pulled it off with grace! And let me say that airport scene, and any other action scene in this film, OH MY GOD! The choreography was spot on. Every fight has emotional depth. I can feel myself almost crying at some points. And SPIDERMAN! This Spiderman was the best Spiderman and the best Peter Parker I saw on screen to DATE! And Black Panther, I haven't forgot about him, he was great too! This movie is just so near perfect, it's unbelievable. And now let me address all those fanboys calling me and other reviewers Marvel biased fanboys for giving this movie a high score. IT DESERVES IT. This was a payoff of 8 years of hard work. It's everything Batman v Superman isn't.

So in concusion. It was Amazingly, Spectacularly Great. 10/10 would see, would see again, would buy, and would die for. Thank you Russo Brothers, for bringing my childhood fantasies to life.",10
29 April 2016,This film provides the breath of fresh air I needed,"Captain America: The Winter Solider pitted the titular protagonist against an organisation bigger then himself, all whilst battling his own demons, particularly his best friend-turned assassin, Bucky. Civil War at its core follows this narrative, exploring the relationship between these two characters even further. After numerous, wide-scaled and deadly incidents, the US Government, and now Secretary of State, 'Thunderbolt' Ross introduces the Sokovia Accord-which aims to prevent the heroes from acing freely but rather work in accordance to rules and regulations of the Untied Nations. In this regard, Civil War retains the political driven narrative and themes of The Winter Solider, but makes it more personal. The characters have different viewpoints and conflicting ideologies, causing them to split apart and form their own sides. Tony Stark for example feels guilty after a confrontation with a mother leads to him realising the cost of his actions; helping him realise that he shouldn't be allowed to act on his free will. Steve Rodgers believes ""that the safest hands are still our own"" and refuses to sign his name and adhere to the Sokovia Accords. The film perfectly sets up their conflicting beliefs, providing depth to the reasons they fight. We know these characters and their relationships with one another, both of which combine to make an interesting plot.

Now I have to address about one big talking point, the introduction of a new (yes a third!) Spiderman. And boy was it an introduction and a half! 19 year old Tom Holland perfectly portrays the characteristics of Spiderman we love; he is witty, inexperienced and most importantly, young. He is a breath of fresh air to this older team but also the character itself. The Amazing Spiderman trilogy nailed the chemistry between Peter and Gwen, but there was nothing special about those films that really stood out to me. I'm not going to lie, I was a bit hesitant at the casting of a younger Spiderman as well as the recent announcement of the title of the official film, 'Spiderman Homecoming', but seeing the way he was presented just got me so damn excited. There is no origin story for the character, but that's partly because its safe to assume that at this point, almost everyone knows his tragic upbringing and the way he gained his powers. He is a character who is fascinated by characters like Tony Stark and idealises him, we, the audience share his excitement. He seems identifiable, something Spiderman needs to be.

Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther is a straight-faced hero but a pure bad-ass. I really enjoyed his cat-like agility and ninja-esque fighting style. His agenda was clear too and he is a likable character, but more character development is needed, especially in terms of establishing the vastly different country, known as Wakanda, he comes from.

One issue I did have was the pacing. Now the film certainly makes the most of its two hours and seventeen minute run-time but I personally found the opening quarter to slow. Yes, it is broken up by sudden bursts of action, but for the most part it just felt too slow. I do have to stress that this was a personal opinion however.

Daniel Brühl's antagonist, Zemo, is nothing spectacular, but fits in with the theme of responsibility and vengeance. Civil War does a good job of blurring the line between good and bad, right and wrong. You can argue that Steve Rodgers is wrong, but that Tony Stark is right and vice versa-but one thing is abundantly clear, this film did not necessarily need Zeemo in any way.

I did enjoy the choice of locales, particularly with Germany featuring heavily, although perhaps slightly excessive and repetitively. The action was massive in scale and most definitely well choreographed. Speaking of which, the 15-minute IMAX fight was brilliant. It looked extremely cheesy as the two opposing sides sprinted (or flew) to each other in the trailer, but boy do the characters get their chance to shine. It just works, with the fight (the only exceptions being Hawkeye and Black Widow) being balanced. Spiderman just makes the scene however. This was hands down the best thing about the film for me.

Now I absolutely loved Batman V Superman (I am sorry for bringing this film up, but it is an important point!), but one thing lacking in the film was the depth to establish the characters agendas. In Civil War, we (speaking in terms of the general audience) understand why they are fighting each other and it makes sense. Sure, it does feel slightly rushed and forced, but the Russo Brothers have used this idea effectively. This was a vital strong and one reason why I felt this film was good. I think another special aspect of this film was that, despite my initial worries, it's not an Avengers film. Yes it features these beloved characters, but it is a story about two friends in the face of adversary, caught up in a world they don't belong in, but have inadvertently become so deeply involved in.",8
6 May 2016,'Marvel'ous!,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",8

27 December 2018,One of the best movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"Captain America: Civil War is a lot of fun. This film expertly juggles action, drama, humor and multiple character storylines in a way that almost makes you almost forget that this is the longest Marvel movie to date. The plot is compelling and the actors play well off of each other. The ending isn't as satisfying as I had hoped it would be, and you have to have seen at least Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Avengers: Age of Ultron to fully understand what is going on, but overall this is one of the best movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

14 March 2021,"It is good, but it is complex and it is important to pay attention to the story.","It was with pleasure that I saw this film from the cinematographic franchise ""Captain America"". It is a franchise that has given rise to increasingly extraordinary and visually ambitious films. The connection to the previous film, ""Winter Soldier"", is very present, but I confess that I was left with the feeling that it would have been better to see the ""Avengers"" franchise first, in order to better understand the film, and the relational mechanics of the characters. I remember, as I said in other reviews, that the world of comics is a maze that I do not dominate at all.

The plot revolves around a tense situation: after having made a lot of victims and material damage in their operations (finally, someone realized this), the Avengers were punished: they either subjected themselves to UN supervision or were considered outlaws. While the leader, Stark, accepts the impositions, Rogers sees them as an unfair limitation and bets on going his way, even if he breaks with his colleagues and, especially, Stark. At the same time, a subplot develops around Bucky Barnes, Rogers' childhood friend, and his mysterious past.

The script is complex and full of details, subplots and nuances that can escape our gaze if we are not attentive or do not know the Marvel universe reasonably. I felt that sometimes the development of the script didn't quite know which way to go or what ideas to develop, and that several characters appear because they really had to be there, if only for a couple of minutes. The central core of characters, however, receives a very good treatment and has time to develop. I thought it was a little strange to see Spider-Man among all these people. He looks a little out of place. And in a film so loaded with good and great heroes, I missed a truly charismatic villain who balanced things out a bit.

The cast is a real nest of stars: it is huge and full of notable names. Of course, the protagonist is Chris Evans, as Captain America. He is already fully acclimated to this character and knows perfectly what to do, and does his job flawlessly. Robert Downey Jr is the eternal Tony Stark, a character he was born to do and who does in an exceptional way. Scarlett Johansson and Sebastian Stan continue to be excellent, as they were in previous films. Paul Bettany seemed strangely robotic until I realized that he was really playing an android. Chadwick Boseman was excellent, serious and very focused. Elizabeth Olsen was fine, but not brilliant, and the same can be said of Emily VanCamp, in a relatively bland performance. Anthony Mackie showed up little and Don Cheadle just did what he really had to do.

Technically, it is a film worthy of Marvel and of the quality to which it has accustomed us: it is an extraordinary and stylish visual show, where every detail has been thought out in a meticulous way to increase the audience's visual and auditory experience. Cinematography is great and the filming work has been wonderfully accomplished. Visual, special effects and CGI work add sparkle, power and visual depth. The editing work was very well done, with precise cuts and great balance. The action scenes, especially the one at the airport, are good and will satisfy the appetite of Marvel fans. The sets and costumes were also very well done and look authentic. The soundtrack is quite good, but I didn't feel it was something that was really in the ear.",7
14 July 2022,Honestly don't think it could have been any better,"This movie just does such a great job of storybuilding, foreshadowing, and putting things into the perspective of all sides. I honestly don't think there's anything they could have done better.

27 December 2017,Cool action that did not make enough sense,"I complained that last year's Avengers movie felt burdened by the many subplots, characters and cliches. This ""super"" story was more focused, even though the whole gang showed up. It was about friendship and consequences. That works. Unfortunately, the two characters that most forced action (Stark and the villain) stopped making rational decisions eventually...also, when Spidey went away, so did the humor. So it was really good, but not great.

4 May 2016,Again I applaud Marvel,"4 May 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Captain America - Civil War. Imagine a really really bad Marvel Film and you're on the planet that it's farthest from. Another great instalment and yet again, possibly one of the best. This film had so much going on it kept your attention one hundred percent of the time. It's another story where superheroes are being pitted against each other and when I saw this in the trailers my heart sank, but I must say go with it, see where the story takes you, it's a Marvel!!!!! All our old favourites get airtime, and even a mention for those not joining us on this outing, and a couple of new ones join the mix, A great performance from Tom Holland.....Billy Elliott turns on his spidey senses. This was quite a serious film but there were still moments of frivolity, and people.....don't get up and walk out before the credits.......it is a Marvel production after all....just saying!!!

10 February 2022,Civil War...,"""Captain America: Civil War"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch the Avengers being divided after a conflict about a serious issue between Captain America and Iron Man. The Avengers are divided and the have to choose sides.

I found interesting this movie since it was entertaining and it contained plenty of action. The plot was simple but interesting because it contained plenty of information about some characters and their history, something that was connected very well with the present. The direction which was made by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo was very good and they both did an excellent job. The interpretations of both Robert Downey Jr. Who played as Tony Stark and Chris Evans who played as Steve Rogers were very good and their differences were presented equally good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Daniel Brühl's who played as Zemo, Tom Holland's who played as Peter Parker, Chadwick Boseman's who played as T'Challa and Paul Rudds' who played as Scott Lang. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Captain America: Civil War"" is a nice action movie and I recommend everyone and not only the fans of Marvel Cinematic Universe to watch it.",8
9 May 2016,Captain America's third outing a very good film,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character.

7 May 2016,Loved it- most entering film made for a while,"Civil war is one of the best Marvel Films made. It's just so entertaining. If you want to be entertained by awesome fight scenes, this is defiantly the film for you. If you want some sort of emotional impact along with awesome fight scenes and quick humour, Civil war should be the first film you see. It's interesting, emotional and awesome.

All the characters you already have met on the silver screen- Ironman, Captain America, Antman etc... are great. They are looked at from all perspectives- we see their flaws along with their powers. The new characters are a bit of a hit and a miss. Black Panther was my favourite character of the film, and was really nice to see him fight it out on the big screen. However, Spiderman was less of a spectacle. Tom Hollands version of Peter Parker is oddly irritating, and actually made me despise the character, just wishing he would leave the screen. The look of Spiderman was fine, but every time he spoke and said something utterly stupid, it made me want to shoot the screen. But besides Tom Hollands Spiderman, the rest of the characters are interesting and accurately portrayed.

The filmmaking skills displayed by Joe and Anthony Russo are brilliant. But don't expect anything too flashy as this is a blockbuster Hollywood film. But they certainly do their job well, and should be credited more for the films success then they have been. Ian Johnstons Captain America: The First Avenger was good, but it lacked an epic feel that the Russo brothers then gave to the Winter Soldier. Coming into civil war, we shouldn't have expected anything better then the Winter Soldier, but we did get better. The epic Russo vibe was clearly evident in this film, and for this 'vibe' alone, Civil War is the superior film to Batman VS Superman.

Personally, I don't see it as ""Marvel VS DC"". I see them all as just comic book movies, even though I'm more inclined to enjoy DC films then Marvel. I loved Dawn of Justice, but Civil War tops it. It has more well constructed action sequences, and compared to Dawn of Justice, we love both of the heroes clashing(Ironman and Captain America) as they both have reasonable heroic reasons for their actions, compared to Supermans selfish, almost villainous ones. But having said this, both films are brilliant, and great in different aspects.

Overall, Civil War is an amazing film, and quite possibly the most entertaining film of 2016, and one of the greatest marvel films ever made.",6
24 January 2022,Team Iron Man or Team Cap?,"This movie is the first movie in the MCU i would consider a masterpiece. It checked all my boxes. The conflict between Tony and Steve is not only interesting, but very smart. The whole movie and all of the motivations are driven by the very core of that conflict. Tony feels guilty, that his actions led to an innocent kid dying. Steve understands that, but also doesn't want to be under full control of the government. They both have a very good point and their actions are always understandable, reasonable and human. Plus, this movie gave us the first Spider-Man and Black Panther appearance. The fight scenes were so well choreographed and edited, I loved it. Zemo was a great villain in this film, one of the best villains of the whole MCU. Simply because he was able to do so much damage, even without being a villain who has crazy powers. He was just a dude with motivation, which is enough. Overall, this is one of the best MCU movies ever made and I absolutely love it.

13 April 2016,Marvel Does it Again!!,"I was one of the few fortunate people who got to watch this early. This movie was everything i hoped Civil War to be. It was funny, got you emotionally involved and Action Packed. Yes! the action is done brilliantly. The best I've ever seen in a comic book movie. Maybe one of the best in movies in general. This movie is not your average comic book good vs evil movie. It's much of a clash between ideologies which was really interesting to see. I also have to talk about how Spiderman was portrayed in this movie. I really liked him. As expected he was not the focus of the movie. However, he was not just a cameo either. The few scenes he was in the movie was enough to like him. If i have to point out flaws there is hardly any. Marvel is almost perfect. Almost. I do have one problem with the movie. It was the main villain. Like other marvel villain, this villain just didn't work for me. The movie would have done fine even without the villain. It feels like he was just there because ...he was just there!. But it's not a deal breaker people!! The story isn't about the villain. It's about Civil War. And you're gonna get it.. I can't recommend this movie enough. Believe me guys, the 1 star reviews are all from Marvel haters. They just can't accept the fact that Civil War was a great move. Most of those reviewers probably haven't even watched the movie. Ignore the haters and watch the movie. You won't be disapppointed.",9
6 December 2021,Civil War Is Upon Us!,"Captain America is a great hero in the Marvel Universe. I really enjoyed Civil War as i enjoyed the comics on this very story, it's interesting to see what comparison both behold. The war between Stark & Rogers is brewing and they executed this in the most entertaining yet exhilarating way they possibly could have. I'm a massive Marvel fan so you can trust me when i say this is really cool.

One of the best team up movie's I've seen in a long long time, i did watch this when it came out but i felt a review is in order. Highly recommend this title, it truly is mindblowing!

6 May 2016,Polished...,"I'm not sure how to describe this film, because it stands on it's own. The motion is excellent and the CGI is visually undetectable. Some scenes had me gawking in awe and wondering...Mind you, this was an Extreme 3D theatre and it's hard to go back now.

Can't really pick out any negatives. There were many great moments on a great story, superb cast and ""Polished"" movie! It almost breaks my heart knowing what's to come...Kudos to any production element that were a big part in making everything look the way it did. I'm still trying to believe what Stark I was seeing...That was awesome! Enjoy this one, I did!

13 May 2016,Very powerful superhero film,"Captain America: Civil America is such a strong powerful marvel superhero movie! The acting is great from the entire cast, including Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Sebastian Stan. I loved this film also for the extended superbly done action sequences. The action/violence is done just right for a marvel movie. The writing is very well done too, it's got it's comedic moments that are truly funny and delivered well by the actors. The stunts are great and the special effects/visuals are very well put together. I liked the younger new teenage Spider-Man here, i thought he did well with his role. You will not be bored for one second all throughout this film, never a dull moment. That is the duty of a hero movie after all, is to entertain with action, and to create good characters with depth. Civil War did all of those things very well, it wasn't perfection, but it came pretty damn close. The different characters come together so well, and their chemistry is spot on. I was genuinely happy with this entry in the marvel hero franchise, the director made all the right decisions. I give Captain America a 9 out of 10.

8 April 2023,The third entry in the Captain America series starts off with a bang giving us the level expected of an Avengers movie while still focused on its core character,"During an Avengers mission headed by Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) in Lagos to stop theft of a biological agent by a team of mercenaries headed by former SHIELD agent Rumlow (Frank Grillo), the team manage to stop the theft of the biological agent but are unable to contain the collateral damage unleashed when Rumlow activates a suicide bomb which Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) tries in vain to contain. With public pressure mounting for some level of oversight over the Avengers, Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) tells the team in response to events in New York, Washington D. C., Sokovia, and now Lagos the United Nations has drafted the Sokovia Accords which would make the Avengers accountable to a body within the United Nations who would authorize the Avengers to action when and if they are needed. This leaves the Avengers split on the issue with Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) on board with the Accords following the events of the Ultron incident in Sokovia while Steve Rogers says it is short sided to put control in the hands of politicians who have their own agendas and interest that could dictate who they're allowed to help. At the signing ceremony in Vienna, Austria a bomb is detonated killing King T'Chaka (John Kani) of the African nation of Wakanda. Footage of the incident seems to point to James ""Bucky"" Barnes/The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) as the bomber, and when Captain America investigates by getting to Bucky first who claims he didn't do it, Captain America finds himself a fugitive hunted by both the authorities and certain Avengers as Captain America and his allied Avengers try to keep Bucky alive to learn the truth.

Captain America: Civil War is the third entry in the Captain America series as well as the inaugural film of the third phase of the MCU. Prior to the release of Captain America: The Winder Soldier, Marvel had already signed directors Anthony and Joe Russo back as directors with Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely returning as writers due to impressive test screenings for the film, and with the massive success of The Winter Soldier Marvel's faith in the team certainly paid off. While initially planned primarily to continue on with the story setup in The Winter Soldier, the focus of the film began to expand with Robert Downey Jr. Entering negotiations to reprise his role as Tony Stark/Iron Man in order to adapt the Marvel event series Civil War (albeit greatly changed and improved from the Mark Millar penned series). As with the previous Captain America film, Civil War opened to massive acclaim and continued to build off the box office success of its predecessor grossing $1.15 billion against a $250 million budget. Captain America: Civil War not only works as a climax to a Captain America trilogy, but it's also a much more satisfying Avengers movie than Age of Ultron.

The movie does a good job of setting up a wedge issue between Iron Man's side and Captain America's side with each character's stance on the issue of the Sokovia Accords feeling like a natural place for each character given the events of their respective film series and character arcs that have lead them to this point (with even Age of Ultron put to good use despite that movie being mediocre in my opinion). The movie keeps the best aspects of the Civil War storyline while also jettisoning the weaker elements of that comic (which are many but too numerous to go into) and this is probably one of the best examples of how sometimes not doing a 1:1 translation of a previously existing work can be beneficial to the end result.

The movie juggles many characters and subplots to the point that with the exception of Thor and Hulk, this is basically an Avengers movie in all but name. But despite having a large roster of characters and also introducing new ones such as Black Panther and Spider-Man the movie still feels like it's balancing all these aspects while still anchored to Captain America as the focal point of the movie especially since his best friend Bucky is at the center of the conflict. Robert Downey Jr.'s take on Iron Man this time around is considerably less glib and has a darker take on the character this time around stemming from all the events leading up to this point, and in terms of execution it feels like it takes lessons learned from Iron Man 3 and builds upon them to the point where Tony still feels like himself but with a considerably harder edge than how we knew him in the stand alone films. Tom Holland and the gone too soon Chadwick Boseman get solid introductions as Spider-Man and Black Panther respectively, although I will say that Spider-Man's inclusion in terms of story feel like maybe it's slightly forced in comparison to Black Panther who has a vested interest in the events due to avenging his father.

The movie delivers on all the scale and spectacle you'd expect out of a premise like Civil War and while Joss Whedon stated his intent with Age of Ultron was to deliver ""The Empire Strikes Back of the MCU"", Civil War actually feels like a case where the stakes have been raised as the threat doesn't come from interchangeable robot drones and the fact that these are characters we've come to know and love now at odds makes us more invested in the outcome. By the time the movie was over I felt exhilarated, but also as if there would be lasting repercussions that these characters wouldn't easily come back from.

I really enjoyed Civil War and in terms of introducing the third phase of the MCU you couldn't have asked for a better way to get your audience sucked in. The movie continues the strong writing and direction of The Winter Soldier, and with the expanded scope the Russo Brothers show why they deservedly helmed the next Avengers films.",9
28 April 2016,Marvel has been Cemented as the Super Hero Studio!!,"You can not get a better Super Hero movie then this!! First of, let me be clear. I was looked forward to Batman V Superman more then i was to this. Avengers 2 killed the excitement i had for this. but after seeing it on the opening night I can clearly appreciate everything Marvel does.

This film focuses on balancing the act between all of its Super Heroes, which is a far greater number then DC has, and it does it perfectly. You never feel that one character has more screen time then another, even though you see Captain America all the time, you still feel the presence of other super heroes. It's not like they appear out of no where and you go ""Hmm, wonder where they were for the whole film?""

The story is pretty great too, the whole situations is similar to what was portrayed in BvS but just done with much better style.

The fight scenes never got boring for me. This is really important, because as a critic and a movie fan I feel that sometimes feel can take the easy route and that is once they come up with 3 or 4 cool fight scenes they will just re use them, but just shoot them with different angles. It was all different here.

This film works on every level. Spider-man does a perfect job of being the comic relief as does Ant-man and even Falcon has more then a few catchy remarks to other heroes. Iron-man is as always brilliantly sarcastic and full of himself.

The drama that Captain America creates is felt through the whole film and is quite good. Black Widow and Black Panther add more tension and help the drama play out through the entirety of the film, which is brilliant as it gives the film it's heart.

Like i wrote in the beginning. This is what films should strive to be. Especially DC movies, if they want any chance of catching up to Marvel Universe.",10
6 May 2016,Best Pound-for-Pound Superhero vs Superhero fight scenes,"No spoilers here.

I thought this was so much better than Batman vs Superman. The storyline was clean-cut, and it was weaved well to introduce the new superhero characters that were not part of the Avengers. Captain America and Iron Man did a great job as being on opposite teams and also in recruiting more members into the Avenger universe. The fight scenes were well executed and I like how the stuns work between all the superhero interaction.

Now, like any other Marvel movie, there's always a scene after the screen credits roll, so watch for that as always.

7 May 2016,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly","What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",8
17 March 2022,Solid Social Commentary in a Popcorn Film,"This is a movie that I saw in the theater originally. I caught up with all the Marvel movies to that point as this excited me. I knew a bit about the story in the comics and the idea of bringing that to the big screen intrigued me. Jaime and I watched this as we worked toward Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame.

What I've realized in revisiting these movies, Captain America's storylines intrigue me more than some characters. I wasn't even excited when the first one came out, but it has come around for me. I don't necessarily love him as a character. What they do with the social commentary is what gets me.

For this movie, the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron has the world wanting the Avengers to have checks and balances. In this case, they want the United Nations to oversee when they're called into action. Currently, they're too powerful and can do whatever they want without repercussion. What complicates things here is the Winter Soldier references and he's accused of a terrorist attack. Captain America tries to protect him. Iron Man feels bad for what he did and wants to make amends by siding with the government. Winter Soldier has done some bad things, but there's a new villain, Zemo, who is framing him as well.

This movie plays an Avengers movie. We have Black Widow, Falcon, War Machine, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man and Vision all back. We also get introduced to Black Panther and Spider-Man who will have movies in this phase. We also get some great character actors like Frank Grillo, William Hurt and Martin Freeman. The acting here is stacked for sure.

Once again, I love the real government implications here. There is a feeling that movie is calling out America for things that we do and I'm for it. This is a still a popcorn movie with good effects. Some of the CGI doesn't work, but not enough to ruin this. This movie has a bit darker feel as well. It didn't hold up as well after my first viewing, but I did enjoy this and where it takes us from here.

My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",8

6 May 2016,A Stunning Masterpiece of Marvel..,"This film is simply exceptional in every way. The edge it has is delivering the best, grittiest action the genre has ever scene and characters that are as complex as the are fun. Why do I say that? Well... It's Marvelous. I loved Marvel movies very much. I thought it was smart and the impressive cast really delivered! I really appreciate the Russo brothers for making a fantastic film for the audience and the Directors carrier also.

The action and fight scenes in the movie are just awesome and there is plenty of action to keep you entertained throughout the entire movie. There is also enough humour to balance all this. The CGI and Visual effects are awesome.

The characters like Chris Evans, Robert Downey, Sebastian Stan etc are fantastically delivered their part very well. Every character fit right and at no point did the movie feel crammed with superheroes. In my opinion, the two heroes that stole the show was Spider-Man and black panther. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is quite amazing no word to say and I am eagerly waiting for the Black Panther movie release.

The movie got a awesome climax also. So guys, go for this movie.... You'll love it. It is a perfect start of summer blockbuster and one of the best movies of the year without doubt..",10
5 May 2016,A Brilliantly Refreshing Place to Take the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"Now that is how you make a superhero film. After 12 films, it seemed unlikely the Marvel universe could create something so refreshing and new, but Civil War does just that. It's impeccably paced, exhilarating, heartbreaking, and just outright fun. Captain America Civil War is one of the greatest superhero films to be put to the big screen.

Civil War sees the return of most of the usual suspects from the Marvel films, with the exception of Thor and Hulk, and sets the universe in a new direction while also honoring what came before it. The Captain America 'trilogy' should be considered the most unique trilogy of all time. Although, for all intents and purposes, this film is essentially Avengers 3. Yes, the story is always focused on Cap and Bucky, but it is just as much a Marvel Universe film as a story about two best friends from Brooklyn.

The Russo Brothers are thankfully back after Winter Soldier and they pulled off the impossible with Civil War. There are so many characters, plot-lines, and things that need to be set up, and it's handled wonderfully. But they also direct action maybe better than anyone in Hollywood right now. Much like Winter Soldier, the action in Civil War always hits at just the right time. The airport scene will go down as one of the greatest superhero fight sequences of all time.

Newcomers Black Panther and Spider-Man were brought along and implanted seamlessly. Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland play the two characters brilliantly and instantly get me excited to see their solo films within the next few years.

Each character gets their time to shine. Scarlet Witch is fully realized and Ant-Man, Falcon, and Vision bring the witty Marvel one- liners that they have become known for. As much as this film is deeply rooted in psychological emotion and tough character choices, it still retains the humor that keeps the film from ever reaching grim areas. It really puts to question, how much better can superhero films get?

I haven't even mention Hawkeye, Black Widow, or Bucky/Winter Soldier who all get incredible moments. Does anybody not have confidence that the Russo brothers can balance 60 something characters in Infinity War in a few years? Overall, the Marvel Universe and superhero films in general, have a new level of greatness to live up to. Perhaps more time will give me perspective, but for now, Civil War is my new favorite Marvel film.

+You understand both sides of the coin

+That Airport scene

+Builds on what came before, and sends the universe in a refreshing direction

+Still a focus on Cap and Bucky

+Black Panther and Spider-Man steal the show

+Maintains the fun tone amidst an immensely emotion film.

2 May 2016,"Words can't describe my love for this film so, in one word, just like Spider-Man: Amazing!","8 years ago, some of the greatest characters in comic history had a whole new world opened up to them thanks to 2008's Iron Man. Nobody thought the film would have the impact it did, including me. Now we are in 2016 and we have reached Captain America: Civil War. It boasts the most characters in a Marvel film, the best film in the entire Marvel franchise and also the greatest action scene in any superhero movie ever, but we will get onto that later.

So the film serves as not only a new Avengers story but also a solid sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It would be easy to make a film with so many characters sideline the Captain America story, but this film really is at it's core a Captain America film. Sure there is a lot to cram in but it is done so well and fits in so well as part of a trilogy. I saw this film as a midnight screening and saw it along with the other two films beforehand. It really is a good idea to watch both Captain America films before and notice the detail put in to incorporate these stories. Cap is my all time favourite Avenger and seeing the development all three of these films has give him really is amazing.

The basic plot without spoilers involves the Avengers causing a huge disaster on a mission in Lagos which results in the government devising the Sokovia accords which they must sign in order to operate under them. Tony Stark feels guilty about the casualties and destruction but Steve Rogers wants to keep operating freely and saving the world. This results in a divide between them and the other Avengers are forced to decide who's side they are on. Whilst this is happening Cap and Falcon are still on the hunt for Bucky Barnes which does play in to the start of the Civil War but i will leave it at that. So already there is a lot going on and we also get the introduction of Spider-Man and Black Panther as well as Daniel Brul as villain Baron Zemo. It would be easy to make this film a complete mess like Batman v Superman but it was not. It is hard not to compare the films because they are quite similar, involving destruction etc. But this film does it so much better.

The airport scene in this film where the two teams fight for the first time is perfect. Tom Holland's introduction as Spider-Man happens just before this and his personality even when fighting is perfectly nailed. Black Panther also feels the same way, just the way these characters are on the big screen is a dream come true. Seeing Ant Man (who is awesome by the way) interact with Vision and Spiderman interact with Ant Man and Black Panther interact with Captain America etc. It is perfect. I also have seen the film and still don't know which side i am on. You want to be with both Steve and Tony on this because they are both right and have valid points. But seeing the personalities of every character clash and play in to every scene they are in is just brilliant. The villain of the film, Zemo, is average at best though which is the only small gripe. Crossbones as well barely has any screen time, but Zemo's plan almost seems like something that the teams could have fought over themselves.

At 2 hours 20 mins there is a lot to cram in but in the end as a Marvel film this one is the best by far. It is emotional, hilarious and most importantly awesome. I cannot recommend the film enough. I have seen it twice already and that won't be the last time. Films don't get much better than this.",10
8 May 2016,OK Film,"Captain America: Civil War is not bad, but certainly overrated.

It has several flaws and issues, few of them are: 1. Too much of shaky camera view. Why many action films want to be another Jason Bourne movie?

2. Is Zemo the villain a prophet? How does he estimate the arrival of Ironman and prepare a video for him?

3. Non-stop changes of establishing shots, especially the different country shots. Are they trying to sell tourism?

4. The cause of conflict is ambiguous

5. Why does the mastermind Zemo has to kill all other winter soldiers instead of making good use of them to fight Captain America? So what's the point to trap the superheroes in the secret base? If Ironman never arrived, what could he do as a non- superhero (so he must be a prophet)? Mastermind, seriously?

6. Common sense issue. If you want to kill the people at the state of hibernation, what you need to do is not to disturb them or kill them any other time. So Zemo the prophet has been spending so much time and effort to plan just to kill hibernated people and then commit suicide? Seriously....

7. If Ironman never arrived, how does this Zemo fight against Captain America? What's his plan B? Clearly he must be a prophet....

8. Another common sense issue. Enemy of your enemy can become your friend, what you got to do is to use brain. So what's the point to kill those hibernated winter soldiers? When you are killing the enemy of your enemy, you are helping your enemy. Mastermind huh....

8. The quick changes of personality (or you can say ""character development"") for few characters are not making sense 9. The airport fighting sequel is fun to watch, but not epic or even realistic. Why? The main issue of Marvel films is they tend to avoid any violent shot which make the superhero fight look like kids' fights and unreal; in addition, when the cause of conflict is ambiguous, it is hard to establish epic fight scene. Why the fight sequel in Return of The King and Mad Max are great? Established motivation (do or die) and realism (blood were shed, any character could be killed)

The best Marvel movie so far is none other than The Guardians of Galaxy; the best superhero movie to date? The Dark Knight.",1
29 April 2016,Very entertaining,"First of all, this movie is directed brilliantly, the Russo brothers do a fantastic job and translating the comic into a very entertaining movie. The writing is fantastic, and the actors, with Downey being the highlight, and the movie makes you switch between both sides, and makes it difficult to decide on which team to stand with.

Now Tom as Spider-Man, is the best choice the Marvel Movies have made since Downey as Stark. He is fantastic here, despite his limited screen time. He really shines as the web-slinger, and his comedic performance does not seem forced, and it ends making you hungry to see more of him. The other characters are also very entertaining to see, and there is not one dull moment with them, and their chemistry is fantastic, one of the major things that keep this movie on its feet.

The best thing about Civil War, is the action, this is some of the best action I have seen in a movie in a long time. There is some shaky cam in some parts, however it can make some of it hard to make out, but also very effective.

Now for the bad stuff, first, the runtime. It can seem very long at times, with some scenes added feel shoehorned in there, to make the movie a little longer. But the worst aspect is by far the CGI. I know - all the other marvel movies have had decent special effects, but this one, not so much. Some scenes look OK at best, but other times, specifically the Black Panther, you can tell how fake he is. The leaping, the explosions, and even some of the powers look so bad. Robert's CGI head is also very noticeable on his Iron Man suit without his helmet, and it distracts every time you see him like this. The green screen effects are also very bad, and you can see it's fake from a mile off.

Other than that, there is nothing else bad about this movie. It is better than most Marvel movies, behind only Guardians of the Galaxy.

29 April 2018,Bad.,"Only watched it because I just watched Doctor Strange and that film was ok. Well, this one is pretty bad. Not a single fight in this makes sense. I honestly have no idea why this movie was even produced. Was really boring, too. But damn, the fights... People are switching sides the entire time, extremely confusing especially because there was no reason to fight. And then, when they fought, it just felt like a showcase of special moves. Some of the avengers don't want to be avengers anymore because they've caused too much destruction? Sure, let's fight the rest of the avengers who don't agree with us and cause a ton of destruction. Wasn't even fun, but not dark either, just confusing and pretty ludicrous.

5 May 2016,"Funny, Smart, and Great Character Development","Captain America: Civil War is in my opinion the best Marvel Studios film to date, I do not say that lightly. I loved Captain America: The Winter Soldier and The Avengers, but Civil War does everything that Marvel has needed to do for a while. Civil War is perfectly written, crafted with care and heart, and feature brilliant character development. All things considered Civil War is a feat, because it finally shows that Marvel is willing to take some risks, all the while remaining true to what has made their films so enjoyable.

When looking at Civil War, in specific the story, it's almost perfect. The story serves as a culmination of all the events that have occurred in the ever expanding marvel cinematic universe. The great thing about this film is it's the first comic book film to intelligently address the issue of how do people respond to the seemingly endless carnage created by the main characters. Such a simple idea is perfectly applied create a thought provoking movie where every action has a repercussion.

The brilliance of this film can't be understated, because the politics within the film are fictional, but feel realistic, and are dominated by shades of grey. The film finds a way to be more brave than any of the previous marvel films by taking risks and attacking deep issues, but keeps the iconic sense of humor marvel has become known for. It should be noted that the film's not dark or anything, but it does attack complex themes, and conveys a surprising amount of emotional depth for a summer blockbuster. When you consider the density of the story and the amount of characters featured it's amazing that the film worked as well as it did.

That brings me to what I consider the most impressive element of the entire film, the character development. It's difficult to have a film with as many characters as this film has, and make every character feel well developed, but this film does that, more so it makes you feel for characters who are brawling with each other. The acting was one reason the characters feel so well developed as the actors brought small nuances that sold the characters that much more, and while Chris Evans is great in this film the real superstar is Robert Downey Jr., who brings so many emotions to his performance in this film. This is in my opinion the best portrayal of Iron Man since his original film, but the irony is that the show stealer is Spider-Man who marvel nailed.

For those who enjoy films that are funny, touching, action-packed, or just good stories this film won't disappoint. This film is what Batman v. Superman should have been, however is even more impressive because the film finds a way to juggle so many different tasks, and does it well. Captain America: Civil War is one of those great films that everybody can watch and enjoy for different reasons. If you like movies of this genre, check Civil War out because it's one of the best in recent memory.",9

25 May 2016,Solid rather than spectacular,"I've never been one of those people who live and breathe Avengers. Have to admit that Captain America has always been one of my favourite super heroes due to the fact that he's the most normal avenger. Most people know somebody who could hold their own in a battle with Captain America.

The movie title gives away the fact that this is going to be Avenger vs Avenger, so rather feared for Captain America. Anyway no real surprise that plot plays a secondary role in the movie to wise cracks and fight scenes. I found the movie entertaining if a little confusing at times. My guess is that the editing removed quite a bit of dialogue and no action sequences. Those people who do love the Avengers franchise will surely be thrilled with the movie though.

6 May 2016,Captain America: Civil War,"With the excess of superhero movies coming out these days, I wish they were all as complex and thought provoking as this one. When I say this is the best superhero movies since ""The Dark Knight"" I mean that, and it's undoubtedly the best of the Marvel movies. This is because of genuinely interesting, believable, and flawed characters that all have understandable motives. Now if you're like me and, during climactic superhero scenes like the one in the avengers, always wonder ""What about the people in those buildings the 'heroes' are smashing up? Aren't they killing thousands of people right now?"", then you will love this movie from the get go. Because in this film, the heroes begin to start facing the consequences of the actions, and start to feel genuine guilt for what they've done, besides Captain America, who seems to believe that he needed to sacrifice these people for the greater good of others. Seriously, while in almost all superhero movies there is a clear good guy and bad guy, in this one I genuinely couldn't decide who was good or bad. Even the man who at first seems like the stereotypical bad guy is revealed to have much more behind him. He will make you realize that that some of our so called ""heroes"" aren't much better than what seems at first to be a stereotypical villain. The morality is grayer than most action movies of the past 20 years.

Its not only got great writing, but its got the great action we've seen in the last Captain America film, but cranked up to 11. There are many great action scenes in this film, but the ones that stick out the most are the car chase scene, and of course, the big fight between Captain America and his gang, and Iron Man and his gang. The latter is a fantastic scene, all of the superheros using there specific powers against each other, while occasionally another would chime in to help someone else out in a fight, and so on and so on. But it's handled with such grace that it never becomes excessive or confusing. All of the camera movements and cuts make it easy to understand what is happening while also handling all this action and all of these superheros at once, going from one battle to the next, and yet they still find time to put genuinely hilarious moments in all of this. It's incredibly impressive, and these great action scenes are already on top of the great writing. Possibly the only part of the film that I felt was unnecessary was the romance between Steve Rogers and Kate, and that is a minor complaint considering how little that portion of the movie is.

It's an ensemble character driven film like ""Boogie Nights"", mixed with the usual humor of a marvel movie with action from ""The Bourne Supremacy"" but with superheros, but also with the moral complexity of ""The Dark Knight"" (although just not really as good as ""The Dark Knight"" or ""Boogie Nights""). And if that's not a recommendation, then I don't know what is.",7

8 May 2016,Amazing superhero flick,"Captain America:Civil War is an excellent superhero flick,with a nice story and awesome action sequences with a powerful editing.

Story:

With many people fearing the actions of super heroes, the government decides to push for the Anti-Hero Registration Act, a law that limits a heroes actions. This results in a division in The Avengers. Iron Man stands with this Act, claiming that their actions must be kept in check otherwise cities will continue to be destroyed, but Captain America feels that saving the world is daring enough and that they cannot rely on the government to protect the world. This escalates into an all- out war between Team Iron Man and Team Captain America while a new villain emerges.

The movie has several entertaining moments and not a single dull moment,which keeps you intrigued throughout the entire movie.

The direction is excellent.

The screenplay is water-tight.

The editing is powerful.

The action sequences was just awesome.

Performances:

Though the movie relies heavily on the shoulders of Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr.,but th the scene-stealer here is Tom Holland,whose portrayal as Peter Parker gives a new yet entertaining image to Spiderman.He is truly wonderful.Chris Evans is excellent,while Robert Downey Jr. is efficient.

Overall Captain America:Civil War is an excellent treat for all superhero flick fans.A Sure-Shot Blockbuster.",
13 April 2017,"Does not work as a film, only as a hub of the MCU's narrative","Captain America 3 is more like Avengers 2.5, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe becomes truly a running narrative because of it

Steve Rogers, leading the Avengers, continues to cause chaos across the world in a noble cause to stop terrorism, but powers that be have had enough. Spearheaded by Tony Stark, a new initiative is set up to keep heroes in check so no more innocent lives are lost in the crossfire. But this causes further strife between the two men as Rogers tracks down his brainwashed friend Bucky Barnes, who is still being used as the assassin Winter Soldier by shadowy forces

After Captain America: The Winter Soldier whipped up audiences and critics alike into a state of euphoria, Civil War has a lot to live up to. So is it surprising that the sequel falls a little short? Winter Soldier was a welcome change of pace and a change of tone, bringing the character into the modern world with a sense of urgency and political clout. Civil War by comparison is one part thriller and another part playset romp where all fifteen action figures are hurled about. When everything is said and done, and the dust settles, Civil War felt alarmingly vacuous.

We have seen Marvel heroes fighting each other before, we've seen it a lot. Ever since Thor's hammer struck Cap's shield in Avengers Assemble, the franchise has indulged in the clashing and harmony of super powers. Civil War isn't driven by a theme or even a tone, in fact the only theme is quite literally ""heroes get to fight each other"", and there's a certain vagueness around motivations and morals of characters. Did Stark really just hire a high school student to go to war?? Did Falcon really know how to find Scott Lang? Did Hawkeye just come out of retirement? Why? Did Bucky really just fall back into the amnesia assassin story again?

But having a theme about fighting isn't always bad. Hell no! The airport fight that the trailer teases, is so much fun. It had me laughing aloud in giddy, childish enthusiasm. Here we have ten superheroes from across the last two phases of the MCU punching each others lights out, but the star of the scene is Marvel's own interpretation of Spider-man. When the fight starts with Spidey asking Stark: ""So what do I do now Mr Stark?"" you know things are going to get ridiculously fun. If it weren't for this particular battle, Civil War would have been a colossal downer both in tone and execution.

As great as Spider-man is in this fight, and as interesting as newcomer Black Panther is, both men feel shoehorned into the film. Peter Parker's introduction (as good as it is) virtually stalls the movie! It genuinely feels tacked on, perhaps due to Sony eventually giving up the rights to the character during Civil War's initial production phase, likely pushing Black Panther's screen time to accommodate the web slinger. The battle sequence that opens the film between Avengers and Crossbones (alias of a bit part player in Winter Soldier, who no one will remember, nor need to remember) has some of the worst shaky cam in recent memory. Not sure how critics are ignoring this. While a highway chase later on, which is a foot race, looks laughably fake.

Ultimately, if you are keeping up with the Marvel movie narrative you will take more from this movie. Personally, I am putting my foot down to say that this continuous narrative device is getting tiresome. Civil War does not work as a singular film, it works as a hub connecting multiple movies from the past as well as numerous future projects together, but that isn't what I am looking for in a film.

It is a fun movie (the dialogue is just as snappy as always) and it proves that the Russo Brothers can direct something as massive as the upcoming Marvel's Infinity War two parter with confidence. But it didn't feel like there was enough at stake, especially when everything is said and done; the ending felt really anticlimactic. It is a poor follow on from the concise Winter Soldier, but is perhaps the best Avengers film since 2012's Assemble.",6
24 February 2022,One of the best Marvel movies,"Captain America Civil War is a truly incredible film, it tests the limits of what the MCU had and went all out, it takes the characters to dark places and has truly amazing character conflicts, you understood where every characters was coming from, the motivations were clear and it did a fantastic job introducing new characters to the MCU.

The action sequences are some of the best in cinematic history, along with a jaw dropping twist and one of the best MCU endings, it's even colder than Winter Soldier.

Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, and Paul Rudd knocked it out of the park, they were truly great and the airport battle is absorbing to this day, this is a truly sad and touching film.

The characterization for Iron Man and Cap is phenomenal and the conflict is extremely understandable, the reveal in this movie is sad and scary at the same time as we see what Iron Man is truly capable of, and the stakes are some of the highest in the Captain America trilogy.

This movie also has one of the most clever and scariest MCU villains, every motivation of his was clear and the actor did a fantastic job.

This is the only MCU trilogy besides Thor that gets better with every installment which I didn't expect, since Iron Man 2 was mid and Iron Man 3 was trash.

Captain America: Civil War is one of the best Marvel movies to date, and I'm gonna give it an A+",10
18 April 2016,Captain America V Iron Man: it's extremely well realized and proves to be entertainment at it's best.,"Captain America Civil War

Marvel knows how to please audiences and after seeing how Warner Bros. largely failed to please the general public with Batman and Superman's first big-screen debut together, audiences are going to question if with Civil War, (which is essentially ""Captain America v Iron Man"") will it really be worth investing time and money into another hero-on-hero mega-budget superhero flick.

Well, this is Marvel's answer to DC's failed attempt, and they know these characters, we've seen most of them around in a few movies now over the past 8 years or so, (some of them more recent and some of them for the first time in this film's cinematic universe). And I truly believe the film is a triumph. Unlike the last Avengers film, there are not really any subplots that don't serve as an important piece to the overall story, directors Joe and Anthony Russo did a great job weaving action scene and character-driven scene together to drive the story forward in 2014's Captain America the Winter Soldier, and they do the same here. What makes this even more impressive is that they are handling roughly twice the amount of characters than what Winter Soldier had, but they do it as near-perfect as you could expect from a big-budget, studio-produced blockbuster these days. Though it had it's strong aspects, Star Wars the Force Awakens was a big money maker for Disney, but as a film, it left much to be desired. This film surprised and impressed me, more than any big budget film in the past 12 months save for Mad Max. It was better than Ant-man. Better than Age of Ultron. It was better than Furious 7, Jurassic World, Force Awakens, Batman v Superman and even Jungle Book which I also was impressed with. The film doesn't take any huge risks and does play it fairly safe to being what we've come to expect from Marvel, but it knows what the formula for success at Marvel is and it works with it. It knows how to still be impressive and wholly satisfying while still playing things fairly safe. Marvel, they takes risks with certain movies, and being that this is called ""Civil War"" which is based on a Marvel comic where major characters DO die, the movie doesn't quite follow that and is really more like a ""Civil Dispute"".

And then there are moments where Tony is acting like he and Steve used to be friends even though earlier in the film he explains to Cap how his father always talked highly about him to Tony and that he just wanted to punch him in his perfect teeth. There are moments where this built-up rage shines through Downey Jr's performance as Stark, after he finds out a truth regarding his parents, that shows Robert actually put a lot of care into this character, more than we've ever seen from him since Iron Man 1. Lately it has felt like he's been phoning in his performances, but not here. Here he really acts the hell out of what the script asks of him, and counter's Chris Evans' strongest performance of Captain America to date, too.

Lots of other big players here, Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johansson, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Sebastian Stan, Paul Rudd, Anthony Mackie, and Daniel Bruhl gives a strong performance as a villain character who isn't given the most fleshing out or devotion to, but he serves the story well enough and it will be interesting to see if he gets any future roles down the line.

If you're a fan of Spiderman, well the studio finally worked a deal out with Sony that allows them to use Spiderman in their shared cinematic universe and he is a very well introduced character played by young actor Tom Holland who probably does the best job as this character we have seen on screen yet, he fits in very well and plays off the other actors very well and proves to be quite a visual spectacle in the film's second act. He gets his own film next year and I look forward to seeing how it turns out, as this film introduced the character properly, and you could tell the directors had a full understanding of what makes this character so great. Overall, if you're looking for a superhero universe to stay committed to and always have faith in, I'd say just stick with Marvel because they know what they're doing and everything are building up to is unlikely to disappoint given the rate they are going now, but I guess we shall see you until then I would definitely recommend this film 9/10",9
13 April 2016,An Amazing Movie,"Russo Brothers did an amazing job with this film. I loved every scene in this film.The action is amazing,its good to see Chris Evans again as Capitan America,Robert , well he is tony stark and i actually loved him this film more than in his own movies. Black Panther, Antman y Spiderman, they are just amazing and interesting characters in the film. Visual effects are amazing and the battles are really good. I thought that marvel will never do a very good movie like it was winter soldier, but i was wrong, i was totally wrong I don't like to compare, but i enjoy this film more than batman v superman. It's obviously that it is not perfect, that's sure but for me this is the best marvel movie, and i cant wait for the infinity war, the MCU is in good hands with the Russo brothers

1 May 2016,Did not deliver all that it promised to,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",7

Now when you see this movie the movie have 100% everything that BVS don't have..I now a lot of people hate the comparations of both movies but is inevitable.

Right now MCU win the road to the box office champ of 2016 (We have to wait to see Suicide Squad and Doctor Strange later this year)and best comic book of the summer (Deadpool too).

OK now the movie.The action are Awesome,the fights incredible,the special effects great,the acting very good,the direction amazing and the story with a lot of surprises.

27 April 2016,Another one has joined the MCU's best.,"Marvel and the Russo Brothers did it again! to simply put, it's a spectacular film overall.

Captain America: Civil War has all the things that makes a comic- book movie an enjoyable blast. It's entertaining, it's emotional, it has action-packed scenes that will leave you at the edge of your seat and of course, it certainly has humor in it and just the right amount as well so it won't come out as a jarring or brooding movie experience. This is what a blockbuster film should be.

My main fear before watching this movie was how were they going to handle this amount of characters in one film since even the last Avengers movie: Age of Ultron had a difficult time in doing so. After watching it though, all I got to say is that it surpassed almost every bit of expectation I had and gave each of our heroes their spotlight moments which allowed them to standout in the movie in their own way which the Russos did flawlessly especially the newly introduced character Black Panther which they also nailed perfectly and served as a strong introduction for those who don't read the comics and aren't familiar about his character at all.

Maybe my only problem with this film is that it's vastly different from it's comic counterpart but I do understand that the MCU is trying something different so I won't bitch about it too much. The villain didn't bothered me as much as people say it was, though his plan was a little too intricate, he was still an exceptionally good villain with a legit motive but I do agree with some people that he didn't need to be in this movie since it's already filled with the necessary conflict that would otherwise make it a thrilling film.

Now for my final thoughts about Captain America: Civil War. If you enjoy comic-book or superhero films as a whole with no bias, this movie is a must see and you'll probably enjoy the hell out of it. This movie proves that a film can satisfy the fans, the general audience AND the critics all at the same time.",7

21 January 2018,Civil War - Love the premise but the execution leaves me unsatisfied,"I guess I'm going against the grain on this one. I've just watched this one, and will admit that I'm no Marvel super-geek, but like everyone else I generally enjoy the tentpole movies. They have been hit and miss, but as they have carried on they have become so same-y, a change was needed. So using the basis of the Mark Millar penned graphic novel ""Civil War""they have created this film.

It's different, it's an interesting and for the uber-comic geek, it helps to to play to their fantasy who is the greater/stronger superhero. Yet for all that, I'm feeling dissatisfied.

It's a long film watching our 'heroes' on each other's backs, yet the strory was strong enough and nor was the dialogue. Captain America is by far the star of the show, but every other superhero is also shoed in; this really is an Avengers movie without the title and suffers the same problem of overkill in characters.

I'm not biasd in DC v Marvel, but both have to step back and re-review what they are producing. This level will see the genre decline, but there is a lot of life in it all.

Hoping for better next time. A great premise and top marks for trying to take the genre in a different direction but really put more work into the story. Sometimes less is more.",4
29 April 2022,"Dismal and moody, but great action","The positives: Great intense action, acting, CGI, cinematography, atmosphere. Negatives: the story was terrible. If you enjoy MCU, you will enjoy this for the action, and intensity, but don't expect to get absorbed in the story - there is no fun here. The first 90 minutes is 10 stars- excellent, the rest is soaked in a miasma of icky goo.

Disclaimer, don't let my negatives that follow, in any way dissuade you from seeing this film. It's a rush of wonderful enjoyment, and super fun action and excitement, but as you will realize if you choose to continue reading, I am critical.

This is not a Captain America movie, and they should not have named it as such. This is a potpourri of idle heroes, bored to tears, with too much spare time. Let's take all this adrenaline, egocentrism, testosterone, and lack of focus and start a fight in the locker room, just for $^%@$ and giggles.

My opinion of alternate titles would include:

The Winter Soldier Returns Avengers: Civil War Avengers: Cynical War Iron Man vs Captain America The New Avengers

This movie is about questions and answers. What happened to Stark's parents? Where is the winter soldier? What is to transpire with the new recruits? Is Ant-Man going to join the Avengers? What are Vision's powers? Who is this Black Panther? Wow, Spiderman? Whatever happened to Frank Grillo? What about Emily VanCamp? Where is the Hulk? Where is Thor? And so many more.

There was way, way, way too much hype surrounding this movie, and we were hoodwinked by the razzmatazz - all bark, and no bite. What I mean is this had no tangible theme, and no lessons learned. We were duped by the glitter of Spiderman, and deceived by the mystique of the Black Panther. But none of this came to fruition, we got a bite of it, but it left a sour aftertaste. View it again with an open mind, and I feel you might fathom what I'm saying (maybe?)

There are lots of failed attempts at establishing additional heroes into the MCU, and providing some foundation, and the presentation was meager at best. I'm sorry for the blasphemy, just being honest. I'm hoping there is no revisionist history at work here, but I really can't remember if I ever loved this movie nearly as much as the other ones. I think I conveniently forgot how abysmal the story was, if only to spare myself the trauma of reliving it. Again, the action, the fights, all the ambience was over-the-top, but the story is depressing and sad (not a fun movie if you're looking for anything... cool). This is very heavy, and the lightheartedness factor is a big zero.

I finished this and thought to myself, what is wrong with me? Have I suddenly lost all ability to enjoy the MCU, or just having an off day? I thought I remembered at least enjoying this somewhat, but now I'm not so sure. I'm gonna lean toward just having an off day.

4 October 2021,Despite its duration it can entertain despite inconsistencies,"The Russo brothers had the enormous task of preparing a film with too many protagonists. Hence, the duration is exaggerated which obviously forces you to consume for sure in theaters. The drama is that there are moments where the movie is exhausting until suddenly fights between old friends ensue; the latter is the only thing that saves the film. We see that there is space for showing off for everyone and we must understand that this film is not a work of art but a machine that must generate money. From that point of view it works. From the artistic, dramatic or humorous point of view, an attempt was made to express the idea of redemption, struggle with the past, loss of family members, and choose between what is right and what is necessary. But still this film lacked enough to be memorable. There are dazzling parts but that quality doesn't last throughout the film.

27 April 2016,The Great Responsibility,"Eight years into Marvel Studios' multi-property film franchise and its increasingly convoluted continuity, a movie as good as ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) is truly and delightfully surprising. While I doubt it could stand alone, and is guilty of a few shoe- horned cameos and more than a few plot contrivances, the second instalment from Joe and Anthony Russo (directors of the previous and similarly impressive Captain America: The Winter Solider {2014}) is a success. As an action spectacle it is above par; as a springboard for future franchise films it is reinvigorating; and as a meditation on the problem of superheroes' power and sovereignty it is the best since Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"" (2009). We are not likely to see critical reception that puts it in league with Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), rather condescendingly hailed by non- superhero fans as something ""more than a comic book movie"" (Roger Ebert). But ""Civil War"" is every bit as engaged with themes of authority and morality as Nolan's seminal work, and borrows much credence from the Marvel Cinematic Universe's well-established lore and cast of characters. It is as close to the true, transcendent experience of comic book fandom as we have yet to see on the big screen.

Following the events of the sadly inferior ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015), Steve Rogers as Captain America (Chris Evans) leads a new team of superheroes in pursuit of a minor villain leftover from ""The Winter Soldier"", only to sustain a large number of civilian casualties. It's the final straw for the governments of the world, says long-absent Marvel player General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt, last seen in 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk""). Now a superhero registration act is in order, rendering all enhanced individuals legally beholden to the United Nations and impotent to act without democratic approval. Humbled by the weight of failure from previous films, Tony Stark as Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is in favour of the proposal. Rogers, ruffled by his intimate experience of governmental corruption from previous films, is suspicious, but might have agreed to compromise if not for the involvement of his life-long friend turned Soviet sleeper assassin, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Staan - the aforementioned Winter Soldier). Barnes has been framed for a terrorist bombing in South Africa and Rogers is alone in defending his innocence. With the help of a mystery malefactor (Daniel Bruhl), the rift between heroes grows into civil war...

The basic premise of this film was adapted from a cross-over Marvel comics event of the same name (published 2006-7), and represented a major paradigm shift in post-9/11 superhero narratives. This arose from the undeniable fact that it was becoming impossible to appreciate large-scale urban destruction without qualms, and that superheroes have always left large-scale urban destruction in their wake. It is something that has been addressed in previous films, particularly ""The Avengers"" (2012) and ""Age of Ultron"", in which writer-director Joss Whedon made a point of conflict containment and showed Rogers doing everything possible to clear the battleground of bystanders – maybe that way we could cathartically enjoy New York's decimation again. But the Avengers are making one hell of an omelette here. ""You try to save as many people as you can,"" Rogers confesses. ""Sometimes that doesn't mean everyone"".

This is Captain America's polite way of using the phrase ""collateral damage"", a theme that has wormed its way into the heart of superhero culture over the last ten years, and to great effect. That ""Civil War"" takes an issue like collateral damage so seriously is its finest quality: we have here a film that does adhere to a fairly formulaic script wherein a villain turns the heroes against each other (seen in both Avengers movies), but not one that lets the heroes off that easily. While much of the story is somewhat contrived - utilizing the classic trope of villain-as-impossibly- prescient-mastermind-who-knows-what-every-character-will-do-every- step-of-the-way - the conflict at its heart is not. It is a very real ideological difference that exists between Rogers and Stark, and not a misunderstanding used to justify a series of fight scenes. ""You're wrong, you think you're right, and that makes you dangerous,"" claims the film's most exciting cameo character. It doesn't matter who he's talking to.

At the same time, the movie remains a solid melodrama, such that we feel the personal stakes which all stories require to function at an emotional level. Stark and Rogers take their sides on principle that is not abstract, but informed by personal tragedy. Bolstered by thematic ties to the story's two main antagonists, ""Civil War"" works as drama as well as dissertation. This is all especially impressive given the studio mandates which must have been weighing upon it, to consolidate the plots and characters of Marvel's eleven preceding films and set up the seven films slated for release by 2019. This is a juggling act of economic, thematic and storytelling responsibility that is rarely executed with such aplomb in the arena of Hollywood blockbusters. It will make money and please fans, an increasingly difficult double threat for superhero cinema. And while it requires a baseline of fandom to operate as a good film, it does do it. It is a story about power; it is a story about people. After all, every story is.",9
16 May 2016,Accountability of superheroes and precarious conflicts,"Ultron was Tony Stark's innovation that was meant to withstand future onslaughts from the threats of the Universe. However, due to the maligned nature of Loki's sceptre, the Age of Ultron wreaked havoc on Sokovia, while the Avengers scrambled to prevent collateral damage as the city was raised to the skies and yet, not everyone could be saved. Nations become suspicious of the unchecked powers of Earth's mightiest heroes and those who lost their families due to their actions, seek to avenge them. Thus, 'Civil War' is partly an aftermath of 'Age of Ultron' and partly a follow-up to 'Captain America: Winter Soldier' mainly due to Bucky's presence. The Russo brothers enter the 3rd phase of MCU and stick to the formula that has worked wonders for Disney/Marvel in keeping with a brighter, entertaining tone.

We start in 1991, with Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) being sent on a mission to retrieve a serum from a car. The driver of the car isn't revealed quite yet but that proves to be quite a twist at the very end. Current day in Nigeria, a group of Avengers disrupt Brock Rumlow's (Frank Grillo) attempt to steal a bio weapon. Their encounter leads to Rumlow detonating an explosive under his vest and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) directing its effects away from the busy marketplace. Unfortunately, it leads to the death of several humanitarian workers from Wakanda who were in the building nearby. Meanwhile, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) reveals his impressive sample of future technologies to M.I.T. students and generously offers to fund all of their research projects. There, he meets a grieving mother who lost her son in Sokovia, reminding Stark of the failures and uncontrolled powers of the superheroes.

Too much damage has been done even with their best intentions and efforts. Accountability was thus proposed by a United Nations panel through the Sokovia Accords that would control their actions. US Secretary of State, Ross convinces them of no other way but to sign in its favor. Tony agrees due to his bad decisions and experiences, Captain (Chris Evans) disagrees because of his suspicion of those who rule with agendas. One prefers accountability by external authority while the other prefers the freedom to act as he assumes that the safest hands are still their own.

The Accords themselves weren't much to quarrel over since the scenario was inevitable but it's the explosion at the UN Conference in Vienna that really tears them apart. The Wakandan King, who was a strong proponent of the Accords, perishes in the attack and his son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is determined to bring the suspect to justice. The suspect being the Winter Soldier. Automatically, Cap saves his bro-friend Bucky on every attack from the government, Ironman and T'Challa's mysterious form of Black Panther. This exciting introduction of a powerful warrior expands the might of the Avengers in general with his formidable abilities and skills. Thereafter, it was upon Stark and Cap Rogers to recruit new members and convince existing ones to take a moral stance in their favor. To make things even, we have Spiderman on team Ironman and Ant- Man on team Cap. Their action sequences are immense fun and Tom Holland's teenage Spider-boy is nimble, agile although quite talkative like his character in the comics. Paul Rudd's Ant-Man takes up some surprising form and plays a big role in the airport fight. This seemingly half hour-ish sequence at a German airport is certainly the film's highlight and showdown of the two teams that is regarded as Civil War.

The plot drags on further as Stark investigates the actual events that transpired before Cap's escape with the Winter Soldier and his findings reveal a deeper ploy by Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) to divide them even further. His revelation of the 1991 incident involving the Winter Soldier opens up traumatic wounds for Stark and it leads them into a more serious combat that breaks the trust between Cap and Ironman. The heaviness of a divided team of superheroes only bears down on us thereafter and it took the Russo brothers over 2 hours 20 minutes to convince us. The motivations for many of the characters remain a bit casual for them to really take sides and stand against their fellow Avengers. Scarlett deserves a Black Widow movie but she's losing the grip on her audience as Natasha doesn't have much influence over others. Black Panther's only reason for joining Ironman is to take down Bucky and Boseman is a brilliant T'Challa. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is just inconvenienced with all this while Falcon (Anthony Mackie) gets adventurous in his second outing with the Cap. War Machine (Cheadle) represents the Government's interests and is close enough to Stark to influence his decisions. Vision (Paul Bettany) spends the entire airport sequence trying to keep Wanda away from harming anyone and without his superhero suit, looks quite weird adorning a sweater. Spider-Man is just stoked to be called upon by Mr. Stark and Tom Holland portrays the excitement to showcase his powers and the fear of Aunt May discovering them, quite naturally. Ant-Man is just happy to be among his heroes and Paul Rudd brings the credibility of a common guy honored to be working with his heroes. But again, this theme has worked well for Marvel and shall continue to do so because the general audience prefers the levity with the action.

'Civil War' does less to lead up to the upcoming Infinity Wars and more to introduce new characters and reboots. In the absence of Thor, who is busy with far greater threats, the stakes aren't high enough for the Avengers right now but they do need to keep themselves in check, even if through an international panel and they must resolve their unsettled differences if they want to be the Earth's mightiest heroes.

6 May 2017,Yawn,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",1
29 April 2016,Marvelously Majestic,"Captain America: Civil War (spoiler free) review

Director(s): Anthony and Joe Russo

Distributor: Disney

Cast: 2 time Academy Award NomineeRobert Downey Jr.*, Chris Evans Elizabeth Olsen, Scarlett Johansson,Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle with 2 time Academy Award Nominee Jeremy Renner** and Chadwick Boseman.

Plot: Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man.

Director brothers Anthony and Joe Russo return with the sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014). This film is action packed from start to finish and with a story to hold it all together. Another amazing entry to Marvel Cinematic Universe.

After the Avengers fell apart in last years Avengers: Age of Ultron with that Captain America and Iron Man form their own team to fight for justice, although Thor and Hulk are nowhere to be seen.

Here are the reasons why this is a must see:

Blistering Action: Theaction scenes are very spectacular throughout with new moves from each of the heroes. The action is very fast paced and and loud which is to be expected. Which all leads up to the outstanding final fight.

No Disney feel: Although this film is Disney because it is part of their MCU franchise this is more serious than the other ones, it still has the funny dialogue.

This film is the start of phase 3 of the MCU and it is a wonderful start. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Crossbones (Frank Grillo) all make their first appearance but they don't go amiss because they make a massive impact.

The dialogue is kind of slow but it is very intellectual but it's all worth it because the final battle is just extremely fun and makes the whole film worthwhile.

Does this final film in the Captain America trilogy end winningly? ABSOLUTELY With blistering and mind boggling special effects this truly is a film that cannot be missed.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier is I hate to say this but there nothing to this. This truly is a Marvelous spectacle to behold. 10/10 excellent not to be missed.

Verdict: Definitely worth the wait and and excellent start to MCU's phase 3. Action packed from start to finish.

27 April 2016,Why civil war is so overestimated,"I'm a big Marvel fan, especially the comic books but i have to say it... i'm a little bit disappointed. I know everything about this universe and i love the Phase 1 and 2. But it's without any surprise that i discovered Civil war.

Don't misunderstand me, It's a great movie but the story is predictable (bad guy with a thirst of revenge, how original), the sequence of the story is interspersed and finally it's an other Marvel movie without surprise (same storyline has always).

They should have follow the story of the comics and bring more character and depth (mostly for captain ! The story behind Tony Stark is touching and moving)

fortunately, spidey, Black Panther and the Amazing Iron ""Robert Downey Jr"" man enhance the level of this movie.

Special effects and battle scenes are amazing though.

with all the hype, the media publicity etc I was expecting a stunning movie and I end up with a good action movie but banal",6

23 April 2016,One Of The Best Movies Of All-Time!,"This movie will surprise a lot of people with its heart while sacrificing none of the thrills. All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark right on the spot. Captain America Civil War is such a movie. It's the best big budget movie that I've seen since Avengers. It hits a high standard of excellence by combining an intriguing plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, charisma, a dash of true patriotism, honor, duty and puts it all together in one amazing package.

The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character. They turn convention on its ear by making Steve Rogers' flaws more apparent in this film and at the same time making Tony Stark's journey and growth very sympathetic. Steve's never say die attitude and heart of a champion makes him a true hero but those traits can lead to something not as noble. As in real life, never say die can turn in to painfully stubborn in a hurry. Both these character's motivations and journeys are more interesting then most. Can Steve remain the ""good man"" his creator instructed him to be in the very first film even through the most trying of times? Can the once cocky Tony Stark continue to learn and grow and work to humbly serve others even thorough anger and his own selfish tendencies?

This movie delivers on all that and on every level. It does so with great emotional moments and it's a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated.",
11 May 2016,Too good not to write a review,"As a comic book fan, reading Civil War was awesome. I am not a purist, I don't believe that they should be exactly like they are in the comic books. That being said, Civil War the comic had a great deal of characters and story. I was worried on how they can could do the movie with losing the great story telling of the actual civil war. While the movie was not really like the comic book story, they still managed to make a great Civil War Movie. And they kept the strong points, action and some of the main characters like Spider- man, Iron man and Captain America all in good form. The action was excellent, copying that same gritty, back and forth special forces fighting that they managed to bring to life in Winter Soldier. Team up scenes, unexpected powers and just coolness of their abilities soared throughout the screen with so many different awe factors. The story it self is believable, they make it a pretty decent reason why one hero would choose this side and the other would choose the other. And other characters that would be in turmoil no matter what they chose. To me when a movie is 3 hours and it seems like 30 minutes, you have a good flick. There was so much to like about it. The humor, was well timed and just flat out great. I heard a lot of people saying Black Panter and Spiderman where awesome, but Paul Rudd as Ant Man was amazing too. So do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an Epic movie that actually lives up to the Hype. Its hard not to like this movie and I'm sure some will, but to me I was in my element and so excited at the end of it all. Enjoy.",10
6 September 2016,"If this is considered ""great"" superhero movie, I'm an elephant","I'm not a huge fan of comic book superhero movies, but as a movie enthusiast that's seen most watching-worth movies in last two decades, I'm more than sure that I can more or less adequately assess quality of the film. And I watched this movie with already pretty low expectations, seeing how superhero movies (with only handful of exceptions over last few years) is getting dumber and worse with every year.

And boy, this movie was disappointing in all possible aspects, from plot and acting to even the CGI - even the over-the-top action scenes was somehow dull and boring, character conflict that was driving the movie plot was so forced and incredibly stupid, that I was just absolutely blown-away with the fact that anybody can call it plausible and go with the flow.

Even the CGI and practical effects, that at least in most cases of high-budget superhero flicks, is top notch and high quality, was very poor and seem totally fake.

I seriously can't get over the fact that this movie has 8 (!!!) stars in IMDb, when in every possible aspect it earns 3 at the VERY best. I guess movie audiences are just getting dumber and expected quality of movies has just plummeted all-time-low.",2
28 January 2017,20 steps to make a Marvel movie.,"Feel like making a few extra billion dollars without using any effort? Well, you're in luck! Here's my 20 simple steps on making a Marvel movie:

1. Start with fight scenes

2. Find as many random comic book references as possible and cram them into the ""story""

3. Add as many characters into the ""plot"" even if it becomes way too crowded

4. Add fight scenes

5. Make the dialog lol-tastic and quirky playful banter, despite being a ""dark"" movie

6. Oh wait, the movie is dark again, be sure to make the film go into dramatic mode, where there are no sound effects except for echoed ""NOOO!""'s and the swelling music

7. Add fight scenes

8. Throw in a few random chuckle-worthy lines. Make sure the music stops when this happens, letting the audience know that something funny is being said

9. Make the editing schizophrenic and impossible to see anything, especially during the fight scenes. This ensures that viewers cant see anything that's going on during all 5,932 action scenes

10. More fight scenes, plus explosions

11. More comic book references

12. Make it at least 140 minutes in runtime to make it seem more epic

13. Add in yet more characters, this time for the sake of making more spin offs that will make more spin offs that will make more spin offs that will make more spin offs that will...

14. Make the directing as obvious as possible, thus eliminating all suspense or deeper thinking. Remember, your audience is stupid and only want explosions...

15. Add more explosions to more fight scenes

16. Make the villain a goofy wise ass who exchanges quirky banter with the characters instead of making it him/her an intimidating foe

17. Throw in a random love arc. DRAMA!!!!!!!

18. Tell your composer to write the most bland score ever

19. Whatever comic book references and characters you have left, no matter how small or pointless, THROW THEM INTO THE SCRIPT! Just dump the entire bucket into the pool!

20. Finish with more fight scenes.

There! In just 20 brief steps, you'll make a guaranteed billion dollars. If you're a DC executive wondering how to make BvS2 or Justice League reach that big B, just follow this list and you'll be rolling in the green in no time. No need to worry about a story, plot, or screenplay, because that crap takes too much time. Instead, just follow my list to become the next Warren Buffett of quickly-aging cinema. Best of luck to you, gents!",5
4 June 2016,Disappointing,"After this hype around the movie and people telling me how great it is, I have finally seen it and did not understand what the fuss was about... Too much of the movie is just talking about ""do we sign the agreement?"", ""Should we sign?"", ""Will they sign?"", ""I feel so bad about what happened"", ""How can they not see what is right?"".. There was barely a time for anything else, and until we did see something else and you think that maybe that's it, the movie is starting, we soon go back to the same talking. I have given it 6 stars since still on its own, its an OK movie, but if you compare it to other Marvel movies, it's relatively at the bottom and one of their worst.

5 October 2022,"A worthy conclusion to the ""Captain America"" trilogy?","""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016), a lot of you know this already. But, if you don't, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014) is my personal favorite Marvel film, as well as one of my top ten all-time favorite movies in general. So, you can imagine the high expectations I had when I waited for ""Captain America: Civil War"" to be released in theaters! Right? My hype was overwhelming, I couldn't wait for it to come out. Well, the day finally came for it's theatrical release. I went to go see it, and I really enjoyed it thoroughly! But then, when I eventually watched it on DVD, it just didn't have the same impact. I just felt a bit underwhelmed when I saw it again. Don't get me wrong, it is still a very well-done film. However, it does have a few hiccups here and there. ""Captain America: Civil War"" has an average story, fantastic acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it all together. The plot is, political involvement with the Avengers causes a feud between the heroes, which causes them to take opposing sides and turn against each other. Wow, now that's what I call an exciting premise! Overall, it does deliver on the storyline and it's everything that you expect to see. But, at the same time, that's also a problem here. Why? Because, this is supposed to be a solo ""Captain America"" movie. Yet, it feels like another ""Avengers"" film. To tell you the truth, I would've preferred this to be ""Avengers 2"", instead of the diarrhea stain known as ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015)! Which, in my opinion, is the absolute worst Marvel Cinematic Universe movie. Another lousy Marvel film that came out during this time, was ""Ant-Man"" (2015). What they should've done, was exclude ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and also ""Ant-Man"" and go straight into ""Captain America: Civil War"". This should've been ""Avengers 2""! They could've still included Ultron in the movie, as one of his many powers is mind control. He could've influenced the world politicians to create the Sokovia Accords, as well as corrupt the Avengers' minds to turn them against each other. On top of that, Hank Pym would've created Ultron at some point instead of Tony Stark, which would've been comic book accurate. That would've been an outstanding film! Then, they could've just done the third ""Captain America"" movie later on about Bucky's brainwashing and Zemo's reign, minus the other Avengers and it would've made more sense. The whole sub-plot with the Sokovia Accords and the other characters is way too much going on for one film. Let alone, a solo ""Captain America"" movie! Plus, it almost fell into ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" territory with the amount of one-liners in this film. As I've mentioned, that's a common problem with most Marvel movies, the corny jokes and humor. But here, it's not that bad. However, some of them can get distracting! For example, right before the airport fight (which is one of the best scenes in this film), Black Widow says: ""this is gonna end well."" I know that's an odd thing to comment on about this movie, but every time I hear it, that line completely detracts me from the moment! Bottom line, there is way too much going on in this film and yet, they tried to squeeze it all in. That being said, there is a lot of focus on Captain America among the other characters. Also, this is probably the most sufficient way to express this substantial story. However, you would think they'd learn from the same mistakes of ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016)! At least compared to that travesty, ""Captain America: Civil War"" is cohesive. One thing that really stands out, is the action and fight scenes. They were really well-done! Those scenes alone make this movie worth watching. Other than that, the best word to describe the storyline is, cluttered. As for the acting, it's standard to great from the whole entire cast. But once again, the most lackluster performances are from Don Cheadle as James Rhodes/War Machine and Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Both of them are just dull and boring to watch for the most part. I could scream! For example, Don Cheadle's facial expressions barely ever change, and his acting is just wooden. Then, Scarlett Johansson's acting is deadpan and boring. But, it isn't her worst performance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That would actually be in ""Avengers: Age of Ultron""! However, this performance is probably a close second though. On an unrelated note, I've seen other films where actors and actresses act the same way, and then they're nominated for Worst Actor or Worst Actress! How does Scarlett Johansson get a free pass? Also, how did Don Cheadle avoid that nomination? Other than their substandard performances, the rest of the cast does a great job! All of the sets/locations are perfect and they give this film a nice atmosphere. As for the special effects, they are all very well-done and still hold up to this day. Which is no surprise, seeing that it came out in 2016! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Henry Jackman is outstanding. His film score sets the perfect tone for the story and it really helps bring the movie to life! ""Captain America: Civil War"" is a fun film to watch once in a while. But, in the years that followed it has not aged that well. The storyline is the weakest element! However, as a whole, I still give it a pass. There are just enough good elements throughout the movie that make it worth a watch. I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 8 out of 10 IMDB stars. Unless you're just getting into the Marvel films, it's really hard for me to recommend it otherwise. That being said, if you're watching the Marvel Cinematic Universe in chronological order, I suggest skipping ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and ""Ant-Man"". Seriously, you won't be missing a thing. I honestly recommend that you skip those films and go straight into this movie. Just make sure to refer to ""Captain America: Civil War"" as ""Avengers 2""!",8
5 May 2016,Russo Brothers handle an ensemble excellently in another Marvel blockbuster but it wasn't without problems.,"Captain America: Civil War has been called ""Avengers 3"" by some people because of the amount of Avengers that star in the film and it's a valid observation...until you see the movie. Somehow the Russo Brothers, with this huge ensemble cast, dealing with the Avengers themselves, adapting an infamous comic book actually make it still feel like a Captain America movie - which is great! I mean don't get me wrong, you see a lot of other characters and I loved seeing a lot of other characters but it really worked well continuing Cap's story that was left off in The Winter Soldier, which I really enjoyed because Bucky Barnes was one of the most interesting things about that movie and I enjoyed seeing him progress here.

And talking of characters, there were quite a few to juggle about but the Russo's once again did an excellent job of not making it confusing or crowded. I'll just go through a few of them real quick. Captain America and Iron Man were great as always, Iron Man was not always his one-liner quip guy in this, he has a lot of stuff to deal with so it was interesting to see him in that light; now I went into this movie on the side of a particular team but boy if you don't start questioning your loyalties during this movie then something's wrong; there were points being made that actually made me see the other guy's side so I was happy to see both sides presented equally, after all it is a Civil War. Black Panther gets his movie debut here and what an introduction it was, he is a fantastic character who I cannot wait to see again, his motives were solid and clear and his third-party angle to the war made it really intriguing to watch, definitely looking forward to seeing Chadwick Boseman in his own Black Panther film. The two sidekicks, as it were, Falcon and War Machine were great to see again and do a lot more plot-wise I think so it was nice to see everyone used really well. Vision and Wanda were fine in their roles again, I think I preferred them in Age of Ultron for some reason, they just seemed more interesting then whereas here, although they were great to see again, I didn't feel as invested in their characters as I was others. Ant-Man was fun to see too and boy do we see him, I'm obviously not going to spoil anything here but he was definitely one of my favorite parts of the movie.

Now during all this Civil Waring there is actually a villain in the movie and for me, he was one of the best villains Marvel have done in their Cinematic Universe; I felt his motives were valid, his intelligence was shown very well and his scenes were just really interesting to me.

Just before I get into what I wasn't such a fan of I'll mention Spider-Man. Tom Holland is a great actor and does a great job in this, it was really cool to see Spider-Man interact with the Avengers and see him do his stuff. That being said, this Spider-Man was not quite what I was expecting; I don't read the comics so from just a movie-going viewer with the past five Spidey movies to go on, this incarnation was quite different in the way of how they handled him. I've been told it was the most comic-accurate Spider-Man and the best version they've seen of him on screen so I have no place to complain but for me it was a little jarring to see such a change from what I was used too. But I did of course enjoy seeing him on screen and really look forward to seeing him again.

Now some things I wasn't so struck on. The first action piece; a battle near the very start of the movie just seemed off for some reason. I don't know what it was but it just didn't flow for me, I didn't enjoy who they were fighting and although it does set up something important a lot of it felt unnecessary. The first quarter of the film I'd say was very much a going from set-up to set-up sort of thing and was a little shaky script wise but the plot eventually straightened and it was great. Another negative I have was that once or twice the CGI was quite noticeable, in some of the action scenes and particularly Vision sometimes it wasn't great. And then something that wasn't necessarily wrong with the film but those darn trailers again. We'd go to one location and I'd instantly recognise it from the trailer so I knew what was going to happen, and that occurred nearly every time they went somewhere else; not all the time mind you, but quite a lot I was already knowing what scene this was leading up to.

In the end Marvel roll out another blockbuster with one of the best ensemble casts and an investing, emotional story. For me it wasn't the best film they've done but a real strong shot from the Russo Brothers and set's up a lot of cool characters for the future.",8
16 May 2016,That's why you pay the ticket!,"Well, nothing to say there, apart from the title of my comment. That's exactly why we still pay tickets to see movies like this, beyond our thirties and even in our forties! Packed with action, right dose of humor, amazing acting and truly breathtaking battles.

When during such a movie you really feel like you're playing a video game yourself and you are cheering with excitement, then this is a movie well made. Having taken one for the team with the not so nice ""Batman VS Superman"", this was actually a movie worth watching.

The plot was there, the story was captivating and all the elements that someone would look for were present. I adored the fact that all the superheroes were treated as equals (although some may overpower others in ""reality""). The fights and the way that the pros and cons of each one came out, was really nicely done.

My personal favorite was Spiderman. Although this franchise has been a bit torn and abused so far, this guy seems quite legit. It would be nice to see a good spiderman movie after that. If you haven't watched it yet, get a ticket and go on...",10
18 April 2016,meh,"I have tried to avoid spoilers in this review to the best of my ability.

While there are several good things about Captain America Civil War,including one terrific action sequence, it suffers from the same faults as Age of Ultron.

That is to say that the characters don't engage the audience. Their flippant irreverence is amusing at first, but it is impossible to care what happens to them. They all remain plot devices who bicker and make up as the whims of the plot demand, but none of them seem to have a life beyond what is presented on screen. There are too many of them now with characters that I found it impossible to care about. If the directors decided to thin out the herd by killing a few off I wouldn't mind.

Not that there seems to be much danger of that happening. Whatever is going on there never seems to be any jeopardy for the characters among all the CGI.

In this regard Civil War, is a retrograde step from Winter Soldier.

To be honest I doubt that Civil War will be the movie that bursts the superhero bubble at the box office, but I think it is probably a step closer.",4
12 April 2023,Surprisingly emotional at times,"Captain America: Civil War is an action-packed superhero film that showcases everything that makes the Marvel Cinematic Universe so utterly captivating. However, what sets this movie apart from other superhero films is its emotional depth, which is often overlooked.

The film starts with a bang and instantly draws you in with its action-packed scenes, but it's the emotional conflicts between the characters that really make this movie a standout. The central conflict between Captain America and Iron Man is one of the most moving conflicts in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as both heroes are forced to choose between their loyalty to their friends and their duty to the greater good. The film is full of powerful moments that will tug at your heartstrings, whether it's the gut-wrenching scene between Tony Stark and his parents or his final showdown with Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes.

Another underrated aspect of the movie is the performances of its talented cast. Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., and Sebastian Stan all give stellar performances that bring their characters to life in a way that is both relatable and poignant. The chemistry between the actors is palpable, and you feel the emotional weight behind every decision that each character makes.

Overall, Captain America: Civil War is a true masterpiece of cinema that should not be overlooked for its emotional depth. This movie is about more than just superheroes fighting each other, it's about friendship, loyalty, betrayal, and the very human emotions that make us who we are. It is a testament to the power of cinema to move us on a deep emotional level, and it is a must-watch for anyone who loves superhero films or great movies in general.",9
2 May 2016,Another over hyped Marvel movie!,"After an amazing second movie with The Winter Soldier I kinda had my doubts as to whether this excellence could continue. I was proved right.

Never mind what the reviews say and what the journalists print, I've become more suspicious of ""reviews"" in this multi billion dollar industry. Especially after the negative reviews for the far superior Dawn of Justice over this ""Civil War"".

I thought this was supposed to be a Captain America movie, not Iron Man 4 or an Avengers flick. There's too emphasis on trying to up the super hero count in this film to get paying customers into the cinema, oh look Spiderman's in it, lets go watch.

Far too much comedy, we're dealing with super heroes here, which is serious sh*t, ha ha.....but unfortunately some people think a films great if it makes them laugh.

So personally I still think the best Marvel films so far are, Thor, The Winter Soldier and Dead Pool (now this is sold as a comedy).",6
15 May 2016,"No movie is perfect, but this was close","What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",8
17 May 2016,Marvelously Blah....,"Action for actions sake. Plot holes galore and more Avengers than I knew existed. Every time there was a new scene there was another Avenger with the Hulk and Thor conspicuously absent I guess to keep salary costs down. I'm still trying to figure out just why Iron man and Captain America were fighting...anyway, they had to throw a couple extra avengers in there to make it even so it could be an even ""civil war"". Glad i downloaded this and didn't pay to go see it. Noting special except the Spider-man showing. Like WEIRD AL said about Star Wars..."" They'll be making these movies til the end of time with my Yoda...Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda... He needs to rewrite one for Marvel.

7 May 2016,"One of the best films of this summer, a real delight.","Following upon from the success of Captain America: Winter Soldier is a sequel, once again directed by the Russo brothers, adapting Mark Millar's famous Civil War series to the big screen. The thirteenth feature in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, backed by Disney, will this turn out to be the unlucky entry in the highly successful franchise?

Following on from the events of Age of Ultron, after another incident involving the Avengers ends in some high profile collateral damage, the UN demand a form of accountability in the form of the 'Sokovia Accords'. This would mean the Avengers would only be allowed to intercede in international matters when called upon by a supervising committee. The Avengers are left split by this with one side agreeing with Captain America, siding against the accords, and one group siding with Iron Man, who wishes to follow the demands of the U.N. The issue is complicated further when the signing of the bill is seemingly bombed by The Winter Soldier, Captain America's brainwashed best friend, resulting in numerous deaths, including the killing of T'Chaka the King of Wakanda.

Much like Batman vs Superman there is a lot of plot to weave through in Civil War, however unlike BvS this film balances its characters with much more success. By no means does everything flow perfectly, but the ideological clash of the characters is kept clear and concise, assisted by us having gotten to know these characters in previous features. Evans and Downey Jnr continue their fine work as the clashing pair, the figureheads of the Marvel Universe, and this feud has been brewing throughout the Avengers series. Recalling so many characters from the MCU could threaten to destabilise the movie, but as we have met so many of the characters before their importance in the story is flexible, with invested characters taking the foreground. For example Ant-Man appears in the film, in little more than an extended cameo, he has little grasp of the larger situation but his fleeting appearance is highly entertaining. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is one of the new additions to the gigantic ensemble and although Boseman does have a charismatic presence there is so much going on in Civil War that we never really get to connect with him. Although it must be admitted that getting to see more of the character in his own feature, under the direction of Ryan Coogler, is an intriguing prospect. The much hyped appearance of Spiderman within the MCU has been one of the most talked about aspects of Civil War and it is a pleasure to report that Tom Holland did a fantastic job as everyone's favourite wall crawler, capturing the youthful enthusiasm that makes the character so popular. Credit goes not just to the actor, but also to the writers/directors for funnelling fresh creative life into a character going through his third incarnation in only fourteen years. Having referenced the writing it would be ill of me not to discuss the work of Christopher Markus & Stephen Mcfeely (Yes that is his real name, and it's awesome) on their fourth Marvel project. They have written the screenplays for the entire Captain America trilogy, and their ability to translate a character many would have dismissed as ill-fitting for a modern audience, due to the perception of him being dated, has turned Captain America, alongside Iron Man, into the flagship character of the MCU. Marvel have long been accused of under developing their villains, their film's tend to focus on the protagonists by design, and Daniel Bruhl's performance is a brief one as Helmut Zemo. However I will say I was impressed by what I did see of the character, and his motivations complement the film's themes in the larger context. With a cast so large I will give small mentions of praise to the continued impressive displays of Elisabeth Olson, Anthony Mackie, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson and Emily VanCamp. Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier is more of a plot piece than a character and I hope to see him explored beyond simply being a brainwashed weapon in the future so we can see more range, especially if, as expected, he becomes a larger part of the MCU in the future. With a range of action scenes I was impressed by the Russo Brothers use of variety, the earlier fight scenes being very organic, using a hand-held camera to amplify the 'street level' of the conflict. Later when the two superhero sides showdown the style changes to a much more fixed fluid motion to allow us to enjoy the wide open spectacle of what amounts to an MCU Royal Rumble. Henry Jackman, one of my favourite composers, once again delivers a stirring powerful score and it's no surprise he was called back on board following his fine work on The Winter Soldier.

With such a massively packed movie I have had to disavow my typical word count just to get close to covering most of the parts of Civil War I wished to discuss. Containing such a monumental amount of content and balancing the narrative, character motivations and plot of the film as well as the Russo's have is a great accomplishment. That the film is therefore unable to completely satisfy all components that hold it together is a small criticism for such a well-made feature but one that needs to be recognised. There is another nagging issue that I cannot elaborate on as it would take us into spoiler region, something I am unwilling to do so soon from release. Suffice it to say it revolves around another common complaint levied at Marvel films in the past that with each passing feature becomes a slightly more aggrandising concern. For now though Civil War is a feast of what fans of the genre will love best, definitely worth seeing, whichever side you're on.

13 March 2022,ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING MCU FILMS,"I really think this is one of the best and exciting MCU films ever. The action scenes and emotional leverage the scenes have were flawless. Even though a myriad of characters were featured, there was no confusion and vagueness. A pivotal cinematic achievement for MCU.

3 April 2021,The same. Ok enough.,"Trying to give a chance to all MCU (and some other super hero non Marvel films)...watching this one, the feelings are the same: the movies are entertaining, with very good production values, a bit childish and overlong.

I get that this is like the McDonald's recipe: you know exactly what you will get when you order a Big Mac. It is what it is.

28 July 2022,Great New Characters,"""Captain America: Civil War"" continues the trend of delivering a good action movie, though this time we have teams of superheroes battling each other. I liked it.

Chadwick Boseman makes his MCU debut as the Black Panther here; it's awesome to see his character as the vengeful but laid back king of Wakanda. Tom Holland also starts here too with his rendition of Spider-Man. I think I liked Tobey Maguire the best as Spider-Man; maybe that's nostalgia for me, and I'll get to him later when I review his solo movies.

Great action scenes, though I wished there more than just one battle where all of the heroes fight and I wish that it had been a little bit longer. I also thought the villain was very weak here. Really cool to see Cap (Chris Evans), Bucky (Sebastian Stan), and Tony (Robert Downey Jr.) having more great scenes together.

Another link in the MCU chain, another great superhero flick.",8
13 April 2016,Awesome,"Amazing, amazing film, features new characters naturally as if they were always there. Clash between the avengers is sensational, with strong arguments on both sides and the two right sides. Spider Man and Black Panther very well presented, has good appearances and are introduced naturally different from BvS pushing new characters unnaturally some very superficially hard not to compare these two films unfortunately ... Marvel knows how to use dark colors and fun at times suitable film. amazing America captain as ever, Iron Man expectable, spiderman great the best. Incredible one of the best films of Marvel, Russian brothers showing once again its capacity and this time with a thicker film and more characters weight was a perfect test for the next avengers they will be ahead, credibility and trust in their work was fully guaranteed after this film. Finally, surprising and great movie worth much follow that it is one of the best films of Marvel Studios.

18 July 2022,The Avengers Split,"I didn't expect that I would like the third Captain America movie so much. You wait for one story that is dedicated to Cap, and you get several at once, which perfectly demonstrate what happens when powerful friends become rivals and even enemies. Thanks to the Russo brothers, the entire cast and a great story.

It became clear from the trailers that this is not a movie about the Captain, but a kind of interim film about a whole team of Avengers who will not be able to agree and will start a confrontation. But I did not expect such a scale.

A large cast, where everyone perfectly shows their hero. The script is written in such a way that it is absolutely clear who is fighting for what, the motives of the characters, their decisions and ideals are clear.

The film immediately throws into the thick of things, clearly demonstrating what the Avengers' attempts to help people can lead to. They save some, and others die. And this is not the first time this has happened. Accordingly, the authorities are tired of this and use the events of the ""Age of Ultron"" to force superheroes to obey the government of the country. Cap and his team refuse. Iron Man agrees. And from that moment on, nothing will be the same.

The film pays sufficient attention to all the characters who influence the plot, the viewer sees how the characters develop, what they are willing to do for the sake of their beliefs. At the same time, new heroes are skillfully introduced, who already have their own stories and statuses in society.

The plot poses difficult tasks for each hero. The captain, for example, makes a difficult choice between friends, without even being afraid that he, always so correct and honest, turns out to be an outlaw. Stark, on the contrary, seems to be tired of being a bad guy, who is always arguing with legislators and taking their side. And each of the other heroes also makes a choice, which is very organically explained. The film perfectly shows this. Let some characters have one phrase, but the viewer understands that the Black Widow chooses one side, and not the other, because that's it. And Spider-Man joins Stark because of something. You need to be able to organically fit this into the outline of the narrative.

The film is replete with jokes, but first of all it is remembered as a dramatic clash of friends. And the audience understands that it is not necessary to be a powerful and strong superhero or supervillain to defeat the Avengers. They can be split by just one smart person.

There are a couple of moments in the film-twists, in which they already give goosebumps. They are strong, they are memorable. This is the merit of the creators and actors.

The result was the triumph of the film. I really liked him. It is deep, interesting, dynamic and even gloomy. And every viewer, one way or another, will wonder which side he would take. And it's great when a movie makes a person think, associate themselves with the characters. So the movie succeeded.

14 May 2016,Cohesive and fun,"Civil War is among the best additions to the Marvel Universe. It is quite easy to notice that Marvel movies have been getting progressively darker and more thematically diverse. And this is for the better since it all adds up to being more than mere macho men throwing punches at each other.

First off, Capt. America and Iron Man. That these two have had a borderline conflict since the very beginning of their collaboration is very well known, and here we see them up in arms over the manner in which they must function, now that Shield has collapsed and the Avengers have literally no one to answer to. A very compelling aspect of this movie is the way the different viewpoints of the Capt. and Iron Man are allayed to each other and to the viewer. Points made by both sides are potent and definitely need more debate and deliberation, which is precisely what the Avengers don't seem to have time for, considering that there are men out to seek glorious revenge(Read Zemo). On the one hand Iron Man is right in that it is unreasonable to think that the Avengers, as righteous as they might think they may be, have no one to answer to, and so it is their duty as a force committed to saving humanity, to sign the accord and make known their allegiance with the Governments. On the other hand, Capt. too is right in that by submitting to be monitored by the UN, the Avengers lose their ability to take on crucial operations due to their being ramshackled in the quintessential political propaganda and such; and thus the Avengers could end up being a mere tool in the promotion of said propaganda. Furthermore, the Captain's POV can be understood in that his having witnessed the failure of Shield has convinced him that the Avengers are most effective when in charge of their own matters.

So with this well fleshed out exploration of conflicting idealogies explored in what was a good, but not great first half, the movie knocks itself right out of the park in the latter. The second half has an exciting mix of comic exaggeration and dramatic exploration of themes and characters. The Airport fight scene is, while I concede hardly a practical realistic battle in that a group of ""fashionably dressed"" super-people happen to chance upon a conveniently deserted airport and fight each other while actually enjoying themselves while consistently smart-talking is well, possibly frown-inducing, yet one of the most exciting action sequences in CBMs, with hilarious exchanges between the many characters. The whole sequence breathes goofy gleeful cherry blossoming abandon, and is after all a coming together of all our favourite superheroes and their collaboration in riding on each others' abilities to execute great action sequences. Ant-man and Spiderman were simply great.

Post the Airport scene, the Capt-IronMan-Bucky showdown in Russia has surprising dramatic heft for a Marvel movie. The plot twist that it provides us adds for a searing intensity in the fight scene that follows, all with the character motivations, if not justifiable, definitely understandable.

All in all, Civil War was brilliant in that it combined all the elements of the summer blockbuster that we have come to expect, as well as providing us a fairly commendable foray into the political and emotional conflict that arises out of being a superhero. There is a lot of fun to be had here, but of course you're going to have to concede that it is after all a comic book movie. The Russo brothers have done a great job in adding whatever 'realism' is possible in a world with alien gods, green monsters, computer-humans, insect men and what not. From a filmmaking standpoint these kind of movies may not hold for much, but that's precisely the point, they exist not for technical prowess but for the, shall we conclude, glory of cinema.",9
11 May 2016,Winter Soldier is so rad,"Often the discussion comes up about what's been the best Comic Book movie? My vote is these 2 Winter Soldier movies, then the Thors, then Xmen First class and Future past. Civil War was as fun as any comic I've ever read. Great direction, the action wasn't too drawn out. There were parts in the last 2 Avengers movies that I just went to bathroom for because they were boring and felt unnecessary. Not a lot of boring filler, family, stuff here. Some. I wanted to see Wanda showcase her Scarlet Witch powers more, and did. The cameos are terrific. A lot of fun despite the severity of the tone. And that brings me to the main thing I liked about it: there wasn't some world ending, galaxy shattering, sci-fi, global domination plot. I think a lot of people prefer grounded, gritty, spy/action stuff. I loved the Thor movies but I'd take submarines and fighter jets over rainbow roads and elves. I'll take robot arms and heroes from Queens over Vikings and games of thrones. Winter Soldier is just my style

8 May 2016,Definitely surprised me,"I've always thought superhero movies were insanely overrated. To be honest the only reason I saw this was because I was bored on a Sunday afternoon. I'm sure as hell glad I saw this. It turns out I was entirely wrong about this franchise... I love it. Now I just have to watch all the other marvel movies.

I had absolutely no idea what was going on at some parts, but that was probably simply because I have barely seen any of the preceding movies. After seeing this I definitely will. To anyone else who thinks marvel is overrated, trust me, give this a shot. You will not be disappointed. I cannot wait for the next movie and the ending (won't spoil it) really sets it up for a sequel. Once again even if superhero movies aren't your thing, I seriously recommend this movie.

6 May 2016,Marvel delivers it's trump card!,"Civil War is a standalone movie drenched in a stupendous show of power, ideologies and action weaved into a meaningful plot and crafted with finesse by the Russo brothers.

Oh Captain! My Captain!

Captain America is the luckiest Avenger in the Marvel Cinematic Universe for three reasons. The number one being he never ages (Come on man! that's pretty cool. Imagine what you would do with that!), Secondly, he had to deal with only one real villain in his entire trilogy of films, and that also was kinda non existent (Red Skull was as ugly as he was stupid), and thirdly and finally, because two of his three films were directed by two visionary directors who appreciate the very aesthetics of Comic Book movies, and are not afraid to challenge the formulaic plot boiler; The Russo Brothers

Captain America: Civil War is a blockbuster, in every sense of the term but not because of Captain America or his prehistoric ideals, it is because of the dangerous and colorful array of characters that join him in this movie. Each scene and subplot are taken care with sterling craftsmanship, and not for even once you are made to feel that the story exists only to give mold to the action sequences. (Zack Snyder, are you listening?). Age of Ultron shoved a tremendous amount of information into our faces, which the Russo brothers slyly avoid. You can separate between the arc of story you should be following and the one that is on a need-to-know basis. The distinctions between the ideals of Captain America and Iron Man are clearly stated from the first arrival of either characters. We all had a little concern over how they would fit Bucky as the reason for the entire devastating stand off, but as it turns out, the film is actually Captain Buchanan Barnes: T'Challa War. Because both The Winter Soldier and Black Panther had a lot more to add than we were promised in the trailers. And nobody's complaining!

Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther has been a perfect example of casting. His grave, ideological approach to the Civil War is often needed, as he is the only character who supports neither Tony or Steve, but is dead set on his set of notions, which he carries on till the end. Tom Holland does a beautiful job as the new Spiderman. His quick witted replies, inquisitiveness in this hyper mumbo jumbo is often veered towards caricature but that is actually what Spiderman is all about. He is the guy who jokes about the Infinity Gauntlet as an 'old fashioned glove' on Thanos' face. So clearly we finally have a Spiderman which is much closer to the comics, not disagreeing to the fact that Tobey McGuire will always have a special place in our hearts. (Come on, Andrew Garfield was ehh!)

The tiff between Steve and Tony is something that will really claw you nerves. Even if you are steadfast on a single team, several moments will question your own decision making? Is Captain actually right? Does Tony actually mean well? there are moments when the singular line of their motives are blurred but each of them are stuck with their own set of beliefs, something each responsible and powerful being must do.

The airport fight sequence is hands down the best superhero action sequence you will ever see. And kudos to the duo for taking even a handful of characters from the universe so vast and creating such a perfect film. The only problem which I had with the movie that it was supposed to be the end of a Captain America trilogy; but honestly Steve reaches nowhere near closure. Maybe that was intentional, something to ponder upon, is a concrete ending necessary or is the legacy of Captain America as vast as his courage?

Captain America: Civil War is a magnum opus, something which changes the way you approach something fictional by incorporating it into the part and parcel of the world, and yet it does it with such splendour, you often wish it was true!",7
3 August 2016,Marvel have lost the plot,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",2
9 May 2016,"More ""The Breakup"" than good comic book hero action","Obviously, I am in the minority, judging by other ratings. However, this movie reminded me more of the rom/com that was neither romantic nor comedic, The Breakup, than an comic action movie.

While the action scenes were fine, the plot had viewers sitting and watching their parents fight and screaming ""good one Mom!"" ""Way to pound her Dad!"" I mean, really, what are these characters supposed to be for viewers? HEROES. How does one enjoy watching one hero beat up, not a bad guy, but a good guy? Another character that is supposed to be your ""hero"".

To borrow from an old phrase, with fans like that, what comic book hero needs enemies.

And a bit of a spoiler alert, the ending is much like the resolution in The Breakup as well. An hour and 46 minutes to get that?! Obviously, I must be taking the roles of the comic book heroes too seriously. Much like Batman v. Superman, fans watching them bash EACH OTHER for a couple of hours seems to be good fun for many. To me, it just seems the writers have run out of good plot lines and have turned to eating their own tails, so to speak.",1

And then Marvel dragged the storyline through extra thick molasses. The film became as dull and boring as so many other Marvel movies. I just do not get the logic behind these movies. Very average.

7 May 2016,Amazing.,"Just saw the movie this morning with my roommate. I have heard great things about this movie and I thought that I was going to cry given how the Avengers are dividing over the issue of government oversight. I haven't picked a team and I don't think I will. I'm a mix, I guess.

Anyway, back to the movie. Wow. Woo-hoo! This movie is a wild ride of action, effects and story. I haven't read any of the comics, but I have been following most Marvel movies, and this one did not disappoint in the least. Even though the story is more mature and brooding, there is also plenty of humorous moments, especially in Tom Holland's Spiderman.

People, those fans were not kidding. This Spiderman flat out steals every scene that he's in with his humor, agility, nerdy persona and Tom Holland is the perfect choice to harbor Marvel's youngest superhero. He even looks a little like Toby Maguire. He was undoubtedly the best part of the movie, even though he didn't get much screen time. Totally looking forward to the new Spiderman movie due next year.

Another huge highlight is the jealousy between Bucky and Falcon. Maybe jealousy isn't the right word, but these two do not exactly get along. Their moments together, though brief in number, are awfully hilarious as well.

Wondering what's going to happen in the next movies to come. This one really helps set the field for what Infinity War will possibly bring in the future. Check out this movie. It's quite a ride",10
18 September 2016,"Good narrative base, which produces good action but doesn't have the heft it suggests it wants","I was not overly taken with the previous Avengers film, but I have enjoyed the Captain America series – although, being honest, if I watched them unaware of the title, I would not be able to tell one over the other with much success. This one in particular feels like an ensemble piece (as they all do) although the return of the Winter Soldier and the focus on Captain America does make it fit. The plot as themes of vigilantism, of revenge, of anger, all of which spin around each other with an air that suggests the film is trying to blur moral lines between the characters.

In theory it does this reasonably well – or at least to describe it out loud it sounds like it must work. In the film though it doesn't seem to push for this aspect so much as just use it. So the film is driven by this, and all the characters have equal validity and tragedy to their motivations; however this is not the same as it being done with a lot of brain and heart. In this regard it doesn't deliver, although it does provide a more interesting base than the usual 'global threat from beyond' that some of the other films have had. On this it builds good action; for sure they are often large and with plenty going on, but many have good fluidity of movement and dramatic delivery – the action has some weight to it, rather than feeling like watching someone play a video game.

The performances are all well-judged, with good mix of humor and dramatic presence. For sure it is not a film where the actors will bother the awards season too much, but they sell their characters and their threads well. There are perhaps too many characters for them to really do them all justice (Spiderman for instance feels rushed into the film, and more about making another film I think); by contrast a cameo for Antman was enjoyable. Mostly the focus is kept reasonably tight on the main few, and the new characters generally add to the themes (Black Panther).

It isn't brilliant but it is an enjoyable blockbuster with an interesting narrative base, enjoyable plotting, and action which does more than just wiggle its CGI in your face.",
30 April 2016,Nailed it.,"Captain America: Civil War is directed by Anthony & Joe Russo and stars Chris Evans, Robert Downy Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Daniel Brül and last but definitely not least, Tom Holland.

After another incident involving destruction, chaos and death, the Avengers are required to sign a contract with a governing body to ensure they are only called upon when absolutely vital. Tony Stark and Steve Rogers become enemies due to a disagreement and the other Avengers are caught in the crossfire.

Firstly I'd like to state that I'm not overly keen on how 70% of movies these days are centred around superheroes or their respective universes. I've always enjoyed the instalments Marvel have been releasing in the MCU canon and this is no different... But yet it is.

Anthony and Joe Russo so skilfully directed 'The Winter Soldier' that I had no doubts for 'Civil War' and I had a deep feeling it would be perfect. I was right. This is how you direct a superhero movie. Take note Zach Snyder and DC Comics, because this is entertainment.

The action sequences are so brilliantly directed and shot that it's impossible to keep your eyes off the screen. It's fast-paced, rapid, clean and smart. If you've seen their work before then you know how beautiful their direction is. And not just in the action sequences; the real conflict and deceit between these heroes is written extremely well and shows you both sides to the story. It's really hard to decide who you side with as a viewer, and that's what is truly wonderful and unique about this movie. It has you rooting for both sides of the argument, regardless of who your favourite characters are.

Along with the usual team of Avengers we have some newcomers; Black Panther and Spider-Man. Chadwick Boseman did a terrific job as Panther and settles conveniently into the story. I look forward to seeing more of this character in future instalments. Tom Holland as Spidey. Perfect. He has an incredible balance between the web-slinger and teenager Peter Parker. He was introduced into the MCU nicely and was actually involved a lot more than I had expected, which was a great surprise. He handles the comedy with absolute ease and had the entire theatre laughing in all of his scenes. I am stunned and cannot wait to see more of him!

Music by Henry Jackman is just as tense and gritty as it was in 'The Winter Soldier' and as the screenplay evolves, the new 'Civil War' theme gravitates to the foreground. Instead of a mash of motifs, Jackman decided that it would be easier to have one overall theme. I appreciate this decision.

My verdict; Captain America: Civil War had major potential to be a disappointment. But luckily the Russo brothers came through just as they did before with a complete masterpiece. This is now my favourite MCU instalment by far. Go and see this movie.

Captain America: Civil War, 10/10.",9

8 May 2022,"The Avengers, but better","I really love this film. Ive always liked when superheroes get involved in politics and that stuff and in this movie it is presented and manage in the best way possible. Despite having a lot of characters the film is still about captain america and his journey in finding bucky. But there is also development for some other characters that appear. You could argue that compared to the comic, this movie is really dissapointing but still, the movie manages to be great in its own unique way. I just wished there were more heroes involved so it could really feel like a war, but aside from that I think this movie is perfect.

10 May 2016,"Not really a Civil War, but a great Superhero-Fight nonetheless!","By a civil war, I understand a brutal conflict between several parties in an urban surrounding over a longer period of time, and this was rather a street fight between a bunch of superhero-friends, who once confronted with the political and moral consequences of their actions, realized that they disagree on certain basic issues and therefore argued it out using their fists and abilities, which was so much fun to watch that I will condone the misleading tag-line.

Especially for a martial arts fan like me, the fantastically choreographed fist fights were the highlight of the movie and the reason why I would like to watch it again on Blu Ray as I found that the 3D technology wasn't developed enough to capture the fast velocity of their movements making them appear slightly jittery. The action scenes were really amazing and didn't seem overlong or bloated.

What I liked about the story is that although it dealt with a lot of characters who all by themselves aspired to be in the spotlight as most of them would ultimately get their own movies like Black Panther for instance, it nevertheless kept a very good balance and followed a clear central theme so that it never felt over-fraught with unnecessary sidelines or was embarrassingly chaotic like ""The Amazon Spider-Man 2"" for instance which was a catastrophe. So I will excuse certain weaknesses that all Marvel movies seem to have which I will describe as a certain immaturity and incompleteness of the plot without giving away any spoilers. After watching it I always feel like I should read the comics in order to get the full picture. With the very popular German actor Daniel Brühl they also introduced a rather unusual villain who brought a new kind of stereotype into the genre, a very quiet manipulator with a tragic human side. It's also interesting to compare the many parallels of the story to the recent ""Batman v. Superman"" movie sharing some main ideas concerning the public control of superheroes placing them under the command of a specific political authority which is all inspired by A. Moore's legendary ""Watchmen"" and in retrospect I find ""Captain America 3"" executed this ideas far better than Singer managed to do with ""Batman v. Superman"".

Another great plus are definitely the new recruits of the Avengers team starting with Spiderman and Antman, who are just marvelous and also the Black Panther and The Vision and Scarletwitch are superb and a rather personal compliment goes to - hot, hotter, - Scarlett Johansson who as Black Widow demonstrated her best performance so far.

All in All I find ""The First Avenger: Civil War"" surpassed it's prequels and also marked a new great highlight of the Marvel cinematic universe.",8

30 March 2020,"When someone tells you to move, tell them ""No. You move!""","This is the best Marvel movie yet! Even if you're not a superhero fan, I still highly recommend this, because it doesn't feel like a superhero movie. Much like ""Winter Soldier"" it's more of a political thriller. It makes you think, and debate about accountability and other important issues, which is very unusual for a superhero film. It's not just mindless action. The action sequences, by the way, are some of the best I've seen in any superhero movie, Marvel or otherwise. They're choreographed so well. There's a lot that goes on, yet you never feel lost or overwhelmed during them. Up until this point, Andrew Garfield was my favorite actor to portray Spider-Man. Move over, Andrew Garfield. Newcomer Tom Holland has taken your spot. I was a bit skeptical when he showed up in the trailers because I thought he sounded way too young. But when he started throwing around one-liners in true Spider-Man fashion, all that doubt instantly went away. Fun fact: Tom Holland starred alongside Chris Hemsworth in ""In The Heart of the Sea,"" and it's because of Hemsworth's recommendation of Holland for the role of Spider-Man to Kevin Feige, the head of Marvel Studios that Holland was cast in the role. Great choice, Chris Hemsworth! I'm excited to see what this young man has in store for the future. This was everything I wanted, and more. Every time I think ""Marvel can't possibly top this,"" they prove me wrong. But that's my worry. I'm worried that every Marvel film will try to outdo the predecessors by being bigger and better every time, until the MCU is eventually crushed by its own unattainable expectations. But until that day, I'll enjoy what the MCU has to offer. I expect great things from the next one: Doctor Strange. Great things, indeed. #TEAMCAP Grade: A+. 10/10. 5/5 stars",10
28 May 2016,Boring,"This one's boring. Not much plot, or at least a plot that rambles all over the place, trying to tie in too many lead characters. This franchise has worked in the past because it doesn't take itself too seriously and the characters usually have plenty of one liners poking fun at themselves and each other. The only place where this happens in this movie is in the airport fight scene.

Generally you know what to expect with this type of movie. But even the teenagers in our house said it was boring. Just a heap of fight scenes at regular intervals in a movie that was just heading towards ... the next one.

The introduction of a young Spiderman was the only humorous part of the movie. And Spiderman's aunt has never been so hot as she is cast here (Marisa Tomei). Look out for Stan Lee's cameo as a FedEx driver too.

9 May 2016,Awesome addition to the Marvel Universe!,"Great action.

All these are shown in trailers so I'm not giving anything away!

Black Panther's car chase has flawless CGI.

Bucky grabs a motorcycle and flips it around in motion.

Spiderman's fanboy is pretty funny. Great actor pick for Spidey.

Personal touches between the characters is a great break in the action.

Another director could have allowed the movie to drag over the 2 1/2 hour behemoth. Never drags, great throughout. Moves along great.

Of course the action and pace accelerates in the 3rd act and is great!

It's a toss up between Avengers and Cap 3 on which is the best. Avengers probably edges out because it was the first group movie that really worked. Sorry X-men.

You'll definitely enjoy it on the big screen and later at home. Saw it in 3D but would also be great in 2D.

Sorry Batman v Superman lovers. I saw it and it's not as good. Saw Batman v Superman in 3D too.

Enjoy and have fun!",9
27 April 2016,Marvel did it better than DC,"First of all, I'm glad that Indonesia had the chance to see this movie one week earlier than U.S.A, and after spending 2 and a half hours watching this movie, I can guarantee you that the wait is worth it..

I must gave all the praise to Marvel for doing this movie way much much better than what DC did with Batman and Superman.. Clearly Russo brothers know how to make a movie about our favorite superheroes battle each other.. Even though it is a multi cast movie with a lot of our favorite stars and character just like Avengers, but the character development for everyone is fair and square with the scene-stealer goes all the way to our young Spider-Man with the wonderful performance from Tom Holland.. Russo brothers did it all, with a really simple story they can develop each of our superhero character proportionally that they can shine on their own.. Such as Black Panther which is for me Chadwick Boseman did an amazing job portraying it..

Overall, it is a superb opening to the Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 3 and definitely can't wait for the Avengers back in action again together in Infinity War",10
12 December 2020,Captain America: Civil War (2016) Review - 9/10,"Captain America: Civil War is in my top five MCU films. This is a movie that I'd show to a person whenever they make fun of me for watching superhero movies. There's action, storytelling, amazing performances by all of the cast, and the Russo brothers in the director's seat. This film has just got it all. And the final fight is also one of the best, and emotional, in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.

13 May 2016,A terribly bloated godawful mess.,"Captain America:civil war is,without question, the most overrated movie ever made.Featuring an extremely incompetent person as an extremely competent villain,the movie drags through the first half and rewards the audience with a cgi fight which looks more or less like a bar fight.And spider man,whose cameo was the most gratuitous and unnecessary,looks cgi and unfinished.The central plot of the movie is utter nonsensense. After boring us with scenes of saving people by loading them into shield helicarrier in Age of Ultron,they are still blaming the heroes?Wouldn't it have made sense blaming Tony Stark for creating Ultron?The plot holes in this movie is big enough to sink the titanic.

And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",5

3 May 2016,Russos Brothers are Amazing,"Like many, I was excited for this movie. After twelve films, I kind of know what Marvel is giving me and that's why I keep coming back. But, despite my excitement, I was getting anxious to find out if the quality met the hype. It exceeded every expectation. From beginning to end, the movie is very engaging and I think I was more invested because I've seen every movie so I have seen everything unfold to this point.

This is definitely a Captain America film because it's all connected to him but it also feels like a mini-Avengers film and even duals as a Iron Man 4 film, simply because everyone has a time to shine. No one is really in there just to fill space.

I am Team Cap all the way but part of me definitely understood Team Iron Man. You really flip flop because you understand each side's motivation.

Black Panther is the star of this though. He was handled perfectly. People who aren't familiar with him are only getting the surface level amount of what he's capable of in this movie, but he;s relentless, regal and steals every scene he is in. Spider-Man comes in second. He is the Spider-Man I have always wanted. I was a fan of Andrew Garfield's portrayal but Tom Holland is definitely superior in this and his abilities are dope. Ant-Man will surprised many people. I thought Team Iron Man was the superior team but Ant-Man is definitely someone you want on your team.

Overall, the Russo Brother know exactly how to handle a superhero film. They know how to balance every element needed to make it solid and re-watchable. Many have an issue with the villain, but I didn't. Underused but still drove the plot forward.

Airport scene is the best superhero action sequence I have ever witness. The overkill with TV spots and clips don't even do it justice. Go see this film!",9
30 June 2023,"Captain America: Civil War (2016) It's serious, but it could be more","A major defect of Marvel movies is the excess of jokes, especially in moments that should be much more serious. However, in the second Captain America movie they took it much more seriously and toned down the jokes and they still did that in Civil War. The problem is that the heroes are battling over political issues and all the time someone cracks a joke at a time they shouldn't. The battles are very good and work very well, especially the final battle. The political dispute could be better, but it still works. The photography is bland and at times the battle seems to have had no effect, so it couldn't even be called a war, considering that not even any deaths happen. The film is very good, but its flaws are very large and it is impossible not to notice.

8 May 2016,Civil Bore,"Civil War is a disgustingly contrived bore that champions the moral that the friendships of the powerful few triumph over the lives of the many. 117 sovereign nations come together to craft a peaceful treaty to reign in the Avengers, but Captain America decides his life's calling is to reject any limit to his authority. The fight between allies was as pointless as Batman V. Superman, yet somehow worse, and the comedy lacked its typical punch. The only redeemable part of this movie was the Black Panther, a character with rational thought and believable justifications, but he is practically drowned in the catastrophic melting pot that is Captain America: Civil War.

28 April 2016,Perfect example of how to make a great super hero film!,"I'm not usually keen on giving such high scores, just look at my other reviews.But at the same time, this film had a lot of expectations and a lot to make up for. Avengers 2 was pretty boring, not funny and not very entertaining movie. Plus with Batman v Superman getting released before this, Captain America: Civil war had it tough. This movie probably doesn't deserve a solid 9, but it does deserve to stand out from other comic book movies, because it should be an example of how to correctly make a super hero movie. Captain America, had more Avengers then first two Avengers film put together. It showcased new characters and gave more back story to; Black Panther, Ant-man, Vision, Scarlet Witch and Spider-man. That is a lot of new super heroes to give screen time, considering you still have the big players like Captain America, Iron-man, War Machine, Black Widow, Hawk-eye, Winter Soldier and Falcon. This film does an excellent job at handling so many heroes, not the same thing can be said for Avengers 2 or Batman V Superman, which failed to keep you balanced between 3 heroes and 2 villains.

The Marketing on the film was great, i was really going in expecting to see a full civil war between Cap and Iron-man, but the way the did it in the film was pretty good, the whole build up of the two sides was really good, and the fight between all heroes was much awesome! Yes, it really was Awesome! with many heroes using their techniques and new skills or fight scenes.

Spider-man in this film was brilliant. I really hope Sony doesn't screw it up and continue to make him work at being a better franchise. He really did a great job at being the comic relief.

The story had few hiccups, but nothing to major, as it was overlooked by the bigger picture. Moments in the film, where you would go as a critic and say ""That character would not make that decision, or he is to smart to think like that"" but even that wasn't as bad as seeing Ultron lose to Avengers 2 or Batman being played the whole film in Batman v Superman.

Like i said, this film might not deserve a 9/10, but it gets from me because it does deliver what so many heroes film have failed to do.",9
3 May 2016,Trash Trash Trash! Sorry,"Sorry, but with billion dollars on hands I'd probably do a better and decent movie than this sh!t that was made! And the worst part is that this thing called movie was nominated ""The best marvel studio movie ever made since"" Like what?! Seriously, you can fall sleep while watching this. It's not interesting, It's not worth watching, It's not good, It looks like a copy of BVS - REALLY! -

Anyway, go to the movies if u want to and see for yourself. Just warning and putting up my point of view.

I do not hate Marvel , but this movie was overrated and not everything they say when watched with a real critical eye , not biased.

8 April 2023,One MCU film that presents an epic battle between Tony and Steve,"After the battle in Sokovia, the world government made rules to regulate the activities of the Avengers so as not to cause more damage. This plan creates a rift between Iron Man and Captain America, causing a civil war between them.

Civil War is the anti-climax of the Avengers story along with Iron Man and Captain America. A political story involving two camps that makes the storyline not focused on Captain America's story alone. This film goes deeper and further into their internal problems as members of a group containing superheroes. Civil War has brought a sense of division from the beginning of the story. Making this film is quite firm and fast enough to show their side of internal divisions. Similar to the previous film (The Winter Soldier), Civil War brings the story of the Avengers with dense material. The plot is not much with a long-winded drama story, but comes with conflicts that come continuously. Neatly constructed in every scene and dialogue. Also a good story is brought gradually to the problem of the story. One of the excitement of Civil War is the presence of new characters such as Black Panther and Spider-Man. There is also a large portion for Vision and Scarlett Witch in this film. One more interesting and exciting thing is the battle scene both at the airport and the two-on-one battle between Tony Stark, Steve Rogers and Bucky. Unfortunately in this case, Zemo got an unsatisfactory story completion even though Zemo's performance in this film was very stunning and memorable.",9
25 September 2022,What a crossover...,"""Captain America: Civil War"" follows a feud/rivalry between the Iron-man and Captain America which leads to some amazing story-telling and some phenomenal fight scenes

Before the greatest cross-over in Cinema history in Avengers: infinity and endgame we had ""Civil War"". This was simply a brilliant cross-over movie with a good story and amazing fight and action scenes. It had my attention from start to end. Even if I wanted to I have a hard time finding major flaws in this. (Also loved the surprise entrant when Tony and Rogers' teams fought, not saying anymore than that, have to watch for yourselves.)

16 April 2016,One of the Best MCU Movies So Far,"I was lucky enough to see an early screening of this movie. From the opening scene till the final battle, I was completely blown away. First off I'm gonna start by talking about the performances.This is the best acting we've seen in the MCU hands down. To highlight a few, Robert Downey Junior gives a Tony Stark a more personal side that we have yet to completely see if him. Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland are both perfectly casted as Black Panther and Spider-Man respectively.

The action was great. The relationships that these characters have built over the course of several movies creates a new level of complexity that makes these fight sequences more emotional and powerful. The Airport Battle is the best action scene in the MCU and is rivaled only by the Quicksilver scene from DOFP.

The final thing I have to say about what made this movie so damn good, was the fact that all of the events in this movie are permanent and will have a long lasting impact. The only complaint I've had with the MCU is the fact that most of the events in their movies are resolved by the climax and there is no lasting impact on future films. While no future films have come out at the time I've written this review, it still seems safe to say that the events in this movie will have a permanent effect on the rest of the MCU.

It is rare that I go into a movie with this high of expectations and i leave the theater completely blown away. 10/10 Great Movie",9

9 May 2016,Waste of time,"Downside: I wanted to leave the cinema after 1 hr to go study in the lobby (at 00:00)

Upside: I've learnt a great deal from this movie and it hasn't even ended yet( since i am writing this from the theater and the film is still on, they're fighting-what a surprise). I've learnt that culture isn't always positive. American culture with all its heroes, all its need to save innocent lives is just a hypocrisy trying to mask the atrocities US has committed through history. At least I thought it is going to be enjoyable, you can never really hate every single part of the movie. I learnt the contrary too. Idiotic screen writing, I could guess what they were about to say. Not even the actors could save this piece of excrement. I tried to sleep through it at some point thinking the pain will go away. My boyfriend is a fan and though I could hear his unsatisfied, thirsty, clenched anger, he wanted to see what happens so I had to stay. The reason I couldn't sleep is the fact that my anger started kicking in more and more every time I heard someone talk. People actually laughed once for like 3 seconds at this very idiotic joke. Now i might have some anger issues but this movie made me go full animal. Also very long. I wish IMDb had the ""attach photo"" option so i could immortalize my face's disgusted look and share it with the world.",1
8 May 2016,"Thankfully, not a let-down","Captain America Civil War is the Marvel movie I've been looking forward to for a while. I've lost interest in the Marvel Cinematic Universe after several forgettable films post the first Avengers movie, but this partially restores my faith. It's not a masterpiece like everyone's saying it is. I think people are just so relieved it didn't turn out like Batman Vs. Superman they're giving it ludicrously high ratings. It takes a little while to get going and the political themes are handled with the simplicity of a primary school politics lesson, but the emotional stuff is handled very well. The collapse in the Avengers alliance is believable and sad, the humour is still there, the action scenes are awesome and the Russo Brothers once again prove themselves fine directors. The performances are all-around excellent, with Robert Downey Jr. giving possibly his best MCU performance to date. I have a bad feeling that once the dust settles people will look upon this less favourably, but this is a very good blockbuster, and tells the story of a small-scale superhero conflict (In the comics the civil war seems to have been far bigger) with intelligence, humour and glorious pyrotechnics.

13 March 2022,One of the most mature marvel films,"In the process of saving the world the Avengers have caused some damage and many people are starting to take notice. This causes the government to put this group in check and manage what exactly it is they will do. On one side of things certain characters are agreeing on the other they are not, causing the avengers to split.

This movie is probably the best written film in the MCU at the point of its release. The movie does a really good job of showing that actions have consequences, it shows that although the avengers are saving a lot of people they are also causing the deaths of many people. Each character in this film needs to make a life changing decision and the writers do a really good job of showing why each person chose each side. In addition to that you have the theme of friendship and the theme of vengeance which are both handled very well and the film shows what can happen when friendship and vengeance are intertwined.

This a movie of two plots though, on one hand you have the Sokovia accords and on the other you have this continuing story with Captain America and the Winter soldier. The film does a really good job of not only intertwining the two plots but also making them both equally important.

Every actor did an amazing job with their character. Like I said each character has their own mini arc and each actor did a great job with that. Chadwick Boseman was great as Black Panther and Tom Holland was also great as Spider-Man.

The semi antagonist to this film is Zemo played by Daniel Bruhl. The characters motives are not revealed until the end of the movie, this is a problem for two reasons. First it makes his character seem like no more than a moustache twirling villain and second he isn't all that interesting. The intrigue for this character needed to come earlier, since that intrigue wasn't there whenever he is on screen and following his side of the plot the only thing the audience is thinking is ""when are we getting back to the avengers conflict"".

The action is highly entertaining here and what I believe to be the best action since the Avengers (at the point of its release). They have a lot of truly realistic action since there are a lot of hand to hand combat, but because they have other types of characters you also get the more sci-fi type action and it is handled very well.

Overall a great movie, amazing character writing, great action scenes and some great character introductions all add up to a great film.

Many people complain about Zemo not been important to the movie but take him out of it and there is almost no reason for characters to fight also one of MCU best villain as he didn't need to fight yet he achieved his plan. Yes there will be DC fans nitpicking at silly things but don't listen you need to see this to believe!!!!!!!! Cant wait for Avengers infinity war surely gonna blow us out of the water. As a fan of comic book movies, i feel this is up there with the likes of the dark knight

8 November 2022,Iron Man vs. Captain America,"Almost like War vs. Peace, yet it was mostly Security vs. Freedom. It seemed to end a bit unexpectedly from my view with the story, but quite unpredictable and a fine continuation for the Avengers squad. It seems to prove that there will be another build-up to something even bigger in the future. Ant-Man makes his first debut in joining the gang as well as a couple other new heroes making their first appearances as well. It's obvious enough to know this film as ""Captain America 3"" and not ""Iron Man 4."" I was fairly entertained as usual with the action scenes, and overall it was a pretty unexpected and yet also an expected enough complex story that in hope will be a seriously memorable time for the Avengers group (and also hopefully a lesson well taught).

9 May 2016,AVENGERS PART 3! What BVSS should have been ..but failed to do.,"Captain American 2 was a great movie, one of my favorites in the Marvel world. The fist Avengers film was a fantastic one as well.. .this one surpasses both in a way that defies convention.

The plot is different in that it is adult and strong in theme. The characters are established and so we are invested in what happens to them. Usually a 3rd outing of a film is weak and disappointing, so imagine my surprise when i see this EPIC ACTION film better than the last 2 captain America movies. Which is a rare thing to do in the cinematic world.

I don't want to give spoilers away, but SPIDERMAN steals the show, and BLACK PANTHER or whoever Mr. Catwoman is lol is pretty cool. At the core of the film, the theme is friendship and loyalty. Watching Iron Man VS. Captain America fight, its inevitable to not compare to that other little film that came out this year where 2 male superheroes were pinned against each other.. and one can see this IS WHAT that other film should have been.

The action sequences looked incredible, the special effects fantastic and the dual loyalty we have between both teams is an excellent psychological sell for it makes us root for both teams, understand both teams and ultimately cry for both teams (no I did not cry lol) but man was i ENTERTAINED !

As the final entry in the CAP AME. trilogy, this is going out with a damm BANG!

This is the definition of a blockbuster film. (ps. ANTMAN WAS KIND OF AWESOME)

1 May 2016,An absolutely spoiler-free comment,"OK, saw Civil War two times already here in Peru, the second time just yesterday April 30th with my 73 years-old father that really loves movies since he was young. He knows and loves everything Superman-related, and even so, he couldn't help but snore through BvS (almost the same with MoS back then). But oh boy! yesterday at the theater i saw my father laughing and even clapping like he was a 13 years old kid watching the ""serials"" he sometimes tell me about! It was that good!. On my first watch on April 27th (first screening), the theater was packed and the crowd reaction was the best i have seen since the first Avengers movie, but that was nothing compared with seeing my old man's reactions. I just wanted to share this because if any movie deserves to be ranked top just by the sheer joy it causes, is this one. An excellent movie, full of surprises (I have seen just the first trailer prior to watching the movie, and avoided spoilers like the plague). Acting-wise, the characters were spot-on, some of the best moments were the ones without any special effect, and the ones that used them were wisely edited. About the villain: a superb and realistic plan (within the boundaries of their universe). Only minor gripe was Martin Freeman overacting. Otherwise, the introduction of characters (new to the universe or to the Captain/Avengers films) was perfect, and rest assured, this is the best on-film version of the web-crawler yet!

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",4
6 May 2016,Against All Odds (So to Speak),"War – It's kind of funny (but not really) how the word ""war"" pops up and everyone gets a little on the fidgety side. It's like something is wrong every time when war strikes and all hell breaks loose. That's in our world. That's in our society. But we don't live in the fantasy mind of Stan Lee. We were taught that war or violence, for that matter, solves anything. (Yes, this is how I wanted to start out with this review.) In 2011, we were introduced to a young man who lived in Brooklyn with nothing more than the shirt on his back – Steve Rogers. All he wanted to do was to fight the bad guy. He got his shot when he was recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. to become the first superhuman fighting machine, to bring down a ruthless enemy who was plotting an evil that could break the mold of extinction.

In 2014, (just 3 years later), Captain America was synonymous, in the very sense of the word in the hearts and minds of every American. That same evil that he fought as The First Avenger, has now infiltrated the government of the United States of America and corrupting the world system.

In 2016, we thought we got rid of Hydra, but we were dead wrong. The very existence of the organization was to wipe out the world so they can take over and plot against the Avengers. Over the course of a few years' time, Hydra has stopped at nothing to plot against the existence of mankind. In Captain America: Civil War, we see two sets of teams – the government team vs. the heroes. I am not going to say too much about this movie except this – WOW!!!! That's the word I am looking for. Led by an all star-studded cast – Chris Evans and Robert Downey, Jr. lead a cast of incredible talent that could make the world think twice of waging war against one another. It was all because of a little brainwash. (Oops, said too much already).

Joe Johnston who started all of this was just the beginning, but when the Russo brothers (Anthony and Joe) took over – well let's just say that they took this series to a whole new level.

Now, if you have not seen this new movie, then I will not spoil it for you, but I will say this stay a little after, because there is a post-credits scene that you do not want to miss.

All-in-all, Captain America: Civil War exploded! And it will continue to explode.",10
29 April 2016,Just Awesome,"Saw the movie earlier and i was just blown away! This maybe the best Marvel movie yet or comicbook movie yet. Very well paced and well written, you won't feel a couple of hours has passed. The action sequences alone is worth the money - particularly airport scene was just pure joy and jaw dropping.

With so many characters and superheroes, everyone still got a chance to shine.I was particularly happy with the appearance of Spiderman, Black Panther and Antman! Can't wait for their solo movies in the future, definitely checking them out.

This is a MUST watch! Will probably watch it again a couple more times!

29 April 2016,A thoroughly entertaining movie from start to finish with exhilarating action sequences and intriguing personal motivations that gives gravitas to the comic book movie genre.,"Digression : I saw this film at Trinoma in Cinema 5. I was excited to be going in early for the trailers but my excitement turned into disappointment when they dedicated the majority of the screen time for trailers to advertisements. Since this film is property of Walt Disney Studios, the trailers that show up are also upcoming projects of Disney. While this is a brilliant marketing strategy for Disney, it is also a cruel one for the other studios especially the indie ones. This will hurt the other studios' box office numbers and potentially ruin the success of indie films. I hope in the near future Disney Studios would give way to the other studios for the betterment of the film industry. But we all know that wont happen anytime soon. On with the review! When the world divides their opinions about the future operations of the world's greatest heroes, Steve Rogers and Tony Stark's political opinions clash causing the divide of the Avengers. Let me start by saying that the action, drama and comedy in this film are well balanced and well executed which crafts a smooth and seamless story line. This is the amazing work that the Russo Brothers are capable of. The implementation of comedy for a movie like this was needed to be executed carefully and they managed to pull it off. While the tension builds between Captain America and Iron Man, we get to deeply explore their character motivations and beliefs throughout the movie. With the previous heroic acts that Tony Stark had, we are now met with a guilty and troubled character. His matured character arc was interesting to dissect because we see him constantly trying to contain each member of the Avengers and take responsibility for their actions while handling the diplomatic relations and internal heartbreak that was caused by Pepper Potts. On the opposite corner, we have Steve Rogers who is fighting for his beliefs even if he has to go against the law just to protect his long time friend Bucky. These character depths add emotional weight to the story which leads us to have more difficulty on which team to root for as both sides have been well developed. The new heroes that are introduced to us in this movie are Black Panther and Spider-Man. They were given enough screen time and their performances were amazing. I'm surprised that Black Panther was given a lot of screen time considering that the audience isn't familiar with his background. Spider-Man was a strong element in this film. The scenes he's in provide comedic relief, but his CGI suit looked very unrealistic and half-baked. One nitpick I have for this movie is that when we are transported to a different place or another time line, there are these huge, white texts that pop out of the screen. It didn't ruin the whole movie for me but it was a bit distracting. The action scenes in here are amazing. The way team members capitalize on their abilities by working together and mixing up their offenses is a spectacle to behold. Each battle is intense and the final battle between Captain America and Iron Man will send shivers down your spine and that freeze frame during their final battle will make your jaw drop. Final thoughts : Comic book readers might not appreciate it that much because the film differs itself a little. What comic book readers should understand here is that the MCU(Marvel Cinematic Universe) is riding on the momentum and the world they created. Films are harder to produce and it takes a lot of time and patience to set up character backgrounds. In the end this is the closest adaptation we will get and it was a damn great effort. This was a very entertaining movie with interesting layers and deep character motivations. The audience that i saw it with even clapped because of sheer enjoyment and I left the cinema with a huge smile on my face I give Captain America : Civil War a 9/10",9
8 May 2016,It was completely what a Superhero movies should be like !,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character.

5 May 2016,So...Just saw Civil War...IT WAS FRICKING AWESOME!!!,"This movie defines the definition of awesome! This movie is amazing! I absolutely loved it! Thank you Marvel for creating the superhero movie that we deserve! None of that Batman V Superman crap! Ohh no! This is how you do a movie about superheroes fighting each other! This movie can even live up to the epic of the first Avengers! Wow!!! I felt so excited and pumped up in every scene of this movie...Even the boring talking parts. Seriously! Oh my god this is such an awesome film. The first half of the film was good but the second half after the intermission was by far the best part about the movie! Also, another thing, I loved Spider-Man in this movie. Nerdy and Funny! I'm really excited for Tom Holland to continue with HIS take on Spider-Man! Thanks for reading!

13 May 2016,Exceeds Expectations,"http://www.metacritic.com/user/SeanVincent

Captain America Civil War exceeds expectations to everyone waiting for this film for a long time.It's the year's best superhero film so far,out of all superhero films that will be coming out.Captain America third outing brings emotional weight and seriousness and it feels more mature than any Marvel film.The action scenes were great and executed well especially the last scene and also the airport sequence.Characters are well written and gives time to shine especially spider-man,who in my opinion the best Peter Parker/Spider-man ever put on screen even if he appears for 20 minutes in length and Black Panther who is such a great addition to the franchise .The story centers in Sokovia accords and also Bucky- Steve friendship,those two plot lines were pretty much well handled and didn't feel out of place.The Villain was good in my opinion, he was given a clear motivation and you can easily follow his plans,well some people may think he is just boring,for me he is interesting.The only problems is that some scenes,The CGI is noticeable.

This film can be a mess like the other film that ha the same premise but because of the level of confidence and love for the film makes this a well written,well performed,well balanced,well paced,well edited and a fun blockbuster film.",8
9 May 2016,One of the best superhero films ever!,"Awesome film! The plot is well- derived from the original comic, and each scenes all stick to one another, making the story line ran through smoothly. The depiction of each character is remarkable. You can really understand why they chose their side, with solid reasons, so that everything makes sense. The interaction between each character was a highlight as well, with occasionally funny moments, bringing this film to a next level. The soundtrack was amazing! The music really add on emotions on each sense, whether it was intense, troubled, or depress. The only part wasn't that satisfying was the part of Zemo. He didn't feel like a character full of personality, which he should be. He seems to be there only because they need someone to be at there spot, not for a strong reason.

6 May 2016,Civil war beats Deadpool!!!!!×o×o👌🏻 nuf said!,"I didn't really had hopes from Spider man, This Movie just hyped me for whatever next is coming From Marvel. And i was super hyped to see how Black panther was gonna fit in, it was just more than expected. My Favorite Superhero is Batman, but this movie just beats everything I've seen in last 2-3 Years. If you go by having less expectations than BVS, You're gonna Enjoy every single second of this movie, coz from my past 2-3 years of movie experience, which was always less than what i was expecting. I mean just go and watch it god-damn, this is by far the best movie marvel has made i don't know what DC fans might say,(BTW I'm also a DC fan (BATMAN FAN) ) but whatever. Civil war IMAX 3D Best Decision ever.

8 May 2016,"Disappointing, but still okay.","I have generally liked all the Marvel superhero movies, but some less than others (obviously). I had high hopes for this one, which might be why I ended up so disappointed in the result.

Most of the movie is built around the quarreling between the heroes themselves, but this ends up being uninteresting, and feel more like an excuse to have them go at each other. But even the fights have such low stakes that it's hard to get much excited for them.

The villain's plot makes little sense (to me), and seems to be based a lot on luck. Without going into to much detail, it would have been impossible for the villain to anticipate and plan for the situation in the end. But perhaps we are supposed to understand that he is just improvising some sort of plan B? Either way, it was not very interesting.

The movie does some things right, though. The movie did not feel over crowded, despite the absurd amount of heroes involved in it. They all felt like they belonged in the roles they were in. Ant-man and Spider-man stole every scene they were in giving me hope for the future of the marvel movies.",6
4 May 2016,A fun watch,"I liked most parts, especially the plot, the cast, the characters, the visuals and the spectacular action sequences. Indeed, I was blown away by some action scenes. We are dealing with incredible CGI and good fight choreography. And we did not see the best parts in the trailer. I love that. The mood was fitting and the humor toned down a bit (fewer one-liners than in AoU. I loved that the movie seemed to address every single movie in this universe. I cared about the conflict and felt invested. Even though the movie was ridiculously long, it was intense and exciting.

But a few things made me cringe. Ant-Man, Black Panther and Spider-Man felt shoe-horned (people are right to say this) into the movie in a shameless way; it was all so superficial. Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye and Vision were as awful as ever.

The actual civil war bit was also a tad disappointing. It felt obvious that none of the heroes were in any real danger, and that none of the combatants were trying to harm each other seriously. Yes, some of them gets hurt - but we can never fully view this as actual damage done with intent. Not until the very end did I feel that someone could easily die from this situation; and even then news of future movie releases had spoiled who will NOT die. The MCU has again spoiled the fun for the viewers by announcing upcoming movies too soon.

The conflict between Rogers and Stark was believable. Even though I was hoping for a different outcome to the final conflict, I didn't feel cheated.

Like I said, seven out of ten. It is a reasonable grade. I will probably acquire the movie later for a re-watch.",

17 May 2016,Avengers: Civil War,"For the past eight years, and a combined total of thirteen movies, Marvel has been doing everything right for when it came to CBM's. Even their less than stellar films (Iron Man 3 and Age of Ultron) still managed to bring the fun, because in the end that's what we want: something fun and memorable.

I loved the new Captain America movie; however, I don't think the title is fitting. I think it should have been Avengers: Civil War, because honestly that's what it was. With Captain America in the title he should have the dominating presence of the whole film. Instead, each character has equal shared screen time.

One thing that this movie does well is it brings on the emotions, and hard. As a friend of mine said once we were done watching the movie, ""I never expected to cry this much during a Marvel movie."" That's one of the biggest driving factors the movie has. You feel for every single character for different reasons. It's not only emotional for the characters on screen, it's also emotional for the viewers watching, maybe even more so because we're connecting with them all.

The action and fight choreography is amazing. Watching Black Panther fight was like watching a ballet. Winter Soldier is an all-around badass. Everything he does (the good and the bad) leaves your mouth open in awe.

Finally, we have a great villain. This man isn't just evil for the sake of being evil. He has a backstory that justifies what he's doing. He has a motive, and his motive is actually pretty rational, even though it's not right. Plus, he actually pulled it off. When you start sympathizing with the enemy, the filmmakers are doing something right.

I had my reservations about the new Spiderman at first, but after watching him in action I can sigh with relief. Black Panther is hands down my favorite part of the movie. His character is strong- willed, he knows what he wants, and he sets out to do it no matter what. He's also very calm and rational in what he does. He's respectable, as he should be. Both Ant-man and Spiderman offer up some great comic relief.

The way this movie was made is how all movies should be made, not just CBM's.",8
28 April 2016,Whoever loses... the audience wins,"The amount of collateral damage leads the UN to pass the Sokovia Accords. Accountability for The Avengers. This leads to a split down the middle of the team, for reasons political as well as personal. Can they trust the government? This time? Which matters most: Security vs. civil liberties? Which side is right? Who's to say? Well, who will emerge victorious? Will they be able to all work together ever again? And just how far might they go, for their point of view, against those they've fought beside, some for several years? This joins the select, short list of the very best of the whole franchise, with the two team outings and Cap's second movie. Marvel... this expanding universe, just, keep the pictures coming. We'll keep going to them. As long as they're this compelling we will. Do note that this expects you to be well-versed in these. Of course, you can just take in Age of Ultron, and you'll be completely prepared for this.

If the Russos needed to prove that they could take over from Whedon, then this film should settle the matter. Every character is well-represented, in every respect. They make the juggling act look easy. And yes, they have a sense of humor in there, and it fits. Do expect less quipping. Even Tony(Downey Jr., reaching a new level of loss), as pointed out in this, is subdued in this aspect. And the first MCU all-out, heroes taking each other, not the villains, on... so many potential match-ups, exploring interpersonal relationships, power dynamics, trust, and this just plain delivers. Oh, and, are you even remotely into Spider-Man? Watch this, even if that's the one element you're interested in. He's not in it much, of course, but he's spot-on every second of it, he gets a lot of the best moments, and it's just such a sheer joy to see, sixth live action appearance, and Feige's first shot at it, they completely understand him and bring the panels to life. No one could have convinced me that I'd be eager for the third continuity in less than a decade.

There is some dark, disturbing and violent content in this. I recommend this to any fan of modern spy thrillers. 10/10",10
10 July 2021,One of the best Marvel films,"I loved the film when I've first seen it in the cinema back in 2016 and I still love it today after many rewatches.

It still hurts when I see them fight against each other but it's just too awesome.

With Zemo there is a not typical but amazing villain and the superhero cast is outstanding.

One of the best Marvel films for sure.

30 April 2021,The Avengers:Civil War,"Debatably the smartest and most unique mcu film. From the beginning of the film it picks off instantly and sets the tone for the film really well. I love how the avengers are faced to realise the aftermath and damage that they have caused and how it creates a strong divide and a conflict between friends, allies. What is so gripping about it is that both sides have strong arguments which makes the audience jump between sides and look at the teams views from a separate angle. There is some confusion amongst all the politics like how captain America didn't tell tony that Bucky was framed, I can't understand that but it makes no difference. The action is probably the best out of any mcu film, the choreography is amazing, the camera angles even better. The soundtrack...omg the soundtrack is excellent especially when they clash at the airport, I got goosebumps. The movie has quite a strong emotional tole as well, mainly towards the end, just watching these characters beat the hell out of each other after such long development and friendships built up between one another. The villain is really strong aswell, I'm not saying he's unique but it was bold for a marvel movie to use a villain with no real physical attributes that are superior to the heroes. I cannot praise this movie enough and frankly it is a bit underrated against the other marvel movies. 9/10 Solid stuff.",9
1 May 2016,The Russo Bros do it again!,"Well, what can I say? If you haven't watched this film, get up and watch it! In my opinion this is one of the best Marvel films since The Avengers. Clever dialogue and good old fashion story telling is what makes this movie so fantastic. First of all I would like to say how pleasantly surprised I was by the introduction of Spider Man into the Marvel Cinematic universe. It was a beautiful transition and I particularly like how Tony Stark fills the mentor role in Spidey's life.

Another awesome intro was Black Panther. The character is well portrayed by Chadwick Boseman and I greatly look forward to watching the Panther stand alone movie next year. Chadwick adds new depth to the film, a depth the movie used to its advantage.

Daniel Brühl's portrayal of Baron Zemo (or Zemo) is understated which enhances the movie greatly. Brühl's performance is not the copy and paste villain who seems to populate a lot of Marvel movies. Instead he is credible and, unusually, the audience can sympathise with him.

The Russo brothers didn't disappoint at all. Their inspired direction really brings the film to life. The added aspect of Stark's origin ties the bow perfectly for me personally. Every frame feels painstakingly analysed which is the trademark of a good director (or should I say directors).

Overall, the performances are spectacular and the structure of the story is very well organised. However, I do feel like this is more of an Iron Man/Avengers movie than a Captain American one. This isn't a problem though, as every character is developed just enough. I would give Captain America: Civil War 8 out of 10 because this is everything a comic book movie should be.",8
29 May 2016,Surprised Stupid Script Was Approved By All!,"Can't understand why Hollywood writers, producers, directors and especially the Actors would agree to conceive a blockbuster major movie purely based on internal differences with political bullshit dividing the Avenger's to practically kill each other! Yea great idea, lets make a movie! Where suddenly Radical Evil risings of powerful villains killing and destroying thousands is blamed on The Avengers who battle to stop them? I only watched this movie to see the characters and some action but really felt like I was watching many boyhood Icon's & Heroes being taken down a notch because some movie moguls decided pitting The Avenger's against each other just for a thoughtless mindless excuse for a movie when nothing else was considered! I don't see Marvel enlightening youths with scripts like this.

29 April 2016,"Hard hitting, mature filmmaking crossed with action-packed, hilarious fun.","The greatest superhero movie ever made? Perhaps not. It's a judgement, I personally can only make after seeing this movie more than once.

What I can say is this: If it were an average affair, the flaws and faults in the structure may have derailed this beast of a movie. But this is no average affair. Too put it simply, this is the best Marvel movie yet. Should there be anything better in the future, this franchise may very well stand as one of the greatest to have ever existed.

We'll start with the flaws as I want them out of the way and they are more niggles than hard errors. The pace is fierce but patchy (what Marvel movie isn't). the beginning especially, is in a big hurry to get through, what is, a great deal of set up. The central conflict of this movie relies heavily on everything that comes before it however and here, character motivations are a little rushed. The ending, also, suffers in the same kind of way.

You could also call a lot of the big moments an unfortunate case of 'I already know what's about to happen'...itis...

HOWEVER!

This is the full blockbuster ingredients list, cooked to near-perfection: Emotionally charged, intelligent, bold, hilarious, action-packed and so much fun. It's a proper grown up affair with a superhero stamp on it. It's engaging, it's interesting, all points on all sides are relevant and understandable and perhaps most importantly, this is firmly, a Captain America movie. Iron Man is there and he's a major player, but he is not the star of the show.

All other players are integral and exciting to watch, especially that very special new player! His intro is hilarious. Even better, every character has a run in with each other at one point or another and most of them ooze amazing and often surprising chemistry with each other. The best of which get the least amount of screen time together, but leave the most satisfying mark.

The overall story is very well thought out. It's spread over several different plot lines, but they all come together as one big, beast of a movie. Like I said, it's patchy, but Civil War makes the absolute most of it's run time to get in what's needed for the story and what is, all but demanded, from the viewer. The Russo brothers have done a very good job here. Infinity War only looks to be more promising with each new movie.

Finally, the emotional heft. It's everywhere in this movie. This isn't a grim affair, but it is dark one. Many punches are inflicted on our heroes and if you love them as much as I do, it can be a hard watch. But it's real and at times, quite heart wrenching. This is a character story at it's core and despite the success of everything else, this, they absolutely needed to make work. And they do. It's not perfect, but it's the best Marvel has done so far to put that lump in your throat. Shed that tear. Make you wish everyone could just get along. But in the end, when the result is a movie this good, you may not actually want them too.

As for sides: There are no easy choices, there are no easy results. There is only first class, grown up filmmaking.

Highlight: The airport tussle. Trust me, the trailer spoils nothing.",9
24 November 2020,Best MCU movie.,"This film rocks for 3 reasons. 1. It has tons of cool action. 2. The storyline is great. 3. It has dozens of superheroes fighting each other at the same time, you don't see that often and it's very well done. Personally I do hate most of MCU, but this film is great. Even if you don't like MCU I'd recommend giving this a chance.

7 May 2016,Terrific,"In short the movie was terrific. In spite of the big cast, the story has been built up beautifully. Every one has had their chance to make a mark in the movie. The fighting scenes were shown beautifully. It was planned and made perfectly. This marks the beginning of the 3rd phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Marvel did it with style. The 3rd phase already got a kick-start. The story had a different theme here. Marvel has always launched a solo film of every superhero before adding them to a cast in the big banner movies. But this time they did well and experimented by adding Black Panther to the cast who hasn't yet had a solo movie. Apart from all the brilliant performances, the addition of Spider- Man to this Universe was welcoming. Hope this phase also builds up the story of Infinity War slowly and steadily. And the road leads to the end in an interesting way. Also waiting for the rest of the movies of the third phase, especially the new heroes that are to be introduced to the Universe. Hope they also does well and the story is connected.

29 April 2016,Not bad......but....not Fun.,"All I can say is......it is about what you would expect from a movie when hero's fight other hero's.

It never really ends well. Yes.....this movie is based on the comic ARC, which I ignored intentionally. But, the trailers for this movie made me think that it might be fun to watch.

It was a long movie. It was at times quiet, and boring. I also missed seeing the Hulk and Thor in the action, so I truly hope that there is something exciting planned for those two in Ragnarok.

I got a chance to see this in Japan, which for some reason premiered a week earlier than in the USA. I kind of wished that I waited for the DVD.

The acting was good. The action was good. I enjoyed seeing Black Panther in action. But...I left this movie feeling like......ehhhhhhh it was OK.

I do hope that Marvel and Disney will read these reviews and consider what the fans want. Because right now, it seems this is not made for the fans.

Over all....solid movie, but leaves you wanting something more. Not more minutes, but more depth.

One more thing, there are two end credits. I left before the 2nd one. Stick around.",5
4 May 2016,An Outstanding Triumph,"Captain America: Civil War is the culmination of the Cap legacy (just with a bunch of other heroes thrown in too.) What started with the First Avenger now ends literally 100 years in the making as Cap now finds himself at odds with Stark and a certain division of his team. As usual, life is breathed into the character thanks to the awesome performance of Chris Evans, who turned the disaster of the Fantastic 4 around and made Captain America all his own. Robert Downey, Jr. is always great as Iron Man, but seems to work better when he has other heroes to bounce off of versus doing a solo film. Both have equal opinions about why they're right, which makes it very hard to distinguish who's right and who's wrong, which is great film-making. Anthony and Joe Russo have clearly shown how to handle a Marvel film. Even if Spider- Man hadn't made the final cut, it still would have been a greatly hyped film. Even though the film is not directly adapted from the comic book altogether, Civil War is an outstanding triumph in every way.

27 April 2016,Stay until the end of the credits!,"This film tells the story of The Avengers who have to be regulated in view of the mass devastation they cause during their missions. However, they are divided on this issue, and neither side is unwilling to back down.

It is interesting to see a ""Captain America"" film becoming an ensemble film, moving from a film about a character to a film like ""The Avengers"". I am slightly disappointed by this, because I like Captain Rogers. However, the resultant story is full of adventure and marvel, exactly because there are many characters involved. The film brings in Ant Man, and even Spiderman, making the film rich with personalities and magical powers (meaning great special effects).

Marvel certainly knows how to make an entertaining superhero action film, with a good balance of adrenaline and comedy. And there are two bonus scenes, remember to stay until the end of the credits.

16 April 2021,A Great Close to the Captain America Trilogy,"This movie was the perfect ending of the Captain America trilogy and was the best way they could break up the Avengers, which of course lead to Infinity War and Endgame, which are probably the best movies in the entirety of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This movie also have great performances, especially by Chris Evans and RDJ, and a very emotional and entertaining story. Overall, this is a very good start to phase three and a great ending of the Captain America trilogy.

9/10.

15 August 2019,Marvel - the Quest for Cash,"Sorry Marvel fans but this is 100% no more than a money maker!

I watched this when it was first released but apparently I was so unimpressed that I forgot about it completely! Now, having made the mistake of watching it again I feel the need to make the statement: it is just awful! There is no real story, just the 'convoluted regurgitated, how can we modify this to make this marginally sensible' sort of approach. The acting is cardboard, frankly I wish someone would melt Ironman down and make a nice saucepan out of him, then take Steve Rogers and shove the shield up his.. enough, yes, I was deeply, deeply disappointed with this movie.

The ONLY saving grace for this was as always, the special effects. Ironically because I was so disappointed with the movie I found myself trying to figure out just how much acting the actors actually do? I believe that 75% of all character scenes are actually CGI, therefore, these 'actors' (cardboard) are getting paid heaps of money for doing less and less! Of course that thought process probably didn't help with my overall opinion of the movie!

I will mention that part of the reason I watched this again was because I lost the link for Infinity Wars and Endgame, so I needed to review this to refresh my memory, sadly! I say sadly because I think Infinity Wars should be called ""Marvel the Quest for even more cash' and Endgame; 'Marvel the we want all the cash you have left from our previous mugging sessions'.

I wasn't a comic book kid so perhaps I shouldn't have even watched these movies, believe me, I wish I hadn't because they are long and I could have been doing something that created memories worth having in the time I wasted on these really awful, pointless and terribly acted excursions into nothingness.

One final comment; Benedict, please leave this clan of losers before you, whom are probably THE only actor worthy of a future from these terrible movies, become labeled as a 'comic book' character and lose ALL credibility as a real actor.

Comic book fans; you'll probably love this drivel.",1
2 June 2016,"Better than Age of Ultron, But Not What I Was Expecting","What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",6
17 May 2016,Civil War: Cap's Galore.,"This movie is incredible. For those of you who were left disappointed or underwhelmed by Age of Ultron, or if you liked the movie all the same, Captain America: Civil War opens up the flood gates and doesn't hold back with exploring The Avengers in greater detail than before. Civil War succeeds in direction and writing where Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice ultimately failed to live up to.

Marvel keeps outdoing themselves with churning out these movies on a regular basis, but this film might stand out as being cream-of-the- crop against all the other Marvel Cinematic Universe installments made thus far. The movie is not completely perfect for me: there were some pacing issues pertaining to Black Panther's introduction, but aside from that little problem Civil War destroys all the stops and goes forward into ridiculously ambitious territory that these types of movies should achieve.

Captain America: Civil War actually stands out as its own thing as well. Sure it's another chapter in the Marvel Universe essentially, but you get that these characters have emotions, values and ideologies that aren't entirely dependent on sequel-knowledge. I'm happy that a Marvel movie has made me feel the same way The Dark Knight left me; Civil War can be seen as a single episode of a bigger picture, or you can just dive right in here if you really want to.

Civil War, Cap's Galore, Will Not Bore, Want Some More, Roger's Lore, Marvel's All. 5/5 stars.

P.S. Spider-Man is in the movie.",10
16 April 2021,"""That shield doesn't belong to you. You don't deserve it! My father made that shield!""","Captain America: Civil War has it's flaws, but that doesn't stop me from liking it.

What this movie does so well is that it's really hard to pick a side, because both sides have a very good reason to be at each others throats. One minute I'm rooting for Tony, and the next I'm rooting for Cap. It's conflict like this that I couldn't decide for myself on who side I was on or who was right, but that's just the fun of it.

Tom Holland as Spider-Man might be one of the best adaption of the character that we've had. Sony studios has made over five Spider-Man movies and the two actors who played Spider-Man (Maguire and Garfield), did their very best of what their got, but didn't quite capture the character that we know and love. But the Spider-Man in this movie has a screen time of 30 minutes or more, and Holland managed to capture the character.

Speaking of good casting - Chadwick Boseman was good as Black Panther.

Now for the problems: Daniel Brühl is a boring villain. I honestly can't remember much about his character in the movie and that's because he was forgettable. Daniel Brühl is great actor but doesn't really stand out.

Martin Freeman is a great actor but he doesn't do anything special or interesting in this movie. Yes,his character is probably going to developed more in the future, but my problem here is that he really felt out of place in this movie.

The story was a bit meh and there was a little bit too much quick cut edits in the fight scenes that I couldn't get all that infested with. Now don't get me wrong, I like the airport fight and the Iron Man V Cap fight, because those scenes didn't have stupid quick cuts and I could easily see whats happening. I think it's the hand-to-hand combat fights that are too cutter for me to see what's going on. That's just my opinion.

Overall Captain America: Civil War is a good film but personally I would have preferred this further down the line when more characters had been introduced to the MCU.",7
1 May 2016,Civil War is a Masterpiece...,"I am quite impressed with Civil War, because beyond being a simple movie of superheroes, is a Solid, perfect, mature and dark drama. Who is the one who has the reason? That is the question I asked myself while watching the movie. Civil War is a roller-coaster of emotions, because unlike the comic, which all the time favors the Captain America, in the film both sides are defended with various arguments, so much so that you get to have great sympathy for the team of Iron Man.

The film is a drama, pure and solid, quite political, I dare to say that it is the movie of the Marvel universe more mature and serious that I have seen, in effect, follows this humor characteristic, but on this occasion it is not feel forced.

The action is spectacular, the choreography of each battle is very well developed and the battle at the airport is epic, fun, Brilliant and amazing, accompanied by a good soundtrack. The CGI may be the least impressive of the film, because sometimes the characters looks like a 3D animated cartoon. but those scenes are minimal (thank god)

Civil War is a masterpiece. The best film of the whole universe Marvel and probably the best film of Superheroes that I have seen.

1 December 2016,"Forced, too soon.","Both as a Normal Viewer and as a Marvel fan, I'm pretty underwhelmed.

First of all, I think the movie is forced. Second of all, it's not well-made. Third of all, very unbaked, raw, too soon.

1,) The movie tries to base on multiple characters, even on characters that haven't been properly introduced or feel like side characters, even though they pose as ""great marvel avengers"". Each of these characters should've got their own movie first, and than the Civil War. The movie feels like they try to say ""Yeah, look at him! He is important!"" meanwhile you are like ""Who the hell is that?"". It feels forced.

The confrontation, the characters, the plot, over-all it's just.. mixed but not forged. They are just there. I expected much more from a Marvel and from a Superhero movie. I feel like this movie is terrible and just hard to watch. Spider-Man feels like he is just there because he was in the trailer. So you need some hype and want to advertise the other new Marvel movie, so let's drop him in.

2,) Most of the fight scenes felt bad. It's not just the lack of them, because in comparison to the Avengers, or the Hulk vs Iron Man of the Avengers II... what do we got? .. but also the quality and un-creativity of them. It feels like they didn't even try. Seriously, compare this movie to the rest of the Captain America and Avengers movie. Well worked out scenes, dynamic fights, show offs, jokes etc. They had so many things in them. Here..? Blank, uninteresting, mostly just camera shots. Simply: In Avengers 2 we could see why Warmachine is a war-machine. Gatling guns, rockets.. it's basically Iron-Man in a gunpowder version. Here? He is chasing a slower, gliding guy, who is basically un-armed in comparison to the Iron-Man armor. Than he gets ""accidentally"" shot down by Vision... On the SKY. I know Vision has a range.. sure. But this precision, force and range? Why wasn't it used before? I would say that Vision is a very mixed character in this story, but let's just say that they tried to hide him.

Pretty under-whelming to be honest.

3,) I don't think they didn't notice this. Even on script these problems, plot-holes, and just overall they can be felt. But business is business and they went with it.. and you can feel that. A lot of choice in this movie is just not good. A lot of part is boring, the side-stories sometimes are stronger than the main story...

F.e.: The video-footage. The whole movie based around it. So they had a camera like that, on the middle of nowhere in 1991? Well, not everything is perfect. Let's forget it. ..and another one.. and.. next one.. and another one. Did anyone thought the actual plot over? The let's hate each other for some unknown reason, because the viewers want to see you fight with each other. Yeah, beat each other up. I liked that fight scene though. I'm sure you will hear people rant, how Captain America who even as a super-soldier should not be able to fight with Iron Man, or that Buky just has an iron-hand not an iron chest, but this is a comics movie. It doesn't have to be perfect. However when you constantly feel that they didn't even try. ""Ohhh it will be good for fans, they watch everything."" The feeling is just flowing from the movie.

I don't recommend it over-all, maybe if you are a hardcore fan.",3
3 May 2016,***** Let's hear it for Captain America! The Best Movie of 2016 *****,"This movie stands above any other comic book film because it combines all the elements that make a film great. It's smart, well written, shot flawlessly with the best action imaginable, has superb performances, top notch effects and plot twists and turns that keep a viewer guessing and on the edge of the seat.

From great character definition to well orchestrated action to funny lines to moving emotional scenes to true conspiracy and thrills to the powerful structure of the film, this is one superbly written film.

THE best movie of the year because it remembers what the cinema is for... SMART ENTERTAINMENT. It never wants to insult intelligence like other big budget movies usually do (and some have already done so this very year). Civil War is smart but fun and thrilling. THAT is what the cinema is for and to quote the first film ""Let's hear it for Captain America!""

31 July 2022,Plenty Civil Moments and Tons of War,"One of the most intense Marvel movies to date, Captain America: Civil War delivers a fallout between Chris Evans' Steve Rogers and Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. The tension between the two is visible throughout, and they're still able to respect each other. Each of their teams are full of fan favorites, new and old. The movie also really hits on just how misunderstood and mysterious Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes really is. And the entirety of the movie poses some great questions about the superhero world. It's a suspenseful movie with plenty of moments that make the watchers go wild with delight. It can be a little slow at times, and the team switching is a little odd, but it's still not entirely a bad thing. My only major problem is that we didn't get a civil war quite like the comics, loaded with superheroes. But it's still a pretty big moment in the MCU, and exciting all the same.

8 May 2016,Marvel just keeps raising the bar for multi-superhero movies...in every aspect...best one so far!!!,"The Russo brothers raise the bar for multi-hero movies to a whole new level after their earlier success of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. As expected the CGI and Stunt team does a fantastic job, better actually, than Winter Soldier which is in itself a masterpiece. Those of us, someone like me who haven't read much of the comics, may be expecting a different plot/background on which the 'Civil War' happens...although the movie takes on many different angles and perspectives through which we can see the characters in new light. With Winter Soldier, they've already laid the platform for this one and it builds beautifully on it. Marvel has always had this knack of handling multiple characters and preserving their individuality while keeping them in sync with the plot, and it doesn't disappoint this time as well. Quite a few character introductions were hinted in the trailers itself what with Black Panther and Spidey coming back to the MCU. What is impeccable is they give each character its own space while still building up on the story. A lot of tussle, both emotional and physical can be seen between the so-called two teams, each member struggling in their own stead of facing someone who until quite recently was fighting with them side by side. The background score complements each scene perfectly well and the camera team captures each stunt with breath taking perfection.

Overall, it is a brilliant attempt given the complexity of the plot which I won't discuss here for the sake of the thrill of actually witnessing it in cinemas. If you've not already watched it, you're missing out on some serious entertainment.",9
4 August 2021,#Movie Review,"Captain America: Civil War (2016) rocks! It's a movie that manages to combine : a deep meaningful message + cool action scenes and let's not forget about the funny moments. At first you might get the sensation that something is wrong but as the story unfolds you can relate more and more and actually understand each character's motivation.

The things that bothered me : I don't like the way some scenes were managed but since the movie has so many good parts it can be overlooked also I am not sure what was Marvel's vision regarding the villain but I was expecting him to have a bigger presence. It's not that he is a bad villain it's just that there are so many super-heroes in this movie raising the bar thus when the villain shows up he kind of spoils the fun.

13 May 2016,Captain America review,"Captain American is a Marvel action hero movie that explores The Avenger's role in relation to the rest of mankind. It begs the question at which point do super heroes overstep their limits and disregard their actions' impact on the rest of humanity. In an age where superheroes have an unlimited amount of power, The UN tries their best to bring back the balance of power by establishing a treaty that puts the superheroes under the authority of the UN. Robert along with a host of characters try to protect this treaty by fighting against Captain America. Subsequently, the Avengers have a ""Civil war"" in which they destroy each other, with each feeling as though they are doing the logical and ethical thing. Ethical decisions come into play as captain America risk his own life to rescue his friend, and Robert Downey Jr. later risk his standing with the government by trying to help Captain America. The movie begs the question ""Are superheroes exempt from responsibility?""

14 June 2021,Alright but can be too much,"This movie was okay, the action parts looked fun and cool and the plot was just alright. The problem is a lot of the action was pointless, they're fighting each other because of some government rules and then at the end it's another pointless fight. I feel as if it contributes to nothing in the mcu. It feels like a bunch of action put together. I gave this movie 7 stars because it wasn't all that bad, the introduction of spider man was epic and the fight scenes were a bit good just not necessary at times. I do recommend but it's not something to watch many times.

8 May 2016,An above average Marvel movie,"If Captain America: The Winter Soldier wasn't enough proof that the Russo brothers are some of the most capable superhero movie directors of our time, this is. Captain America: Civil War is possibly one of the best directed superhero movies ever made. The story is very well thought out and does justice to the characters, while simultaneously developing said characters beyond what we've seen of them in previous movies. It's surprising that even though this is the fifth movie starring Chris Evans as Captain America, there still seems to be things we can learn about him. I was never the biggest Captain America fan, and as I went in to the cinema I was decidedly on Iron Man's team, but you cannot help but feel very conflicted between the two from start to finish. The Russos' keep you gripped for the entire movie, and there really isn't a dull moment. Perhaps that's because of the constant flow of action sequence after action sequence, which felt overwhelming at times (pretty much every ten minutes or so another giant fight took place). However in my eyes this was undoubtedly the best action in any superhero movie (the sequence in the airport is nothing short of mesmerising), from The Avengers to The Dark Knight. The story is also surprisingly thought-provoking, as it not only explores themes never before seen in a Marvel movie but also continues to show the Russos' talent for storytelling.

What Civil War does particularly well is manage the great cast of characters it has, both new and old. This has often been a problem in previous Marvel movies, for example both Avengers movies always kept some characters sidetracked. However there was none of that here, and each of the many, many characters in this movie had some very memorable moments. Past supporting characters such as Vision and Falcon were given lots of time and energy, although ultimately once again it was Captain America and Iron Man who took the spotlights. This movie is really a sequel to 2014's The Winter Soldier, and was heavily focusing of Sebastian Stan's Bucky, and his relationship with Captain America. The main new editions to the cast, Black Panther and Spiderman, were thoroughly well-written, fantastic characters that by the end you will be very excited for their upcoming movies. Tom Holland did a great job as the most realistic, grounded Peter Parker we have ever seen - suddenly everyone is glad they didn't bring back Andrew Garfield. Although for me, Black Panther was the most interesting and the character I enjoyed watching the most, due to his fantastic place in the story and of course Chadwick Boseman's great portrayal of the character. The only other person really worth mentioning was Daniel Brühl's Zemo - a surprisingly well fleshed-out villain who instantly surpassed any of Marvel's other (usually very forgettable) villains. Forget Batman Vs Superman, is the true movie that the fans wanted.",8

That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

3 May 2016,1 of the best & greatest Marvel movies I've ever seen (and made)!,"I finally saw this movie today! And you know what?

This movie is so freaking awesome! The heroes didn't disappoint (even Spider-Man, which is my fave Marvel superhero despite him being on Team Iron Man & me rooting for Team Cap). The action, drama & fight scenes were very awesome & well done! :)

My favorite scenes are the following:

1) Airport fight scene - Every hero fights one another (the 2 teams). This is my most fave part of the film.

2) Cap & Iron Man fighting - This is the last fight in the movie. It was so cool.

3) The opening fight scene - It was cool, especially with the scene being shot at a market.

So, I recommend watching this movie. It's worth your money & time. And this is my #1 favorite Marvel movie of all time! :)

My rating on this movie is 1,000,000,000,000,000/10 heroes!",10
29 April 2016,The old formula we are tired,"Good points: The battle, spidey and Antman.

Anything else it can be considered as a copy & paste of a formula that it's becoming boring. Even the starting is slow and characters look plain. The villain is hardly to believe and share his goal. Too many jokes again even in the critical scenes that don't let the movie be transformed in adult movie.

Downey Jr looks tired of his role as Ironman and his acting has disappointed me. The conflict is not deeper at all. It caused expectation that disappears as soon as spidey is out of the movie.

Sorry, but I really don't like this movie.

28 April 2016,The Masterpiece Marvel will be remembered by,"I've seen all of MCUs but I've never considered them films. More of like a series of product/ TV episodes with great production value.

I liked the first Iron Man as its a complete film of its own and structurally sets the ultimate MCU formula that pretty much continue to work with all other movies. I also liked Guardians of the Galaxy which I thought really differed itself from what people think Marvel should be. That being said I've always thought Feige was a genius in the fact that he doesn't set out to do ""comic book"" movies but rather playing with different genres within the same universe.

Yet Captain America: Civil War is a totally different animal. It's the ultimate Marvel movie that geeks like myself dream of in their head ever since they announced plan to do shared universe back in 2009.

Ensemble movies are hard to pull off strictly from a storytelling perspective. Balancing characters, keeping each motivation simple and understandable, tonally fresh, thematically focused, and with just right amount of pace that keeps the momentum going and in the case of of this one: digging deeper into existing characters AND introducing brand new ICONIC ones without ruining the whole narrative. Civil War actually does all of them but never forgets to keep it fun and action-packed enough in the process.

Black Panther is a classic yet niche character in the universe. But they amount of care that went into introducing and forging him into this already crowded ensemble is handled with great care and details. Spiderman is on a mission as well but the Russo brothers spends enough time with him to bring the character, along with his origin and new background almost seamlessly and with great humor into the MCU. All of these make the airport smackdown scene all the more memorable as we can easily root for all of the characters at their most classic selves.

Perhaps the most difficult achievement in all of this is that with all the fireworks at play and character motivations, Cap is still at the very core of the story. This is after all, a Captain America movie and they never seize to remind you of that as it starts and end with his arc completed and emotionally satisfying.

It just doesn't get better than this. So stop reading now and get a ticket.",10

22 August 2021,Lived up to the hype!,"While I prefer the films where the Avengers unite and thrive as a team, the sweetness of introducing new characters and adding them into the action-packed mix with the team splitting apart and fighting is very original! Plus, the last 20-30 minutes of the film gives us one of the best and emotion-inducing fights of the entire MCU!

29 April 2016,"A superhero film to enjoy, not endure","Unlike a certain other superhero film recently released, 'Captain America: Civil War' is unlikely to polarize opinion. It's a Marvel film, you see, and despite being the relative newcomers to the 'film your own characters' school, they're rapidly risen to top of the class, knocking out hit after hit by simply understanding what their fans want. Civil War is no exception, and is unsurprisingly much more than a 'who would win in a fight between...' punch fest.

Although Cap gets title billing here, Civil War is basically Avengers 3, following directly on from Age Of Ultron. We open with The Avengers kicking are as usual, but again as usual it's impossible to avoid civilian casualties when there's guns and bombs all over the place. One explosion later and the team are basically ordered to become an official task force, answerable to that most despicable of things: a committee. Tony Stark sees the sense in this, whilst Cap doesn't trust people to not have self interest and also to allow them to react quick enough. There's only one way to settle this...

So the scene is set, as The Avengers split into pro and anti factions. To actually get fists flying, however, you need a reason. Enter The Winter Soldier, last seen disappearing after saving Cap in The Winter Soldier movie. With Bucky seemingly to blame for a terrible international incident, Cap decides to grab him before the officials can, setting him squarely against Iron Man, now firmly doing what he's told. Cue stand off...

As I said earlier, this is much more than a simple series of hero on hero scraps, although the main one is a doozy. Not only do we get our usual Marvel suspects, but there's also the introduction of The Black Panther and a certain kid in a red and blue onesie. Both are handled exceptionally well, and you will be gagging for the Black Panther movie by the end, not to mention 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' in 2017. Add to this a nice return to the screen for Paul Rudd's Ant Man and the two and a half hours (yes, really) will fly by.

Much like the last Captain America film, Civil War gives a damn about plot, and a decent amount of time is spent actually having one and talking about it. The Winter Soldier is once again the device that gives the plot momentum, and poor old Bucky looks like he'll never escape his Hydra brainwashing. Whilst it's a Captain America film, Tony Stark and Iron Man are given plenty of screen time as Stark's demons are fully explored, pushing him towards an inevitable showdown. Again, it's a pretty serious film, but unlike a certain other film it finds time to make you smile as well. I mean, who'd make a two and a half hour superhero film without any light moments at all? Oh yeah....

Bold, bright, brash and brilliant, 'Captain America: Civil War' stand up alongside Marvel's other movies, and whilst some have said it's the best yet, I'd say it depends on what you're looking for. The joy of the Marvel movies is that they each tend to have something different, and to compare this to, say, 'Guardians Of The Galaxy' is pretty daft. Suffice to say it's faults are few and far between, it maintains a large cast without short changing anyone, and it's not full of plot holes. Chris Evans remains as perhaps the best piece of casting in the superhero genre, with new Spidey Tom Holland and Black Panther Chad Boseman each owning the screen as nervy kid and moody warrior respectively. Once again, when asked what kind of comic based films work best, the answer is 'make Mine Marvel'. Excelsior!",9
7 May 2016,The the best superhero movie that is the most mature out of all the marvel films,"""Captain America: Civil War"" is an action/adventure movie directed by the Russo brothers and stars Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Tom Holland, and Paul Rudd. The Story centers the Avengers whose worlds are turned upside down when a Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man.

This Movie is not only the best Marvel movie ever, but it is also the best Superhero movie ever made. It's very thought-provoking, emotional, action-packed, and very Mature. right off the bat you get the impression that this movie is going to be a very serious film with dark images, and very shocking scenes in terms of an emotional drama. this movie throws an argument in the story that is very relevant to the plot and crucial to not only this movie but to past marvel films as well. it isn't very one sided and you do see both sides of the argument coming from both Captain America and Iron Man. that is only a piece to the brilliant movie that has a very realistic and gritty tone.

Visually it's spectacular. the CGI does very well at blending two things together and making the fight scenes more believable. Speaking of fight scenes, The action segments in the movie are amazing to look at especially the airport fight scene which is filled with moments of awesomeness.

The characters are very well developed here just as they were in the comics. Two characters that steal the entire show are Black Panther and Spider-Man. Black panther (played by Chadwick Boseman) does a very great job at playing a character that feels like he lost everything and is looking for vengeance. he did a great job and will probably get awarded someday for such a talent. the real winner is Tom Holland as The Amazing Spider-Man. He shines in this role and not only brings something new to the character but he brings plenty of old and nostalgic parts to his character as well, such as the costume. the actor did a great job at portraying a teen which is what Peter Parker is supposed to be. The rest of the Avengers all have a moment to shine especially Scarlett Witch (who is much better developed here than in Avengers: Age of Ultron). Iron Man and Captain America are very well developed and directed when the emotional moments kick into high- gear. The villain, while very relate-able is pretty forgettable.

Overall this movie is amazing and is very incredible. I highly recommend it if you want to watch a great film. Watch it.",9
16 April 2022,A great conclusion to the Captain America trilogy,"Captain America: Civil War delivers the spectacle, emotional story depth and great acting, that you would expect from the Captain America franchise.

It also introduces such heavy-hittes into the MCU as Black Panther and Spider-Man.

8 May 2016,Same ol' Stuff,"Do you ever go to a concert for a band you loved 30 years before? It's great seeing the whole band back together, singing their songs with loyal, adoring fans. You have a wonderful night of nostalgia and, for a moment, you're transported back in time with the reminder of things you used to love. You overlook the fact that the band is a bunch of old fat guys, that their voices crack, their timing's off, etc ... you just love the fact that your favorite rockers are together with you again. That's the way I felt watching Civil War. While it's fun to spend a few hours with these characters again, the experience brought nothing new, nothing fresh and simply reminded me of the better films that preceded it. I watched it with a packed crowd that barely chuckled (barely made a sound) and who applauded meekly at the end like parents at the end of an elementary school play before filing quietly out of the theater. Few remained for the final stinger. For a 2.5 hour movie, it felt like it lasted longer.

I loved the first Captain America. Its sense of patriotism and nostalgia was infectious. It's my favorite Marvel film. I really enjoyed the second CA, too, although at a point I felt a bit of CGI overload (especially when Widow removed the CG mask). But overall, they are definitely my favorite MCU films. I also enjoyed Ant-Man and the first Iron Man but could have easily skipped Guardians and the Thor films.

When I read the sort of reviews this movie got (along with the reviews of Jungle Book three weeks ago), I can't help but think that Disney has brainwashed the world's critics. After seeing this film, I know it's true. Captain America: Civil War is in the bottom % of the Marvel films, right there with Iron Man 3, Thor 2 and the Hulk movies. The multiple chase and fight scenes are monotonous and, ultimately, pointless. The pacing is tedious and the story is jam-packed with too many characters. A scene in which Stark meets Peter Parker is not only unnecessary, but stops the movie in its tracks for ten full minutes. I don't understand the excitement reviewers have for the character; in my opinion, Spider-Man's role in the film was annoying and desperate. It would have been as if Robin appeared in the final battle in Batman v Superman asking the heroes if they had ever seen some 80s action movie in the middle of the fight ... a movie that the new movie was clearly ripping off. That's what Spidey does here - he provides comic relief for the kiddies.

About halfway through the film I glanced at my watch. I kept glancing at it about every fifteen minutes. The movie seemed to go on ... and on ... and on. But there wasn't a single scene I loved, no musical score to embrace, no development from the first act to the last. The characters were the same at the end as they were in the beginning. And it was definitely Stan Lee's worst cameo in a film, a nyuk-nyuk joke setup that fell flat.

Just so you know this isn't a hate-fest, let me tell you what I liked. 1. Black Panther and Scarlett Witch make memorable contributions to the film. 2. I have never been so glad for Paul Rudd to appear in a movie as I was in this one. His Ant-Man provides a much-needed spark. 3. I was glad to see William Hurt reprise his role as General Ross.

I spoke to a few moviegoers on the way out of the theater. They thought Deadpool was much better (so did I, and I only marginally enjoyed that one). My kids were satisfied enough, although one thought Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman could have easily bested all of the Avengers by herself. They have no desire to see it again. Both enjoyed Batman v Superman better (both saw it three times).

Like any loyal groupie, I will pay money to see my favorite rock band again when they come to town in concert and, likewise, I'll stand in line for that next Marvel movie. But I have a feeling I have heard their best songs before. Their Greatest Hits are in the past.",6

27 April 2023,One of the best MCU films ever made,"Captain America:Civil War hands down is one of the greatest movies to ever come to the MCU. After political conflict between the Avengers and other foreign country's, the return of William Hurt's General Thunderbolt Ross introduces the Sokovia Accords that will either cause the Avengers to give up their rights to fight any threat where they choose or force them to retire. When it causes Steve Rogers/Captain America and Tony Stark/Iron Man to take different sides on the Accords, tensions are higher than ever causing each Avenger to choose their side. When a attack on foreign diplomats that leaves King T'Chaka of Wakanda dead and Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier is framed, it's up to Captain America to help save his friend and prove his innocence with the remaining Avengers on his side while the other half of them are fighting against them. First off, this is probably my favorite film to feature Chris Evan's Steve Rogers/Captain America, because it forces him to choose between what he believes is right and what he thinks is wrong. It's also one of my favorite films to feature Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark/Iron Man, because it shows a side of him we haven't gotten to see before until now. Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow is stunning as always. Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier is fantastic while also giving showing us more of his now more sensitive side while also showing more of his sinister past. The film also introduces us to new characters like Chadwick Boseman's Prince T'Challa/Black Panther who was born to play this role and Tom Holland's Peter Parker/Spider-Man which is also fantastic. I was also glad to see other hero's join this film such as Paul Rudd's Scott Lang/Ant-Man, Jeremy Renner's Clint Barton/ Hawkeye, Paul Bettany's Vision, Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson/Falcon, Elizabeth Olsen's Wanda Maximoff, and Don Cheadle's Rhodey/War Machine. The film not only introduces us to one of my personal favorite villains of the MCU with Daniel Brühl's Helmut Zemo, but he gives us a villain that doesn't need any form of superpower to defeat his enemies. Only his actions. This film hands down is one of the best films to come to the MCU, that is one of its most memorable, action packed, dark at times, and emotional that has viewers watching all the way to the end. Rating 9/10.",9
23 November 2016,"""Captain America: Civil War""- A wildly thrilling and often complex action adventure extravaganza! One of Marvel's best!","One of the most shocking things about Marvel's widely beloved smash- hit Cinematic Universe is its seeming ability to deliver constant and consistent high-quality films with only the most minimal of missteps taken and sore thumbs stuck out. With well over a dozen widely- released films on top of shorts, television franchises and streaming series, the Marvel universe is very much an unstoppable behemoth. One of the greatest franchises to ever grace the silver screen. And ""Captain America: Civil War"" not only continues this trend of quality films made by a quality studio- it excels as one of the best of the best. It's a consistently thrilling action extravaganza filled to burst with complex characterizations, carefully laid plotting and non- stop fun.

After a disastrous mission, the Avengers find themselves at the center of controversy, with several world governments demanding they be put in check and only allowed to operate with committee approval under the newly drafted ""Sokovia Accords."" However, the team is morally split, with Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) unable to trust the accords while Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) wants to embrace them out an ever increasing sense of guilt for his previous actions. At the same time, James Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is blamed for a terrorist bombing that kills the King of the peaceful nation Wakanda, causing his son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) to don the guise of the ""Black Panther"" to seek retribution, forcing Captain America to try and protect his former best friend against orders. However, it will soon become apparent that a devious figure known as Zemo (Daniel Brühl) is secretly masterminding the unfolding series of events, keen to gain control of Winter Soldier and to tear apart the Avengers for his own devious reasons...

Directed by brotherly duo Joe and Anthony Russo from a script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film is very much a revelation, and feels like the culmination of everything that has come before it. Markus and McFeely's script is wonderfully paced and skillfully juggles the various characters with a strong sense of deliberation, giving everyone involved their moments to shine and most major players a good sense of development. An admirable achievement given the sheer volume of plays and plot lines at hand. They also really pile on the moral ambiguity of the film's central conflict in such a way to keep the audiences guessing and changing sides in a matter that is decidedly not at all black-and-white. Finally, they introduce new characters to the ever-growing mythos with great organic ease, particularly excelling with the newly introduced Black Panther and the absolutely phenomenal new Spider-Man (Tom Holland), who steals the show in his small but highly memorable scenes.

The Russo Brothers, best known in the past for their work in wonderfully subversive comedy classics like ""Community"" and ""Arrested Development"" continue to excel at their craft, with an expert sense of visual storytelling and tone that lends itself perfectly to the material. They are able to balance out the conflicting tones of the characters present in a very grounded way, allowing for entertaining and well-conceived interactions with everyone from Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) to the Vision (Paul Bettany). In addition, they are just one heck of a good team when it comes to action, delivering some of the craziest and most thrilling sequences of the year. The long-fabled airport battle sequence might just go down as perhaps the greatest full-on superhero brawl of all time. Yes, it's that good.

The cast is just flawless. Really nothing more can be said. From the incredible work of Evans and Downey in our central roles, to the supporting roles played by the likes of Rudd and Elizabeth Olsen, to the new additions like Holland and Boseman, everyone is completely on-point. Each and every character is wonderfully written and fantastically performed. Add to that the gorgeous and deliciously stark cinematography of Trent Opaloch, the fabulous and haunting score of Henry Jackman and the mind-blowing visual effects and you just have yourself the perfect storm of awesome. Everything works in conjunction to build up this tale to the point it is no longer just another movie in the series. This is an event in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A clash that will have lasting impact on future films and will go down as a turning point in the series.

""Captain America: Civil War"" is the best kick-off to Marvel's third phase as is possible. Its keen use of previously established characters now being pushed to the brink while new characters are introduced to build the mythology is amazing to behold. Its action awe-inspiring, leaving you breathless at the end of each scene. And perhaps most important- its emotional core and moral questioning is complex and will leave each and every viewer asking themselves what they would have done in this situation. If a movie about superheroes fighting each other will still leave questioning the implications of the choices made and their possible impact weeks or even months after release, you know it's done a good job.

There's no way around it, ""Captain America: Civil War"" is one of Marvel's best and it easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10 from me for sheer entertainment value and for its surprisingly deep and complex themes.",10

That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",7
1 May 2016,You're in for a treat,"I honestly can't express the amount of awesome in this movie. This is how you make movies let alone comic books movies.

The story has been well thought out and and follows effectively. The characters and their motivations are well developed. Although a direct comparison between Batman V superman and this movie cannot be made, certain aspects can. For instance in BVS the new character introductions seemed rushed, however in CW the whole movie flowed really well.

Age of Ultron was a bit of a let down it wasn't anything different from the previous Avengers movie. CW however was a definite step up the fight scenes themselves were astounding.

This is definitely a movie I will be watching several times in the cinema.",10

13 February 2021,Good for superhero film,"Not a huge fan of superhero movies, but this is good.

The implementation of comedy for a movie like this was needed to be executed carefully and they managed to pull it off. While the tension builds between Captain America and Iron Man, we get to deeply explore their character motivations and beliefs throughout the movie.

With the previous heroic acts that Tony Stark had, we are now met with a guilty and troubled character. His matured character arc was interesting to dissect because we see him constantly trying to contain each member of the Avengers and take responsibility for their actions while handling the diplomatic relations and internal heartbreak that was caused by Pepper Potts.

On the opposite corner, we have Steve Rogers who is fighting for his beliefs even if he has to go against the law just to protect his long time friend Bucky. These character depths add emotional weight to the story which leads us to have more difficulty on which team to root for as both sides have been well developed. The new heroes that are introduced to us in this movie are Black Panther and Spider-Man.

They were given enough screen time and their performances were amazing. I'm surprised that Black Panther was given a lot of screen time considering that the audience isn't familiar with his background. Spider-Man was a strong element in this film. The scenes he's in provide comedic relief, but his CGI suit looked very unrealistic and half-baked.",
30 May 2021,"great supporting cast...cap, not so much","Obviously, the film's a lot of fun. It's a nice cap (pun intended) to the trilogy in that it combines some of the heart of the first (in this case the pain of a rift between friends) with the brains of the second (here the moral quandary of power and governance). Downey delivers as usual and the members of the supporting cast shine unexpectedly (especially the new spider-man that i wanted to keep at arms length yet won me over in capturing the childlike wonder and awkwardness that has made peter parker so enduring) but I found evan's rodgers, who is supposed to be the principle character, unconvincing and emotionally one-dimensional.

6 May 2016,"Tired of the need for ""Damaged"" Heroes.","I'm not even going to get into the plot or events as they are played out. I'm sickened by this movie just like Superman v Batman. Seriously? We can't find enough bad guys, no, we have to take our heroes and tear them apart. Pitting two of our more famous ""good guys"" against each other brings out the worst in them. Alas it doesn't just bring out the worst in them, simply by forcing other heroes to take sides we ruin their reputations as well. ""Heroes"" fighting against ""Heroes"" shows us we really don't have any heroes left to root for. Thanks for ruining our heroes for us.

Bottom line in the Marvel Universe? There are NO good guys. Just shades of bad.

8 May 2016,Batman V Superman's inverse opposite,"Ever since IRON MAN came out, I always ponder on whether or not the MCU's ""shared universe"" experiment would pay off. Amongst the Phase 1 movies barely reaching above average and the obnoxious references to other movies within movies (to which AGE OF ULTRON became the worst example of), a small part of me wonders if any of it matters to the big picture, or if I actually stick around for said big picture. However, after seeing other superhero franchises executing this concept SO. FRICKEN. HORRIBLY, my doubts simmered while Marvels biggest secret became clear. They take their time in developing their wacky, comic-book universe while virtually blending it with the modern real universe, They care about these characters and their struggles so much as to have us care about them as well. They explore concepts and opportunities within these heroes and expands their meaning and what they represent to those that wrote them in the first place.

And now with CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR, when the film might tread on the ""dark and moody"" vibe instead of the campy escapist fare that they represent, they smartly delve into the morals of these already-established characters and their reasons for going off against each other, all while never being shy of occasional fun. The result, even considering a few missteps, blooms into the most grounded yet thrilling superhero movie since THE DARK KNIGHT; a shining example of Marvels status as engaging character- driven action romps with poignant philosophies about what we believe is the right course of action.

The most glaring thing to consider about this film is that it doesn't really feel much like a Captain America movie as it is just another Avengers movie. Rather than the actual character taking front and center of his movies, his ideals, the way he solves issues, and how said ideals are being conflicted instead reflects on the other characters, with some of them opposing the Act because they feel they can do things right again. The biggest variation, though, is that none of their sides ultimately become the WRONG choice nor the RIGHT one. With Iron Man switching towards responsibility to contrast the irresponsible behavior prior and Steve Rodgers justified do-gooder turned independent vigilante, neither side trumps the other; sometimes it's good that the world is saved with a few casualties, but sometimes said casualties wind up too unbearable to cope with.

All of this is due to the films willingness to implement ""breathing room"". All of this is due to the Russo Brothers character-driven television backgrounds, which allows them to set the story back a few times to properly flesh out these characters. I mean, c'mon! The idea of shoving in Spider Man and the Black Panther while simultaneously developing Scarlet Witch and Visions friendship, AND shifting focus on Captain America saving Bucky would sound like another AGE OF ULTRON disaster, but it pulls together this time! While some hiccups are inevitable in this gamble, the willingness to take its time, plus some actual stakes by the actual team and not just another army invasion, gives this story its lasting weight. And yes before you mention it, boy do I feel lucky to be alive seeing the best Spider Man and the best Black Panther! Tom Holland as Peter Parker and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther both succeed in adapting these characters in a script that impressively establishes them without treading on their back story for too long. Even keeping the abundance of solid action scenes in mind, the introduction of Black Panther and Starks small talk with Parker might be two of the best scenes in this movie. But make no mistake, this film would never be worthwhile had it not been for the Russo Brothers surprisingly solid action. Seriously, this might be the best Marvel ensemble fight scenes ever! Explaining these would ruin the fun, but let's just say that the airport scene HOLY CRAP!

Judging solely on the action scenes pairing with the conflicting ethics of regulation would instantly make a masterful film, but sadly it is not. Once that big fight gets out of the way, the film feels like it should conclude from there, only to shift into another fight scene due to one's own vendetta. No matter how bold of a move that is, to have this whole fight derive from a smaller but more personal struggle, but it took me out of the film to have yet another fight scene just a few minutes after another. You also might gloss over the ""villain"" in this movie that brings up a worthwhile twist in the end, but I pay no mind to it

Now I am sure there is quite a lot of discussion that my praise for this film strictly lies on my ""bias towards Marvel"" after recently bashing DCs shameless aping of this shared universe. Trust me guys, I strained to stick with my doubts on this one. I desperately find anything wrong with this movie despite the ratio of reception of film and BATMAN V SUPERMAN telling me otherwise. Sadly, I stand with my statement. This is not only miles better than DAWN OF JUSTICE, but I am right on board on the ever-so redundant but inevitable discussion that this is an opposite inverse of that in quality terms. Smart and funny writing instead of stupid and self-important trailer fuel; struggles based on character-based ideals instead of dumb manipulation; dark tone for meaning and weight instead of mindless aesthetic mimicking. Even that notwithstanding, this makes a confident, everlasting, and fun superhero movie properly made better by the eight years of world-building that has finally payed off. I would say watch it and judge for yourselves, but I believe my stand is as follows: SEE THIS ONE INSTEAD!",8
25 October 2016,Who Are All These Guys?,"My son informed me tonight that the reason I was confused by this film is that a missed a previous Avengers movie. I try to enjoy these comic book movies and am always astonished how personally people take them. In this one, we are treated to so many characters with different skills and agendas that it is hard to know who to pull for, who is lugging around guilt, and who some of them even are. I was told there is character development. I don't see it. The milieu into which these persons are thrust seems to be so tilted that they really need to keep working. Lets face it. If there are casualties when they ply their individual trades, imagine the carnage without them. Of course, I had all I could do to figure out which side they are on. I guess ""Civil War"" means that they are fighting among themselves in their own universe. What are the motivations? My son also informed me that there are at least a dozen or more superhero films coming out in the next two years. Good God! I love a plot where a villain has created some malevolent thing that only special powers can stop. It would be nice if there weren't a tidal wave of superheroes.",6
25 November 2016,Politically Correct Disaster,"Would give it a 0 if not for excellent special effects. I cannot believe they can turn a superhero movie into a politically correct lecture. I love the Avengers & have been watching & reading them for 30 plus years. It has always been good supers against bad-supers, and lately with amazing special effects. Leave it to Hollywood to destroy the franchise to make sure they lecture us in their version of what is right & politically correct. How can Hollywood take such great characters, actors & writers & create such a mess. Undoubtedly the last time I watch an Avengers movie. So sad, really loved the previous ones over the last few years. Fun to watch. Note to Hollywood, if I want to be lectured on how to be politically correct I would watch CNN not pay to watch what should be a fun movie.

28 April 2016,"It's good, maybe not as good as everyone claims...","SPOILER FREE - (As long as you've watched the trailers)


(TLDR at bottom)

Going into Captain America: Civil War (I'll call it Civil War from now) I was extremely excited for the film. This was something I was really excited for, especially after the success that was Winter Soldier. I knew the Russo's knew what they were doing with Cap and were good at both progressing plot and developing characters. Something I love in film. So how does Civil War stand up? The answer, in short, is that it's good.

All I've seen said about this film is praise, 10 stars and shouts of this film being a classic. Whilst I wouldn't say this film is a classic, it's not a bad film. One of the film's main attractions comes in the promise of the Avengers being split in half and going head to head against one another, and you get that in heaps. There are plenty of fights in this film between heroes, with the exception of the very first fight every single fight in this film is between the heroes that have been developed in previous movies, and the action is stellar. Considering the vast majority of these heroes only rely on hand-to- hand combat it's really amazing that the action feels so fresh and swift, it's something to definitely be commended, and all of the fights feel swift and real.

With the action pretty much down, how does the story do? Here I have a bit of an issue. In my eyes, the plot is a bit of a mess. Literally so much drama could have been avoided if anyone just TALKED to someone on the other side of the argument, at least ATTEMPT to reason with the opposing side before going in with guns blazing. There is also a villain in this film that has an extremely convoluted plot, a plan that relies almost entirely on coincidence and luck. I think the film could have done without him. So overall, the plot is relatively weak.

But how does the character development fair? For the most part it's done pretty well. The film wisely decides to focus most of it's attention on Captain America and Bucky (aka: Winter Soldier) as it is still a Captain America film. With these two characters you can really sense both of their struggles. Bucky's done a lot of bad things that fall on his shoulders but he did them all brain washed and only now is regaining his identity whilst nearly everyone else wants him gone. Cap is determined to help his friend where no one else will, to help that one lost soul from his past, the last healthy memory of the world Cap once knew and can never get back. It's very well done stuff. Iron Man gets some decent development too. It's good to see Stark on the back foot and struggling to keep everything together when it's all falling apart, Stark trying to amend for past mistakes and being fought against. It's a side of Stark we haven't really seen before. Widow also has an interesting plot in her deciding between choosing what she knows is safe and what her guts want her to go. Other than this, however, the development is poor, ESPECIALLY for Vision and Scarlet Witch.

But overall, here's why this film can not be higher than a seven. It accomplishes nothing. It's a problem I had with Age of Ultron and it's a problem I have here. In these movies, where the universe is slowly being build upon piece by piece, I want each movie to have an impact on the universe, for the world to adapt and alter because of the events in the film. I felt Civil War could have been more. Ultimately, once the film is finished, everyone pretty much ends up where they began and it just makes me a little disappointed. What I loved so much about Winter Soldier was the pretty interesting plot, the development of characters and the companionship of Cap and Black Widow. Understandably this couldn't be focused on as much due to the cast, but it still feels lacking. Also, Winter Soldier changed a lot. It introduced a new character, new motivations, it collapsed SHIELD and the characters changed. You don't get that in Civil War. It's not that the film's bad, it's not it's actually quite good, but for me it's good in the places I care less about so I can't really give it more than a seven. I had fun and got what I wanted at the core but I felt like just a few more tweaks could have made this one of the greats.",10
19 May 2016,Runs out of ideas early on.....,"Captain America Civil War runs out of ideas early on. This is a an action film that promises a full on civil war between the Marvel stable of action hero's but what you get instead, could best be described as a ""bit of a dust up"".

The result is a action film that never really goes anywhere. Its sort of ""OK"" but like so many films in this genre, its real shortcoming is a lack of imagination and a slavish adherence to a formula that's been done to death.

In short, whilst this film is not utterly boring, its hardly interesting either. Its a deeply superficial watch, that relies on eye candy, a little well scripted but predictable action and a few special effect ""novelties"" to carry it. Five out of ten from me.

29 April 2016,Highlights just how bad BvS was,"Civil war shows how an ensemble comic book hero movie SHOULD be done. The CGI in this movie didn't look like CGI - the airport scene - shows how a superhero movie with multiple main characters SHOULD be done! No doubt you've read all the critics reviews, and by and large they are RIGHT!

But CGI alone cannot carry a film (again one of the major flaws in BvS). The story itself is compelling. You can watch this film and enjoy it without watching any other Marvel movie, but it is SO more satisfying to get all the backstory!

Words wont do this movie justice - WATCH IT - ENJOY IT - you won't be disappointed!

It gets 9/10 because NO film can ever be perfect!

2 May 2016,Well made and decent,"When I agreed to go and see this movie with friends, I regretted that decision. This is mainly because I do not enjoy many superhero movies and I rarely go out of my way to see them. But this one was an interesting journey and had a cool concept of superhero beating the hell out of each other. So I don't regret the decision anymore.

The movie is well shot but it felt like it had quite a bit of shaky cam in the fight scenes which I find quite annoying usually. The pacing of the movie felt quite fast and neatly laid out which was great. I wasn't bored through the movie like I have been with other recent Superhero flicks so that was great. The exposition can be a bit boring and tedious but the movie gets going quite quickly and has a good balance of everything you want with this type of movie.

The action is great all the way through. There are many fights spaced out through the exposition scenes, all the fights felt brutal. And because its superheroes vs each other it can feel quite personal and gripping, even though you know they wont kill each other really. If you want to see this movie, the best reason to see it is for the action and characters, as there is a lot of both them things. Plus the stories or structure are never the strong part of superhero movies usually anyway.

The characters are pretty much all the people we've seen before in the past movies plus a few new ones added in. So if you love the characters then thats one of the greatest reasons to see any movie! As the focus of this movie is more aimed at Captain America, Tony Stark is less witty then he probably would be in a movie where he is more of the focus but he still manages to get some humour in still so its not gone completely. All the actors play their parts great and all work off of each other well. No one lets the team down with a dodgy performance.

The story of course is the main point and it may be the weakest point of the movie, at least to me anyway. Superhero movies very rarely have a story that actually makes you feel anything and the story just feels like it has to be there to keep the audience away from action for a while. With that said, it isn't badly done or in need to be ranted about. The overall point in the movie was apparently done in Batman Vs Superman which doesn't surprise me as Hollywood love to release two movies at the same time with a similar narrative and message. With all this said, this movies main focus is characters and not story. And the characters are all there, so if you love them, then you'll like the movie.

It has the humour and the drama that the other films have which you may like if you enjoyed it in the other movies. If you are a fan of superhero movies at all then you should really like it as I believe it ticks all the boxes for an enjoyable superhero flick. If you aren't a fan though then you may still possibly like it because of the concept, or something else may wow you. If you hate these types of movies with a passion then you may not like this one, in fact you'll hate it. It doesn't break any ground or do much too differently that the other movies do. And given that I don't enjoy them ones, then I guess I like the movie mainly for the concept.

The movie overall is a good experience and I enjoyed it. I wouldn't mind watching it again. If I had to choose between all of the superhero films, this would be on my list of likely to pick. People might be wondering if its better than Batman Vs Superman and id say, given all the criticism that movie got, this one must be the better one out of the two.",7
7 May 2016,A rare third chapter that's solid.,"Kevin Feige, the Russos' and the MCU crew really get Cap. The Captain America trilogy is the best trilogy the MCU has provided so far. I don't think the last two Iron Man films are any good, and Thor is quite mediocre. I'd go so far as to say it's the best superhero trilogy out there as of now(Yes I did not like The Dark Knight Rises, calm down people, just my opinion).

There was no bias or favoritism involved despite it being a Captain America film. The entire time everyone's reasoning to joining a certain side is completely justified and as an audience member you absolutely see their points, making it very difficult to see who is wrong and who is right.

Tony Stark has a point. This is what the world wants, some form of accountability. Superheroes should not get a free pass. Are you gonna let a superhero get a free pass if someone close to you died during some random battle? It's tough to deal with, and it's so easy to root for Cap, but realistically, if this were the real world, you would want accountability, lets not kid ourselves. Would it actually work, maybe, maybe not, but the idea of it puts everyone into a more safer and secure mindset. He knows for a fact he needs to be put in check after the events of Ultron.

However, in Cap's point of view, given what happened in Cap 2, how HYDRA took over and the how untrusting the government can be, I think we can all agree the safest is in his own hands. The government may say that they care about the safety of the people, and even if that were true, they're also as interested in fighting in wars and guaranteeing their interests. If superheroes were to fall into their full control, the government would just use them for that purpose.

All these ideologies and view points are present and the film does a beautiful job presenting that, it's not just superheroes fighting for the sake of fighting. Give credit to writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.

The Russos' also deliver fantastic action sequences throughout. I'm not given to hyperbole, but the second act may be the best action sequence in a comic-book film ever. You'll have to see it for yourself to understand what I mean.

This film is also wonderfully acted, it's the best acted MCU film to date. Scarlett Johnasson, Anthony Mackie, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Renner, Emily VanCamp, Don Cheadle, and William Hurt deliver the goods.

Standouts to me were Sebastian Stan. He brings more to Bucky than ever. The bromance element between Bucky and Steve never felt overdone, but enough to give you the feels and make you care. He is quite a tragic character and it's very fleshed out. Chadwick Boesman delivers an effective T'challa/Black Panther. You understand his place within all this chaos. Elizabeth Olsen has a much more impactful role as Wanda Maximoff this time.

I'd like to mention the bug heroes absolutely steal the show in that airport sequence. Paul Rudd's Scott Lang is basically the audience as he displays his inner fanboy. He has a big moment in the film that will surely be memorable. In a short amount of time, Tom Holland, the Russos', Kevin Feige, and the creative team at Marvel do what Sony failed to do in the past ten years or so. I'm now more excited than ever to see the next Spider-Man feature. Holland combines the best of Maguire and Garfield in his performance. Spider-Man is not just shoe- horned in, he's got a substantial role and it's just fabulous.

For film's two leads, the heart and soul of this movie is Chris Evans as Captain America. One would think this is like an Avengers film, and Cap would get the short end of the stick, but to be honest, it really isn't just an Avengers film. Captain America is very much the lead character. He really is the heart of the MCU at this point. His morality is his greatest strength and there's an inspirational quality to his character. Downey Jr. this time around portrays a more disturbed and depressed Tony Stark. He's a bit more bleak and it's fascinating to see Tony at this state. Without any spoilers, Evans and Downey Jr. display their finest performances as these characters with an very intense and gut wrenching third act.

The only nitpick I have is Zemo played by Daniel Bruhl. Although I loved his portrayal and found to understand what his motivations were, it seemed as if his execution heavily relied on coincidences a little too much. It seemed very far fetched for all the things to unravel at point of the film, but it didn't take away from the impact it had. Honestly they didn't need Zemo at all, if you took him out of the equation then I would contend that this is a near perfect superhero epic.

With all that being said, it's still a wonderfully crafted film that did not disappoint. Where Batman v Superman tossed out ideas without ever thinking them through, Civil War is constantly aware of the consequences of its characters' actions, both to themselves and to the people around them. In my opinion Captain America: Civil War breaks the curse of every superhero threequel being either bad or disappointing. Civil War is another knock out and entertains relentlessly. It's an impressive opening to Phase 3 and nudges out The Winter Soldier for me by a hair. The Russo Brothers have a very good hold of this franchise now. They knew when to be serious and when to be humorous, balancing out the tone of the film extremely well. Not to mention juggling every character as much as they can. I think Infinity War is in very good hands.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

15 April 2016,Best superhero movie of the year,"We've seen deadpool and it was great. We've seen batkill v. Supersad which was horrible. Now get ready to be amazed!

This movie was amazing in everyway. The action was so good! the acting was good. the story was a lot better than batman v superman's story. it is everything that bvs wanted to be, but couldn't because snyder isn't as talented as either of the russos bros and the writers are better as well. civil war is the perfect comic book movie. dc lovers suck on that. even dc fanboys will cry because this movie is that good. thismovie doesn't have flaws, because.. it isn't a dc movie of course and it is absolutely perfect.

Verdict: if you hate mediocre superheroes movies, don't go to batman v superman, but if you love good superhero movies then go to civil war. it's perfect in everyway. I made this review as compensation for some idiots thinking they can bring down the score of civil war before it comes out!",10
26 August 2021,AVENGERS : CIVIL WAR... that's the name should be,"First of all, this is not a Captain America's solo movie. This is totally an Avengers movie. The civil war between the Avengers. And I'm with team Iron man.

An amazing story and screenplay and Russo brother's smart direction. This film is perfect in every technical side and the action seens are just marvelous. One of the best superhero movie it is. Nobody can miss it.

13 February 2017,Too Much CG Spioils An Otherwise Good Film,"Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man.

I see some people calling this the best Marvel film yet, and right now it sits at a 7.9 on IMDb. I would have to respectfully disagree with these champions of the film. While I do think it is a decent plot, and does a fine job of showing the philosophical differences between Iron Man and Captain America, it has two big issues for me.

One, it is far too dependent on CGI. I would rather see more physical effects, even if they might be less ""spectacular"". Frankly, I am not impressed by the CGI because any time something happens action-wise, it becomes very obvious the characters are drawn in and not played by actors. I understand that action is important to a superhero movie, but why must it be the worst-looking part? And two, while the plot does do something for character development, it really has very little to offer as far as a story. The characters seem to have very little growth. My impression is the whole point of the film was merely to set up Spider-Man and Black Panther for their own films. It definitely didn't do much for anyone else.",7
19 May 2016,A very good movie,"Watched the movie yesterday. Without giving any spoilers, I thought that it was a very enjoyable movie, even for non-super hero moviegoer fans. The acting was excellent, especially Iron Man and Spiderman. The cinematography was very good, with the main battle between the opposing factions being the highlight...superb.

The only flaw, if it can be called that, was that the movie started out rather slowly, but after the first twenty minutes or so, it was almost continuous action. No wonder that the Metascore rating is so high and the rotten tomatoes website gives the move very good reviews in general. The movie has everything, including a little humor at the right times.

20 May 2016,"Cap deserves his own movie, not Avengers 3","I will say this, ""Civil War"" is certainly a step up from ""Ultron"". It's still the same sort of bloated showroom floor for next year's big Marvel movies, and I never liked the central warring factions plot line, but it does at least have more enjoyable bells and whistles. I wasn't expecting to like the big fight at the airport. It's a noisy mess, but it's also where the movie seems to come to life, with Ant Man and Spider-Man especially. Their humor is what makes this tick, and the sad part is that it's so short-lived. It's the little things like this that get lost in the big showdowns and Marvel movie infrastructure.

But the Civil War idea is so damn stupid, and really only exists to thoroughly divide our heroes along ideological lines. I dunno, Stark just seems too insubordinate to fall in with the UN, and his motivations (not to mention the big reveal about is SPOILERS) just seem unbelievably contrived.

That said, it does end pretty well, an unlikely ray of hope manages to break through. But the question of where these characters go from here is left a mystery. I'm just not looking forward to watching the Black Panther movie for an effective closure.

10 May 2016,Captain America VS Iron man right VS wrong.,"CAPTAIN America :CIVIL WAR Is a great movie. fine acting all around. and a solid story. People are going to think this is a retelling of the Cap Vs Iron man comic book event civil war. It is not. there are similarities in the comics The Super heroes are forced to a Registration cat that forces anyone that has powers to become a government agent if you refuse they go to jail. This is done after a hero VS Bad guy conflict goes wrong and destroys a city. Cap refused to sign and Tony headed it up. Both sides did not see the wrong in their actions. The Comics took a matter of three years to resolve the aftermath of the civil war. In a series a great to less then great story arcs. This movie does not have that privilege. The story here in the movie is more or less Civil War MCU style. and it raises a lot of interesting questions.

After a mission in which the Avengers are trying to stop the last of Hydra wrong. a building gets destroyed And The Scarlet witch is blamed. The Nations of the world unite to bring an accord against the Avengers the accord makes them a body under the control of the UN. Captain America disagrees. He likes having a free hand. And he does admit the actions of the Avengers has resulted in destruction of cities and loss of lives but the alternate would have been worse. ""The safest hands are still our own"" Cap declares. but Tony and General Thunderbolt Ross disagree. Ross tells Cap the world owes them a huge unpayable debt but their is a percentage of the population is scared of them. they need to be reined in. Cap is scared of being turned into a weapon and being sent to places they might not want to go instead of going to places that they might need to go. then Bucky Barnes as the winter soldier reappears and complicates matter for Captain America. And once again Cap chooses right over wrong after the Avengers are ordered to being him in, But Cap finds out there is more to this then even Tony and his Avengers even knew. And it doesn't always come down to right or wrong but in loyalties and the courage of your convictions.

The film is a great entry in the Captain America series but not as good as winter soldier. In looking at the movie in terms of right VS wrong for a movie that tries to show us the areas of gray. It tends to force the point. I found the villain Baron Zemo uninspired in comparing him to his comic book counter part. Zemo is simply wasted. As the Mandarin is in Iron Man III. A lot of potential ruined by a script that should have been so much more. but in what we were given the movie is more then enough. Spider-man in his first Marvel movie makes it special. tom Holland claims the role in such a way that Garfield and Mcguire never did.

Of course the film ends on a sour note and in such a matter that you know it is going to be resolved in AVENGERS :INFINITY WAR or whatever the Russo's are going to call it.

Civil war isn't perfect. but it delivers the goods .",10
12 January 2017,"Given what they spent, likely felt compelled the additional dull 45 minutes","When Ant Man gets really big, shouldn't have become just a bigger easy target given he has no real powers? And when will there be a giant Ant Man vs. Godzilla movie? Come on Hollywood get it together! Anywho, this over-earnest summer popcorn movie comes out under the banner of Captain America played by the charisma-free but purdy Chris Evans but secretly and wisely treats RDJ's Tony Stark as the main attraction. A boatload of other characters clog the film many becoming forgettable during actual scenes (oh yeah, Bucky the Winter Soldier IS still in this shot). The film also makes the George Lucas second Star Wars series of spending too much time listening to politicians argue about characters who could be performing some action scene. Not that the movie lacks for action, it just comes in prolonged, interminable sequences particularly an ending fight between ""Cap"" and Ironman (oh, yeah and Bucky, he was in much of that scene) which goes on longer than The Thrilla in Manilla and yet doesn't resolve much. The movie does provide more Easter eggs than your Aunt Sally's for her annual egg hunt which will give you something to do rather than listen to the rebellious, free-thinking maverick Tony Stark incongruously argue for United Nations oversight. In short, yeah, you know it's not any of the Fantastic Four movies but not quite the first Ironman.",5
3 September 2016,Marvel fails where it lacks experience: behaving as adults,"Marvel has had no problem bringing in wacky heroes and making them feel real, yet when they need to behave like actual people, it all fizzles. Civil War depicts so many characters that it is difficult to bring in a believable villain or to develop any of them, especially with the mandatory action scenes thrown in. In the end you have a two hour and a half mess that shows grown men and women rather punch their way than talk about a common goal.

That doesn't mean it's a bad movie, just average and somewhat disappointing. While introducing Zemo, Black Panther and bringing in Spider-Man and Ant-Man, the movie feels more like one of those Mortal Kombat games than a real story. I wanted to shed tears, to understand and empathize with deep character feelings. Instead I got CGI robots fighting CGI captains.

Bottom line: more a stepping stone for the MCU than a movie with its own story and soul, it is marginally entertaining, but ultimately teaching nothing and bringing nothing new.",7

30 May 2016,Nothing you haven't already seen one million times..,"Seriously rating 8.3? This is meant to be one of the best movies of all times? I was really bored to death! Endless fighting scenes with nothing that we haven't already seen a zillion times: PIM-PUM-PAM superhero falls but then stands up and fights back PIM-PUM-PAM and the other superhero falls down. There are no fresh ideas, not even the slight effort to show something a minimum original or new. The plot is all but credible, full of ridiculous dialogues and impossible to believe behaviors. And when you don't have ideas you have to fill the void with a lot of superheroes - so many that you will lose yourself and ask why FART-MAN didn't turn up for a go! From a technical point the fighting scenes are also of very poor quality - it looks like many frames are missing from the shooting and these scenes do not come out smooth and are quite disturbing for the eye (looks like a 1970's camera was used).

1 May 2016,What Batman v Superman should have been,"Captain America: Civil War is the third Captain America movie with a similar theme to the more hyped up Batman v Superman. While Batman v Superman was an enjoyable movie it failed to live up to the hype. So it was up to Captain America: Civil War to redeem the theme of superheroes facing off against each other, and I'm glad to say it did that.

It has a better storyline and it delivers it much more systematically unlike Batman v Superman where it was very slow. It was also able to utilise other Marvel superheroes in a much better way than Batman v Superman. We also get a bit more background behind the characters portrayed in the movie. And the action is a lot better compared to your typical superhero movie.

I really enjoyed Captain America: The Winter Soldier and thought it was the best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But Civil War manages to just about match it. The Russo brothers have once again managed to do a fantastic movie. The good news is that they will also be directing Avengers: Infinity Wars Parts 1 and 2 so I'm really hoping that the Marvel Cinematic Universe will be better from here on. As for DC, standards seem to have slipped since Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. Either they need to get Nolan more involved or take a leaf out of Marvel's book if they want Justice League to be successful.",9
25 April 2021,Marvel's not afraid to go all political. Are you Team Cap or are you Team Iron Man?,"Marvel Studios' Captain America: Civil War (2016) is the best in Cap's trilogy. The Winter Soldier (2014) isn't far off, but it beats it to it not far off. The cast is bigger, the storytelling is more compelling, and the Marvel world is growing! Having Iron Man in a Captain America solo movie is pretty extraordinary, and... let's just say, including a new Spider-Man, AND a new hero in town; T'Challa/Black Panther played by the late Chadwick Boseman, is just the icing on the cake. Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man thus far, and he's got a whole way to go. May Chadwick rest peacefully as the Black Panther he'll always be known for!

The storytelling is gripping, friendship is a big thing in this story canon. Cap and Bucky's friendship puts the rest of the Avengers to the test. Is The Winter Soldier trustworthy or not? Whose the enemy; Cap or Iron Man? The best thing Marvel has done, is it's let YOU as the audience decide what's right and what's wrong? Are you Team Cap or are you Team Iron Man?

Spectacular.

6 May 2016,Marvel at its Very Best,"Captain America: Civil War was my most anticipated movie of the year. The MCU movies have made a great setup to this movie and Civil War was everything I wanted it to be and so much more. I had extremely high expectations and this movie even blew those away. This movie is AMAZING. Everything about the movie works and it is put together so well by the directors and writers. The story pretty much follows how the Avengers experience conflict and a rift is formed between Captain America and Iron Man.

We all know that the cast would bring their A game to this movie since we've seen them as these characters so many times by now, but I feel they brought their A+ game to Civil War. About the new characters, Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther is awesome. He is a very interesting guy and he is so entertaining during the action. Tom Holland's Peter Parker/Spiderman is very likable. The thing I liked about this Peter Parker is that you do feel sympathetic for him because you really see that he is just a kid in high school fighting among grown men. This Spiderman is terrific.

The story moves at a very fast pace and is both thrilling and vastly entertaining. Despite all that happens here, the movie is really at its core about the relationship and conflict between Captain America and Iron Man. The whole promotional things are about the teams but the movie focuses in depth on these two, and that is great writing. The teams don't really matter anymore because you will be able to see that both Captain and Stark have clear motivations for what they're doing and that they're both correct in certain ways. There really are clear motivations and reasons for why Captain America and Iron Man have to fight. As for everyone else, you also understand why they choose a certain side. The movie is so emotional because it feels as if the MCU has been building up to this.

The action in this film is phenomenal. There is so much action and it is all done so well. That airport scene from the trailers is AWESOME. The chases and fights are so exhilarating and I was just gripping the seat handles not knowing what would happen next. All the battles between Captain America and Iron Man are gritty and bloody. These guys are really fighting to kill here. I have to say my favorite action scenes were the ones with Black Panther and Spiderman.

A lot of people are complaining about the villain Zemo and saying he is ""shoehorned in."" I understand why they'd say that but I definitely think he was a necessary part of this plot and just like with the others, his motivations are clear. Daniel Brühl does a fairly good job in the film.

Captain America: Civil War takes everything that worked best in the previous MCU movies and builds on them. I do think this one is the best MCU film so far and the Russo brothers have proved for a second time that they know how to direct these movies effectively. I can't wait to see what they do with Infinity War. In my opinion, Captain America: Civil War is the best superhero movie besides The Dark Knight.

Captain America: Civil War gets an A+.",10

10 May 2016,Marvel show DC how it's done,"I was expecting big things from this film. Especially with the mild disappointment of Batman vs Superman. I had a lot of faith in the Russo brothers to deliver, especially after what they did with The Winter Soldier. And, boy they delivered. Again, they've delivered the perfect blend of action, humour and seriousness we've seen in other Marvel hits, but this time they had about 10 superheroes to fit in. And they did it. They actually gave each character a chance to shine in their own respect. Which I thought was outstanding. The action was expertly done, with minimal CGI and lots of hand-to-hand combat, which is how it should be done. In summary, this film has made me very excited for Infinity War. P.S: Spiderman is f***ing awesome!

30 April 2016,What A Movie,"This is the best Comic Movie Ever Made So Far,

No Spoilers For those not seeing this yet. I not comparing BvS and Civil War because Civil War is from another Universe . The plot , the character , the scene & the story is GREAT!!, Russos's really know what they are doing. Spider-Man is the best , Tom Holland play Peter Parker/Spider- Man is the best Ever , better than Toby and Andrew. Can't Wait until Spider-Man Home Coming is on theater. I'm really gonna go watch it again .

TeamIronMan vs TeamCap just WOW. Congratulation Marvel You did it AGAIN.

The true ""Civil war"" comics have several important events that never come to happen in this movie. Starting with the nuke explosion caused by masked vigilante at the city residential area.

The betrayal of S.H.I.E.L.D. to Captain America.

The super hero battle that ends in The Giant Man's death by the hands of Thor's clone, created by Reed Richards and Tony Stark, and many other things because I should say this no Civil war but something else.

5 June 2016,Captain America or Avengers??,"I have to say I am confused here. I thought I was watching a Captain America movie but after 1 hour I had to check the ticket to be sure it is not an Avengers movie. If this is a Captain America, shouldn't it be more focused on Captain America and less or close to 0 about the Avengers? We all love when all super heroes gather together but hey, let's focus the stories on the main character only. This was a bad stunt just to sell in the box office. Besides the fighting scenes which were awesome, the story behind the movie is very thin. I am a comics fan but I have to say I was getting bored at some times. Is it much to ask for a movie with a good plot and story line?

8 May 2016,Fun Avengers movie,"Totally enjoyed the movie. I've been a Captain America fan since the first movie. No one disappoints but Spider- Man. Since when did they hire a 12 year old to play the part?? Otherwise loved black panther and his accent. Scarlet Witch's abilities. Ant man's humor and his talents. Buckee and the brotherly relationship with Captain. Iron Man's quips. Ultrons sense of ethics. Black Widows martial art moves. Captain America's justifications. Nightwing's (?) toys. Hawkeye's cool factor. So it may seem like I'm being harsh on this Spider-Man actor. But it's hard to watch a Spider-Man who looks weak after watching the last two actors that portrayed him. Plus Marisa Tomei is spidey's great aunt?? In what universe?!?

9 May 2018,The lowest point on MCU? probably,"It is no secret that I am very critical of MCU films and have lost all hope in their content, if there was any doubt all it would take is a look at my review of Ragnarok movie. However while Ragnarok was an insult to the Thor and Hulk as characters and their respectively amazing and deep storylines the Civil War is an insult to the audiences. The downfall of MCU storytelling comes with Civil War, this film is so boring and so unimaginably stupid that I have yet to watch it and not feel the urge to have my palm meet my face in a facepalm so inevitable you would say it was 8 years into making. The real problem here is the way the story goes about to justify its events when nothing in it makes any sense. Anyone even remotely familiar with the Civil War ark of stories from Marvel comics would tell you that Civil War movie is not even in the slightest remotely like the source material. Lets say for the sake of the argument that we are going to ignore the source material (Even though that is a big mistake for any medium that is basing its content on a source material that is established and well known) and just focus on what we are given we are presented with such a bad story telling it turns out to be worse than Iron Man 3's entire second half and then some. This movie presents you with challenges that are none existent, like blames put on our characters that are baseless, in one scene we go through all the wrong the Heroes have done while completely ignoring the fact that literally none of these were at any part the heroe's fault and to top it off the one that was their fault (the situation in Africa in Age of Ultron) is not even addressed in that particular scene. Then we have back and forward about what is right and what is wrong and it just falls flat with really little reason to consider any argument but the argument presented by Captain America. You see that comes from inconsistent story telling, in another scene Captain America is considering reverting his decision only to change his mind again because of a simple thing as one person being kept hidden because they are probably unstable (hello? since when Captain America suddenly has a problem with that? did this dude forget Hulk being kept hidden a big part of Avengers 2 or other times they had to hide for similar reasons?) The villain is worse than Iron man 2 and 3 combined, his actions are unnecessarily convoluted and go through complex hoops that makes you wonder if there is more about this character we are not being told. For example he has knowledge about some stuff that he is going to use for his scheme. Information exclusive to Hydra big guys and this guy had nothing to do with Hydra, so what gives? This thing just goes on and on when it should have not taken half as long as the time it took to put 2 plus 2 together to get the answer which is 4 not 5!

You see the reason CW comics was loved was its careful plannings, its very first seeds were planted long before the story ark ever started. It also followed several huge catastrophic events that Heroes had messed up like Hulk going on a rampage that destroyed Las Vegas, the entire House of M ark and much more. It was a labor of love, it took planning and good writing, clearly things CW the movie did not receive. The action sequences are really well done and that is a given thing but that seems to be one of my bigger concerns too, these movies have moved past the comic book super hero movies and turned into normal Action flicks. For the unimaginative and bad storytelling combined with lack luster sound design I give this movie 3 stars.",3
2 September 2020,A fantastic start for Phase 3!,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",10

30 April 2016,The world we are in,"This is the world we are living in. Where higher ideals become nothing but shadows on the wall in a Platonic cave, when the defenders of those ideals are shackled by the heckles of the mushy side of democracy, where the UN is inundated by those who are let in in principle to honor a fuller spectrum of representations but who are once in become agents who dilute, obscure and block the very fundamental reasons why the UN was conceived and what it was meant to defend in the first place. The strength of democracy is now being cleverly used as weapon against itself by the unsavory to advance their anti-democratic causes. That is what Captain America Civil War is about in a mashed up, comic book sort of way using the US as an analogy of the greater world.

5 May 2016,You just gotta love Marvel.,"I don't know why but everything Marvel puts it's hands on succeeds somehow. 'Captain America: Civil War' is the third ""Captain America"" stand-alone movie and the first of Marvel's Phase 3. I've never been a comic-reader nor am I a big Marvel-geek, but the MCU has in the meantime become a part of my annual movie visit's. And I'm not yet tired of them, especially not after Marvel's supposedly best adaptation to date.

With 'Civil War', Marvel reaches new depths and significance. Apart from the typical Marvel humor we are offered a side that proves high demands as well as some seriousness as we have seen in 'Winter Soldier'. The Russo Brothers here, too, prove their skills and show us a new, more grown up side of the MCU. First and foremost ascribable to the grounded story, that does not only put the Avengers to test but will also get every Marvel enthusiast into a conflict. The discord between our otherwise well attuned superheroes is the core of the story and the reason for the imminent ""war"". But we aren't pushed in an alleged right direction. Both sides are justified in their individual views and comprehensible in their motivations. The conflict, which is the incentive of the entire movie is inarguably clearly to be felt and appears most of all plausible. Every fan that chose a side will find himself questioning his decision, if he allows himself to.  But not only do the motivation of the torn Avengers seem reasonable but also those of the antagonist Zeemo, though they are maybe held a little too simple. Besides all the old characters, 'Civil War' also introduces two new characters: Black Panther and Spiderman, who finally returned to the MCU, last year. I can't even put into words how incredibly awesome both are portrayed and how much I'm looking forward to seeing both their stand-alone movies. I don't even want to say much more about them. You simply have to see and enjoy them on the big screen yourselves. All the characters appearing in this movie fit into the storyline and are in no way incoherently presented to us. Not for one minute does the movie feel crowded or simply disorganized. Even though not all of the characters have the same amount of screen time, everyone has their shining moment and reason to be in the movie. The interactions throughout the movie are especially great to watch. Partly pretty hilarious and entertaining but also severe and emotionally touching. In general this movie has throughout alongside the unique humor much more grown up and serious parts. Not only palpable through the stunningly written script, but also to be seen in the nerve-racking fight sequence of the last act, that will thrill but also shock everyone watching. The tension that is build up in those few minutes is incredible. Needless to say, that the action scenes are well choreographed and beautifully filmed just like they were in it's predecessor. 'Civil War' probably delivers one of the best on screen action in the history of Marvel. 

Conclusion: 'Civil War is Marvel's most mature movie and in addition has a big emotional impact, that I haven't seen in any Marvel movie before. In combination with the for Marvel typical humor the movie seems to be well balanced and atmospherically harmonious. 'Civil War' is without doubt Marvel's most grown up movie to date. Whether it is the best, that's up to you to decide. It's definitely far up on my list, because just thinking or writing about it makes me want to go back to the movies.",
31 March 2020,Captain America,"In the end, Captain America: Civil War is an entertaining film while dealing with complex human emotions.There is no shortage of darkness, death, and destruction in this film, but comedic touches offer welcome shifts in mood.

17 February 2021,Real Life Without Being Real Live,"I'm not a big comics guy nor do I really follow all of the ""super hero"" type movies that seem to be coming out every couple of months or so... at least before the China virus super villain invaded Hollyweird and the rest of humanity. But I really like the Captain America series for its generally pro-America/Liberty/Freedom stance and its ability to tell great stories related to the times we are in without flinching and with only names and fancy uniforms to stand in for the real-world entities they mirror.

""Civil War"" is a magnificent embodiment and reflection on our divided political views and the sometimes harsh realities that come with being ""free"" and defeating tyranny: Do we play nice and appease the evil forces in the world for the sake of avoiding potential collateral damage in confronting them now before they get too strong to defeat? Or do we look the other way and pretend the forces of evil aren't there and continuing to grow as we paper over the reality with formal systems of appeasement such as the UN in an attempt to lend credibility to our cowardice? Do we face ridicule and punishment for standing up to evil now even though the inevitable costs of doing so will be high? Or do we keep our mouths shut and hope for the best while knowing that eventually, everything we hold dear will be destroyed if we ignore our consciences? Or do we do the right thing anyway and accept our roles as outcasts and scapegoats in the eyes of the very society we save from itself?

This is a pretty serious film about a very serious time in the history of our world which is now. Bravo to the studio and all involved for making such an unflinching piece of ""fiction.""

The only reason I give it 9 stars instead of 10 is because I believe that the use of CGI is excessive and distracting. I think a lot of the scenes could have done without it or used some other ""real"" methods to get the same effect. At some point you have to ask if the film is live action or a cartoon. And while it is a mix of both, it relies a little too much on the later. Obviously some scenes could not be done without CGI but many could have been done without it... as with fight scenes between two or more characters which could have been done live action but CGI characters were used instead. This to me is just distracting and it pulls me out of the film. Plus there were some other things that bothered me such as the under-explained absence of The Hulk and this new character ""Cross-Bones"" that, while I know his background, just seems unnecessary, underdeveloped and gets lost in a sea of other much more important and interesting characters.

Also, the witty banter, tough-guy (gal) one-liners and super-stylized poses and moves starts wearing thin really quick. It's just too much. Much of the dialog, I'm sure, is designed to inject comic relief but it winds up feeling forced and inappropriate much of the time... like when ""friends"" are fighting and practically trying to kill each other they like to quip back and forth with jokes or comments of admiration on their fighting styles or their snazzy outfits. Just not very appropriate and is in juxtaposition to the serious nature of the situations. Sort of like your oncologist telling you a ""bald guy"" joke while you are dying of cancer. Again, pulls me right out of the film.

If they can stop going overboard with the CGI and constant cringe-worthy attempts at tough one-liners and failed comic relief, they will have a great formula for future films. Overall a great movie and well worth the viewing.",9
7 October 2016,Near Flawless,"The Russo's just get better and better when it comes to directing action. Civil War is one of the best looking movies I have seen this year and is definitely showing that Marvel is not losing any momentum and is here to stay.

While The Avengers are trying to stop Crossbones in Wakanda and something happens that kills a lot of innocent people. This causes some powerful people to put The Avengers in check, this also divides the team as some believe it is a good idea to be put in check (Iron Man) and some think it is unpatriotic (Captain America). There is also drama surrounding Bucky's past and this creates great tension between certain characters creating very emotional fights which again look amazing and are directed perfectly by the Russo's. We are also introduced to two new characters in the MCU, Black Panther and Spider-Man. Black Panther is a wild card and has his own motivations for being in the middle of the fight and he is a total badass who earns his right to be in the film but I feel that Spider-Man was a little tacked on. Don't get me wrong Tom Holland played the wall crawler better than anyone we have seen on the big screen yet and I'm very excited to see Homecoming next year but while it was a strong introduction, it did feel a little tacked on at times. There are also moments where you find yourself wondering why a character is even in the movie, you never quite get a clear motive for him being there and it is a little noticeable but it will not take you out of the film.

Overall this was definitely one of my favorite films of the year so far with great direction, cinematography, and great performances. I give Captain America: Civil War a 9/10",7
30 April 2016,"This is how a ""versus"" movie should be done.","After a disappointing ""versus"" movie we got a couple of months ago, Captain America: Civil War was clearly a remedy for that. The best thing about it was they've had a reason to fight and a reason to end it without a lame excuse like sharing the same mother's name. The story was simple, not about who's right or wrong, it was about what you believe in and how that would make you different from the others and the results of it sometimes not what you expected. Throughout the movie I couldn't decide which sides I would take because both team had valid reasons to defend their decision. The actors were really on top of their games. For me, the highlights were Elizabeth Olsen and Tom Holland (yes, he's a perfect Spider-Man). I also agree to some people who didn't like this version of Baron Zemo, but after watching the movie for second time, I think Zemo was a brilliant mastermind in creating the conflict between Avengers and I hope that he will appear in the future MCU films.

29 April 2016,Wow. Comics over Movies . . . Until now.,"Okay, as a massive comic book fan I have always found the Marvel, DC movies a bitter pill to swallow mostly because I thought the comics where better . . . Well, not in this case.

Sure, Civil War is really not like the comic, certain characters aren't there and the teams are different, but OMFG, this movie is amazing, from beginning to end, it's just a bomb of great dialog and amazing fight scenes!!

Steve Rogers! Tony Stark! Both amazing as per usual, I walked in there as Team Ironman, then when i saw the difference in the story I actually was emotionally torn between them! It was a hard thing to watch and that alone proves to me the depth in this movie!

Their fight scene in the airport is potentially one of the best fight scenes I have EVER seen, some of my favorite comic heroes, Ironman, spiderman, black panther and scarlet witch all just throwing down! MY GOD! . . .

Only ""downside"" if I had to pick at something, was some of the fight scenes had so freaking much going on it got a little hard to follow with the shaky cams! OH and I wish they had made a better fight scene with Widow and Sharon Carter VS the Winder solider, that would have been bad ass!

But this movie borderlines perfect for me and they 100% deserve the 10/10. Congrats guys.",10
21 May 2016,Paprikash,"In the 1980s cartoon Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends, arch-fiend The Chameleon's master plan left something to be desired: ""I will destroy your friendship – get you to distrust, even dislike each other!"" Flash-forward thirty years, and the same conflict anchors one of the most expensive movies ever made. Okay, so it's contextualized within more sociopolitical morality debates and Avengers than you can shake a shield at. Still, veteran Winter Soldier/Community directors Joe and Anthony Russo carefully keep hurt feelings the eye of the blockbuster storm. Their ability to effortlessly counterbalance the macro and micro levels of the conflict makes Captain America: Civil War a strong candidate for the most satisfying superhero film ever. It shrugs off clichés that had been threatening to bog the genre down, while reaffirming its core populist appeal with unprecedented nuance.

Switching gears from the colourful din of Age of Ultron to the far more interesting Age of Accountability, Civil War neatly consolidates the politics of its comics source text into about as in-depth an interrogation of the ethics of unsanctioned vigilante justice as we're ever likely to get in a franchise blockbuster. Like Ultron, there's simply too much going on for Civil War to not have a 'bit-y,' episodic feel, which undercuts the sweeping feeling of exhilarating, euphoric rush many of the best Marvels deliver. Unlike Ultron, all these bits are actually good. Every character's dialogue breathes distinctly and organically, while their respective subplots are fastidiously orchestrated - with even inconsequential emotional beats unexpectedly coming crashing back as red herring climaxes later on.

The Russos keep the moral naval-gazing concise but impactful, giving both sides of the debate a fair hearing, without backseat driving the viewer to taking a side. If anything, considering the 'Captain America' in the film's title, Rogers' steadfast conviction in individual autonomy has its fair share of holes poked in it, making it a genuinely even moral playing ground. And if the politics are motivated a touch over-conveniently at times (Rogers' resolution to keep fighting the good fight during a inspiring eulogy is one of the film's few stumbles of contrivance, while a non-sequitur kiss briefly flirts with the surreal unacceptability of 'Brutasha'), the Russos, in true Marvel fashion, are always ready with a quip or more stunning fight choreography to keep the melodrama at bay.

Ah yes - let them fight. It's no exaggeration to say that Civil War showcases, hands down, the most spectacular superhero action combat we've seen yet. The opening anti-terrorist Avenging takedown of Frank Grillo (remember him?)'s tech-beefed Crossbones is itself pulse-pounding fun, exhilarating without overstaying its welcome. But let's face it: it's the hero vs. hero airport super-brawl you came for. You're not wrong to do so; the hype doesn't do it justice. Gone is the bland spectacle of mowing through faceless CGI blurs. Here, our combat is up-close, unprecedentedly intricate choreography, grounded in character, humour and Star Wars references, crunchy with moral ambiguity, and consistently topping itself with more and more 'Big Moments.' It's almost obnoxious how awesome this fight is.

That said, it's the finale you'll really take away with you. An abrupt about-face from the bombastic fun of earlier, following a trail of twists and turns we genuinely don't anticipate (including a climax riffing on Se7en of all things...), Civil War's final fight is pared-down, viciously gritty, and microcosmically ties together the entire MCU thus far. It's also exhaustingly grim, which would be a buzzkill if it weren't so intimately emotionally truthful. Still, stay until the very end of the credits if your spirits need further bolstering.

The film's real battle is deciding which character to cheer for the most. We get more time with relative newcomers - Elizabeth Olson and Paul Bettany adorably weave tender humour into contemplating godlike powers amongst mortals - but veterans like Scarlett Johansson and Don Cheadle find new wrinkles and punchlines to explore. If Sebastian Stan's Bucky verges on tiresome histrionics, he's easily redeemed when paired with the hilarious banter of Anthony Mackie. Meanwhile, the inhumanly charming Paul Rudd delivers an infinitely more satisfying Ant-Man mini-movie in fifteen minutes than his whole flaccid feature. As new blood, Daniel Brühl's Zemo wisely stays mostly behind the scenes, deftly delivering one of the franchise's most complex, troubling foes. Chadwick Boseman's slick, sombre Black Panther is breathlessly captivating, and the prospect of waiting two years for more of him is agony. But the winner might be Tom Holland's prolonged cameo as a certain prodigal web-head, whose chatty cheeriness was so perfect it reduced our theatre to delirious cheers of euphoria.

Nonetheless, the film's greatest accomplishment is reinvigorating the MCU's two most beloved characters as relevant again. Robert Downey Jr.'s career-defining sassy Stark charisma had been imperceptibly threatening to dip into the quagmire of phoned-in indifference in his last few outings. Here he's back - vivaciously emotive and present, and owning a nuanced redemption arc that we actually buy like nobody's business. Conversely, Chris Evans traces Captain America's dogmatic, unwavering morality and gradual acceptance of his role as propaganda figurehead to darker places than you'd ever imagine, his strained conviction verging on the psychotic. The MCU has largely found its groove in refuting the genre's trends of claustrophobic darkness, but allowing Downey Jr. and Evans to dabble is morbidly fascinating and entirely truthful, and a reminder of just how talented they are.

Civil War isn't as taut and punchy as Winter Soldier, or liable to pump you up as much as Guardians of the Galaxy or The Avengers. It's arguably better: the mature instalment needed to keep the genre in check, leaving us genuinely fascinated to see how the franchise proceeds. The fact that it's also furiously fun, and does justice to its dizzying excess of characters and content? Maybe, as Winter Soldier's Baron Strucker proclaimed, we really are in the 'age of miracles.'

24 May 2016,"Bad Direction, Insipid Script","Why did the moneymen entrust this franchise movie to two TV directors whose biggest accomplishment was getting the shows ""Community"" and ""Animal Practice"" canceled. Their lack of experience explains why they felt they needed to use the nausea inducing shaky camera for action scenes, why no scenes were cleanly cut and simply slid into each other, and why bad dialogue abounded. Joe & Tony, this is a movie, not a bad comedy series. You could tell the actor's were as thrilled with this direction as I was as they sleepwalked though their parts.

The overall story logic kind of worked, but was so weak they threw in characters left and right simply to get enough content. Wait to watch until it come out on on free TV...which should happen in about a week.

6 May 2016,The Russo Brothers Do It Again,"Whenever Anthony Russo and Joe Russo are behind the camera for these Marvel films; I get extra excited to go to the theater and check it out. There should be no surprise that they were given the reins to direct Infinity Wars. Civil War doesn't disappoint at all as it brings the same level of tension and comedy as The Winter Soldier. Both movies tell powerful stories compared to the rest of the Marvel Universe that leave you on the edge of your seat.

What made Age of Ultron just an okay movie was the lack of a strong villain and the constant running gags that can take the viewer out of the moment. The jokes really felt forced in Ultron and had me cringing all the way through. Civil War was more subtle with the comedy which I enjoy way more. Civil War goes away from the typical bad guy and makes the viewer think who is in the right. Do heroes need to be controlled by the government or should the heroes be able to be heroes?

So I believe the story was top notch for a Marvel film and they were able to blend in all the characters without it being forced. It seemed like all the ""minor characters"" got equal amount of screen time which was a surprise too me. The airport scene was a little long and silly at times but it was fine. I am a little disappointed by how much the trailers gave away in the airport scene. There are still a couple of cool moments but a lot of the fighting moments were in the trailers.

3 May 2016,A really good 3rd captain America movie,"I saw Captain America and i've got to say that this was a really good movie, not the best comic book movie ever but a very good. What i like best on this movie was of course Spiderman (he was the main reason that i saw this movie) and i was really curious and very impressed about Black Panther. I'm not very familiar about this character, don't know his origin and basically don't know anything but he was a very interesting character who plays a very important role in this story.

I believe that almost everyone know the storyline so i'm not going to say anything about the movie or going to spoil it for the others but some facts. At first and maybe it was only me but i was really disappointed about spider-man's costume, maybe they are going to going to get it much better on Spiderman: Homecoming but at this point on this movie i didn't like it. And second thing about this movie and mostly for the 'fans', please guys don't compare it with BvS movie, Civil War was a very good movie with lot of action and drama and good humor and Russo's tied up the Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron really good on this movie and this gives us the view that Marvel has a plan and develop their characters movie by movie than BvS which was the just the 2nd movie of the DCU. So guys just don't compare it.

Now my score for this great movie is 9/10. I really enjoy it, it's a MUST SEE movie and i believe that the ticket price is well spend and no one going to regret it.",8

13 April 2016,"A fun experience, but not a great film.","It is by no means a great film. It's just solid, good fun. The fantastic action sequences were well shot, but other than that the cinematography was lacking. At times, I felt the framing and color palette made the film look like something that was made for television.

The score for the film is lacking as well, especially for a film of this magnitude. It would have been nice to stray away from the generic, somewhat flat score, and instead have something more befitting of the films scale. The score at times undercut the epicness of what was transpiring on screen, which was quite jarring for me.

The acting was fantastic. Robert Downey Jr. in particular gives his best performance as Stark to date. And the writing for his character is quite fantastic as well. I think it's fair to say I'm Team Iron Man.

It's impossible to hate this film or call it terrible. I would gladly recommend this film to anyone, though I'd tell them to keep their expectations in check. Ultimately, I think this is a film that won't age too well, in the same way as The Avengers (2012). That film was hailed as one of the best films ever when it was released, rated above 9 on IMDb and with a very good Rotten Tomatoes rating. But as time went on, and people judged it for it's cinematic elements rather than the gimmick of seeing those characters on screen for the first time, the perception of the film changed. I think the same should happen with Civil War, because it's more reliant on the spectacle rather than it's cinematic quality.",2
24 September 2016,The heroes're divided and so the fans!,"Before watching this I thought what the Avengers are doing here. I believed they got the title wrong. Once I watched it, I'm still the same. Because it did not look like the Captain America's film, he never was dominated, so calling it as his film totally inappropriate. Technically, it is a third Avengers film and well done. I liked it, it was entertaining. But the Civil War means it's nothing a nation's war within, just these super-guys fight for themselves against what kind of administration they want to come under.

I think they have heard that people's complaint about blowing up the buildings during reviewing other films by bringing up this one. So they finger pointed those events in this narration and that is one of the reasons for the Civil War to take place. Particularly disturbing the public and loss of many lives when these powerful men fighting the bad guys. The fun part is they are off the street and had a most important confrontation of the film in a deserted airfield. So does it make people who were whining about that be happy?

I don't know, but as an entertaining film, it did everything it can give the best for the viewers. Like the title and posters reveal, the heroes are divided here and probably you're going to take a side. Like usual, I'm with the Stark. So if you're like me, then you would feel the annoyance with the opposite team, particularly like Antman and obviously Captain America's rebellious decision. It was like the world versus United States, because only Americans are behind Captain America. Anyway, I did not like dividing the fans and what this film has been a serious damage. I hope the fans won't take it seriously.

15 May 2016,Better than expected,"I have to admit that my expectations weren't very high on this movie. Although the interesting trailer, I always thought it will be the same like with the Age of Ultron, few good moments in kind of boring movie. I have never been so wrong in my life.

In my opinion, this movie has good action moments, with the pinch of humor in right moments (I'll never forget car scene with Cap, Bucky and Falcon). And, once again, Marvel hit the spot with the choice of actors. Chadwick, Tom and Daniel rightfully took place side to side with the rest of the excellent standard crew. Also, Paul Rudd as Ant Man fitted like a puzzle in Team Cap.

Not to lie, there were some moments which were a little bit too long and made you think Oh, come on already"". Exactly for this reason I gave 9/10, because I couldn't wait the second after credits because I had to go to the bathroom. But, overall impression is positive and I would watch it again soon. Team Cap FTW!",9
29 April 2016,DC vs. Marvel: Surprisingly DC won,"Contains spoilers -


This is my first review and since I am German, forgive me any grammatical mistakes.

However my verdict is no mistake.

It seems to be Zeitgeist, that heroes fight against heroes.

In Cap3 we see Cap and Iron-Man fight against each other because Tony Stark feels bad about people getting killed (actually nobody meant for anybody to die, but Wanda's decision was not the brightest). In my opinion the suicide-bomber version in the Civil- War-Comics was a better one, than the ""colleteral damage-version"" in the movie. But that was not enough for Tony Stark to get mad as a douche-bag. Bucky killed his parents (don't remember that from any comic I've read). Don't you think, that's overkill? In my opinion it would have been the wiser choice, that Captain America doubts his action, since he was more involved in the deaths than Iron-Man. Wanda should have chosen an SM-outfit (remember Speedball in the comics), because she was involved in the deaths of many. Why does Tony Stark suffer more than Cap, when a mother gives him a photo of her son who died in the Age of Ultron-movie? My verdict: The comic on which the movie is based convinced me much more of the conflict. In the comic-books Peter Parker chose to reveal his secret identity, because that was what the government demanded so that heroes were no loose canons.

DC's Batman vs. Superman wasn't as funny as Cap3 was, but: The fight between Supe and Bat was orchestrated more convincingly. The end of the fight was a humane shift of Bat's opinion, which stirred a lot of emotions in me.

Cap3 let me laugh out loud in some scenes, but did not move me emotionally.

If you like Cap3 and haven't watched Batman vs. Superman, please give it a try.",5

7 May 2016,for dedicated fans it should be a blast,"Despite all of their heroic deeds, the Avengers have left an extensive trail of collateral damage causing politicians to view them as vigilantes who've operated outside the boundaries. When the 'Accords' are passed to regulate superhuman activity, tensions mount and definitive lines are drawn between moralistic Steve Rogers—who sees regulation as an infringement upon their right to choose, and repentant Tony Stark—who believes they should be put in check for any catastrophes they've caused. With new and very personal threats emerging, Earth's mightiest heroes suddenly find themselves engaged in conflict with their former comrades-in-arms. Not so much a Captain America solo adventure as it is an Avengers free-for-all, this is a unique and exciting blend of comic book adaptation and political thriller, with compelling themes of friendship, loyalty, and betrayal, not to mention the sheer joy of seeing so many superheroes engaged in a smackdown of epic proportions. There are too many characters to do all of them justice, but with great lines, spectacular action scenes/effects, and laugh-out loud humor, this is still a comic book geek's dream that only heightens anticipation for the future of the MCU. ***

30 April 2016,A properly done versus movie. A great thriller movie. An amazing Marvel movie.,"As a showdown between arguably the 2 leaders in the Avengers, this movie doesn't disappoint (as I thought BvS did). You have many scenes that illustrate both sides of this conflict, the lawful and the rightful. Captain America and Iron Man are not opposite personalities. They just have different definitions of justice and protecting the world. The movie refuses to pick a side: it will push the viewers to pick one purely on emotion.

As a solo movie and a sequel of ""Winter Soldier"", this movie continues to have a ""spy"" feeling. It's not an epic showdown a la Avengers, it's more of a personal film focused in both Captain America and Iron Man. There's several twists of that kind. The action doesn't disappoint, however, the villain is forgettable.

As a Marvel Movie, this maybe the best one yet. It loosely follows the comics but I think it made the right changes almost every time. It has an incredible number of characters and yet it almost never feels overcrowded (Amazing Spider Man 2, Avengers 2) and it never feels like it has less substance than visual appealing (BvS). Every character is used correctly, and you can almost feel inside a comic book (Also, Spidey was very good)

Greaat job, Marvel. And also the Russo brothers. Avengers 3 is in good hands.",9
24 May 2016,Why did I go and see this film?,"I was torn between going to see this film and Angry Birds, I saw the IMDb + Rotten Tomatoes ratings and decided this might be an exception to the rule of terrible recent superhero films. Now I deeply regret my choice. No matter how bad Angry Birds was, it can't have been this bad...

The action seemed oriented towards (and possibly directed by) 4 year olds mashing plastic dolls together. You never really feel that any of the characters are in any danger (with one exception later on), because they're all, well, superheroes, except that one guy with a bow and arrow, who might have been a superhero in the middle ages but seems hopelessly out of place in this futuristic battlefield.

The portrayal of Africa was just stereotyped and ignorant, as expected, while the portrayal of America as selflessly struggling with the burden of protecting the rest of the world with the best possible intentions was contemptible.

There were some fairly amusing parts, usually involving Captain America's biceps, but most of the jokes fell flat. There were a few attempts at emotional depth, which, for me at least, failed miserably.

The action felt boring and repetitive, and lost its appeal within about 20 minutes of a 2 and a half hour film. The antagonist was completely underdeveloped; rather than the usual lack of backstory, this guy just suffered from having no particular skills that would allow him to stage a major plot against the omnipotent avengers.

Now, I know I'm not the intended audience for this film (i.e over 10 years old, enjoy films with a bit of depth), but I enjoyed the (Bale) Batman trilogy and was maybe hoping that this film was in that kind of vein. Sadly, it wasn't. However, younger kids with a violent temperament, CGI fans and real Marvel obsessives might enjoy it.",1
30 April 2016,Billion dollars in the pocket for Marvel...,"Civil war...hold onto your seats people,because this movie is mind blowing.I personally do not watch many super-hero movies.I have a few names to mention when it comes to it,The Dark Knight trilogy still remains the best super-hero series for me.Now,I know I seriously should not be comparing DC Comic and Marvel universe,but this is exactly the case here.This movie has totally lived up to its expectation.The release of the teasers and trailers did not reveal much of a plot,but it was really well edited and subsequently became a back bone to the success of the film.The story of the film is simple and it stays simple to the very end.There are less elements of suspense throughout the movie which isn't necessarily a bad thing.For this movie,an expectation is panned out in every scene,but the director has given much more than we expect.The director has completely won in every department to capture the audience attention.The highlights of this film is the action scenes.There are three major action scenes in this film.My particular best is the fight scene at the beginning of the movie.Scarlett Johansen has rocked in some action sequences more than the others.The screenplay of the film is brilliant,I honestly did not feel time passing by while watching this 150 minute long film,in fact quite puzzled on short it was.The compelling scenes in the film makes it more interesting along the way.The music was magnificent.Kudos to the music director for understanding the script and composing great epic music.All technical aspects were well handled.Amazing cinematography and perfect VFX made this a greater level of visual experience.Final say,I watched a DC Comic movie this year,and I was totally unimpressed,now I have watched this,and it has become one of the best super-hero movies of all time,in my books.Don't go for a war,go home and watch Civil War...",8
16 April 2016,Best marvel movie,"THe best marvel movie. THis movie is a combo of politics, action and emotions.I simply love it. Marvelous job by directors Anthony and Joe Russo . The story is nice . CGI is great . A solid performance by all the actors. Tom Holland as spider man is ultimate. Screenplay is also good. Chadwick as T'Challa nails it. This movie is not gonna disappoint you. One of the best movie I saw in my life. Good job Marvel. Civil war is better than the winter soldier an the avengers . Everyone should watch this movie. With this movie the expectations for avengers infinity war rises. Cinematography in civil war is good. This movie is the starting of the phase 3 which I bet is gonna be better than phase 1 and 2.

1 May 2016,Wow,"I have just returned from seeing Civil War in the theatre, and I can hands down say that it is not only the best film of 2016 so far, but it is also one of the greatest movies of the last decade. I don't want to go into spoiler territory for this review, but all I can say is that you will enter the cinema as your adult self, and leave a child. I have never been so immersed and captivated by a superhero movie like this before, I felt like my 8 year old self once again.

The chemistry between Evans (Captain America) and RDJ (Iron Man) is phenomenal, and although they are both the stars of the film as it were, the best performances of the movie come from Sebastian Stan (Bucky), Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther) and, much to everybody's delight, Tom Holland (Spiderman). When I first heard that Holland would be taking up the iconic role, I wasn't sure. I had grown up with Tobey Maguire as my Spiderman, and I thought that he would be irreplaceable for the rest of time. But Tom Holland knocked it out of the park, and he truly made the role his own during his short time on screen.

I could go on forever about how good all of the performances were, honourable mentions must go to Daniel Bruhl (Zemo) and Paul Rudd (Ant-Man). Both of them, like Holland, exceeded my expectations. In fact, Ant-Man was dark horse of this movie, and just like Spiderman he provides some of the funniest moments of the movie. The reason I haven't rated it 10/10 is simply because there were some slightly cornier moments (e.g. although of I lover Renner's portrayal of Hawkeye, I felt as though his dialogue was ruining the intensity and the excitement of some scenes).

Some may argue that there was too much action, but I thought that there was a perfect amount, the final fight scene will take your breath away. Trust me. I am so excited for both Infinity War and Spiderman: Homecoming that it is unreal. Marvel have put DC to shame with Civil War, and they should be extremely proud of themselves. I am very proud to call myself a Marvel fan after this truly incredible movie; it is a modern day masterpiece. Captain America: Civil War earns a very impressive 9/10. Performance of the movie: Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther)",9
6 May 2016,Civil War - Marvel's one of the best movie .,"The movie was very very good and Captain America is the best trilogy of Marvel leaving first one meh . Movie is not very like comics but still it is done so great that we don't even miss comics and can be viewed by everyone and not only comic fans unlike Batman v Superman which I think it was their only mistake . Every Avenger was used perfectly except Vision but Vision has nothing to do in this . At every superhero entrance the hall cheered especially at Black Panther's and Spider- Man's. Black Panther has its moment and they are all awesome , the more you look at him the more you want from him .Tom Holland is perfect as Peter Parker and as Spider - Man by far and he definitely steals the show in Airport fight sequence and so do Ant-Man but they both have small roles in this but Anthony and Joe Russo used them perfectly and I think Avengers Infinity War movies are in good hands . The last fight is good but not that emotional as people are saying but both Captain America and Iron Man were right in last fight so you cant really pick sides on that , other than that Captain is right in this and you will get to see . The only think I don't like is that Marvel still can't get emotional even after 8 years that is the only thing I don't like with Marvel . But this is definitely one of the best Marvel movie till date . I am definitely going for second time tomorrow and everyone should also after their first time .",9
8 May 2016,Review of Cival War,"If this movie were to be a song it would have about 6 notes played over and over. The characters are tremendously underdevloped.

The only one to hold his own was RD. I sat there as long as I could stand it and finally got up and left.

Going to the movies should be a fun experience......this flat out failed.

This review has to be longer than I have made it.....however, it would be just like the movie, a series of the exact things to be said.

Let me make it longer, don't waste money for seeing really nothing but about a series on 6 notes repeated.

I rarely get up and walk out of a movie but my son and I both agreed......I want something from the money that I spend.

Captain America was not inspiring in any way.",1
28 July 2020,Up there with the best,"Very enjoyable MCU movie, good how the conflict came with in and some of the fight scenes were crazy good. Introduction of black panther and Spider-Man were definitely welcome and the relationship between Steve and Buckie is brilliant. Good all round film and up there with the best of them.

28 April 2022,I LOVE the Captain America Trilogy,"The last movie of the captain america trilogy and its amazing as always. The Captain America movies always feel like something big. Nearly like the Avengers movies. This is no exception. We get introduced to a lot of new characters like Black Panther or Spider-Man. For me this movie is actually kinda the point where the MCU changed and got more connected to eachother. I love this movie and I love the action in it. Definitely one of the best MCU movies!

17 April 2016,The Comic Book Movie,"So far we had many comic book movies, but we never had so far, THE comic book movie. Not until Civil War! The Russo brothers did something I did not expect, exceed The Winter Soldier and make not only the best Marvel movie so far but the best movie in its genre so far. The movie is not only an epic proportioned spectacle but also a very well thought conclusion to what previous movies have been leading up to. From a technical standpoint the movie is, just like The Winter Soldier a delight. Practical effects, very good implementation of CGI, beautiful camera work and choreography, sound and a solid script. The Russo brothers take action to another step with amazingly cut action scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat. I need to mention that Captain America Civil War has one of the best action scenes I have seen, ever. The movie not only offers great action but also very good character development, strong performances from each member of the cast and more than enough screen time for everyone. The newcomers, Black Panther and Spiderman are as expected among the highlights of this spectacular flick. The movie has its issues, while it is up for debate the villain played by Daniel Bruhl is most definitely the biggest low in this movie along with some specific scenes where the editing can get a little confusing and tiresome making it hard to keep track on what is happening on screen. With all these said the movie is absolutely excellent and a whole new level for comic book movies.",10
15 April 2016,"Civil War will succeed, BvS has failed.","Once again, Marvel has proved itself to make good movies, all movies depend on a good script, good director and good producer which Marvel has all three. Those who think BvS is better than Marvel is clearly psychotic, Autistic, mentally unstable, delusional and paranoid at the same time. Dc films except the dark knight trilogy does not however. Marvel films has a good balance in characters and jokes and dark moments while doing all very good at the same time. BvS has shown nothing interesting in particular or potential to expand their universe, watch Winter soldier, and Iron man, they are the best films to be made and the rest of Marvel films.

7 May 2016,The Russo brothers did it again!,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",9
10 May 2016,why why why,"Superheroes pitted against each other in a quest for righteousness this seems to be the trend this year. First it was superman versus batman and now its captain America . The movie starts from where captain America 'The Winter Soldier left'.This guy is actually responsible for Iron Man's parents death. Never mind the half baked story and the logic. And then there is the secretary of state baying for the avengers blood that they come strictly under the purview of the state for causing mindless loss of lives and property during their heroic quests.Mindless no doubt. Roped in is some sovokian guy who wants to eliminate the avengers by deliberately causing confusions amongst the avengers because his family was accidentally killed by them. and suddenly we have two avengers groups; the upright headed by Captain America and the politically correct headed by the Iron man.More surprises,the group manages to rope in The teenage spiderman and the Ant man, The picture becomes clear now. Superheroes against superheroes. What follows is some cortex splitting but riveting action. but in the end all this doesn't make sense and so does the huge expenses that must have gone into the making of this sequel. All in all confusions galore. Right from the director to the audience.",3
9 May 2016,Best Crossover Movie to Date,"DISCLAIMER: I read Marvel's Civil War four or more years ago and I believe it is the best story arc ever written. Not only does the story arc include almost every character in the Marvel comic world, it has an incredibly relevant and sound basis. Hence, I was very skeptical of the movie because it had so much to live up to.

That's how blown away I was with the movie because they adapted it well for the screen and made a compelling enough story that wasn't too simplistic. Some may say that this was nothing more than a Marvel version of Batman v. Superman. Not even. This story existed well before that movie came out and the Batman v. Superman impetus was very contrived (a Gotham City character interacting with a Metropolis character and the simple moralistic reasons they fought). Civil War, as the name implies, was far more encompassing than simply two superegos battling it out with one having an epiphany mid-fight. This is the best crossover multi-character movie to date.

You may ask about the action because after all this is a big budget superhero movie. Don't worry your little head about that. With 12 of Marvel's finest partaking in a battle you are sure to see plenty of well choreographed fighting and an equal amount of quips and one-liners.

But the action isn't the reason for the excellent review; it all goes back to the story. It's been a while since I've seen a superhero story this well written. They stuck to the true essence of the Civil War story arc (that being superhero registration) while adapting it to introduce characters not originally apart of the story AND making the story believable enough to have a final showdown.

Sometimes, in an effort to get an epic fight, a movie will throw together a very elementary plot that has all the complexity of a game of tag. Basically a simple misunderstanding or good guy turned rogue and two friends are in a Battle Royal. Civil War's plot was more layered, more multi-dimensional and more thought provoking. Civil War had something for everyone and for sure when it was over you had chosen a side.",9
29 April 2016,Everything I wanted and more! The BEST Marvel movie to date!,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",10
26 June 2022,One of THE comic films.,"Fun, action, humor, emotion, interesting, exciting...It checks all the boxes. You have to give props to Marvel/Disney for their casting choices. Absolutely no one is out of place (shame that hasn't transferred to Star Wars). One thing I've noticed more than ever going though the MCU films for the umpteenth time is Robert Downey Jr's acting. He really is just fantastic as Stark/Iron Man. I'd be perfectly happy if no one ever played the character again. This movie is what I expect a comic book film to be for the most part. I don't mind different takes on characters as that's the nature of comics but when I think about what I go into a comic book movie expecting, this film comes to mind.

10 May 2016,Most boring Captain America,"I couldn't sit it through.

And why the heck is it called Captain America, when it is not even about him?

There are again too many superheroes and not enough time for everybody and the little time is wasted with boring talk.

I have nothing against interesting talk, but this was not one of that.

It was another Avenger crap.

And they had to jump on the bandwagon and had to make it about how the Avengers kill everybody around them by ""saving the world"".

Duh...! We know it since Batman v Superman that you are sorry. We don't need to talk about it in every superhero movie from now on.",4
7 May 2016,An embarrassment to the genre,"I found myself observing this film with a feeling of mild amusement, pondering over how the hell this franchise has gained so much traction and popularity. Smash, punch, abominable one-liner, rinse, repeat.

The traditional elements of a superhero movie have been totally removed, replaced by unrelatable shiny suits and often totally unexplained superpowers. Personal growth, strength in the face of adversity, finding you've got something special when you feel ordinary: that's a superhero movie.

Give me Deadpool, GOTT or the original Spiderman. Give me some depth, story, even a touch of reality.

They might as well have filmed this whole movie in a wrestling ring and saved a few million dollars. I'm sure the kids that bump it up to a shocking 8.5 on IMDb would still be quaking with excitement behind their 3-D specs.",1

9 May 2016,A real compromise between ......,"Don't think I am going to talk about a compromise between the Iron Man and Captain America. But the compromise by each of the viewers of this movie to its director, camera man and script writer, for testing the patience with their not at all promising job.

Script.. New style scripting makes sure that, 90% of the viewers will never understand what's going on the screen. Direction... I don't think the director has taken this movie seriously with some proper home work, except a few graphic works here and there and dragging scenes.

Camera Man - Its pretty clear in the scenes that, the camera man was over excited about the action scenes, or he him self was cutting vegetables keeping camera in one hand. Camera movement was faster than the speed at which the cars in the scenes move around... viewers needs to strain the eyes to understand what is going on.. Poor camera handling at all.

After all, those who want to loose money in big screen and those who wants to sleep in theater, its a nice choice.

I am wondering, how come this movie has a big rating of 8.5 in IMDb? Bogus !!",3

7 May 2016,"Don't wait, go see it!!","Captain America: Civil War was a phenomenal movie. It's perfect blend of Action, Comedy, and Adventure made for a great story. The key to this film was the perfect combination of the plot and all star lineup. Many movies lack a good combo of both, however this movie is an exception. The story of the movie will keep you guessing, laughing, and wide eyed the whole time. My fear was that it would be hard to follow for a person who hadn't watched the previous movies. This is a movie where previous knowledge will help, but isn't completely required. The movie is enjoyable for anyone. The cast complemented each other well and the new additions (hint hint) were great. For action i give the movie a 9 on a scale of 1-10. For the comedy aspect I give it a 10. A 9.5 would be more accurate for the rating. For my recommendation i would have to say........ go see it ASAP! Don't wait for it to come out on DVD, go see it in the theater and enjoy what I believe is the greatest movie of the year thus far!!

2 May 2016,Great movie,"Captain America civil war is a great action scenes and a thrilling story. Its problems , however, involve multiple underdeveloped characters (scarlet witch, vision, black panther and Spiderman...also crossbones and baron zemo) scarlet witch is developed in this film and we see her struggling with her powers so she gets ticked off the list in this film. Vision isn't really developed much and the only development his character receives is in his relationships. Black panther, as a new character he hasn't been developed, was devolved slightly and we see his passion for what he believes in play out. Spider-Man is amazingly developed and the new Peter Parker is best one so far. Crossbones and baron demo are so horribly boring that they are probably the worst marvel villains so far (which is saying something).

The plot was really intense and the action scenes were amazing so the good > bad.

18 July 2017,Cheap copy of BVS,"I know it may sound a little harsh but the critics decided to bash BVS and showered praises on Civil War when it was altogether the same movie. The only difference being Civil War was stuffed with jokes that personally I do not care about. the movie plot was linear with no depth in the story, a child could predict what would happen and the plot holes are too big to ignore as they do not show how come Zemo had access to all those information that even Iron Man did not have, and the climax was totally depended on chance..... In other words WHY DID'NT ZEMO JUST SEND A MMS TO TONY OF HIS PARENTS BEING MURDERED.

20 December 2021,Marvel Cinematic Universe Marathon 2019 #15,"""TEAM IRON MAN""

After the wonderful and glorious Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Russo Brothers did it again! Captain America: Civil War is another prosperous entry in the MCU pantheon with thought-provoking themes, cutting edge VFX, mind-blowing action sequences, accompanied by an array of Marvel's popular superheroes.

Captain America: Civil War is an emotional rollercoaster and a stealth Iron Man film and also a mini Avengers film. The script is marvelous and the performances of each characters has so many depth and we can feel that in each scenes.

30 April 2016,The Ultimate Marvel Movie Experience,"Everything in the MCU has been leading to the production of this masterfully made film. Marvel has yet to make a dud of a film and they seem to have been developing their style, choice in filmmakers and talent involved.

All of Marvel's efforts over the first two phases of the MCU has yielded Captain America: Civil War. This movie is action packed, a political thriller, a chase film, a character piece with a human heart. Critics and public opinion dismissing the movies produced by Marvel Studios as mere 'superhero' films have either not watched enough of these movies or they need to watch this one.

The cast has proved by now that they work well together as an ensemble and the main trio at the heart of the story Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr and Sebastian Stan deliver human, vulnerable and heartbreaking performances.

Superhero comic books and as a consequence their films have since their inception been adapting and mirroring real life issues and struggles of the real world at the period of their issue. This film is no exception. Dealing with themes such as power, loss, family, friendship and forming basic human connections. The movie marks the strongest addition to the Marvel slate and beyond initial enthusiasm may rank as one of the greatest superhero films of all time, if not the greatest.

Character development has not suffered at the expense of the presence of the variety of superheroes sharing the screen. The story is well crafted and the ideology spurring the civil war convincing.

The new additions to the cast, the long awaited younger version of Spiderman and the ever intriguing Black Panther of Wakanda have worked well within the storyline and provided each of the aforementioned superheroes with a very satisfying origin story to make the transition to their own feature length films smoother.

An absolute achievement from the Russo brothers with the only desire left being at least a mild reference to the TV Show world which would undoubtedly be influenced by the events in the film. An amazing and unprecedented superhero film with a heart, a human heart. A must see.",9
23 October 2019,Less Captain America and more Avengers,"Rating

7/10

This is less a sequel to The Winter Soldier and more a prequel to the next Avengers movie. Captain America is just one member of the cast. The story seems more of an excuse for the climactic confrontation but it is well acted. Action scenes are energetic and visuals are great.

Watchable

13 August 2017,This is why I don't follow MCU films,"Yeah I admit MCU made so good films like Iron Man (2008) but this film is not good. It's boring like I'm starting to watch BatMan v SuperMan (2016) and it's better (not a DC fanboy) so what it's a bit longer at least BatMan appear way sooner than Spider-Man in the film. Just cause it's label 'MCU' It doesn't mean it's going to be good. I hate when in films they talk very softly some of the time like I see Hulk (2003) talk louder than that. At least we get to see Spider- Man in the film even though HE'S IN TWO SCENES INCLUDING THE POST CREDIT!! At least Tom Holland is better than Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man.

10 September 2019,Was this a good movie or not?,"At first, it's great. Its great to see so many characters and have them fight each other.

But seriously when we compare this movie to the comics; This movie isn't that great. For a civil war it was really puny compared to the comics.

There is not much Civil War going on In m opinion. Its more of just seeing characters in cgi, tights and a guy listening to a voice message.

I'll keep it as an 8 when its more of a 6.

6 May 2016,Best Comic Book Movie Ever?,"More emotionally charged than the first Avengers movie and even better than the Russo Brother's last movie Winter Soldier (2014), Civil War is my new favourite MCU movie. Both action packed and full of powerful game changing moments that shake the status quo, this film makes sure the once solid superhero team will never be the same again.

The performances are across the board excellent, especially newcomer Tom Holland as Spider-Man. Even Robert Downey Jr, six movies in, gives his best performance as Tony Stark. Civil War does everything that Batman v Superman tried to do, combining great action scenes, and making you care about the characters. Best movie in the MCU, maybe best comic book movie ever?

11 May 2016,Perfection in movie form,"I wrote a glowing review on here for Age of Ultron, and I watched it again recently and it wasn't as good as I remember. So I wanted Civil War to be better, and it's better in every single aspect, from the plotting to the action scenes. The plot is that collateral damage from an event divides the Avengers, and it ends with civil war. That is a very broad summary but I don't want to spoil it. The plot is considered, well planned and intriguing with many elements pulling together to make a thrilling plot with surprises along the way. Unlike Avengers 2, the story isn't messy and it's more interesting as it doesn't hinge on huge action scenes. So a perfect story. The new characters are very nicely introduced, such as Black Panther who is important in the story and isn't crowded out by the other members of the team. The fact that all the characters feel more connected and he makes a valuable addition to the Marvel Universe. The only thing missing is a comedic connection, but this is made up for with some spectacular action.

The action scenes are stunning. The one at the airport is one of the best I've seen, as it's so well directed and it shines with the new additions to the team. The film isn't all action though and some of the more touching, character driven moments really ring true through the fights. The whole film, from the way it's directed, to the action, to characters is all perfectly played and perfectly done. I can' really think of a single fault, the lack of comedy isn't really an issue as the film flies along at a great pace. The film doesn't feel as long as it is, and that is always the sign of a perfect film.

Overall, all elements of Civil War are stunning. There is nothing wrong with it and it's certainly the best Marvel film to date and we, as superhero movie fans, couldn't of asked for anything more.",10

17 May 2016,"I am sorry to say this,","But this movie was literally boring. action hero here, action hero there?

You wanna know the truth about this movie?

this movie is about positive discrimination, you see 2 or 3 black guys who got super powers and are working with white guys like friends. FAKE FAKE FAKE. Not special, boring.

Did you see the new Star Wars Force Awekeness. this is the same ,about positive discrimination. A black guy Jedi? Black people don't even watch star wars.

this whole IMDb seems pretty fake to me, when i read some of the reviews its like people get paid to leave false (positive) reviews about a movie.

Jesus Christ this movie is not even near 8.5 score, nor is the Star Wars.

i was looking at score of the movie Black Sea, pretty low score, while i watched this movie and its real, natural, spectacular. acting is super B and still it has lowers score then this pillow of bull crap? the whole IMDb seems to be untruthful source.",2
16 May 2016,A great movie from MCU with Amazing fight and advance plot.,"I had very high expectations for the movie with early reviews of IMDb and with two trailers, Also I am a fan of MARVEL MCU yet didn't miss any of past MCU movies. I am glad to say that I didn't got disappointed with this movie and it was beyond my expectations with Amazing spider man & specially black panther who does wonderful part of the movie.

The fight between Captain America+winter soldier vs Iron man is possible and Cap is right with his opinion and Iron man also got a point. When I go to watch movie I had argument with my friend who was on Team Cap and I was with team Iron man, But finally when movie ends we both had kept out of choosing team and felt sad about what happen, what Baron Zemo did, BTW he is actually not a villain but a man seek vengeance I guess. The movie deserves 9.5/10 and only issue I heard from my friends was if you were not familiar with MCU early movies you might not understand the story well. But I was okay with movie from beginning to end because I was Marvel fan and this movie got on of the best fights I have seen in a movie. The special music during action scenes gave me awesome feeling too.

Strongly recommend to watch this masterpiece ASAP..!!!",10
6 May 2016,"Good Robert Downey, Cartoonish Action and Logic, Dumb Finale","*Spoilers ahead*

The Good: 1. Robert Downey steals every scene he's in. 2. Vision is interesting. 3. The recruitment of Spiderman was funny and the highlight of the movie.

The Bad: 1. Too many characters with no character development, motive, or dialogue. Probably used to sell more toys.

2. A civil war where nobody dies, nobody dislikes each other, everybody going through the motions. Felt like watching a cartoon from the Disney Channel.

3. Nonsensical fight scenes. For example in his fight with Captain America, Iron Man doesn't use his capability to fly nor does he shoot straight. If logic was too be followed, Iron Man's suit would overwhelm Captain America's shield. And didn't he have a whole army of Iron Men to help him. What happened?

4. Government is just too dumb and clueless. They can't even hold prisoners in a fortress in the middle of the ocean. Pleeaaase!

5. Big ending let down. The whole point of this elaborate (and probably expensive scheme) was to show a video. Why not just send Iron Man a Youtube link? Dumb!!

Summary: Story is better than Avengers Age of Ultron and Iron Man 3 (which is a low bar). However action sequences are more cartoonish than the first Avengers and a recent superhero movie. Don't believe the critic ratings which make this appear as a better film than the Godfather. Its not.",6

29 January 2018,Captain America - Civil War Review,"Captain America - Civil War is a film directed by Russo Brothers. Back in 2016, watching the trailer excited me. But due to some reasons, I couldn't watch it in the cinema. Finally, when I watched it at home, I felt so bad for not watching this film in the cinemas. But still I was satisfied since I got the best that MCU had to offer.

Plot: Due to recent events, the Avengers are divided into 2 factions over an Accord that would oversee the Avengers' activities.

Story and direction: Russo Brothers nailed it when it came to The Winter Soldier. They opened so new dimensions to Captain America and MCU that I couldn't think of. So when announced that they would be returning for the third installment, I was overjoyed. The story encompasses all the events that have happened in the past eight years. The theme dealt with in the film regarding those who still suffer while the Avengers win, so gets attached with you. This is what instantly got me connected. Also we get the MCU dose of entertainment which never is off. The characters, even the new ones although minimal in their roles get their due importance in this film. You can understand as to why a person makes such a decision. Same can be said for the villain too. As usual, production design and VFX are top-notch. Never does it feel artificial, it feels so natural. The action sequences are jaw-dropping. Many people complained of shaky cam been quite often used, but I didn't notice any. Henry Jackman's score is awesome to hear especially during the Bucky-Cap-T'Challa chase scene and the climax in Siberia. I couldn't fault this film even in a single bit even in my 5th viewing of this film.

Performances: Chris Evans is again on par excellence as Captain America. Robert Downey Jr I guess delivered his best performance as Iron Man/Tony Stark. A special mention to Sebastian Stan for wonderfully carrying the role of Bucky Barnes. Same goes for Anthony Mackie. Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson were alos great in their appearances. I missed Hayley Atwell in this film a lot. Emily VanCamp was great. Chadwick Boseman looked promising and can't wait for his solo venture. It was good to see William Hurt Back. Daniel Bruhl also was impressive. Paul Rudd reminded me again why he is perfect Ant-Man. Finally, Tom Holland. It's a Spider-Man that I have been waiting for years. Than you MCU for giving us the Spidey we love to see.

Favorite Scene: When it comes to this many will say the Airport fight or the climatic battle in Siberia. But those are action scenes. Not that I am saying they are not great, but those don't count for me as a favorite scene. My favorite one would be the one-on-one Stark has with Peter Parker as to why he (Peter) gets up every morning. That scene impressed me a lot because of what Stark makes Peter realize in the scene.

Verdict: Civil War is definitely the best that MCU has us to offer. The Russo Brothers again did it. They had a difficult task of handling an ensemble cast and they came out victorious. Can't wait for their Infinity War.

I give it deserved 10/10.",10

16 May 2016,Amazing,"Loved this move so much. Only reason why it's not a 10 is because it could of had more characters. Other then that it was very amazing. I loved the use of each characters powers (especially scarlet witch). I thought wolverine, cyclops or jean grey would have been a great addition to the movie although it is captain America. The ending was good and I hope it gets a sequel and hopefully a Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3. The quality of the film was good and all characters costumes were very detailed and done well. The story of the movie was planned well and executed amazingly. It is a family movie as most people like the marvel universe. I hope everyone enjoys it and the writers did an amazing job.

3 May 2016,Disappointing!,"Let me just start by saying I love Superheroes but have never been a big fan of Captain America - He is too much of a clean cut, charisma devoid, goody too shoes IMO. That said, I enjoyed the first Cap Film and both Avengers movies. I even praised the second Captain America film because, despite a couple of things it was a good film with lots of action and some awesome visual sequences.

What spoiled it for me is exactly what spoiled Civil War too. The Winter Soldier himself. I accept the second movie was centered around him (hence The title) But, Captain America's unwavering efforts to rescue and re-establish his friendship with his psychotic, murderous ex-friend (despite the many deaths caused by him) was sickeningly repetitive and boring.

Fast forward to Civil War, which I was really looking forward to (new characters joining the fray - wahoo) only to suffer the same fate again; seeing an otherwise great movie spoiled because it revolves around the winter soldier....again. Urrggghh! I mean: the Winter Soldier has even less personality than Captain America and that is truly an underwhelming experience to endure.

After watching a superhero movie, I am usually excited, happy and hyped. After Captain America: Civil War I was quite angry, simply because I knew it could have been so much better!",6
5 June 2016,definitely not the best,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",6

29 April 2016,AWESOME MOVIE! Marvel again sets the bar VERY high.,"Just like the last Cap film, I can see why everyone is praising Captain America: Civil War. Marvel AGAIN manages to deliver a little bit of everything and does it with style and integrity. This extremely talented cast fit each character perfectly, both large and especially the smaller roles. The story itself is told in a masterful, crisp manner and is every bit a conspiracy thriller as it is an adventure. The dialogue is witty and the humor works its way seamlessly in to the natural order of the story. The film certainly is smart and delivers more emotion than most will expect. These epic comic book style slugfests HAVE NEVER BEEN DONE BETTER. What's wonderful is that these spectacular action set pieces are inserted as a vehicle for the story and not just to see CGI things explode.

What makes Captain America: Civil War BETTER than just about every action film to date is the fact that it balances amazing spectacle with an intelligent and a moving plot with full character arcs. How many movies can pull that off? Like many other Marvel films, this is movie making of the most entertaining order but actually does it even better if that's possible. It easily deserves all the praise it has generated from both fans and critics alike. The events here makes everyone long for Avengers Infinity War but also makes me wonder if they can every possibly top this film? Marvel again sets the bar is now set VERY high.",

11 October 2018,Shows why the MCU has to be stopped!!,"I love Captain America but this went over board!! The first movie was done pretty good & it was a TRUE Captain America movie!! Then Winter Solider came out & started getting away from being a CAPTAIN AMERICA series!! This came out & it became an AVENGERS movie!! The Civil War comic series is just that, Civil War!! It's a different story arch than what this movie series started as!! You look at what fox did with the entire X-Men franchise, THEY STAYED TO THE X-MEN ONLY!! They kept close to Deadpool & so on, but not Disney/MCU!!! This movie is a prime example of why Disney/MCU should have closed MCU down for at least 10 years!!

20 October 2016,Good action movie,"This one was not so good either, but after ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" (2016) it comes as real refreshment. If I was watching it on my own, I would probably give up on it after half an hour, because it was confusing and boring, but that would be a mistake. In the second half of it, the fun begins. It is extremely fun to watch Avengers fight each other. In a few days, I will probably forget what I saw and I definitely do not want to watch it again, but for one run it is an action good as it can be.

5 August 2020,Meh,"This film seems like an excuse to pit the main characters against each other outside an Avengers film. Just like the other Captain America films, he relies on these other characters to push the story along, which is a big weakness of his character. In this case it doesn't really work as it is rather forgettable. Although the special effects are good, the action itself is messy and uninspiring.

12 February 2017,Top notch Superhero film,"The third film in the Captain America series sees more of an ensemble cast and less of a Captain America film. Though this may be such a bad thing in hindsight. Things only get uglier between these groups when Captain America's old pal-turned fugitive the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is accused of killing civilians, and the Avengers' leader, believing his friend is innocent, helps him escape.

Once settled further into the film, there are a lot of side stories to Civil War. And really, nearly two-thirds of the film is just a setup to the big payoff. That super powered conflict in the film's title. And when it arrives, it doesn't disappoint, as a retired Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), an ""I'm just happy to be here"" Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), a newly teenage Spider-Man (Tom Holland) in his first major fight, and movie screen newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) join the fray. Their five-on-five battle may seem like CGI overkill, but directors brothers Anthony and Joe Russo, who directed arguably Marvel's best film Captain America: The Winter Soldier, know how to stage the war. The film does feel quite long but it is needed to be seeing how many more characters there are. For an entertainment value, Captain America: Civil War lives up to its expectations and it delivers. As a rewatch 07/06/17' this latest Captain America film feels more relaxing and adjusts as more to an Avengers film, but in a way that isn't much of a problem. The clear highlight is with the 12 Avengers coming together and battling out with each other on the city's rooftop for a lengthy awaited battle.",9
6 May 2016,10/10 Perfect movie!,"Everything about this movie is beautiful! The acting, the story and the action! Marvel does it again with balancing out humor and seriousness when it's needed. Some characters like Spidey, Ant-Man, Iron Man and Ant-Man are supposed to be humorous. Meanwhile characters like Black Panther and Winter Soldier are serious! I love just about everything about this film and I trust in the Russo's for the next lot of Avengers films. The Airport fight scene has to be one of the best action scene in Superhero Movie history! I highly recommend this movie as it is Marvel's best movie to date! I was TeamCap before seeing the film and I walked out being torn apart.

6 October 2018,One-Line Review: Captain America: Civil War (7 Stars),"Marvel's Captain America: Civil War is perhaps the first superhero movie that takes into account the large number of civilian casualties that these vigilante fellows cause and then try to do something about it, which, along with some spectacular action shots, make it an engaging watch despite the same vigilantes causing a great number of non-human destruction around the world.

20 April 2019,I Enjoyed The Hell Out Of It,"I just watched Captain America: Civil War and whilst I didn't love it when it came out, I have to say I enjoyed the hell out of it when I just watched it.

I'm not sure who I side with, although I'm kind of leaning towards Tony Stark's side, even though you'd expect him to be against it, and I totally understand why Steve Rodgers is reluctant given the events of Winter Soldier.

All the returning cast are great, Tom Holland is a lot of fun as Peter Parker/Spiderman and Marisa Tomei (an actress I always enjoy seeing) is easily the hottest Aunt May you will ever see!!

The battle at the airport is great and is still a stand out of the franchise. It's up there with the attack on New York in the first Avengers movie.

31 January 2021,"Could've been great, but at least it was pretty good","Overall, it kind of bites off more than it can chew, it takes itself a little too seriously, suffers from occasional choppy editing, and features some surprisingly terrible special effects (mainly thinking about the on foot chase scene early on featuring The Winter Soldier, Captain America, and Black Panther.

But: the other action scenes are fun (I mean, the airport one is silly and a bit inconsequential, but it's fun in a mindless way), it's paced pretty well, is very ambitious with the number of characters (the balance is honestly pretty good) and the way it sets up some new characters is pretty skilfully done (I like the Spider-Man and Black Panther stuff more on a rewatch, now that I know where those characters do end up going).

It's a more than solid, sometimes very fun MCU movies, but it still wouldn't crack my top 10 if I had to rank them all.

18 September 2016,This was a silly movie ... but needed for the larger narrative I guess,"This was a silly movie that likely serves some larger narrative purpose but let's face it ... it was kind of dumb.

Hopefully it'll be the last of these movies that just bridge plot points.

Fake conflict. Check

Manufactured crisis that doesn't really hold up.Check

Introduce new characters. Somehow keep it a Captain America movie Sort of

Set up for the next movies. Check

meh...

Next movie please...",6
2 May 2016,Un-freaking-believable!!! (NO SPOILERS),"I was never a CA fan. I always thought Iron Man was so much better and was always fighting with my brother -he was addicted to CA. So when we found out CA 3 was CA v. IM we got really excited. We were speculating on who was gonna win and kick the other's ass. We had seen EVERY trailer, EVERY spoiler to this day yet none of that really spoiled the movie for us.

Because it was un-freaking-believable, over the charts good. And, yeah, this is coming from someone who hates Cap America. It was well balanced, showcasing every hero's abilities giving them the time they needed on screen -no more, no less. The storyline kept going smoothly, having very small but clever cliffhangers between some scenes keeping us on the edge and I really have to congratulate the writers for that. Whoever says they did a crappy job with this movie they're just haters -don't listen to them.

This movie is not an Avengers one. It's focused on CA and his struggle to do the right thing. You can't really hate him, or hate IM. They both had some points in their arguments. By the end of the movie, I felt sympathy and love for both of them -yeah, even CA. So the characters were not ruined as individuals at all. I really like their relationship, their chemistry and their friendship -which, by the end, I realized was quite deep.

As for the debuts... BLACK PANTHER SLAYS!! He was skilled and strong and such a badass. I loved him and I'm so excited for his solo movie. SPIDER-MAN literally stole the show. We all know Peter is funny and goofy but that actor did a really good job portraying the character. He was a badass as well, but with a funny hint to it. IM and SM actually made a pretty funny duo. I'm so excited RDJ is set to play in the SM movie. And... CROSSBONES. Well, don't expect much from that douchebag. He's not much of a threat -he gets killed in the first 10' (oops! spoiler alert!).

CAPTAIN America and his hero hair were working overtime to save the world while trying to save his best friend. IRON MAN was trying to reason with CA and get Bucky in prison while using some new awesome tech that had our jaws dropping (not just the glove). BLACK WIDOW was kicking a lot of asses and ANT MAN was surprisingly awesome (I didn't really liked his solo movie) and hilarious as expected. ALL THE OTHERS were awesome as well as their evolving powers.

To sum up, it's a MUST WATCH. It was the BEST one in the Avengers/CA franchise. I can't wait for Infinity War 'cause it sets up a new world for the MCU.

GO. SEE. THE DAMN MOVIE. NOWWWW!!!",9
7 May 2016,Avengers never seem to find a peaceful way out of trouble,"This movie helps one realize how much better the real world is compared to the courier guy's fictional world of superheroes. How much better the world is without heroes and their struggle towards proving themselves. It also makes one think about the kind of friends that a person keeps and his commitment towards his relationship with them. How vulnerability to hypnosis renders a person totally helpless and doing things that he doesn't want to do. Ideas like the dark force of vengeance, the power of forgiveness, the internal conflict between these two emotions that a hero has to face makes it interesting to watch. This might also help us realize how lucky it is to be ordinary and alone, rather than having super powers and being with a group of super people.

Ultimate freedom comes from not having to choose between two sides. Let the avenger's avenge. Let the lovers love. We just sit there and enjoy the show. It was a great show. Loved it.

6 May 2016,"Great Fights, Boring Movie","I'm a big fan of traditional storytelling. What I mean is, the plot should start off with an inciting incident which introduces the conflict that sets the story in action. The plot should build on this conflict until it is resolved in the climax.

But I felt like this movie was all over the place.

The climax is a confrontation between Steve and Tony (not a spoiler, it was shown in the trailers), which could have been great if the rest of the movie built up to that. But the inciting incident started a plot about collateral damage, political will, government oversight, and the responsibility of super heroes.

Even these themes were not developed very well, imo, as we jumped from random location to random location, the script writers seemingly caring more about groping for reasons to make these heroes fight than putting together any compelling narrative. Then, in the end, the conflict isn't even addressed or resolved. The climax is basically an unrelated (to the plot) fight scene introduced by a random video.

I found it to be a messy movie and I was thoroughly disappointed.",5
15 June 2022,Amazing,"This film has lots of cameos from the wider MCU and incorporates them in such a fun way. Without spoiling, there are some moments that are iconic for the series.

Also the funnest part of this film is the whole Iron Man vs Captain America split and seeing which heroes take each side. The film starts off great, but has some minor pacing issues in the middle and slightly underdeveloped ending that take away from an otherwise 10/10.

25 November 2019,The most thematically ambitious and mature of the Marvel films,"Out of all the Marvel movies, this is the one that I want to love the most, but I can't quite do it. There's so much going on that goes so well, that the fact that it doesn't land as well as it should and has a couple of large distractions undermines the affair enough to disappoint me, but not enough to take it from goodness.

The Avengers are causing collateral damage. They're doing good work, but they're also hurting people along the way. The governments of the world appreciate the fact that the world isn't being run by Loki, but they feel like a line needs to be drawn and the Avengers need to be reined in. Some Avengers agree, and others do not. This provides the political reason for the split within the Avengers, but the movie doesn't turn it personal early enough, in my opinion. An esoteric fight about the relative limits on Avengers power is a great place to start the conflict of the film, but it hangs on that for too long before it gives us the gut punch change that turns the conflict personal and what drives the final twenty minutes of the film.

The Winter Soldier is still on the loose after the events in The Winter Soldier, and it looks like he's bombed a UN complex in Vienna when the Sokovia Accords are being signed that will limit the Avengers' authority. This explosion also kills the King of Wakanda, who is there to sign the Accords. A chase ensues after Cap gets a heads up on where Bucky, the Winter Soldier, is, and he helps him escape temporarily until they end up captured and arrested. It is here that Zemo, the actual antagonist of the film, inserts himself, setting off an EMP that kills power in Berlin and gives the secret command codes to Bucky that turns him into the Winter Soldier. Cap gets Bucky away and finds out where Zemo is going next. In order to get to Siberia, Cap and Bucky need to get an aircraft.

It is at the airport that the big battle between the heroes breaks out. It's big, inventive, fun, and ultimately pretty pointless (the physical stakes in these movies have gotten laughably low), leading Cap Bucky to getting an airplane, chased by Iron Man and the Black Panther. In Siberia, two hours into the movie, we finally learn Zemo's plan and have the movie move from an political argument to a personal one. Zemo wants to tear apart the Avengers from the inside, knowing he's not physically strong enough to take them on, so he uses the truth that Bucky, as the Winter Soldier, killed Tony Stark's parents to splinter them completely. It's such a great and brutal fight between three people in an enclosed space.

Ultimately, as I said earlier, I wanted to love this movie. It's got strong themes of liberty versus regulation that echo through so much of what's going on. It eventually distills that beginning intellectual conflict into a personal one between two heroes we've grown attached to over the years. It looks really good and the action is better filmed than it was in The Winter Soldier. However, the big airport fight, while fun, is pretty pointless. We do get one injury, but that's it, keeping the stakes of these fights really low. There are too many characters that have their moments that don't feed into the larger narrative (Spider-Man being the most egregious example). And Zemo is underdeveloped. I love the idea of Zemo, but the execution is so relegated to the back end of the film that it ends up losing its impact.

I'd love to see this movie with a smaller cast that allows for greater focus on the central conflict between Stark and Rogers. I'd love for Zemo to have a strong narrative presence early, and I'd love for the information on Bucky's involvement with Tony's parent's death to come out earlier and define Tony's motives well before the final act. I can imagine scenes where people confront Tony with his opposition ' to Rogers's side because he's driven by revenge, and he needs to balance his ideals with his personal emotions before ultimately giving in to his emotional side.

Still, there's so much that's so good here. It has some of the same issues as Age of Ultron, but it does a better job of holding it all together. It also feels like it gets closer to something special, even if it still falls short. It coulda been great.",7
11 December 2016,Disappointing on many levels,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",3
29 March 2020,Excellent to see different perspective.,"Love this movie, ties in very well with the series as a whole. I feel at this point of the series there is some quality depth behind the characters

3 August 2016,Most boring Marvel experience,"This movie feels like a Avengers rip off, but the boring kind. After the first avenger (that I really liked), the 2 sequels were just plain boring. The direction these movies took were nor fun (the trademark of the MCU) nor dark. These were just some kind of filler movies to take the characters to the next Avengers movie. So, as expected, Civil was did not feel like a Cap America movie, nor an Avengers movie. The conflict was stupid and if you saw the trailers, you knew what it was all about. The only good thing about this movie were Iron Man, Ant-man and Spider-man. The much hyped airport scene was useless for the story of the movie (we knew that they will not really hurt each other, common!). It could have been replaced with a good group therapy session, that would have better fitted the tone of the movie. Besides the special effects, this movie made me sleepy and I don't get all those good reviews from the critics, like we saw 2 different movies. I do not believe in conspiracy theories, but it seems like everything Marvel is considered gold by the critics, and DC is smashed. I refuse to believe there is such a conspiracy, but still... Just wait for the underdogs (Guardians, Ant-man) of the MCU to see the next good Marvel movie.",2
6 May 2016,Those were 2 and 1/2 hours of my life I'd gladly spare again,"I am not going to spoil anything on this review, because it is best to go and watch this movie without knowing anything. Bear in mind that it's a long movie, but it never lets your interest flow away, not even for a second. Now, for the review:

Plot: Not a single complaint. The story catches up from The Winter Soldier and Avengers: Age of Ultron, and tries to tie up what happened to the Winter Soldier, uncover some things about his past, which weren't shown too much in the previous Captain America movie, and show the devastation that the events in Age of Ultron left behind. Every character has his story and reason behind their final decision to side with either Iron Man or Captain America, and they never deviate from them. Everyone has a part, and the movie ties them all in a splendid, seamless way.

Cinematography: You'd think you were in the fights and conversations yourself, right beside the characters. Many different places are used, and they all contribute to the general drama/action feeling of the movie. Every fight is just amazing, more so than the Avengers.

Acting: Flawless. From everyone. Especially Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackey, Chadwick Boseman and the ever amazing Robert Downey Jr. I was really glad that the Russo brothers did not use RDJ in a way that would eclipse the other characters. Daniel Bruhl is a chilling Zemo, driven solely by vengeance, and even though he's not the true villain of the movie, he is definitely the catalyst behind the Civil War.

Make no mistake; this is a Captain America movie. It revolves around Cap, his relationships and the aftermath of the decisions he takes when it comes to his closest friend. However, it is done in such a way that you are not fed up by him, or any character. This is a humorous, action packed, plot driven movie, that raises the Marvel bar even higher.

10/10 is not enough for this.",10
6 May 2016,The Best Lit Up Marvel Cinematic Universe movies & The Best Superhero Movie of 2016,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",10
19 April 2016,Really Good Film I Enjoyed It (No Spoilers),"being a marvel fan for me this is one the best marvel movies it has fantastic character arcs, great action and really good acting. and my god SPIDER-MAN!!!!!. just seeing peter parker interacting with the other avengers made my day and also he does awesome stuff with his web shooters. i think to say tom Holland is the best spider-man is to soon but i think he will be after we see is standalone film next year. and also Chadwick Bozeman nails it as black panther he has a personal goal in this film and you fully understand his motivation and his action is the best in the film. the performances from Downey and Evans were great and it was such a emotional film because you've seen these characters grow and you have history with them. Anthony Mackie stays awesome as falcon and has a couple standout moments. Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes/winter solider is fantastic a great and strong performance from him. and i also want to point out that Elizabeth Olsen was much improved as scarlet witch i thought she was a bit underdeveloped in age of Ultron but she had a fantastic arc in this film. the airport battle is phenomenal one of the best superhero action set pieces seriously it's crazy i couldn't believe what is was watching. there is only one thing that was bad about it which has become very familiar in marvel movies the villains. once again marvel makes a another generic and disposable villain in Baron Zemo its a shame because Daniel Bruhl is a really good actor. but i look at it that he wasn't really a villain this film didn't need a villain it was a family dispute between the avengers. but other than that overall it was a very good and entertaining movie which makes sure the marvel train keeps on rolling 10/10",9
4 May 2016,Captain America: Civil War - Movie Review,"Even friends can be your biggest enemies.

Captain America: Civil War is behind ""Iron Man"", ""Winter Soldier"", and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" of being the best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Or MCU for short). The movie has it's flaws, but that doesn't stop me from liking it. I don't know about you, but the Captain America series are the only movies in the MCU that actually get better with it's squeals. The action, the effect's, the humor, the characters, and it's stunt work has improved from the first movie.

What this movie dose so well is that it's really hard to pick a side, because both sides have a very good reason to be at each others throats. One minute I'm rooting for Tony, and the next I'm rooting for Cap. It's conflict like this that I couldn't decide for myself on who side I was on or who was right, but that's just the fun of it.

Tom Holland as Spider-Man might be one of the best adaption of the character that we've had. Sony studios has made over five Spider-Man movies and the two actors who played Spider-Man (Maguire and Garfield), did their very best of what their got, but didn't quite capture the character that we know and love. But the Spider-Man in this movie has a screen time of 30 minutes or more, and Holland managed to capture the character so perfectly that it makes Sony studios look lousy. He was excellent in the role and I would go as far to say that he was a billion times better than Maguire and Garfield (In my opinion). I can't wait to see more of him in ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" that's out next year.

Speaking of good casting - Chadwick Boseman was pretty damn awesome as Black Panther. Boseman can basically play anything and I'm not kidding you when I say that, as he played Jackie Robinson, James Brown, and now Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman has some crazy talent and him as Black Panther was spot on casting. I'm looking forward to seeing his solo film coming out in 2018.

If you thought the stunt work in ""Winter Soldier"" was outstanding, then wait until you see the stunt work in this movie, as it was just....INCREDIBLE! All the heavy praise belongs to the stunt team for this for doing the impossible.

Now for the problems: Daniel Brühl is a boring villain. I honestly can't remember much about his character in the movie and that's because he was pretty forgettable. That came across a bit too harsh didn't it? It really sucks for me to say that, because Daniel Brühl is great actor and sometimes he can be the saving grace for a movie that's either good or bad. He wasn't awful or anything like that, it's just that I didn't find him treating at all.

Martin Freeman is a great actor and I'm glad he's getting more meaty roles, but he doesn't do anything special or interesting in this movie. Yes, I know his character is probably going to developed more in the next movies, but my problem here is that he really felt out of place in this movie. At times the movie itself completely forgets about him, so every time he popped back up on screen I was like ""Oh, Martin Freeman is in this movie, I totally forgot about that"". But that's just me.

The story was a bit meh and there was a little bit too much quick cut edits in the fight scenes that I couldn't get all that infested with. Now don't get me wrong, I like the airport fight and the Iron Man V Cap fight, because those scenes didn't have stupid quick cuts and I could easily see whats happening. I think it's the hand-to- hand combat fights that are too cutter for me to see what's going on. That's just my opinion.

Overall: ""Captain America: Civil War"" lives up to the hype of being a great superhero movie and being a good movie on it's own. Marvel is having a great track record thus far- with the box office success, great reviews, and many upcoming spin offs. Civil War is most likely going to win every fan boys heart and it's not hard to see why.",6
18 February 2020,Since when does a superhero flick have a better third act than first? Since Civil War.,"Part post-Watergate thriller, part post-Bourne globetrotting actioner. Slick dialogue, sick action, some smart retconning and remodelling and a smattering of excellent ideas. The concentrated, focused tone and influences and the cleverly designed superhero moments make for a memorable and nail-biting superflick.

Remember that first time you saw a Marvel movie and you loved it. That very special Marvel movie that you came out of the cinema thinking: ""THAT'S what these connected, colourful, gripping, comic properties should be, full of in-jokes and great surprises and genuine humour."" Civil War wipes the floor with that. Fully succeeds at making a Cap centric story that has some amazing character introductions, exchanges, and is focussed on paying off so many threads from previous Marvel films in a way Ultron wishes it could. It appeases the adult in me by providing rich dialogue, completely balanced non-archetypal politics, and stunning modern action sequences, each one with three or four gags at least that makes smart individual use of the characters skills involved. Cap's third instalment simultaneously managed to also appeal to the child in me by providing many, surprising, earned comic book moments full of wonder and integrated very organically and very differently to the crap that was Ultron. I genuinely cheered, and exclaimed in wonder, or surprise or shock. And that's a testament to the skill, nerdy smarts and talents of the Russos and their team. Making Cap a sympathetic, emotional, very un-American hero. Yes, you do have to have seen the other MCU properties to appreciate this movie. But even without all the comic bookiness, it succeeds as a taught 'family' thriller, brothers versus brothers. Genuine globetrotting (nice use of location cards) thrilling, clever, riveting, twisty movie that takes Winter Soldier, throws everything bad about it out, tosses in everything that made Iron Man great and closes off so many threads in a sensitive, spiralling, ingenious way that you can't help but go along for the ride and come out grinning. I won't whisper in your ear about how great it is (the way you could palpably hear a ripple of boyfriends in the cinema explaining who this or that is in the MCU when they appeared!) But instead I will shout from the rooftops how great this movie is - because if the MCU is more like this, then it isn't a colossal, cheeky, cashgrab, it can sometimes meet the lofty heights of an affective, reflective, relevant piece of art.",10
1 May 2016,The Most Impressive Entry in MCU,"From the first introductory to the second dark political thriller, the Russo brothers has surprised the audiences by transforming the entire tone of the series into a psychology based superhero film. It's a mini Avengers reunion but more centralise on the conflicts between Captain America, Winter Soldier as well as Iron Man and with more grounds to cover, both Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely who have written the first two installments managed to ensure the well-pacing of the story without losing its sense of intentions. Continuing the epic traditional fighting sequences from previous episode, the 13th outing of this MCU adventure offers a wide variety range of action scenes and it is evenly distributed among all the superheroes through efficient cinematography of switching without focusing much on gunshots, smashing and explosions. All characters are engaging thanks to the compelling character developments; Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr. and Sebastian Stan deliver well as their roles respectively in term of resolving the challenge of their friendship test, the other Avengers perform outstanding too especially the brought in of Spider-Man, Back Panther and Ant-Man have added more fun and joy which is entirely absent in DC's Dawn of Justice. It is emotional, inspiring and perfectly crafted, implying that the actions chosen between the two main characters are not anything about right or wrong, but more on perceptions and the outcomes. While the Captain America trilogy is not up to The Dark Knight trilogy masterpiece, the decision to explore thought- provoking themes have made it one of the most impressive series in MCU.",10
4 February 2017,I did not like it at all,"Recently I have quite liked the Marvel movies that I have watched. Sadly I did not like this movie at all. The only reason that it does not get a zero or one star rating is cool special effects and a few laughs.

I want my heroes to be just that, heroes. Unfortunately this movie gets off on the wrong foot right away by not only ""incriminating"" the Avengers in the eyes of dimwit politicians and putting them on surveillance of a political body but to make matters worse it is the useless black hole of taxpayers money, the United Nations, that are supposed to surveil them. That pretty much ruined the movie right away for me.

When I though that it could not get any worse it actually does. In true Hollywood fashion the Avengers start to bicker and fight among themselves.

The few redeeming qualities of this movie is great special effects and a few fun comments that made me laugh from time to time. Even the ending is pretty crappy with the Avengers remaining divided and the main bad guy feeling that he achieved what he wanted.

Technically there is not really anything wrong with the movie. The actors are good, the filming is good and, as I wrote, the special effects are great. The story however is not my cup of tea to put it mildly. I cannot express how much I despised the story in this movie.",4
12 June 2018,Approach/Avoidant,"So... after a non-stop run of sequential violence (That's the story line of Marvell), now comes the PC curve, really? Trying to hit the brakes, and do a cerebral attempt at a show, is a noble change up (not really), but doesn't work. it smacks of raw inauthenticity; it's the Marvel style and now a writer wants to be PC and sincere(?) Never mind the convention to be violent and then say you're not, and make the viewer feel guilty. Never mind the violent-tepid-violent frame, which throws the viewer off (it's like domestic violence syndrome... victim calls police, they show up, offender immediately feigns calmness and points to hysterical victim, which is what cops only see. And victim is at fault for thinking that!). Never mind that hypocrisy. At least make sense whilst being confusing. An Accord? Aliens blew up the world each move, Heros battle (gee, can't imagine why any global damage spillover), and so get rid of Avengers...? They should have said, ""Okay"", and go hide. See what happens. How about next time an alien race invades earth, the General stops them and has them sign a damage control accord. Maybe asks them to say ""sorry"" whilst they are fulfilling their agenda on destruction. Yeah, that feels right. And, in the story line, only Capt. Amer. sees footage? No one else sees the security camera of ""psychiatrist:, just go to war. Man, we had enough of that damn Stark conceited arse! (like previous movie said, he can't tell the difference between creating and destroying the world. That's who should be deciding things?) ""Now, lets be sensitive...unless we're not, but feel should be, while not to be... unless saying sorry, but don't..."". Same approach-avoidant contradictions. What you bet, to mix you up with Marvel's writer hypocrisy, the next epic movie is usual stock violence again. Hey, wait... it is! (Infinity Wars). (From the nice old comic writer that brings you Jessica Jones).",5

19 May 2016,Stupid,"This is a waste of my time. Also it should not be the first thing to show up when your look up the Civil War it is completely disrespectful to the people who fought and who died. What is wrong with society these days. People can be so selfish. And sorry if I offend anyone in some way but I'm just stating my opinion. I just think that this is not fair to our history I mean first of all they put the name Civil War in it and that's just mocking the actual war and second of all this is not at all important or useful. I'm not saying they should like remove this movie completely just don't make it the first thing to show when your researching the Civil War. And by the way I have watch this movie and I definitely was not a fan I just don't really get the point of making a movie like this. And once again I apologize for anyone who I might have offended. If you actually read this whole review thank you and you can have your own opinion about it.

10 May 2016,Crap-tain America Civil bore more like Poor man's BvS,"Compared to the first and second films in the Captain America franchise, Captain America: Civil War isn't quite as fun or thrilling unless impressive CGI and loud action sequences are enough to whet your appetite. Captain America: The First Avenger had a riveting plot that kept you at the edge of your seat. This one lacks suspense and is jam-packed with so many superheroes that, unless you're already very familiar with the franchise, you'll forget why you should be caring about these cardboard characters and their relations to begin with. Attempts to generate poignancy fall flat and come across as clunky while the wafer-thin plot feels stretched too thinly.Winter soldier still is the best MCU movie... And this is overrated as hell...critics are ruining good DC movies box office like BvS MoS and Watchmen.. MCU tried to do something different and managed to stick to the same old mediocre formula .. They're afraid to take risks and raise stakes because they don't have the creative minds for it. MCu should stop making movies because they're for thumb-suckers

Totally worth your money and your time. Just watch it without any prejudgement. İf you have a prejudgement you never love movies.

I read some review , who give 3 or 1 star to this movie. And I'm checking their profile. Guess what. They give 10 or 9 star to BvS. And give 1 or 3 star CA:CW because one is DC other is MARVEL. Like I said before I like both. You can check my profile you will see I give 8 star to BvS. BvS is good movie but also big mess. And guys be fair. If you really don't like movie. İt is okey. But you give 1 star because this is marvel movie. Not cool move. I know their is also Marvel fanboys gived BvS 1 star. They are also brainless.

7 May 2016,A League to Disown,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)

THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.

IN BRIEF: More of the same, but there is some skill and care by the filmmakers to develop characters between all the standard action stuff.

GRADE: B

SYNOPSIS: The superheroes are called to task about the repercussions of their questionable actions which leads to a splintering of the league.

JIM'S REVIEW: Today, many moviegoers above the age of forty, like myself, can easily develop a condition known as PTSHD (Post Traumatic Super Hero Disorder), a malady that weakens many seriously-minded cinephiles who are continually force-fed the barrage of comic book blockbusters playing at our local movie theaters. Side effects include: vertigo (caused by multiple hyper-kinetic CGI battles), nausea (due to shaky hand-held camera-work), a lack of stamina and general listless yearning for sophisticated dialog (instead of snide puns and comic one-liners) and a feeling of isolation and abandonment (as one feels adrift from today's younger generation of moviegoers).

If I am at all honest in my review, after seeing so many superhero blockbusters of late, in this era of pop entertainment instant gratification, I must admit that I have indeed reached my saturation point. The formula for success is repeated with successful variations on a theme: A rowdy band of misfits is assembled to become their own weapon of mass destruction, destroying cities in one fell swoop. Endless repartee is bantered between our crusaders. Actors fit into their tight-fitted spandex to fight the forces of evil with the straightest of faces and sexual identities to match. Granted, I am not the target audience that the filmmakers have in mind. But here I am, ready to plunk down my well-earned dollars to see another epic sampling of comic book justice.

This time around, the group resembles one big unhappy family dealing with sibling rivalry issues and minor dysfunction. Captain America: Civil War is entertaining, if somewhat over-indulgent in its messy strained relationship between Captain America (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark a.k.a. Ironman (Robert Downey, Jr.). Their animosity causes a ripple effect with the other superheroes taking sides...and gee-whiz, is there an over abundance of muscle, power, and ego! Fanboys, behold the testosterone level on display: Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and Vision (Paul Bettany). Women and diversity are well represented in this Marvel universe: Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), and War Machine (Don Cheadle), Newcomers to this action figure franchise include: Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) for the millennial set. Batteries not included.

The plot borrows a similar scenario from the DC comic book universe's recent movie entry, Batman v Superman, the premise being the high collateral damage inflicted upon the town-folks by their so-called protectors. Many lives have been destroyed as they battle evil forces. So there is now a public outcry and revenge against the Avengers. It's governmental and political control over our vigilante crime fighters, some of which accept the terms of a UN mandate while others want to secede from that union. Their decision to either conform with this global request or go rogue causes the friction and tension that finally dissolves their alliance.

￼Credit screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for spending considerable time to build the interrelationships and inner angst, even if there are far too many Avengers to do full justice to their individual back-stories. Most characters seem to be fighting for equal screen time than actually fighting a cause. At times, the film feels a bit desperate and overstuffed. It is always on maximum overload, which has both positive and negative results. One just wishes less superheroes were called to duty so the film could be more focused. ￼ The fight sequences themselves are uneven. The opening battle is poorly edited and filmed in harsh close-ups that obliterates the action. But the film improves greatly from there. In fact, the main combat between the divided team of superheroes, which takes place at a deserted airport, is a brilliantly staged and extensively well choreographed scene that is worth the wait (even if it takes over an hour to get there). There is also a strong climactic smack-down between a few of the Avengers that delivers, even if the build and final twist misses some fine opportunities to unite the splintered crew for one final memorable free-for-all.

Both Evans and Downey as the opposing leaders bring their A-game to the A-Team. They have a nice chemistry that makes their rift involving. The rest of the cast play their parts well. However, Daniel Bruhl is miscast as the villain, Helmut Zemo, who never establishes any real presence or menace. He remains an enigma right to the end.

￼Directed by Joe and Anthony Russo, with enough whiz-bang expertise to make the film diverting and satisfying, Captain America: Civil War proves to be a film that would rather debate the deeper issue of friendship and family than settle for being just another simple slam-bang blockbuster. That factor helps elevate this action fantasy and takes it a rise above the standard genre. The playing field may be overcrowded as everyone dukes it out, but it is still enough of a crowd-pleaser, even for this older and slightly worn-out reviewer.

3 May 2016,Without limits,"Thematically this film has similarities to rival DC Comics/Warner Brothers Batman v Superman. Who watches the Watchmen, sorry superheroes.

This is the question asked in Civil War after a disastrous incident in Lagos involving Captain America and his team but the powers that be led by General Ross now the US Secretary of State that various incidents involving The Avengers either as a team or individuals has led to collateral damage. In short, innocent people have died.

The film sets up a confrontation between Captain America and Iron Man and the various superheroes choose sides with new additions including Ant Man, Black Panther and Spiderman. Iron Man feels that there should be scrutiny or oversight by an external body like the UN. Captain America has concerns, rightly so after all he revealed Shield as being corrupted in the previous film and so nervous about history repeating itself.

History does play an important part in the film. The Winter Soldier has history both with Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. Something just ripe to be manipulated by the film's villain Zemo who is planning the moves to pit the various heroes against each other.

What the directors, the Russos get right here is a layered story with action pieces that are well paced. Some of the action sequences in the early part of the film are maybe too fast and frenetic with almost cartoon like action.

The new version of Spiderman is introduced here and along with Ant Man they are there to add zippy humour and expand the Avengers universe.",7
19 May 2016,One of the More Important Entries in the MCU,"Action packed from beginning to end, Marvel Studios expands its cinematic universe yet again in Captain America: Civil War.

As the Avengers have stepped up to the plate, toe to toe against the forces that threaten our humble blue planet, public opinion of our heroes have been heavily tainted due to the high body count, and absolute destruction left in the wake of events that occurred in New York, Washington D.C, and the fictional country of Sokovia. Some hail the Avengers as the only group able to battle such enemies, but others believe that these events occurred because the Avengers allowed them to happen. Think about it for a second, if Thor never came to Earth, then neither would Loki. If Stark never invented the A.I Jarvis, then Ultron would never have been born. Captain America has been left in charge of the team for now, but the U.S government would like them to register their identities, and put themselves under their command. Although this entry lightly samples the massive 2006/07 Civil War crossover events, it does well on its own as the Marvel universe expands.

The plot is everything an action movie should be, with a few twists and turns in the road. It is of course as linear an event as you would expect, you know 'catch the bad guy,' as every superhero film goes, and it rehashes a few topics already touched on in the first Avengers film where you have the typical 'Hero Vs. Hero' situation that everyone seems to love. Yet the film does well in its intensity, and is never cartoonish or convoluted within the borders of the story-line. I didn't expect too much after seeing 'The Winter Soldier (2014), which I felt was probably one of the more boring entries from Marvel, but this film makes up for that slow movie, expands on it, and drives home quite a punch. This is the film that I felt closes the second phase of Marvel, and leaves it open for new additions for the next.

I found it difficult to put the focus on Captain America, because of the sheer volume of characters who star and interact with each other. It is a 'Captain America' branded film, but he shares the screen with several heroes throughout the film, and arguably this movie doesn't necessarily feel too focused on him. The major players all happen to pop in at some time (barring Thor and Hulk), but a few new faces have joined in the fray. Chris Evans does well reprising his role as the titular character. Robert Downey Jr, and Scarlett Johansson easily have as much screen time with the Captain (arguably more). Sebastian Stan returns as Bucky Barnes, and has certainly beefed up since his last incarnation as the Winter Soldier. A few new faces enter the fray as well. Chadwick Boseman as the Black Panther gets a poignant origin story here. Tom Holland, as the teenage Spiderman, is a welcome addition if you can ignore all other incarnations of the Webslinger (it fits better with the overall story if you do, and you don't won't have to shake your head at the gaping plot hole he provides). Finally, I was quite surprised at Daniel Bruhl's portrayal as the manipulative and intelligent Baron Zemo, and he was definitely the most human role in this entire film.

However, one small issue I had was with the motivations behind the main characters. I did have a hard time trying to figure out what the divide was between these friends, outside of Tony Stark's and the Captain's motivations to keep the planet safe at all costs. I didn't really get why Stark would feel the need to register all superheroes if the government ALREADY knows who each super-individual is, and where they are at all times. Wouldn't registration be irrelevant? Tony Stark is one person who should be AGAINST this idea. After all, he's seen the Chitauri army gifted to Loki via Thanos during the Battle of New York, and he's one of the few people who comprehend the magnitude of this threat that faces mankind from a galaxy away.

On the flipside; Why does Captain America, who's been a government agent from the very start of his adventure, oppose such a move from the U.S ? He's been a soldier in the American Army since World War II. If anything, he should be the one supporting registration, because he is already registered as a U.S infantryman. What's the difference if they are or not? It poses no threat to the Avengers, nor their members, nor the Winter Soldier. If he signed it, he could still go on after Bucky, and keep his allegiance in tact. An avid fan could easily argue these two roles should have been reversed from the comic book approach (where it made a lot more sense due to the sheer number of mutants and super-powered individuals, many of whom live in secret and have lives or families to protect. Cap goes against the government's plans for registration because he sees the act somewhat akin to what the Nazi's did to the Jewish people in WW2), but I'm certain they wanted to adhere to the original comic event somewhat without too many alterations.

The movie could have easily been called Captain America Vs Iron Man, and still do well as a set up to the future Civil War events. I suppose, Marvel Studios wants to plow ahead with its endgame before people lose interest by 2018. All in all, Civil War is an absolute action smash from beginning to end, and I think this will be noted as one of the more important entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",8

28 April 2016,7/10 honestly its a season of disappointments *Spoilers*,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character.

That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

20 May 2016,Meh,"Visually it was enjoyable, but overall I found it a bit slow and I kept waiting for Captain EndtThis to finally appear. I settled for his sidekick, WakeMeWhenTheyFightAgain.

It mainly was just repetitive dialogue scenes about you're right, no, I'm right, followed by mostly the same punching and shield throwing. I really enjoyed the use of other characters the most and the last third of the movie was a little redeeming. I will be fair and say that my hubby liked it a little better than I did and he said 5 out of 10 stars. His issues were the same; too many slow bits followed by fighting, then back to the slow bits... There was no real build up, just repetition.

29 April 2016,a thrilling treat for ALL film fans!,"This movie is honestly as good as any adventure film that I've ever seen. This isn't just a treat for Marvel fans or comic book fans, this is a treat for ALL film fans.

I'm glad to see the response to Captain America Civil War has been very positive. I've noticed that sometimes expectations are unreasonable or some fans are too attached to their comic book preconceived notions. Sure Cap stays close to the spirit of its root origins but the fact that people are judging it as a film first is great to see. Whatever the reason, it seems everyone enjoyed it as much as I did. Visually it is a sight to behold and that goes for the special effects but also for the cinematography and grit of the film itself. Every scene was captivating, whether it was full on action or the developmental down time.

Isn't that what movies are suppose to be about?

17 May 2016,High on breathtaking action and bro-feels!,"Captain America: Civil War subtly disembarks crucial Marvel characters into the MCU grounds without overlooking the originals. There is a morsel for everybody, as they get a shot at each other with some rad action to ice the intriguing melodramatic plot. Nobody gets left out with their screen time, which was a Herculean thing to achieve. Marvel simply aced it.

Bro-feels are hopping around throughout the movie as you see Cap and Iron Man digress from their paths to go against each other, in a gradually developing storyline. You can't help but feel sorry for both of them as they try to rip each other apart. Like other characters in the movie you end up taking sides yourselves. Iron Man is understandable but Captain America can't be written off either. Both are on such pedestals of morality that Civil War between them becomes inevitable.

Action is sheer bonkers! So many cool stunning bits that you have to see the movie again to keep your cross-hairs locked. The biggest action driver is no doubt the Winter Soldier again, as Bucky Barnes ravages through every one who tries to either stop or catch him. Watch out for that highway action scene! He single handedly decimates every superhero who comes in his way. Black Panther gets introduced brilliantly to the tale. So does Spidey! Looking forward to watching their solo movies now.

Civil War is high on humour just like any Marvel movie is, with Robert Downey Jr., Tom Holland, Anthony Mackie and Paul Rudd doing us the honors of throwing us off into non-stop guffaws. Brilliantly penned screenplay as usual with great music to cover things up. Editing is exceptional as well.

Its drama lets you dig deeper into the heads of the superheroes, and make them fairly relatable. You can't help but relate your plight to these characters who get hammered under egotism, friendship, choices and conscience. Despite everything the movie packs in, you have to establish hands down that Iron Man stays the coolest, and Captain America undoubtedly the finest! The weird thing about Civil War is that you divide the movie into sub-sections and you still get awesome mini-movies that hit extraordinary feat per se. Wrap those little plots and there's the big one that reveals like an eye-opener eventually in the climax.

One downside could be that there is no true villain in the movie. Rather a pointer that directs them into mangling each other to gnaw at the team from inside.

Not going into the spoilers much I would recommend you go get on the awesome bandwagon at once, and enjoy the thrilling action-packed bromancing ride. Watch it over and over if you wish to relive its classy mind-numbing action.",8

20 February 2021,Good,"This movie uses the theme of collateral damage/accountability in order to pit superheroes against each other. And it mostly succeeds. It creates the divide in a better way. And it was light and used a lot of humour effectively. With so many characters thrown together in the same film, and new ones introduced, it would be so easy to lose track of some of the characters' story development. The writers deserve some praise in this case because they succeeded in keeping all the characters' own storylines going throughout around the main plot. All the avengers are there, apart from Thor and The Hulk - off on their own adventures. As usual the quality of acting is good from the usual suspects. Though it's the couple of new additions that I enjoyed the most. Black Panther was really cool. Spiderman was also refreshing adding some hilarious lines. Ant-Man in the support role comes up with some funny lines. The visuals were very enjoyable. The various action and fight scenes in particular were awesome. They were exciting without becoming cheesy or predictable.

The movie isn't perfect tho. A big problem was its length. At 147 minutes it was probably half an hour too long. There are a few of the scenes that dragged on a little too far. I also have a problem with the title. Having seen all the previous Marvel films, I don't think that this had the feel of a Captain America movie. It was much more suited to being an Avengers movie and I can only imagine the lack of Thor and The Hulk is the only reason it wasn't called 'Avengers: Civil War'. During the main fight scene between all the major characters reference was made to people pulling their punches and still being friends. These people are friends and superhero colleagues. They have future movies to make together. At no point did I feel they were ever going to actually kill each other; which slightly takes away from the tension.

Overall, CW does very well as a stand-alone movie and also helps set up future movies for various characters. It is a bit too long but there's enough to keep you entertained and keep you guessing about where the story is going. If you enjoy the Marvel universe I'm sure you'll enjoy this instalment.",7
9 May 2016,Blast of fun with a difference,"Was looking forward to watching this for a while, and enjoyed nearly every last minute of it. The film does very well to set the tone, coming from comical-comedy-action to very serious drama/thriller. The acting is portrayed greatly, although I feel there may have been too many characters for each to fully contribute to the film. Some great action sequences, as well as convincing passionate battles. Also does a great job at delving into moral issues that divide us. The writing was very convincing, great dialogue all-round. Effects were magical, done very well. Great film overall, not my favourite Marvel addition but certainly brings a harsher change to a fun-filled franchise.

18 May 2021,Another great entry in the MCU.,"While it feels more like another Avengers movie than a Captain America title, this movie did an excellent job at introducing new characters and cementing the stage and dynamics for the second half of the road to Endgame. It may be liking some of the finesse or humor of later entries but it's still another must-see for any Marvel or action movie fan!

22 May 2016,I'm Supered out,"I was a comic addict, but these new movies are really getting crazy. Super heroes seem to have developed powers and abilities that they classically never had. Each movie seems to try to out ""super"" the next with special effects etc. with less and less story. For me this one does not walk (aka it is lame). Plenty of special effects....some quite ""Jerky"", but apart from that, little of anything to attract. Captain America and his band of merry men seem to have developed invincibility, being able to sustain impacts and blows that would kill or maim any mere mortal.

If you like that sort of thing then by all means see it. If you like a good story/drama, then you would be best to avoid this one.....

3 May 2016,As Good As It Gets,"Saw an advanced screening last night and what a treat it was! Once again the writers for Marvel do it right. The Avengers was done so well and then Age of Ultron was a bit bogged down trying to squeeze characters in but Marvel learned from it and wrote a fantastic film that was able to include so many old and new characters but didn't give that ""crowded"" vibe.

My favorite scene has to be the scene that is teased in the trailer were our heroes are split into two factions and are forced to come to blows. You had fun banter between the characters and of course cool fight scenes, my only noticeable omission in this scene was the lack of Vision activity. For being as powerful as he is he doesn't really do much of anything positive during the battle.

The final scene between Iron Man, Cap and Bucky (which again is teased in the trailer) is such an emotional roller coaster cause at that point you had decided which side you were on BUT a plot twist puts you all out of whack and you just see three characters you genuinely like having to fight each other, but it was another well choreographed scene and very cool!

Do yourself a favor, be sure and watch Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron as a refresher before going and you'll love it!",10
17 February 2021,Captivating from start to finish,"From time 0:00:00 I was hooked all the way to 2:27:43, yes that means the entire movie even the credits! This movie has a different tone than other MCU which was a fantastic change of pace and film style. The comedy was great,action was great and acting even greater. STUNNING performances from Sebastian Stan, RDJ, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson and Chadwick Boseman. Tom Holland did excellent in his first spiderman role. His comedic timing was amazing and his characters lack of awareness was very well done. Paul Rudd also added a light hearted and funny tone to the movie everytime he was on screen. All around fantastic movie, please do yourself a favor and watch it. Definitely top 3 MCU movie. Endgame and Infinity are obviously better but this was very close!

16 May 2016,The Unbearable Heaviness of Being A Superhero,"A long time ago, when many of us were sleeping under a rock, a bunch of exceptionally gifted men and women banded together and started calling themselves The Avengers. The prime responsibility that they had taken upon their specially endowed bodies was to fight terror and crime, cutting across state boundaries, but especially the bad guys that originate from the bad country of Sokovia. In fulfillment of this responsibility, they perform tasks, which defy the laws of physics, explained to us by wise men like Newton and Einstein. There is this lady Superhero, who can conjure up heat and light by manipulating her fingers, much like a puppeteer is wont to do. Another Superhero can achieve instant communication and teleportation by tapping a contraption worn on his wrist. But not all of them are tech-savvy; there is a Superhero still using bow and arrow. And another one uses a designer shield. To cut a long story short, they use exquisite weapons and toys while performing their extraordinary feats to protect lesser mortals like us.

It is not that The Avengers are always perfect; they do commit some silly mistakes sometimes. And one such mistake happened during their mission in Nigeria, leading to the death of some innocent people. It also resulted in United Nations waking up from their stupor and calls for bringing The Avengers under their purview. Some Superheroes, feeling guilty and tired, agree to submit themselves to UN control; others are outraged at their independence being compromised. There is a vertical split among The Avengers. The boss at UN gives the good guys 36 hours to bring around the bad guys. And fortuitously, it is also time for Halloween or some such festival. So they all don their best costumes and have a spectacular fight at Leipzig airport, crushing few planes in the process.

The Shock and Awe at Leipzig does not resolve the stalemate. Fortunately for us, The Avengers have a good sense of humour, of the self-deprecating kind. Particularly witty, is the Spiderboy, a new recruit. But he is advised by the seniors to talk less and fight more. Meanwhile the mummified soldier in Sokovia, who is revived by some mumbo-jumbo, spills some secrets about the parents of one of The Avengers. This reunites the two factions in their fight against the common enemy. The emotions tend to get a bit overwhelming and also confusing. But hopefully there will be a sequel soon to throw more light on these weighty matters.",5
16 October 2016,A Brilliantly Emotional Superhero Movie...With Politics,"Combining political intrigue with superhero action is a daring, risky move...but ""Captain America: Civil War"" couldn't be in better hands. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo prove once again to be the best directors in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, turning Stephen McFeely and Christopher Marcus's brilliant screenplay into a work of art. No other Marvel movie has yet delivered such a fluid combination of intelligence, symbolism, and heartbreaking opposition as the Russo brothers' latest entry into the already amazing Captain America series.

Chris Evans (Steve Rogers/Captain America) reminds audiences why his hero has always been the most likable as he embodies the valiantly flawless titular hero in a way only he can. Robert Downey Jr. introduces a new side of his smarmy Tony Stark/Iron Man, which will either make you love him all the more or repel you, depending on who's side you take. And that's one of the many beauties of ""Civil War"": the viewer has to determine hero's side he's on, as both have their own opinion of the ""Sokovia Accords"", a document that will put the United Nations in charge of all super-powered individuals.

As both heroes recruit others of their kind to fight for (or against) the ""Sokovia Accords"", a scheming puppeteer manipulates them, practically unseen, both Captain America and Iron Man mistakenly believing the other to be the true enemy. And Daniel Bruhl as Helmut Zemo, the man most determined to accomplish his agenda, is the most moving, emotional performance in the whole movie. Helmut Zemo is at once terrifying and enigmatic, in a way no other Marvel villain has been before, and he accomplishes this without any superpowers, bringing to mind Heath Ledger's Joker. As he stares blankly into space listening to a voice recording on his phone, his motionless face says more than any other actor in the whole film. And that's saying a lot, because most of what fuels ""Civil War"" is dynamic, passionate acting from almost all of the actors.

During its worst moments, the film is thought-provoking, conflicting, and emotionally immersive, and when an action scene obligatorily comes along, it doesn't forget the inherent tragedy of the circumstances. The many lighthearted, chuckle-inducing moments (many courtesy of Ant-Man) don't distract from the plot, but remind us that the dueling heroes are still friends, despite their differences. The third installment of the Captain America series--and hopefully not the last--is sure to excite superhero fans, and also entice those harder to please.

Synopsis: ""Civil War"" is an instant classic that transcends typical superhero movie expectations with powerful acting, an artistic vision, and a story that will incite discussions and arguments many years from now.

Official Rating: 103.7/100* *Anything over 100 indicates a Great Movie.",10
4 May 2016,Awesome!,"This film is amazing.

I always say that the mark of a good bit of a film is when you're so engrossed you forget to eat your snacks. There were at least two 20 min stretches where that happened. This film is expertly filmed, the fighting and effects are amazing and the characters all have sensible motivations...the minor characters like Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch and Vision are not just split randomly, you can see why each one goes for the side they do.

The Bucky storyline is amazing too...won't spoil this one.

The villain is also good....again no spoilers.

There is also humour, but it doesn't overwhelm the intensity of the conflict...Falcon, AntMan and Spiderman literally had me cracking up in the middle of big battles when it was intense...but it didn't distract too much.

One thing is that if you haven't seen at least both Avengers films, Captain America WS and Antman you will be hella lost...

One problem is that it is def",9
23 May 2016,The Greatest MCU Film of All Time.,"Captain America: Civil War is without a doubt, the greatest movie in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. You read that correctly. The story is incredibly compelling and very deep for a superhero movie, the acting is outstanding (per usual when it comes to these) and the action scenes are intense, to say the very least. The Russo Brothers have once again hit it out of the park with Civil War, and it's just as great as The Winter Soldier.

As usual, Chris Evans was incredible as Steve Rodgers/Captain America. He has such a likability to him that you just cannot ignore. As you know, Robert Downey Jr. owns the role of Tony Stark. If for whatever reason another actor gets the chance to play Stark, it's likely they won't come close to playing the character as well as RDJ. The biggest surprise to me was Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, AKA The Winter Soldier. He plays a much bigger role in this film compared to the previous Captain America films, and Stan managed to pull off an extremely interesting and captivating performance. You don't know if you should root for him or be against him. Scarlett Johansson gives a noteworthy performance as Black Widow yet again, and Elizabeth Olsen and Jeremy Renner, as well as Paul Bettany are all pretty great in their roles as Scarlett Witch, Hawkeye, and Vision respectively.

Also, the new additions to the MCU are Black Panther and (finally!) Spider-Man. I do not want to say much about them because I would rather you see them for yourself, but I will say Panther may be the most interesting and mysterious hero yet, and personally, Tom Holland is my favorite Spider-Man ever, and I never thought I would say that. The climatic fight scene in the airport is the most entertaining fight I may have seen in film. I don't want to spoil, but Ant-Man steals the show in this scene. And the fight between Cap and Iron Man is so intense it will literally bring you to the edge of your seat.

This movie is what every single Marvel fan has been waiting for. It is a complete rebound after Age of Ultron, which disappointed me completely. Phase Three is off to a very hot start, and we may be in for the best phase yet.

5 May 2016,The Russo Brothers strike gold again,"Straight off the bat Captain America Civil War is worth the hype,it's dark,grounded,action packed,emotional and very fun.

First off the Russo brothers,these guys have to be praised because of they way how they handled each and every character in this film no matter how much of a big or small role they had everyone fit perfectly,because not only was this a Captain America sequel but this felt like an Avengers sequel as well,and the film is just handled perfectly.

So this movie starts off there winter soldier and Age of ultron picks off with the Avengers team still being intact and doing their missions then as the movie goes by you start to see that the Avengers aren't so perfect as events from the first Avengers movie,Age of Ultron,Winter Soldier and Civil War it's self,reveal that people have died during these Avenger encounters and it was really never touched upon in past movies as they made it seem the Avengers saved everything and everyone with no added consequences and this is one of the things the movie does well in exploring what has happened in the past to determine everyones motivation in the film and thus the world starts to question the Avengers' methods and the civil war between the Avengers begins.

What really impressed me was how solid everyones reason for being on either team Captain America(against the government) or team Iron Man(with the government) was,and what I found amazing was how no team was villainized as both sides remained neutral and the decision was really left to the audience as both sides were correct and again the points and reasoning for each side is spot on(well done again Russo Brothers).

Now there are some new characters in the movie namely Black Panther and Spiderman.Chadwick Boseman nails it as T'Challa/Black Panther as he has his own agenda in the film and he is just epic as you follow him and his story throughout the movie as he is one of the best things in the movie because he was so different from any other superhero we've met before.Spiderman,man Tom Holland's performance as Peter Parker/Spiderman is just amazing and you enjoy seeing him for every minute in the movie from start to finish and I definitely can't wait to see more of Spiderman in the future.Baron Zemo is the villain in Civil War,before I saw this movie I questioned whether this film needed a villain,but Baron proved to be a good villain with good motivations.What I also found surprising is how grounded the villain was as he wasn't overblown or overcomplicated,he was just a regular guy who was against the Avengers for a justifiable reason.

The Action in this movie is wonderful as Captain America:Winter Soldier had some of the best Action sequences in the MCU and I proudly say that Civil War has better,more epic and bigger action than any other comic book movie.The Airport fight scene is just incredible it's fun and heavily entertaining and it's not that one fight scene alone that's done so well as Civil War has great balance with action sequences and character interactions and with all the Avengers including Antman,Black Panther and Spiderman,Civil War is a great visual feast.

The Balance of tone is near perfection as the movie is dark and grounded in some scenes,then just shifts to a light and fun tone with some humor as you laugh multiple times in the film and when the movie needed to be emotional and dramatic the Russo brothers made it that way.

Since this is a Captain America film,the focus always goes back to Steve and his journey after Winter Soldier and his relationship with Bucky/Winter Soldier.Their relationship is also one of the strong points in this movie as Captain America never gives up of his friend Bucky and their relationship is tested in many ways in the movie.Sharon from Winter Soldier is back and plays as Steve Rogers' love interest which was a welcome surprise too and Sharon also has something to do other than being a love interest too.

Now the movie isn't perfect(but it's really close),the Ironman introduction into Civil War at the beginning of the movie was a bit sluggish and although Baron Zemo was a good villain,but his end game at the near end of the film is a bit lacking and somewhat plot-device- ish as he makes the Avengers come into quarrel and you just find Zemo's methods questionable in order to move the movie along.

So at it Captain America Civil War is a film about friendship and family which comes with the struggles of it,one thing I have to point out without giving too much away is that the friendship message is wonderful crafted in the third act and in my opinion that's were the ""Civil War"" begins as the tag lines suggested in the posters and trailers ""United We Stand,Divided We Fall"", and this message is conveyed beautiful in the movie along with some epic action,fun moments combined with some emotional moments too.

A great movie and definitely one of the best Comic book movies ever made.Can't wait for Avengers Infinity War.",8

26 July 2018,"Avengers: UN mandated, or in violation of the prohibition of enhanced force","An American fantasy action film; A story about a superhuman soldier who is propelled into conflict with his Avengers teammate, Iron Man, over a system of government control over their actions. Collateral damage comes home to roost for the Avengers superhero adventurers. Some agree to being, others do not. It's an interesting, topical story direction and it's a more mature and substantive picture because of it. Compared to the previous films in the series, the fighting sequences have a little more purpose, showing the dynamics of their abilities, and while the set pieces go on too long, they are impressive. Tension reduces because it doesn't convince why the allies are opposing each other with lethal intent. What the producers gain in satisfying their growing and committed audience, viewers unaccustomed to the Marvel Universe films will feel it is overstuffed with characters. All in all, an exhilirating adventure.

7 May 2016,Worst movie i would say,"This is the worst possible movie marvel can take after batman vs superman.. Even though it is named as captain America, it is a sequel to ultron, and director has possibly thought by the inclusion of all super heroes, the film would be a success, then guess he should be thinking again.. This movie is all about vengeance, don't wanna put any spoilers of course, and lastly they spoke about friendship, which means the climax should have been unnecessary if they really took friendship into consideration. Vengeance, glamorous fights, super heroes, without any story is what i will say.. Best part is spider-man's comedy, and apart from that, this movie is totally a waste of time.

27 April 2016,Marvellous,"The most awaited films of the year brings a big broad smile on the MCU fans. Directed by ANTHONY RUSSO & JOE RUSSO a.k.a. RUSSO BROTHERS presents a beautifully crafted film with all the action, emotional, and drama. Obviously the film doesn't have a bulk of superheroes alike actual comic but believe me it has everything you expect from the film. The core story of rivalries between team cap and team iron man is breathtaking. Addition of new charming characters such as black panther and spider-man gives a great upgrade to avengers. Costumes - Perfect Action Sequences - Fascinating Story - Impressive. Tom Holland as spider-man is the exact spider-man we need - Young, Strong and Blabber mouth. Chadwick Bosemen - You sir deserve a medal for your performance. As per me villains weren't given enough part, could use Zemo and Crossbones in better way. Well a multi-starer film will leave you questioning that did I chose the team wisely.

6 May 2016,The franchise is alive and well,"Which side are you on? Are there sides at all? Do you support the ideology of freedom and individual responsibility or the one of security and obedience to a collective? Is either of those two polar opposites attainable in the first place or are they just illusions?

This film couldn't have been more topical if it wanted to. Wait a minute - it's the Election year in the US... it DID want to be topical. Nothing occupies minds of citizens of the Western hemisphere more than these issues nowadays and ""Captain America: Civil War"" addresses them with zest. Of course, it does so in Marvel style: punch up first, ask questions later, but it does address them with some unexpected insight and self-awareness.

Personally I found the premise a little ludicrous. If I was someone with superpowers and a proved record of integrity and reliability I'd be hard pressed to allow sneaky bureaucrats who elbowed their way to UN to ""supervise"" me; or to wait for months on end for them to reach an agreement on what to tell me to do. If I was an unreliable and/or immoral superhero, they'd see even less of me. So it's a no-brainer as to what side should any of the characters really take. I also found ironic that the thing ""the Avengers"" were accused of by their political opponents - routinely ignoring sovereignty of national states and acting as the World police - is what the US military does on a regular basis. But hey, the setup needed to happen and the screenwriters have put in enough effort to make it look as plausible and as realistic as possible.

The result is a very tense and well paced film that balances serious and fun bits pretty easily. All the characters of old as well as some new additions have found their place in it. Perhaps the most anticipated addition, the one of Spiderman, is the one most effective (and hilarious). Given how colorful that superhero bunch is, the fight scenes are naturally spectacular and very imaginative. I found the ending kind of anti-climactic and unfairly vague in resolution. Obviously a major Disney investment isn't allowed to really take sides and risk repelling some of the audience, and that warrants taking the rating down a notch or two. Still, overall it's a very satisfactory film.

Of course, comparison with another major conflict in a competing comic-book franchise is inevitable and kind of obligatory. So, as far as that's concerned, I'd say I find both films on equal footing. Both are overall impeccably produced and directed, both are marred with similar implausibilities in terms of main premises, and both can be forgiven for that because they're so damn well made. The only difference is ""Captain America: Civil War"" is more fun and ""Batman v. Superman"" has a more poignant ending.

But comparisons don't really matter to me - I like both franchises and I like to see them both alive and well because I've grown tired of TV-series. You see, ever since the early days of television the cinematographers are fighting to bring the audience back to theaters. A relatively easy task at first, it became harder and harder over the decades, as both TV-series and TV-sets kept getting more and more cinema-like. The 3D technology was the latest gimmick but it also ended up in living rooms. And now the film industry started copying television. Just as TV has series, cinema has ""franchises"". A couple of ongoing and very expensive sagas are set to entertain majority of the film-goers during the next decade or so. The companies can ill- afford any flukes and I root for all of them to succeed as far as possible. If they retain the quality of this year's entrances, it could be a long fun ride.",

30 April 2016,"It's really good, but still flawed.","What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",7
28 April 2016,Wow,"I'm literally writing this 30 minutes after I walked out of my local cinema, and I'm still shocked.

After Dawn of Justice was... less than well received, it gave Marvel an amazing chance to leap even further ahead of DC in the ""superhero war"" and boy did they take that chance.

I'm gonna jump straight in with a bold statement. Captain America: Civil War is in the Top 3 Superhero Movies of all time. Probably the best from the MCU, and given the likes of Winter Soldier and Guardians, that's quite a feat.

So what was so great about it? The plot was extremely well structured, which should be a given but after the mess that was Dawn of Justice, it's refreshing to see such a well tied together story in a major superhero movie.

The characters are all amazing, and there's a few surprises along the way too. As expected, Spider-Man hit it out of the park, as did Black Panther, but the star of the show (in my opinion, anyways) was Falcon. Every line he said was absolute gold, the stunts from him were all amazing, and while he was less than spectacular in Ant-Man, Age of Ultron and Winter Soldier, we're finally starting to see some great potential in a minor superhero, and if Steve Rogers is killed off in Infinity War, I can think of no-one better to carry on his legacy. Also, honourable mentions to Bucky Barnes, Hawkeye and Ant-Man, for also putting on a great show.

Any negatives? The editing seemed a tad sloppy in places and in action scenes the camera shook a lot, but why even bother caring about minor details like that, when the movie all-around is exceptional.

I can't see anything beating Civil War for film of the year in 2016, though I hope I'm wrong because I have high hopes for Suicide Squad.

The future of Marvel movies looks to be in good hands!",9
3 May 2016,8.2out of 10 And Watch out for spoilers,Now after about 3000 arguments with random Instagram people and hours watching reviews and watching the movie I've decided to take my rating of 9 out of 10 To a 8.2. Captain America is a great movie it's has some fun parts but as a whole movie it doesn't really work but the fun parts are really fun. It's all makes sense why they do this and why they do that in airport scene no one is trying to kill because team iron mans plan is to just arrest them and team cap was to go beat up assassins. And how visions missing for half of fight scene because he's kind of in the middle and only got involved when he beloved he needed to. Zemo is developed enough and man driven by vengeance what else do you need to know like really the one thing I don't agree with is people calling him a weak villain his plan to turn them against each other would have probz been better if Tony killed Bucky but I didn't want anyone to die because thanos will be a massive threat and they need everyone . There's a lot going on in the movie and introduction to two knew characters which were amazing but this was kind of a test for the russos and every flaw they have in this will be perfected in infinity war first they only had to deal with cap widow fury and Sam but now they had all superheroes except 2 but for a first try they did great and I know infinity war is in good hands after seeing what they have done with this movie where they got to bring all avengers together.,8

20 June 2017,Seemed as if minds of superheroes were toggled.,"It's strange how we were introduced to the characters of Iron man and captain America in earlier versions of Avenger movies. It never seemed like Iron man could go for the version which accepts rules to fight by getting in accordance with UN. Furthermore, it would be Captain America to oppose such a bond laid down by UN. Well this was something my mind could not accept in some way so I rated it less. Well if that is something that does not come to your mind you will definitely find movie to be great.

I don't know why the movies with single superheroes pleases me more than multiples ones. If you are a marvel fan you would definitely like this so go for it.

6 October 2016,"Good morning, Soldier...","While I am not overly a fan of the superhero genre, then I will still watch these movies when I have a chance, because they tend to be entertaining enough and usually be a visual treat in special effects.

And that was true also with the 2016 ""Captain America: Civil War"" movie. Sure, the whole superhero thing is starting to wear thin in my book, but it should be said that there is enough action and impressive effects in this movie to make it worthwhile watching.

For fans of the superhero movies, then I think that ""Captain America: Civil War"" would be like a mother of all movies, because there are so many different superheroes together, with myriads of backgrounds and powers.

The story in the movie was adequate, albeit a bit simplistic. But it was easy to follow and it doesn't really require much thinking from the audience. Just sit back and enjoy the action, the fighting and the sparkling special effects.

Personally I like Ant Man the best, because he is played by Paul Rudd and also because he is the one with the funniest and weirdest of all powers.

I can't really say whether or not this movie is extraordinary compared to the other ones in the same Marvel universe, because to me they are essentially all the same, just with different characters. But it sure was entertaining enough for about two and a half hours.",6
9 May 2016,Disappointing,"Very disappointing given how much I enjoyed the previous Winter Soldier, which Id certainly recommend, unlike this one. I find it surprising that the same directors and writers were involved. Far too many long talkie parts and most of the action consisted of hand-to-hand fist fights, which got terribly boring and repetitive. Not much of a plot either, and Tony Stark takes up as much screen time, if not more, as Capt America, which is never a good thing (and I mean Stark, not Iron Man). It is not a terrible movie, but to call it, as some have, the best Marvel film so far is laughable. That title could possibly go to the Winter Soldier, but not this one. A shame.

27 April 2016,An excellent accomplishment,"As brief background I am an avid comic book fan (both Marvel and DC, but I read Batman the most). I loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and have been generally pleased with most MCU output. I thought Man of Steel was OK but that Batman v Superman was actually quite poor film- making.

Civil War has simply made me think even less of BvS. I know some people don't like comparisons but I cannot help it when Civil War does what BvS tried to do but actually accomplishes it. The good:

The action scenes are great - it really felt like a comic book had come alive

21 May 2016,Superb Avengers film,"The Avengers are in trouble. Because quite a few innocent people were accidentally killed during their many battles the government wants to rein them in. They draft a bill that makes it clear that the Avengers only go into battle when the government allows them too. Iron Man, Black Widow and a few others sign it. Captain America, Falcon and others won't. This leads to an all out battle.

Just GREAT movie--overflowing with good acting and wonderful action scenes. It moves quickly--the 147 minutes flew by. This did everything right that ""Batman vs. Superman"" did so badly. It's serious but also has a sharp sense of humor and some VERY funny lines from Spiderman. Only two debits--Sebastian Stan is bad as Bucky and the way Scarlet Witch was treated at the end was vicious beyond belief. Still this is a wonderful comic book film well worth your time.

8 May 2016,Is this what you call war???,"They were not kidding when they said this was a Captain America movie. Aside from the occasional pompous Tony Stark stealing the spotlight, every actor in this film had minimal screen time. Those that had descent amount of time in front of the camera where quite forgettable. This is one of the biggest downfalls of the franchise thus far. It might just be too much of a challenge to keep track of that many story lines and characters and there is also no denying how shallow the actual script in this film is. Not to mention the franchise has failed to really bring a memorable villain to this universe. The villain here, without going into too much details and spoilers, is some self righteous victim of the Avengers deadly carelessness out for revenge...really?

As far as the actual story line it is as predictable as any other Marvel films in the past. I would find it surprising if anybody who watched the film saw something they weren't already anticipating. The ""plot twists"" were more like plot reroutes and were nothing unexpected. I was also yearning for a lot more depth in the dialouge and interactions between the characters, yet I was sorely disappointed when they chose to go with the long tedious action sequences instead. You would assume that the highlights of the film were the already mentioned confrontations between these super heroes yet, they leave a lot to be desired. At a certain point it almost becomes pointless to see these heroes relentlessly pounding on each other without any real consequences. We get they're nearly immortal with all of their abilities but at some point during the film you will feel guilty for demanding some actual blood to be shed. I almost feel that the main audience of the film were children and non comic book fans. Not that this is bad in any way but their material was not as transcendent as Guardians of the Galaxy, for example.

My biggest problem with the film was with the one dimensional characters scattered throughout the two hours. None of whom really grasped my attention. We all knew what each characters motives were which pretty much took out all of the intrigue. We live in a time where we demand ""gray characters"", in a manner of speaking. We want flawed characters that seem more human....characters that we can truly relate too. A warning for you movie ""critics"", do no expect that from this film.

Having said all that the film was descent and was watchable. There are moments when the film went with very realistic and mature themes such as, weather who should regulate the activities of such powerful beings....which was something to really ponder. There were also elements of the film that were intriguing such as the mass casualties of the Avengers excursions. Ultimately, however, the film fails to really make us believe there is an actual war going on between the Avengers. In the end it will seem like a minor disagreement which they will all scrapbook about and laugh of over a plate of shwarma. Perhaps I just had really high expectations which lead to my unpleasant disappointment. Or perhaps the standard for comic book films is lower than any other type of film. Whatever the case may be, the film is worth the viewing even with all of it's flaws.",5
12 September 2016,"As a stand alone movie this is good, as part of the series it lacks the drama that I like in my movies.","""I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart."" After another attempt to save the world ends in destruction Steve (Evans) and Tony (Downey Jr.) are on opposite sides of what to do in the future. Tony feels that the superhero's should not be given free reign, while Steve feels that they should be able to act as they see fit. When an old enemy surfaces allegiances are put to the test, and the end of the Avengers could be near. This is a movie that is basically review proof but I'll do one anyway. First of all, I'll say this is a good movie full of action, comedy and excitement, like all of the other Avengers movies. The big problem I have with this movie, like I have stated with all of the other movies in this series, is that it lacks real drama. By that I mean, because there is already the announcement of 2 more Avenger movies means that you know how it will end going in, this one had a chance to go dark and really change the game for this series, but once again, it got wrapped in a bow and left me feeling like this is just another in the line of movies made in order to make money and not offer drama. I liked Batman v Superman because of the drama. That movie did have major flaws, but because it ended with the death of a major character. Even though they are coming back for the next movie it set a precedent that makes you go into the next one wondering who won't make it out alive. I'm not a big fan of comic book movies, but the ones I do like are dark, gritty, and makes you wonder what is going to happen. To me the Marvel movies don't. As a stand alone movie this is good, as part of the series it lacks the drama that I like in my movies. Overall, another in the line of the Avengers movies that people will love, I don't. I give this a B.",7

6 May 2016,Thanks Russo Bros for making movies great again!!!!,"Aside from the fact that its a movie based on Superheroes, It really is a great movie! Unlike a lot of these kinds of films, there is an actual plot. The characters here feel real. They are complex and deep.

You actually get emotionally pulled into the story and care about what happens instead of staring at your watch every 5 minutes. I loved all of the actors in this movie. Chris Evans as Captain America was good as always. Tony Stark aka Ironman is my favorite but Black Panther was everything! The guy is a total BADASS!!!I loved all of the superheroes in this movie.

A lot of other Hollywood hacks could learn a thing or two from the Russo Brothers on how to make real movies. For me one of the best movies of 2016. Just saw it today and will be going back tomorrow with a friend! I cant wait!!!

30 April 2016,Captain America: Civil War was AMAZING!,"NO SPOILERS HERE...

I watched the film on the 29th of April, Sadly only in 2D ;( so I cannot comment on 3D and what it looked like and if it's worth seeing in 3D.

But...

What I can comment on is how AWESOME this film actually was; by writing this review and breaking it down into small, tasty, bite-size chunks for you.

The Story

Marvel films have hit a wall recently when it comes to story lines they just haven't been as 'well-done' as other Marvel films like Iron-Man and Avengers Assemble. Green Lantern was a letdown even though the amazing Ryan Reynolds was Green Lantern, also Deadpool could have been so much better all the elements of an amazing film were there: amazing actors, great fight scenes, there just could have been more to the film, the story was so simplistic. But Captain America: Civil War's storyline was so perfect it brought in all the elements of a great film in and they bounced of this amazing storyline that tore people between Cap and Iron- Man. It's so difficult to pick a side, and that's what makes it so great you are constantly changing from one team to the other and when they fight each other you're so torn between the two teams you can't decide and then you just don't want anyone to die are be seriously harmed and if any of them do it's a huge shock. The story easily gets a 9/10.

The Acting

The acting was amazing, the emotions run high in the film and the actors killed it, the emotional scenes hit you right in the feels. Shut out to Robert Downey JR who was amazing in the film. But we all know who we really wanted to see... SPIDER-MAN and BLACK PANTHER. Tom Holland for me is the best Spider-Man so far, he is a real Spider-Man I love how Marvel have decided to actually use a teenager to play a high school kid and not a 20 year old actor to play a high school kid, Spider-Man stole the lime light in the film with his humour, fighting abilities and that fine new suit! Black Panther didn't have many lines, but when does Black Panther need to talk as soon as you see him you know it's about to go down, and that vibranium suit was just Purrfect. The acting was a solid 9/10.

The Action Scenes

WOW... just... WOW they were visually stunning and so well done in all aspects, the main fighting scene in the airport lasted nearly 20 minutes of pure actions, every character was shown and used to full effect, Spider-Man kicked ass left, right and on the ceiling. Ant-Man was actually useful and was so well used. Scarlet Witch was ridicules in the fight scene she was a titan she protected everyone and was like a brick wall full of cars she controlled with her mind. You would think nothing could top off that fight scene in the airport, you would be wrong... very wrong... but no spoilers :D. The action scenes smashed a 10/10 perfect score.

The Conclusion

The film destroys a 9/10 more a 9.9/10 the film was stunning in every way. I would recommend going to see this film as soon as you can and then go and see it again. The film took three different film series The Avengers, Iron-Man and Captain America and combined them and just... well played Marvel... well play, you have made the best superhero film so far by a solid 400 miles. I really hope upcoming Marvel titles like Doctor Strange, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Thor: Ragnarok and the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War films with most of the characters from Captain America: Civil War going to be in the film, will hopefully be as amazing as Captain America: Civil War is.

GO...AND...SEE...THIS...FILM!",9
8 July 2018,Pick Fav Fallacy; Bogus Competent Authority or Causation vs Correlation,"Most of the critical reviews are by fanboys. For the most part they're right about the silly premise. If you're in the business of saving the world/galaxy/universe, you are the competent governing authority philosophically, morally, legally. By what right can the UN claim authority? They have no mandate or competence to deal with such tasks. Many of their members are illegitimate or obsolete shells. The US isn't really a country anymore than the EU is. Feudalism 2.0 has landed in the West with both feet. With geography being much less important to the wielding of power than feudalism's first go round. Then we're treated to Vision's brilliant theory that since the number of heroes has increased that's responsible for the increase in super villains and ET invasions. Now you could have had realistic premise for an internecine conflict. The Avengers stage a false flag attack to raise money for their retirement. Ironically that's what this movie is really about anyway.

8 May 2016,Amazing Marvel Movie!,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

24 May 2016,A shame so many false reviewers mark this so high.,"Being a big Marvel fan for many years, and seeing a very cleverly put together trailer, plus extremely good (well GREAT) early reviews I was looking forward to this film. I came out the cinema with my young nephew thinking this - was it because he is only young, and needed a toilet break, and I generally made sure hes enjoying it, that I missed out on engrossing myself into a classic movie? So I went again, and realized no its was not that at all, and this movie is not very good at all.

The story line is very weak, the main fight scenes are awful personally, no tension, no actual reason to feel they are fighting with any conviction for the side they choose, and their different skill sets just make it all a bit of a mess. I am sure there are some very well paid reviewers to lie about this film.

DC (and no regardless of your petty thoughts) seem to try and make some dark deep stories, and are more targeted towards adults. Marvel seem to try and aim at kids. So if you want to take your child to this film, then yes they will enjoy this fairly action packed light heart colorful film, but anyone over the age of 15 that likes some sort of depth will not.

DC = Adult films. Marvel = Child flick. Shame as I loved the first Avengers film. Wait for the DVD and do not waste your hard earned cash on this, unless your taking children.",3
11 February 2017,"""Sometimes I want to punch you in your perfect teeth""","Civil War blends the incredible action sequences and humor from The Avengers while also bringing real depth and pathos to plot and character that was done so well in The Winter Soldier. It really is every comic geeks dream come true to see these kinds of movies brought to the screen like this so well. The film is stuffed full of so many beloved characters yet somehow pulls it off. Chadwick Bosemans Black Panther is a fascinating character I am already eager to see develop more in his own movie and Paul Rudd as Ant Man is a welcome addition to the team and steals every scene he is in. Of course the biggest treat is Tom Holland as Spider-Man who reboots the character in the best way possible and gives much promise to his own movie franchise. The film is brought together by Robert Downey Jrs Iron Man and Chris Evans Captain America. These two actors are so well cast for the roles it really is impossible to imagine who will play them once the actors decide to move on. This is one of the best super hero movies hands down.

5 May 2016,"Deep, Emotional yet Thrilling (NO SPOILER)","At first before you walked into the cinema all you could think about is whom you'll support. Captain America or Iron Man.

That's what happened to me too.

But once you sit there in front of the screen and let the storyline flow as you let yourself into it, you slowly changed your mind. Now all your concern is not about who will win between the two team, or who is wrong who is right.

This is the movie where you can see those superheroes are also 'human' and has their ego, which is also relatable to our daily life where every big problems come from persistency and selfishness.

In this case, you couldn't hate Steve because you know he's just trying to do what is right, you can't either hate Tony, because you realize he is just trying to keep the team away from problem, and just feel emotional of things that happened.

Absolutely the BEST marvel movie so far, which all you see is not superheroes kicking bad guy ass, but that sometimes even the mightiest force on earth can also have the emotional tension between them.

This movie is so thrilling, exciting, yet emotional. The Russos has done an incredible job bringing the other team member featuring the movie yet it still taste as Captain America's movie just like how the title said.

4 March 2020,Heroes fighting heroes,"Civil War is basically Avengers 2.5 and Marvel throw everything at the film. Interestingly, this film never hit the heights of the previous Avengers film, just odd when you consider everyone involved. The Marvel films at this stage were very connected and started growing towards Infinity Wars. This at the very core is a Captain America film, and a continuation of the first two films. I've never cared for heroes fighting one another, but Captain beating Iron Man is icing on a cake though.

20 December 2016,'Our very strength incites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict... breeds catastrophe.',"Yes, the Avengers are back and this super long film is populated with one of the most impressive list of actors in the business. Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have transformed the Marvel comics writers' Joe Simon and Jack Kirby ideas and concepts and Mark Millar's comic book 'Civil War' into one explosive and at times very funny adventure. Anthony and Joe Russo hold it all together as directors.

Whether you are a Marvel comics devotee or just a person who likes to see a group of good and good-looking actors/actresses do a lot of impossibly ridiculous feats, this film is entertainment. No profound messages (except the goal of the Avengers is to make the world safe and right wrongs that threaten life on this planet) but the endless CGI tricks and costumes and jabbing dialogue are enough to make you stick around for the 2 ½ hours of off the wall antics.

A synopsis is hardly feasible with so much action: With many people fearing the actions of super heroes, the government decides to push for the Hero Registration Act, a law that limits a hero's actions. This results in a division in The Avengers. Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) stands with this Act, claiming that their actions must be kept in check otherwise cities will continue to be destroyed, but Captain America (Chris Evans) feels that saving the world is daring enough and that they cannot rely on the government to protect the world. This escalates into an all-out war between Team Iron Man - Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Vision (Paul Bettany), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle), and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Team Captain America - Captain America (Chris Evans), Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Ant Man (Paul Rudd)) while a new villain Zemo (Daniel Brühl) emerges.

Add to this a dazzling cast actors with bit parts – Frank Grillo, William Hurt, Martin Freeman, Marisa Tomei, John Kani, Hope Davis, Howard Stark, and Alfre Woodward – and it is easy to see why actors as well as audiences have fun with the Avengers characters. Take it for what it is – CGI wizardry embellished with some terrific puns and patter. It IS a comic book, afterall! Grady Harp, December 16",8

27 January 2017,Captain Ameria: Civil War*******,"The Russo Brothers' Captain America: Civil War was a very good film. I do believe that the title adapted from the critically acclaimed graphic novel written by Mark Millar, did not suit it. I felt that an adaption of this title could've have better been saved for another movie, truly felt wasted. In general, I thought the movie was solid but somewhat of a let down, not on the same level and excitement that Captain America: The Winter Soldier gave me but a great effort nonetheless. And honestly, this feels more like an Avengers 2.5 movie rather than a Captain America 3 movie. My favorite things about the movie are Chris Evan's Steve Rogers/Captain America as always he does a great job, Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa/Black Panther, and Tom Hollad's Peter Parker/Spider-Man. 1 of my least favorite things were Robert Downey Jr.'s character development had taken a toll. As I stated, it was a good film, a step down from the last, but good.

15 May 2016,Civil Bore,"Civil War is a movie that contains literally over a dozen 'super' heroes who end up in conflict when the government wants to contain their powers (basically for saving the planet twice). ½ support the government while the other ½ protest this action.

The next 2 hours of the movie is these groups fighting each other in various ways for unclear reasons, and other than a lot of cities/airports etc getting blown up, very little happens plot wise.

The biggest problem is that they are all basically the same no matter which of the dozen or so they actually are. Captain America, the new Black Panther, Bucky, and about another 4 heroes all have virtually the same powers, motivations, fighting styles, and magic weapon (the distinction of course is claws vs a shield vs an arm vs a suit). The next set of about 6-8 are the suit guys who shoot missiles of some sort and fly and are otherwise just trained as ninjas. None of them have any weakness or flaw, they are basically all superman without the laser eyes. Either way, it is all so samey.

How many times can Captain America and the Winter Soldier fight before they realize that neither can hurt the other no matter how many times they punch each other in the stomach; and no number of elite seal team soldiers/tanks/planes can stop them from accomplishing their goals however big or small they are. In one inane scene, the Winter Soldier defeats 20 odd elite forces soldiers without breaking into a trot to simply surrender to another small group of soldiers because

I watched this soon after two other super hero movies, Deadpool and Dawn of Justice. While all had their flaws, I felt in Super vs Batman and Deadpool I was watching something new, characters that had.. well, character. I didn't know what Deadpool was all about, and I was curious about how the fight between Batman and Superman would go. I never had this feeling with Civil War – Iron man vs Captain, a lot of ninja rolls and nothing. Spidy vs Falcon, a lot of ninja rolls and nothing. Rinse and repeat. And all the while the character Vision is basically a God who could do anything he wants at any point and just punches people.

I'm not sure why I was so disappointed, I mean I guess that is what a Marvel movie is. Each hero has their one liner, none are in any real jeopardy in a fight because they are all basically immortal, and when one is injured/defeated it just is so much stupider because you have seen them defeat Gods with ease only to be knocked cold by the 100,000,000 punch to the face for no real reason other than the writers need to eventually move on to another set piece action sequence.

This movie is disappointing because it is so predictable. I enjoyed moments, the action is loud, and some, but it is shocking how bored I could be with a movie that manages to pack so much into it.",5
7 January 2021,Baffling,"The way this movie is made you can't pick aside. You feel guilty if you side with Captain America but then you also want to side with To Merica it because you know the truth. Team Tony was just doing what he felt was right but it wasn't right in another case. It shows how the team compete against each other with different sides and different views and it's literally one of the best movies I've ever watched.

6 May 2016,Winter Soldier/Avengers 1 > Civil War > Age of Ultron,"""Civil War"" is Marvel's second attempt to bring the ever expanding roster of the Avengers lineup to the big screen--and by second attempt I mean this film in addition to ""Age of Ultron"". Sure, most Marvel Cinematic Universe films are featuring an Avenger or two in some capacity these days, and yes, ""The Avengers"" obviously started the whole affair in earnest. But Avengers 1 was a more limited roster consisting of just the few heroes who had already had their own stand alone movies (plus Hawkeye and Black Widow). ""Age of Ultron"" and ""Civil War"", on the other hand, have featured heroes galore, and so I see this movie as the second installment of this new phase of the MCU.

That said, the good news is that ""Civil War"" pulls off its task of including just about every Marvel property introduced so far in a much better way than last year's ""Age of Ultron"". Whereas with ""Ultron"", the film's pacing and lack of setup made for bad storytelling, ""Civil War"" avoids these problems by offering more in the way of plot development and better introductions of new characters (Black Panther and Spider-Man, the latter of which obviously needed no introduction but got one anyway).

As far as the movie's other task--the task at hand of simply being a good movie with a compelling story to tell in addition to juggling so many characters on screen at once--""Civil War"" does well in that department. At no time did I feel like I was watching a bad movie, even if there are a couple of scenes that feel a bit forced (Vision & Scarlet Witch, for example; Spider-Man's introduction being another).

All in all I'm going to give this movie 8/10 stars. It's definitely a step up from ""Age of Ultron"", but doesn't quite hit the standard set by ""Winter Soldier"" or ""The Avengers"".

Two quick afterthoughts:

1) Marvel misstepped by branding this a Captain America movie instead of an Avengers movie. The source material may revolve mostly around Cap, but it's really an Avengers movie, and certainly felt like a sequel to ""Age of Ultron"".

2) This is geeky of me, but with everyone happy to see Marvel's ""Civil War"" comic hitting the big screen, I'd just encourage the comic fans out there to check out the late 80's Captain America collected volume, ""The Captain"". That story is a proto-Civil War story, written twenty years before the more prominent ""Civil War"" comics event. ""The Captain"" was my favorite Captain America story arc when I was a kid, and I'm glad to see it having the influence it's had in the Civil War comics and now in the movie.",8
14 November 2016,The Best Captain America And Or Avengers Film Yet!,"Out of all the ""Avengers"" and ""Captain America"" films this has to be the best one! The story-line and plot are great, it's loaded with action, and it introduces some new characters. As I said with the other ""Avengers"" and ""Captain America"" films I am not a comic book fan but these films are great and can be enjoyed by most anyone. What I really enjoyed about this particular ""Captain America"" film was the political message that ran through it, with that I really couldn't decide who's side I was in favor of. In a way both sides were right and both sides were wrong and to me that's part of what made this film so great. This film would make a nice political debate for some people. Anyway, this film is absolutely awesome! The acting brought on by these actors in this film is great especially the performance brought on by Chadwick Boseman, who played The Black Panther. Speaking of which, at first Iron Man was probably my favorite character, but all of them were awesome but now the Black Panther is one of my favorites. What he did and said towards the end of the film is what really did it for me. There's never a dull moment in this 2 hour and 27 minute film because the action is on point and the film never fails to keep its viewer at the edge of their seat. If you enjoyed all of the other ""Avenger"" and ""Captain America"" films you will really enjoy this one!",8
9 May 2016,An amazing movie!,"First off, I will say that this movie was brilliantly made. The soundtrack was stunning, and went together perfectly with the movie.

There were a few plot holes, and pieces that didn't make sense, and I didn't like or agree with, but I had a wonderful time watching this.

I will not spoil any of the movie, but I will say that I think Ant- Man could have been either excluded from the movie, or brought down a little on the humor. He seems to add too much, and this movie is supposed to be somewhat dark and serious. I also think that Spider- Man should have been added into more of the movie, since he was one of the bigger parts of the comic story-line.

So I will say this; if you were expecting something extremely close to the comics, and nothing else will make you happy, you will be disappointed. I have read the comics, and those aside, this movie was great.

Bucky and Sam have a very good friendship, it seems.

(I think there should have been a darker tone with Bucky's recovery, though that might have come from reading too many very angst-filled fan-fictions, ha ha.)

This movie's choreography was amazing! I was happy to find out that the same person who did it for CA:TWS was going to do it for this movie, and I wasn't disappointed.

Second, I am very glad that the Russo Brothers directed this movie. They did very well with what they had at their disposal. (For one, everyone actually had earpieces!)

The Black Panther was one of my favorite characters. He was very respectable, I think, and extremely mature.

All-in-all, this movie could have been more, but it was absolutely amazing, and I will definitely watch it again, and again. 9/10.",9
10 May 2016,Almost a perfect 10! Would actually give it a 9.5 if IMDb allowed half stars.,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

2 November 2016,"Lenghty, boring, and unneeded film","Look, it's over 2 hours. Why does this need to be over 2 hours long? I should mention this movie is really boring.

It's probably the most stretched-out film i've ever seen. With a plot already suitable for a half an hour short, Captain America: Civil War requires to know exactly what happens in the previous delivers, but i don't mean you've got to remember just a bit, you've got to remember everything or else you're not going to understand where the characters come from, why they act they way they do, just overall why things happen. I suppose this might be great for comic fans, but for someone like me it's just a pain in the ass.

The characters feel lazy. There is not much character development going on, as most just come out of nowhere and are suddenly protagonists. Also, as i've mentioned before, there are so much of them that it just feels confusing.

As usual, though, the special effects are awesome. The sound effects are also nice. The combat scenes are well done and the movie is astonishingly directed.

Now, do i recommend this movie? No, of course not! Unless you're a big comic fan, or just want to see the action scenes, this film is not going to be a hassle. Awesome special effects and direction, but with an lacking and overall boring story.",1
8 May 2016,"Marvel's Captain America: Civil War, through the eyes of a DC fan","After last year's stupid Ant-man and disappointing Age of Ultron I wasn't going to waste my money on another star studded, cgi action flick that will just build up for Thanos or something. Fortunately my friend had a free ticket. And honestly, this is the best Marvel movie to this date.

Of course it still is another star studded, cgi action flick building up the stage for Thanos. But Civil War has a lot more going for it. It tells a story. Story of friendship, ideology and origin. Villain is irrelevant here. Although we are eager to see where this is going, we still can't take our mind off this story. And even though I didn't care much for all the jokes and quirkiness, I couldn't stop laughing at them.

I wanted something ""deep"" from BVS. People need to learn that ""deep"" and ""dark"" are not the same thing. If you are looking for something deep, dramatic, entertaining and you are angry at Zack Snyder for not delivering what was promised to you, then go and watch Marvel's Captain America: Civil War.",8

30 April 2016,Not a 10 but real close so technically a 9.5,"It was truly a great film, it made sense, was accurate and was what you expect from a Marvel Movie. The action was intense. The characters chosen for this film suited the way the film wanted to be done, in despite of all the seriousness of the movie, it had its funny moments to draw back on to kind of release the tension like all Marvel movies before. It provided a good ending to make future films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe have a purpose and direction for the future. I guess in ways it could've been slightly better, but to be honest I don't really how exactly it could be improved but you always think in some ways a movie isn't exactly perfect but this was pretty damn close. It fulfilled the promise of what I was expecting and I am looking forward to future films now to continue with this.

9 May 2016,Fantastic Movie,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point.

10 May 2016,Avengers Disassemble,"Now at the start of ""Phase 3"" Marvel has decided to open it up with one of its biggest films yet, putting together almost its entire roster of heroes in to one movie and taking on one of the biggest game changing conflicts within the entire history of Marvel. Whilst the film is at times clustered, the Russo brothers successfully create a blockbuster driven by a very personal conflict whilst still delivering some of the greatest action sequences of the franchise so far.

After a mission goes wrong and several civilians end up being killed, a proposal is put forward to place the Avengers and all its heroes under government control which divides the Avengers in to two factions. On the one side is Captain America (Chris Evans), who after the events of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is distrusting of government interference and believes the Avengers are most effective working independently. On the other side Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who after feeling responsible for destruction caused by Ultron believes that even the Avengers need to be kept in check. But during all this a villain named Zemo (Daneil Brühl, playing another Marvel villain who could have been very interesting but unfortunately goes completely underdeveloped throughout the film) hatches a plan involving Cap's former friend Bucky (AKA Winter Soldier) to further this divide between the Avengers.

This causes all the Marvel heroes to choose their respective sides, with each having their own personal motives and reasons for who they side with, all colliding against one another in an all-out brawl. To the films credit, the inclusion of all these superheroes never detracts from the core conflict between Captain America and Iron Man, with their emotional conflict always remaining the centrepiece of the film. But at the same time, every cast member gets their own moment in the spotlight. Whether you want to see scenes exploring the relationships between characters like Captain America and Black Widow further explored or just fun moments like seeing Ant-man being shot off one of Hawkeye's arrows, this film will have something for any fan of the Marvel Universe to enjoy.

Although out of the films massive cast the biggest standout of the film is Tom Holland as Spiderman. Whilst he only has around 10-15 minutes screen time, Tom Holland has the potential to be the best Spiderman yet. He's able to pull off both the awkward but charming Peter Parker and the fun quick witted web swinger better than either Maguire or Garfield were ever able to. Plus Holland works incredibly well off all the other heroes, particularly with Robert Downey Jr. as he and Holland appear to share a very natural chemistry with one another. The only drawback of Spiderman in the film is that at times the CGI appears very unnatural, looking a lot more like a video game character than he does an actual person. Nonetheless it was a great re-introduction to the character, without relying on the already familiar origin story, to be another great addition to the MCU.

However just like too many superhero movies lately, by having so many different characters to juggle the movie does feel clustered at times, with some plot lines not getting the attention that they deserved and being incredibly underdeveloped. Probably the worse effect of this is the Black Panther's origin story. It's an interesting story about honour and revenge which on its own would have been enough to fill an entire film, but doesn't get the time it needs here and thus his origin story ends up feeling wasted. It's a shame too since it's the first time the characters been introduced in any film and it could have been a great backstory if the film had the opportunity to properly develop it. Plus Chadwick Bosman gives a great performance in the short time that he's actually given a chance to. Hopefully his standalone film should give a better opportunity to give the character the attention he deserves.

Whilst there are a few problems with some of the films action sequences, with some scenes suffering from the overuse of fast paced editing techniques, for the most part the fight scenes have the same exciting tone and focus on practical effects that the Russo brothers demonstrated in Captain America: Winter Soldier. However the one scene in the film is the airport sequence, which sees both sides of the conflict and all the heroes collide together in an all-out brawl. I won't say anything specific about what happens in the fight, since it does have a lot of great surprises that shouldn't be spoiled, but it does just about everything that you'd want to see from these characters fighting and is probably one of the crowning achievements of the MCU so far. The only downside is that this scene is so incredible that afterwards the rest of the film ends up feeling fairly underwhelming in comparison.

Also the film does shy away from some of the darker aspects of the original Civil War storyline from the comics and the movie doesn't do anything that we haven't seen from other Marvel movies before. Whilst the conflict between Captain America and Iron Man is interesting, the snappy back and forth between both sides whilst fun and enjoyable leads the clear impression that neither side will be willing to take the fight too far, thus reducing the stakes of the film.

Saying this, Captain America: Civil War does just about everything that audiences expect from and want from the MCU. It's funny, it's exciting and it continues to explore the characters that have remained at the core of the Marvel Universe since its inception. On top of this the Russo brothers have once again proved themselves ready for the task of taking on the next Avengers movie.",6

4 May 2016,8.5/10,"Marvel's 13th entry in their MCU comes in as the answer to anyone who was thinking that the super hero genre was starting to die or that it had spent its potential. ""Captain America: Civil War"" is a soaring triumph of modern mythological storytelling which improves on its source material and delivers a film with a remarkable artistic credit.

The most stunning element the film immediately presents is its relentless momentum and pace. The way in which every single story beat feels necessary and connected with everything else is astonishing. There isn't half a moment wasted, you are grabbed by the narrative and never given reason to let go. What the Russos manage to do with these characters is shocking the more you think about it. They succeed in not only make this story integral and interesting to every one of them, they also manage to give each and every one of them further and deep character development and insight, from the smallest one to the ones we have seen in six movies already.

I have no idea how a vision this big and complicated got so smoothly adapted on screen. There is so much to get across, so many points to tick, so many elements in play and the filmmakers manage to nail every single one of them. The themes are engrossing and relatable, but most importantly they are presented to you in a clear way, you don't have doubts about character motivations, every one of them has complexity and relatability and it is a joy to see their relations unfold on screen.

And we haven't even started talking about the action scenes here. On a first impression I might say that this is one of the best action films of this cinema era, it might just be an instant classic from that point of view. These sequences all have such an urgency to them, you feel stakes and momentum. They are supporting every beat of the storytelling, they are almost all an integrating part of it and stunning to experience. The flawlessness with which they are put together is overwhelming. Not a beat was missed. The stuns are clearly visible, the CGI (for the first time ever in a Marvel movie) is unnoticeable, the complexity is engaging and not distracting.

Look, the sophistication of the film is reflective of the difficulty of reviewing it, everything is just so good and emotionally touching, it is coherently funny, joyful, dramatic and thrilling, there just is too much to get into, every one of these actors should deserve a paragraph on their own, their commitment in bringing this together is heart warming and they all deliver performances that are exactly what the movie needs. The music, the villain, the sound, I just could go on and on about the technical perfection we have here, it almost moves me to tears because it is the demonstration of everything I've believed: love and passion for the material always bring to the best results and the fact that everybody involved is so clearly caring about the final result is demonstrative of why this film is such a success that I really look forward to checking out again because I am sure there will be stuff to be found in further viewings.

It does bear some minor problems: a 10 minute rounding the edges could have been easily possible, the famous airport scene has a couple of tonal shifts that could have been handled slightly better, there is a little too much breathing space between the first and second climax, yet that is probably all.

I loved this movie with both my heart and my brain, it is put together with a mastery and affection that is rare to find in any kind of movie overall, it is the proof of the equality of all movies and that it doesn't matter what is in yours, what matters is what story your telling. I repeat I genuinely can't wait for a second viewing, it is so encouraging to see a movie this big and this commercial be so endearing and important for cinema.",8
3 December 2017,Powers doesn't matter,"The fact of having a power or not is totally irrelevant. Anyone can beat anyone if the film requires so. That nonsense and the poor argument's line make the title absolute rubbish.

If I rate it with a three is due to the Tony Stark, Peter Parker and May scene; a good comedy portion with three charismatic characters.

12 May 2016,Best Super Hero Movie Ever,"Smart, emotional film. This one takes a look at the heroes from the layman's perspective and it's not a pretty view. This isn't a film with a traditional threat or single villain that needs to be overcome. This is a story about guys who passionately disagree with one another and their inability to agree on the response to certain issues leads to conflict and war. I love the way this movie managed to introduce and setup future Marvel films without seeming like too much of a distraction to the overall film. I love Spider-Man's quips and comments while meeting the other heroes. I love the way Black Panther does not have time for anyone and refuses to quip! He's a man on a mission and carries himself in a cool, calm, regal, and charming way that makes a stark contrast to characters we've seen in the past. The most interesting character in the movie are Spider Man, Black-Panther, and the Awesome RDJ AKA Iron Man. Sure this is a captain America movie , but the role of Iron Man was something else you can't forget. And at some point in the movie you sure wants to kill BUCK and CAP!

This movie starts at full speed throwing the audience into the surprisingly intricate story without any warning. What I mean by this is that Civil War opens without any credit sequence, Marvel logo, or fun soundtrack to ease you into the chaos that unfolds. Instead this movie throws you right in and trusts that you'll stay afloat from the onset. Once the credits actually roll we're treated to a scene that both made me wonder how they stuck a young Ferris Bueller in my Marvel film and what sort of devilish deal was bartered to get RDJ seem so young. Like, seriously, this moment was utterly shocking!

The plot of this movie is similar to other super hero movies but this movie finds a way to set itself apart with the attention and care of the characters themselves. The less you know about the plot the better but the conclusion of this movie ensures that the heroes in this movie don't walk away from this film with relationships unscathed. There are ramifications to the relationships that will likely carry on in future films. Civil War initially gave me some bad Age of Ultron vibes with The Avengers encroaching a mission without any backstory. Those concerns began to wash away when the film took it upon itself to remind me that this is the Russo's we're talking about and their concept of action is a lot more grounded and brutal than what we see in other Marvel films. This is a deliberate introduction that has a purpose that you'll understand as the movie progresses. The movie may begin with action but the action sequences are so good that they seem like they were lifted directly from a great Jason Bourne movie and Marvel has no business having sequences this well thought out or fun.",9
18 April 2016,What a shame,"Another marvel formula This movie can fit right if they show this at the 1st phase,its boring the direction is horrible and the effects to, what a shame. Like all Disney made marvel movies the characters lack any kind of development. There is no attachment to them and the audience can care less what happens to them. The soundtrack is just another generic computer generated sound and lacks any real soul. The plot is also a rushed mess.However this movie gives the same generic marvel formula that we have come to expect.This is a bad choice for marvel,in critics its always good for they because they pay it all always but with the fans its another thing

1 May 2016,"Some have called it Avengers 2.5. Make no mistake, this is without doubt Captain America 3.","Some have called it Avengers 2.5. Make no mistake, this is without doubt Captain America 3.

After the last Captain America film (The Winter Soldier), expectations were sky high for the next instalment. The Winter Soldier was an extremely high quality film that introduced the titular character to us in a compelling way as well as cementing the relationship between Cap and Bucky. Then we moved on to the destruction of Sokovia, brought about because of Tony Stark. We explored the increasing divide amongst members of the Avengers team during Age of Ultron.

This is effectively where we pick up in Civil War. Team Cap vs. Team Iron Man. One team is all for an overseeing body of people to keep the Avengers in check; this is the Iron Man camp. While the other team if absolutely against the idea; this is the Captain's camp. Cap has already put his trust in a governing body in the shape of S.H.I.E.L.D. only to be betrayed and find out it was Hydra all along. After watching all the promos, you may has chosen a side. But you will constantly be changing your mind while watching this film.

You may also have worried about how high could the stakes be. The promos may have not convinced you, but you have nothing to worry about. I genuinely feared that we may lose one or two characters. Whether we do or not is for you to find out.

I only have one negative so I'll get that out of the way. It is an ongoing struggle with the majority of Marvel movies; the token 'bad guy'. Maybe it is just me, but the villain's agenda seemed a little convoluted. He didn't really have much to do. In the end, it serves the plot so not too big of an issue overall. After some thought, I may even go as far as to say that there could have been other ways to further the story making this villain unnecessary. It just means there is more time to focus on the struggle between Team Cap and Team Iron Man. I appreciate that neither of those camps were portrayed as right or wrong - it goes back and forth making it a constant struggle.

The performances are outstanding. To think that some of these actors are playing their respective characters fifth or sixth time and yet bring their A game every single time and add a layer of nuance every time is fascinating to me. It just goes to show how well these actors now know their characters, how comfortable they are with each other and how much fun they must have making these movies to continue to improve film after film. The newcomers are very impressive too; so was their introduction into the story itself. It all felt organic to the story. Chadwick Boseman brings a sense of gravitas to Black Panther which makes me very excited for his solo film. And then there's Spider-Man. The one people have been most excited to see. I won't say much at all except that he is one of the highlights of the entire film.

The other highlight...an absolutely phenomenal action set piece at the airport. You haven't even seen a tenth of it in the promos. I was filled with a pure sense of wonder and cinematic joy while watching it. You will see things you've never seen before. Quite possibly the best action scene I have seen in a comic book film.

I could continue to wax lyrical about this film. But in short, although it is still fresh in my mind, Captain America: Civil War is tied with Avengers Assemble as my favourite Marvel film so far. They nailed the drama, they nailed the action, they nailed the humour and most importantly they balanced all of that while giving all the characters their due. The Russo brothers and the writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have done a masterful job. This is the 13th outing from Marvel in their cinematic universe and they have absolutely knocked it out of the park; surely this is unprecedented. Bring on Infinity War!!

My Score: 9/10

the potential drama is intriguing, but falls short due to cheap laughs inserted at any give time.

what movies like watchmen and nolans dark knight got right in terms of drama and deadpool got right in terms of humor for mature audiences are both shortcomings of this otherwise entertaining flick.

but because of this it fails falls short of innovation and excelling in any other way that than CG

28 September 2020,One Of The Best Marvel Movies Out There,"Pros: 1. The costume and set design is brilliantly done. The Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spiderman (Tom Holland) outfits are especially great, and the Captain America (Chris Evans) suit has progressed since its' conception. 2. The combat is a whole lot smoother and fast-paced than the previous films, and the action scenes (particularly the airport fight scene) are fantastically choreographed. 3. The movies' serious and gritty tone works really well, especially with the fissures in the Avengers only heightening said tone, and vice versa. 4. The mixture of practical effects and CGI, for the most part, looks great, and they helped to ground the film in a certain realism. 5. The score helps to lay a suitably tense and stifling atmosphere, without becoming stifling itself. 6. All of the Avengers (both the characters and the actors) have brilliant chemistry with each other. 7. The introductions of Spiderman and Black Panther are amazing, as they're given actual story-arcs which are compelling. 8. Both Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man/ Tony Stark) and Tom Holland deliver fantastic performances. 9. The last fight scene between Captain America, Iron Man, and Bucky Barnes/ Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is one of the rawest and emotional scenes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it's pulled off greatly.

Cons: 1. There are a couple wonky CGI moments. For example, when Captain America starts running on the motorway in Germany. 2. Elizabeth Olsen (Wanda Maximoff/ Scarlet Witch) puts on a distractingly bad Russian accent.",9
5 September 2016,Truly a superb entertainment,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) is the best movie in this franchise since the first ""Iron Man"" and with the exception of exceptional ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". Finally there was a story that was in a first place, and then the action, which was simply - amazing. Fight scenes and special effects were amazing to say the least. Stunts were superb as well. Craftmenship is as good as these movies gets - 250 mill. dollars surely were spent wisely. Finally there were a consequences of the action which i looked forward since the first Avangers - what about thousand if not million who died during these movies - so great that it was finally questioned here (maybe a bit to late but it's better then never).

Overall, ""Captain America: Civil War"" is just a superb entertainment which kept me glued to the screen during the whole 2 h 5 min. And you better find the biggest screen possible if you missed it during theatrical run, cause this is a blast.",10

Ant-man and Spider man have come as surprise package. Performance wise everyone has given their best. Action sequences were really awesome since from beginning to climax. Climax action sequences were really breath taking. For Cinematography perspective, you will have tour of really amazing locations across the globe. Chris and Robert are sure shot winner. Inclusion of Iron man's story was great. Visual effects were really terrific. You will miss Hulk and Thor in this movie. Eagerly waiting for next installment and more action.

16 June 2021,I've grown up into liking it,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",9

20 April 2016,Overall Captain America: Civil War is an amazing superhero film and arguably one of the best ever (For me it's no challenge) the best MCU movie yet with amazing characters,"Hey guys it's STARK here with my early screening review of Captain America: Civil War!

Expectations: Going into the early CA: CW screening I was pretty hyped. My expectations were high and maybe the highest I've ever had for a marvel movie. The film did not disappoint.

Review: The Russo brothers directing was next to perfect for this film. I can honestly say there were no real or huge flaws from their directing. The fight scenes sometimes got a bit unrealistic from some characters but we're still so good. The fight scenes did not involve very much CGI at all and had a beautiful pace that was quick. The fighting was clear and did not make you confused or dizzy either. At the same time though they did a great job of getting in touch with the emotional side of the film and were able to put the film on the same scale as both Avenger films. The directing was amazing and Infinity War is in great hands.

The screenplay for the film was also amazing. The majority of the script was suited the plot really well and did a great job with all the MCU characters especially with the first besides a few corny lines. There were lot's of great lines in the film involving comedy and drama. The way the plot was together was great and one of my favourite MCU ones. Once again Infinity War is in amazing hands.

The films soundtrack was engaging and very good. Even though I couldn't distinctly remember it bar from bar It was still interesting and gave the story more life.

Finally the characters. Chris Evans brings his best Captain America performance yet and really dives into the characters ambition this time and does a great job of showing both the characters good and bad side. The character of Cap in this film really makes you question the nature of him and if he's really the good guy we all know and love. Robert Downey. Jr brings another good performance of Iron but I thought even thought it wasn't bad it wasn't his usual best. The Iron Man character was great in this film and stayed the same at his core throughout the film so it was still the Iron Man we still knew and loved. Mostly. But I'll leave it at that. Elizabeth Olsen does a much better job as Scarlet Witch in this film with a more familiar style of acting for herself that wasn't as forced and much more natural. (More less thick accent). The character of Wanda I thought was much better and had developed a lot more. She was less of an annoying character and brought a lot more interest to the table. Sebastian Stan's acting as Bucky was great because he was able to play the character with humanity and the monster/drone very well. Bucky's character had change a lot since Captain America: Winter Soldier but there really isn't much I can say without revealing anything. Frank Grillo did not get much screen time in the film but the time he did the character was better than the acting even though his acting was not very bad. The character was portrayed as a terrorist and was one of the films darkest characters and also brought a dark sense to the film. Daniel Bruhl did a great job as Baron Zemo. His acting was great and very interesting to watch. The character himself even though he was a bit of a cliché was perfect for the film and rest assure, did not take away attention from the actual Civil War part of the story. His character was controversial and maybe one of my favourite Marvel villains yet. Chadwick Boseman. Black Panther. Boseman becomes the perfect casting for Black Panther portraying absolutely comic accurate but also being appealing to the audience. His acting never seemed off for a moment and never seemed corny. He made you believe and trust the characters motivations. The character of Black Panther was also very comic accurate and cool. His fighting style was entertaining and awesome. He was Marvels Batman and brought a new refreshing character to the MCU. They aced Black Panther in all ways. Now finally... SPIDER-MAN! Tom Hollands performance was not always great as Spider-Man but as an early actor it's okay and still wasn't bad and was very fun to watch. As he grows older I think his acting will continue to get better. The character of Spider-Man himself was better than all other Spider-Men and was next to perfect. He looked awesome, provided great comic relief that actually gave me a good laugh, great action and awesome character interactions/development. He was the most comic accurate spider yet and one of the most comic accurate comic characters seen on screen yet. Besides one or two cheesy lines (That went with the character in a way) Spider-Man could not have been better. Returning characters like War Machine, Ant- Man, Falcon, War Machine, Black Widow, Vision etc did not change too much. Though Ant-Man in a film with Avengers was a delight to see and he fit pretty well with it.

Overall Captain America: Civil War is an amazing superhero film and arguably one of the best ever (For me it's no challenge) the best MCU movie yet with amazing characters and an amazing story with no real flaws. Infinity War will be amazing. In case you were wondering.. #TeamIron is who I side with.

1 May 2016,"Captain America, the first good superhero trilogy!","When it comes to superhero movies they rarely succeed at making the whole saga of movies (specifically trilogy) consistently good. Some might argue The Dark Knight Trilogy is perfect I think that's bullshit, The Dark Knight Rises is a mediocre at best and disappointing finale to what could have been a nice Batman Anthology. Other trilogies that haven't come out well are: X-Men Trilogy (Last Stand wasn't good), Spiderman Trilogy (Spiderman 3 doesn't need explanation), Iron Man Trilogy (neither of the sequels are any good), Blade Trilogy (Trinity sucks) and the old Superman and Batman sagas (sagas which the first two films were actually really good, but the two that followed were laughable corny crap).. Civil War is actually even better than Winter Soldier and First Avenger which is insane. The Russo brothers continue Bucky and Cap's story in this very well crafted adaptation (which actually has little to do with the comics). The performances are great, specially Tom Holland and Chadwick Boseman as the newcomers to the MCU. The airport scene is even better than people are saying. It's as action packed as a film can get. Every superhero in the movie get's their moment to shine. The only weakness I can think of is the villain.. But we already expect mediocre villains from the MCU, THE MOVIE IS PERFECT ANYWAY!!",
5 May 2016,MCU at its BEST,"Its the best M.C.U movie ever created. Russo Brothers have done it once again. Properly interwoven which has ultimately resulted in a visual as well as intellectual wonder.To sum up, it's a MUST WATCH. It was the one of the best in the Avengers franchise. I can't wait for Doctor Strange, Infinity War 'cause it will set up a new world for the M.C.U. According to me, the movie should have been released only in 2D & IMAX. Other than a few popping-out-of-the-screen moments, the 3D does not add a lot to it. But once again I will recommend you fans from MARVEL as well as DC that it is one of the best superhero movie ever made.

N.B:- Deadpool is some other thing, don't compare with it.

29 April 2016,The best Marvel movie of all time,"This is hands down the best Marvel film to date. Expertly made by The Winter Soldier directors Anthony and Joe Russo, and featuring a complex and intriguing story combined with some astonishing action, Captain America: Civil War is a riveting, exciting, and most of all massively entertaining ride from start to finish.

I'm going to start with what I loved most about this movie: the action. The Russo Brothers proved in The Winter Soldier that they can make some amazingly exciting action sequences, and they've upped their game here in Civil War. From the word go, this film is filled to the brim with intense and exciting action, filmed in a brilliantly sleek way that makes it all the more enjoyable to watch.

There are at least four major action sequences (one of which is probably the best we've seen this century) in this movie, a fact that would normally condemn a film to being too explosive. Here, however, thanks to the longer running time, you get good and necessary breaks between those major set-pieces, meaning that when it's time to up the tempo, it feels so satisfying to watch.

However, a great action movie is nothing without a good story. Fortunately, Civil War delivers stunningly on the storytelling front too. Despite being enjoyable to watch, Marvel's films have had a tendency over the last eight years to feel a little thin when it comes to genuine thrills and drama, and that's what makes Civil War stand out so much from the rest of the MCU.

I won't deny that the film may be a little overlong, and a little overstuffed in the first act, but when the pieces gradually begin to come together, it makes for a thoroughly captivating watch. Civil War's premise puts the world's most powerful heroes at odds, and its story lives up to that perfectly.

This isn't a civil dispute, this is a civil war, and at every moment, there's a really strong and serious emphasis on how high the stakes are. This is a film that matters. It's got emotional depth, political intrigue, and as many superheroes as you can imagine clashing in the most epic way, and that's something that we've not seen from a superhero movie in any way since The Dark Knight.

Overall, Captain America: Civil War is a brilliant film. It's just as entertaining as you'd expect from Marvel, but with a heap of astonishing action sequences and a more serious, intelligent and high-stakes story, it makes for hugely riveting viewing.",8

3 July 2022,Just why?,"Didn't watch this picture because apparently the Stamford Incident doesn't happen in it. For the unaware the Stamford Incident was when a group of C-rank heroes tried to fight some S+ tier villains for their reality show and one of them exploded in front of an elementary school killing hundreds. It is the inciting act and the emotional core of the event and if its not in this film then what's the point?

6 May 2016,A Great Beginning for Phase 3!,"Hey everyone Connor here once again with the review of one of the biggest films of 2016, Captain America: Civil War

After the scenarios of New York, Washington, Sokovia, and newly Logos, the U.N. wants to put all super powered beings into check. Cap doesn't exactly like that and so many of our favorite heroes choose which side they represent, and so comes the arguing, then the fists go flying. So there you have the central plot.

One of the things that I loved about this film was how perfect the fight was, not in just physical form, but mentally as well. I found myself neutral throughout the entire movie. That is how tough it is to pick a side, both have even pros and cons against the others beliefs. Therefore job well done to marvel again for that part.

As for the characters, they are the same misfits we all have come to know and love over the years. Except for a few new faces. Ladies and Gentlemen we finally have in the marvel film universe Black Panther and welcoming home in amazing fashion, Spider-Man. Chadwick Boseman plays T'Challa aka Black Panther who we see a lot in Civil War and I must say I now am sold and cannot wait to see his stand alone film when it releases next year. As for everyones favorite web swinging hero Spider-Man is home with marvel and debuts in Civil War. Tom Holland in my opinion is already in my opinion a scene stealer and easily my favorite part of Civil War, mark my words by next year when his solo film Spider-Man: Homecoming is released i truly believe everyone will say he is the best Spidey ever! The way he looks and cracks jokes constantly is perfect and I cannot wait to see him return soon.

The film from the trailers point don't show much humor but I promise you Civil War will at many points have fans laughing away as it brings a whole lot of humor to a film with hurtful truths as well.

Overall I loved Captain America: Civil War and would see it again. I Connor approve this film and love where Marvel starts us out in Phase 3!

Hope you enjoyed the review and as always have fun and enjoy the show!",9

12 May 2016,The screenwriters were on vacation,"I never go to the movies and, very fortunately, this saves me tortuous hours under a stupidly big screen and sub-indirect relations with rude people. The last time I attended a movie theater to see contemporary films was at the launch of that second Hobbit and then now, to accompany colleagues and family at 2 hours and 26 minutes of juvenile bullshit. Not that it was a surprise. The title says Captain America before a colon and Civil War but it is an Avengers spin-off. As such, carries a luggage of poor dialogues, incoherence and overload superficiality, trivializing violence. Oh, don't forget the jokes that helped giving face and arms to a pseudo-cynicism catastrophically used to destroy the integrity of the characters.

30 July 2017,Outstanding !!,"After the debacle of Avengers Age of Ultron, the Marvel Studios have done a brilliant thing by pitting the Avengers vs each other. Thanks to excellent writing and in the good hands of the Russo brothers, we get an all out entertaining films and one of the best from the Marvel studios.

Civil War is not your usual superhero film where there is a bad guy and the heroes teaming up to stop him. Civil War is different because its a clash of ideologies and beliefs. And thats what makes the film work.

Its great to see Captain America being pitted against Iron Man and the fact that they become opposites of what they are known for. Captain America who is the principled one doesn't want any laws or council stopping him from preventing terror while Iron Man known always know for breaking rules wants to live by them.

The movie also captures how a simple man can bring a crack between the superheroes and instead of uniting, they fight to stop each other. Its also highlights the importance for fighting for your friends and being with them no matter what the odds are. The movie is high on emotional quotient with a lovely climax and there is no right or wrong one.

The performances are top notch and each actor gives his best. Special mention to Paul Rudd and Tom Holland for their cameos as Ant Man and Spider Man. They bring the much required comedy in otherwise a serious film.

Go watch it whether you love the superheroes or not because this film will not disappoint you a bit.",8
2 May 2016,Best superhero movie of the year so far,"The Russo brother's strike again with this amazing, thrilling and entertaining superhero movie that left me very excited to watch the next project of the Marvel cinematic universe. Everything about this movie was amazing especially the action sequences they were very exciting and not like all the other cliché and boring action movies these days.

Before I watched the movie I was worried that the movie was overcrowded but I'm glad I was proved wrong. Every character had the perfect amount of screen time.

The story was amazing and I was blown away by the final fight scene. I loved how the movie showed the point of the two sides which will leave the viewer switching teams in the movie.

The movie is longest Marvel movie so far but I didn't feel bored at all. Every scene was very well made and had me on the edge of my seat.

The entire cast did an amazing job, the cgi was awesome. I can absolutely see this movie in the list of my favorite movies of the year.",9
30 April 2016,A Marvelous time with exciting new characters and the fan favorites,"The Marvel Universe is based on fun and fighting with an interesting story tucked in there. Captain America Civil War definitely delivers on these parts!

While the story is a continuation of the previous Captain America movie Winter Soldier, the scope is far more than that. You could say it's an Avengers movie, but the stories of the Captain's past and where he believes his future lies are what gives this movie some interesting depth.

But who are we kidding? The intersecting story of all Marvel heroes is great, but the fighting, one-liners and hilarious scenes are why I come back. if you're the same, well you'll have a Marvelous time.

The new characters and some minor known characters are allowed to claim the spotlight, putting others in their shadow for once (watch the movie and you'll get it)

I can't wait for the upcoming Infinity War movies, a lot has to happen to screw those up with this cast, these directors and the Vision of the MCU. But who knows, maybe Thor Ragnarok will bring an ironic end to the good times.",9

5 May 2016,Massive entertiner,"Captain America: Civil War is an abundantly-entertaining piece of blockbuster entertainment which gives lie to the notion that an adventure film with lots going on must devolve into chaos. Following the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, the world has become understandably concerned about gangs of super people destroying bits of the planet every so often. When Bucky Barnes (Stan) is finally brought out of hiding, he becomes the catalyst to allow Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) to bring the world's super people under control, starting with Steve Roger's (Evans) Avengers.

Ostensibly an excuse just to get loads of super people to wail on each other for our amusement, Civil War takes the opportunity it has to delve into the people who make up its world while also at least considering the real-world problems actual superheroes (and by intimation, real-world superpowers) would pose if they did whatever they wanted. And it really makes with the super people wailing on each other.

A big part of Civil War's strength is its insistence on avoiding the trap of cameos even when many of its characters only show up for two or three scenes. Instead it gives everyone something to do – from Vision (Bettany) and Scarlet Witch's (Olsen) slow bonding to Spider- Man's (Holland) introduction and brush with the big leagues to Black Panther's (Boseman) dogged mission of vengeance – and something to feel (so that we feel it, too), creating a joyful smorgasbord of superhero action that is the most Marvel thing Marvel has ever made.

The list of such character-based touches is almost endless and fantastic – Falcon and Bucky's forced partnership, Tony Stark flirting with Aunt May to Peter Parker's extreme horror, Vision trying to figure out how cooking works – with new elements melding seamlessly into the new. Spider-Man and Black Panther are organically accepted into the whole, particularly Panther who is well connected to the main plot, as the various characters work not only within themselves but as part of the whole.",9

5 May 2016,Avengers: Infinity War is in safest hands.,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

8 March 2020,"Civil War brings a deeper integration and development of each character, in addition to expanding the universe bringing new characters","Civil War is responsible for deepening and providing long-awaited answers and has an essential role in answering questions raised in previous films, in addition to setting the stage for the expansion of the universe for future films that promise to be nothing than epic.

The Avengers are on a mission in Africa. Even if they avoid an attack of catastrophic proportions, civilians die. Secretary of State Thaddeus E. ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt resuming his role as ""The Incredible Hulk"", 2008) reports that 117 countries will sign a treaty that limits the team's activities. Tony Stark, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) understands that this restriction is necessary for tragedies to be avoided. Steve Rogers, Captain America (Chris Evans), believes in the individuality of the human being and sees in the treaty a form of manipulation. Meanwhile, another situation involving Winter Soldier / Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) contributes to the division of the Avengers.

The film is, at the same time, a continuation of the proposed themes of ""Age of Ultron"", in addition to continuing the arc of the ""Winter Soldier"", and bringing together the best characteristics of both, bringing the epic action with a very well stitched and with a political background that exposes various ethical and moral issues of our society amid characters with fantastic powers. Set after the events of ""Age of Ultron"", screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely adapt the arc of the ""Civil War"" comics by Mark Millar and Steven McNiven with extreme category, establishing the feud between Captain America and the Man of Iron when the Sokovia Treaty is placed under the table, signed by more than a hundred countries that aims to regulate and limit the jurisdiction of the Avengers who are acting by ignoring the limits of sovereignty, with unlimited power and without supervision, causing destruction and deaths caused as a result of previous clashes in New York (The Avengers), Washington (The Winter Soldier), Sokovia (Age of Ultron), Lagos (beginning of Civil War).

The plot makes a point of not pointing out who is right or wrong. Tony Stark is haunted by the guilt of past actions, while Rogers is concerned with protecting his battlemates and that the heroes' anonymity is key to their risky missions. The other characters naturally align themselves to one side or the other in an organic way and showing the whole context of their decisions, which generates a split between the heroes. Each fights for the ideals he believes.

Marvel still takes advantage of ""Civil War"" to bring back old acquaintances and introduce some new characters long awaited by fans. The Winter Soldier (Bucky Barnes) is the catalyst character and moves all the actions of the feature. We can finally see what happened to him after the end of ""Winter Soldier"" and how he is used as a play to trigger ""Civil War"" events. In addition, we have the introduction of T'Challa, the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). In a few scenes we are already presented to the political side of the hero and, soon after, to the warrior side of the protector of Wakanda. From his first scene in Vienna with his father, even when he appears already dressed as the Black Panther, starring in crazy scenes of chase through the buildings, tunnels and streets of the city alongside the Captain and the Winter Soldier, they already show a magnificent introduction to this character.

We have back to Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision, who bond, Hawk (Jeremy Renner), Combat Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Agent Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp), and a comeback that will blow the head of fans of comics and films: Spider-Man. As a result of a highly publicized agreement between Sony and Marvel, the hero returns ""borrowed"" to the studio of the House of Ideas, Peter Parker is recruited by Tony Stark to fight alongside the Captain and his allies, Spider-Man reappears being younger than previously shown in theaters, as well as Aunt May. Living with his powers for about six months and still learning to deal with them, but already knowing that this meant new responsibilities in wanting to help people, he gets a "" upgrade ""in his still precarious Tony Stark uniform, in addition to satisfying all fans in the airport scenes with his acrobatics, agility and humor. Actor Tom Holland is extremely comfortable playing the most famous arachnid in comics. In his few scenes in the film, his mentor / apprentice relationship with Tony Stark is incredible. These scenes are the highlight of the comic relief of the story.

The script by Christopher Markus and Steven McFeely is decided to put different facets both in this agreement and in the people involved in it. General Ross (William Hurt) is known to the public, for ""Incredible Hulk"", and, therefore, famous for not being a very pleasant person or even just. When referring to the Emerald Giant and Thor, Ross compares them to atomic bombs, not people or superheroes, but weapons of giant destructive power. The Russo Brothers want their Civil War to embrace international issues and not merely within the realm of superheroes born and active within the United States.

In addition to this fight between responsibility and supervision, there is a more central theme in the film: revenge. Baron Zemo is a complicated character, since his true motivations are hidden until the final minutes, but I was very happy to see that his goal was simply to screw with the Avengers, because they caused the death of people he loves - and not conquer the world or make an army of super soldiers. It is still a little forced, but he did not care to die or be arrested, he was completely overwhelmed by the desire for revenge. The same is true for Tony after he discovers something we have known since Winter Soldier: Bucky was responsible for killing his parents (remember when HIDRA shows the agent's targets, and we see Nick Fury and Howard Stark among the dead?). That desire also grips T'challa after his father is killed at the UN. But when the Black Panther sees what the villain's central purpose was, he understands where he had fallen. Maybe the way Wakanda has behaved needs to change, maybe he needs to change.

Something interesting is to note that the Avengers union usually happens just to see them fighting as a team or exchanging jokes with each other. And this is not necessarily a bad thing, on the contrary, but eventually you start to expect ""something more"". After all, nobody likes a magician who only has one trick. Civil War is that ""something more. ""It's a film that is only possible because we know Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Clint Barton and Bucky Barnes. We have seen how they have changed over the years, we know their motivations and weaknesses, and watching them fight goes beyond ""heroes vs heroes"" is fun.

Action scenes in different locations on the planet. In addition to the United States, the plot takes place in Vienna, Budapest, Nigeria, London and Berlin for example. The entire opening sequence in Lagos in the persuasion against the Crossbones (Frank Grillo) - which triggers the questions of the governors around the world - is simply breathtaking, as well as the attack in Vienna, the persecution of the Winter Soldier in Bucharest, the fifteen uninterrupted minutes of action scenes at the airport involving more than a dozen heroes and, of course, the final climax involving Iron Man, Captain America and the Winter Soldier involving a major revelation of the past. The Russo brothers repeat here what they had already done in ""The Winter Soldier"", creating extremely realistic and impactful scenes, using camera movements and frames that put you inside the action. Combined with the incredible visual effects and photography by Trent Opaloch and the soundtrack by Henry Jackman, make ""Civil War"" a unique experience. In all these action scenes, however much they involve several characters, they are extremely cohesive, well directed and which gives everyone space to shine.

The impression for the vast majority of people is that ""Civil War"" is an Avengers story before it's a Captain's story, and although they're not wrong, this is a story led by the Captain, an arc that focuses more on him than in others. ""Civil War"" has some problems. Characters like the Combat Machine, Hawkeye and Ant-Man are just there for the action to get more interesting, and Zemo's motivations are extremely expected - one more person who lost his family and blames the heroes - but this is by far the film that leaves more consequences for the universe, that brings more weight and importance to itself, and for that reason it is perhaps the best of Marvel so far. It is the real closing of Phase 2, and more important than deaths or twists, we have a breach of trust and friendship. Yes, the world is hunting heroes now, but more than that, the Avengers, as we know them, are over. From now on, it will be fascinating to see some developments of the consequences of the acts presented here. We will see Tony reacting to the fact that he is wrong, something he does by not following Colonel Ross's orders. Wanda and Visão were clearly moving towards something more intimate, but there was a tremendous breach of trust between them, and the android ends up questioning his reason. And Black Panther now decides to implement a different philosophy in his country, abandoning the path of revenge and going against the world by hiding the Avengers there.

""Civil War"" is yet another hit by the Russo brothers in Marvel's multi-million dollar franchise, bringing action, adventure, humor, drama and lots of fun in a lean script, with excellent dialogue and twists that leave everything just right to please the audience . It is, so far, the best Marvel film, which brings a deeper integration and development of each character, in addition to expanding the universe bringing new characters that will have fundamental importance.",9
2 May 2016,Great Movie!!!,"This is another great Captain America movie.

Obviously it doesn't follow the Civil War comics but Marvel still managed to make a great movie out of it. Even with many (or few) characters, it still worked and were all shown well in the movie. The characters too are very lovable. The action was again, awesome. The story was great also.

In conclusion, Captain America: Civil War is another great Marvel movie. It's a great movie filled with the right amount of action, comedy. thrill and excitement! You won't be disappointed.

And again, expectations of a sequel of the movie is most awaited.

19 May 2016,The next big film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"The next big film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe arrives in a slam-dunk fashion, with a great story line and unexpected twists and turns. The cast, once again, as usual, is a standout. Chris Evans still proves that he is Captain America, distilling in him doubt and a questioning manner, while also showing him as a conflicted and true leader. Evans commands the film and ever scenes that he is in, proving that the Marvel Cinematic Universe isn't complete without the character. Robert Downey Jr. once again proves that he is Tony Stark and that no other actor can depict the character. Downey takes a backseat to Evans in good fashion and doesn't try to take the film away from him. This is more Captain America, than Iron Man, with Stark only arriving into the film when necessary and never hogging the film away from Evans. Downey and Evans work well together, while successfully showing the different sides of both characters: Captain America as the leader and Tony Stark as the billionaire, who after the events of Age of Ultron, is guilt ridden. His decision to favor oversight comes from a civilian in Sokovia being killed during the battle, which has a huge impact over the film. Sebastian Stan makes a welcome return to Bucky Barnes, the brainwashed friend of Captain America, code-named the Winter Soldier. Once again this character proves that the Captain America trilogy is about one thing: brotherly love. Stan's depiction brings a sense of doubt and confusion, since he still trying to piece his entire life together, while it also partly ties certain events together. Scarlett Johansson is marvelous as always as Black Widow, delivering great lines and working well opposite both Evans and Downey. Anthony Mackie is once again amazing as Falcon, Captain America's new ally. Don Cheadle still works well with Downey and in the role of James Rhodes, having replaced Terence Howard in Iron Man 2. Jeremy Renner makes a great, small appearance as Hawkeye, as does Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, lending a sense of comedy to the film and giant surprises. Paul Bettany depicts Vision as an android attempting to come to grips with the world, while Elizabeth Olsen gets to further explore the character of Scarlet Witch, sharing some really great scenes with Bettany. William Hurt makes a welcome return to the MCU as Thunderbolt Ross, now Secretary of State. This approach seems to be done as a way to still make clear that The Incredible Hulk (the black sheep of the MCU) is still part of the universe. Hurt shows Ross as a complicated politician. Frank Grillo makes a great, small appearance as Rumlow at the beginning, while Emily VanCamp makes a welcome return as Sharon Carter and Martin Freeman is introduced to the MCU in a small role as Everett Ross, who will undoubtedly return for future installments. The real standouts in the film are Tom Holland as Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. Holland steals the scenes that he is in as Spider-Man, working exceptionally well opposite Evans and Downey, as well as Marisa Tomei, who depicts Aunt May. Holland is comedic, depicting the character as a nervous, geeky, unsure character. Holland seems to be the definitive version of the character, delivering a far better performance of the character than Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, the two of whom are also fine actors. While some may say that Spider-Man is only featured in the film to introduce him into the MCU and also to setup the planned standalone film, I believe that Spider-Man worked out well in the film and lend a real sense of stamina to the film, especially the big fight. Boseman is amazing as Black Panther, delivering the character with menace and true purpose. Boseman is calm as the character, while the introduction is wild and spectacular. Daniel Bruhl makes a great appearance as the villain Zemo, who has a huge connection to the events of the film. While the character is different in the comic books, I can defend the change that had to be done, since it supports the film's plot and layout. Bruhl's approach to the character, as a calm and calculating villain, as well as the villain itself is spectacular, while he has got to be the best villain that the universe has had to see so far. The idea of having a normal, regular human face off against the Avengers is smart and total genius on the part of the filmmakers. The end result is films that will leave the viewer wondering how the universe will continue. Since Captain America: The Winter Soldier acted as a turning point in the MCU leading up to Age of Ultron, this film does the same, showing a change in Stark, while also showing Rogers as a new leader. The film ends in such a way with us wondering the directions that the characters will go in and also if Stark will ever be needed anymore, while also showing the lengths that he can go to. The film includes a number of good references to other films in the MCU, while it also acts as a terrific conclusion to the Captain America trilogy, proving that this is the best trilogy within the MCU. In the case of good third chapters in trilogies (Toy Story 3, The Dark Knight Rises, Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) this film acts a fantastic third chapter to its own trilogy. The film also does the smart move of not revolving around a huge battle, showing the slow build up to the battle and the lengths that characters can go to, in a way showing a war of opinions in political style discussion. The result is a film that is terrific and well-handled, acting as a great comic book film, but also so far as this year's best comic book film. Fantastic!

6 May 2016,"Entertaining as always, but nothing game-changing.","Good movie, but nothing that you haven't seen before (still entertaining and keeps you engaged though).

Marvel has followed a simple plot line lately: Just make the biggest opponent the Avengers face...themselves. Genius. Wow.

Look, I get that it works, but this movie didn't bring anything new to the table. Yet again, we have someone pulling the strings and pitting these guys against each other, like Loki and Ultron before them but with a different reasoning. Sure there is more explanation behind it, more characters, clear sides...but apart from all that, it was simply just entertaining. And that's what Marvel does well even if it's just recycled and presented differently.

I love Captain America, he did pretty much lead the role (obviously because it is his movie technically) but this movie pretty much was building on other smaller characters like Widow, Antman, Vision, and Panther while introducing Spidey to balance out the ""serious dark tone"" the film tried to capture.

Sure it sets up future films, but why praise this movie for doing the exact same thing BvS did at a smaller scale two months ago (but apparently was TOO MUCH)? Everything some people hated about BvS was even worse in this one...but we are giving Marvel a pass just because it's not DC? Come on.

Marvel did do a good job, don't get me wrong...but they didn't take any risks or freedoms with this film. It had a very predictable plot and subplot that most people will eat up because they are unfamiliar with Marvel comics (unlike DC, where everyone knows who's who before the franchise was even thought of).

Sure this movie does a good job as a continuation of the Marvel Universe, but it wasn't really something that builds Captain America role (like Winter Solider did) but, again, was really just building the smaller characters.",6
28 April 2016,slightly better than iron man 3 which was horrendous,"I walked out after 30 minutes Spiderman CGI costume...??? I've seen better things on you tube for crying out loud Just some mindless constant parking lot battle scenes with bad dialogue and story It seems like people forgot how to make good movies now days its all hype, marketing and CGI.

Im starting to think Marvel actually pays people for good reviews and comments just to sell the movies, rather than actually make a good movie and it happens with other movies too.

It makes me sick.

If you're the kind of type that likes CGI , Iron man 3, Twillight or 50 shades of Grey this is the movie for you, for me not so much.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

15 May 2016,A solid entertainer with a story...,"I was a bit apprehensive based on all the negative reviews and went to the movie without any get expectations, just to kill a Saturday evening. But I was pleasantly surprised. Captain America Civil War is a decent movie and deserves a 7 star rating. By far it was the best Hollywood flick I saw in the past 3-4 months I guess.

There is a story, a twist, some good witty dialogues and a cameo by Marisa Tomei too.

If you have no other great movies lined up to see, then Captain America Civil War will help you pass 2.5 hours with some light and quality entertainment.

12 June 2016,The One thing that was wrong,"The is no way that Captain America beats Spiderman, it's ridicules. You would understand the irritation if you are true Marvel and Spiderman Comic book reader. Spiderman is stronger and faster than Captain America, not to mention the fact that Spiderman is intellectually gifted and bright in the likes of genius kids in league with the likes of Tony Stark. The main reason why Spiderman beats Captain America though is because Spiderman can dodge bullets. He can also see and sense blows miles away before they touch his body, not to mention that he senses danger even before the attack happens. The only way to hurt Spiderman is to distract him in the havoc and chaos created, with innocent bystanders or what not, while Cap has to hide behind his shield. Captain America had difficulties fighting the Winter Soldier while Spiderman defeated the Winter Soldier and Falcon at the same time? it all speaks volume of favoritism for branding and marketing purposes rather than staying true to the Marvel Characters integrity. Spiderman is also tactical and he always subdues all his opponents by using his wits and intelligence rather than hurting them, always finding it more preferable although he is more than capable of going rounds blow for blow with some Powerful Beings. Captain Americas strength, endurance and stamina is mediocre in comparison with Spiderman too. It is a shame that the fight scene didn't do the fight between Cap and Spiderman justice although I understand the necessity for branding for more blockbusters.

The great things about the Movie was all due to Black Panther, Antman, Spiderman and the childish quarrels between Falcon and Winter Soldier. They put life, personality and charm into the blockbuster.",5

12 May 2016,"Didn't expect much, got a masterpiece!","I gotta admit, I wasn't hyped for this movie as much as I was for past MCU movies like The Avengers and so on, and since I hate spoilers, I haven't watched or read anything about the movie after the very first trailer. But, boy, was I pleasantly surprised!!

How great you're asking this movie was? I was literally shivering at one point in the movie. The actual ""civil war"" fight, that was shown partially in the trailer. I've been to a lot of movies, but none of them has made me shiver with excitement like this one, and that's saying something.

There wasn't a weak point in this movies. Now, I'm not very pretentious about movies and have liked films that are hated by the majority of moviegoers, but even I admit the flaws of movies that bother others. Well, this movies has none! NONE! You literally have to nitpick to find it bad. The action scenes were good, the storytelling was good and characters felt fleshed out.

Speaking of characters, I cannot not point out the villain in this one. So, yeah- Marvel makes great comic book movies, but the villains have always been a weak link. Well, I'm glad to tell you that this is not the case in Captain America: Civil War! Finally another good villain has joined Loki in the rogues' gallery :) Zemo is not your clichéd villain that seeks world domination, he's motives are good, he has a certain charisma to his character. You'll like 'im, trust me ;) And of course, much thanks to Daniel Brühl for his performance.

To sum up, if you're into comics- go watch it! It's a must! A really well made CBM. And since the same directors are going to make Infinity War 1 & 2, we're in good hands :) And if you're just a casual movie enthusiast- go watch it. It has a lot to offer to you as well, even though you won't get most of the references.",10

18 April 2016,Haters Gonna Hate,"DC fan girls are shaking in their boots, so you know it's going to be good. BvS was okay but DC should really just stick to animation. I hold out hope for Ben Affleck's solo batman film I think it will be a winner. Also I think Wonder Woman was well represented and look forward to her solo project. Marvel knows they have a winner here, though. Thats why they lifted the review embargo 3 weeks before the movie comes out and they were right. BvS lifted their review embargo 3 days before release, assuming they too had insight to how their film would be received. Let's be honest with ourselves please DC fans. Everyone who has seen Captain America: Civil War, and reviewed it, has come to the same conclusion. So these DC shills come onto sites like these trying to drive down the review numbers in hopes they can prevent some ticket sales. The thing is, they know it's coming and they cant stop it. Like a tsunami on the horizon. A tsunami made of money.

12 May 2016,Arguably the best movie of 2016,"""Wow"" - This one word would describe the movie aptly. After the disappointment of BvS (shame on you DC), the Avengers sequel checks all the boxes for a well made movie. Great acting, Amazing story, jaw-dropping action, well written humor, and great characters.

Unlike the previous Avengers, (still a little confused as to where Ultron and Vision came from), this edition has a solid ( i mean rock solid) story line. The intro of all new characters into the Avengers fold is very well done.

As the trailers have shown, Cap and Iron-man go at each other, and this is probably one of the best parts of the already awesome movie. Superb action, superb acting and great humor thrown in between. With all these, you could not possibly go wrong!!!!

One peeve though, I feel the movie name should have been Avengers - Civil War and not Captain America - Civil War. Because this movie is as much about avengers as is about Cap.

This is a must watch for all movie goers, a solid 10/10. I cant find a single flaw in this movie.",10
29 April 2017,BEST Marvel Movie so Far!,"""Captain America Vs Iron Man! Wrong. It's Bucky Barnes Vs T'Challa - Nope, wrong again. It's Bucky Barnes Vs Tony Stark - Oh, wait, it's Steve Rogers' movie. Avenge!""

The preface should tell you what the film is all about. Yes, it's one hell of a film!

But I'll show you how to criticise it, still.

With his propaganda-poster jawline, WW2 promotional adverts to fitness inspirational videos and air of unimpeachable nobility, Captain America (Chris Evans) has always been one of the duller members of the Marvel universe.. Which is probably why, although this film or ""the Avengers 3 with a Boy Spidey and a giant Ant?"" - outing bears his name, the film-makers have press-ganged (almost) every spare ounce of Marvel muscle to back him up. Oh yeah, it's not entirely the ""American War Mongering"" spectacle titled Civil War (with Captain USA).

Ignore the crap above, this is, as it should be, very much Cap's movie and Evans' Steve Rogers proves he's the heart and soul of the MCU. And no matter what, he's a good man - who has to make tough calls, who's essentially alone in the world despite the company of his superhero pals. His battle of ideologies with Tony is compelling, but it never quite evolves past the same argument being repeated throughout and both sides doing something to show why the other might be right. Guilt over collateral damage is what prompts some of them – Tony Stark, Natasha Romanoff – to sign an accord ceding responsibility for their actions to the UN. But Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, demurs.

The freedom to deploy a spot of unilateral ass-kicking where needed is what makes the Captain so great, and by extension America, also, great. But let's not get into that shall we? The scene is set for an internecine Avengers smack- down; the plot – hooked on an under- cooked vengeful grudge – is of secondary importance to the opportunity to watch them knock titanium alloy spots off each other. Fortunately, the zinging screenplay, by Marvel regulars Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, hits home almost as frequently as the punches.

The Hulk-sized gap in the lineup is filled by an engagingly geeky Spider-Man-boy-dork (Tom Holland, a promising taster for the stand- alone upcoming Spider-Movie - where Captain is returning the favour by making an unusual cameo, I think, based on the trailer). While the little guy, the ANT-MAN got a round of applause in most of the theatres/cinemas, including the one where I was at and I didn't even try to be cynical about it. It was great.

Downey turns in an uncharacteristically morose turn as Tony, even moodier than he was in Age of Ultron and in parts of Iron Man 3. He certainly has his good reasons for being down, although it does sap the movie of some of the charm and fun Iron Man has long been relied on to deliver. His differing ideology from Cap's is the crux of Civil War's philosophical and literal battle, but, like 2016's Other Superhero v Superhero Movie, this heady and repetitive debate also grinds down the pacing at times. Between Civil War and Batman v Superman, hopefully both filmmakers and audiences have fulfilled their need to address the issue of collateral damage and can once again embrace what superhero movies do best, namely pure escapism. That's not at all to say superhero movies can't or shouldn't address heroes' moral culpability or echo real world concerns, but continually lecturing to and piling the guilt onto the protagonists (and, by extension, the viewer) for superheroes doing what superheroes do is growing rather tedious and, frankly, taking the fun out of the genre.

As much as Cap and Tony's relationship is put to the test here, it's ultimately Cap's Bro-man-tic devotion to Bucky that trumps all else. Sebastian Stan once again finds the humanity in his cold warrior killer, and even gets a rival to Cap's affection in Anthony Mackie's Falcon. Their relationship is played mostly for comic relief to help offset the overwhelmingly tense and even gloomy tone of the movie. Know who else brings the chuckles to Civil War? Your friendly neighbourhood and highly anticipated new addition to the MCU... (Hint: He was beaten by some crappy insect).

Overall, the Civil War does a far better job of juggling so many different characters than AOU or even X-Men. Sure it has a very complicated story-line but it's one hell of a film which you don't want to miss out on. While memorising who is in which of the colour- coded, armour-plated exoskeletons can be challenging, the sheer force of so much super-powered personality on screen makes for a blast of a movie.

And the best one from Marvel, yet.

*A ""Spoiler"" not necessary need to be ""Alerted"" about: Stan Lee appears to mispronounce his own-created character's name: Tony Stark to Tony Something else!",9
7 May 2016,Not as much fun as it could have been.,"As a huge fan of the Marvel Universe...I must admit I had high hopes for Captain America Civil War...and I was disappointed. Not terribly disappointed,but slightly disappointed nonetheless.

Reviewing this movie as simplistically as possible...this is a revenge movie, where everybody is angry at everybody else...and this anger...much of it misguided leads to all types of conflict, between all types of individuals, regardless of their lot in life.

This isn't an Avengers Movie...but it really is an Avengers Movie...and I must admit, I like my Avengers movies, much larger, louder, and bolder. Maybe its the absence of the Hulk and Thor, which leads to a bit more subdued of a movie...and trust me they are missed. Yes, Ant Man and Spider Man show up for the festivities, but their presence hardly make up for the Green Guy's or Odin Son's absence (although Tony Stark does give the ""Green Guy"" a shout out). With that being said, however, I personally got a kick out of ""new and improved"" Spider-Man, now that he's been given the ""Marvel Treatment"", and I expect the upcoming standalone Spider Man Movie should be the best yet.

As noted already, this entire movie is predicated on interpersonal conflict, and its this conflict which leads to two major battles between our superheroes. The first battle is a bit tongue and cheek, but the second battle is all business, and our heroes are truly intent on inflicting serious harm on each other.

Not nearly as big or bad as its predecessors, Civil War is what it is...A study of the human and superhero psyche. Although it is an interesting endeavor, it is not a particularly exciting one. Marvel's crown jewel, The Infinity Wars (or whatever they're going to be entitled) are fast approaching...and the bad blood between our heroes, (spawned further by the events in Civil War), better be healed...and Thor and the Hulk better be planning on showing up...or Thanos and his Infinity Stones should have a cake-walk when defeating our heroes, and conquering the universe they are sworn to protect.",6
8 May 2016,High ratings deluded us,"To start my review, I must say I'm not a big fan of Marvel and I'm not very familiar with the pre-sequels. I got into the cinema, with the feeling of both excitement and both I would rather see Mowgli feeling.

Firstly, as this movie built up, all I felt was boredom. Conversations were OK, but I couldn't pay much attention to it, as it felt like I know the movie's ending already. The only part of the movie, that was interesting for me, and I could really pay attention to was the Airport's fighting scene. But then again, the constant stupid jokes ruined it. I couldn't understand why everyone else laughed at these very awkward, corny jokes, at the cinema expect us. The story was bad and mediocre, also the acting was mediocre too. We decided to watch it, in 3d, but it turned out to be a bad idea, as the fighting scene's very clipping and felt low in FPS.

Overall, It felt like it will never end, and we felt constant boredom through the whole movie. It is a mediocre action movie, and I don't really understand the means of the high ratings. I wish we could have seen Mowgli's story instead of this trite action movie (,but some of us really wanted to see this, because of the high ratings).",5
11 May 2016,Hastily assembled movie,"Hi,

I would like to start with the past. Specifically, winter soldier, the previous movie. Now that movie was focused. It had established an identity, which in my mind felt like espionage/action movie. Directorship was great and in my opinion extremely underrated. This comes in its own light due to the inevitable comparing between the two of these movies.

In this movie to start with, combat scenes are poorly assembled. Directorship is terrible, very shaky camera, bad angles, constant switching between cameras, unnecessary dark lighting. Recent contrast to compare? Dead pool. They have the means to create a great combat scene where you don't need to replay everything 2-3 times to see what's happening and get a gratifying feeling and appreciation of the art in it.

Let me give you another example... Jumps. I mean the heroic intro jump from a building or some other height. The ""bad-ass"" intro. They've cut all jumps and change camera at landing, they didn't even bother to CGI it. The manner that this happened didn't feel neither artistic, or purposeful, just hastily assembled.

As a fellow reviewer commented, plot holes everywhere. I am not going into specifics but you couldn't get they why. It's like after they had filmed the movie, someone changed the script.

Lastly, i just want to point out, that i am the kind of man with an obsession. Meaning i like the franchise immensely and i will try to cut corners and justify everything they dish out at me, and I've defended every movie of the universe from day 1, either good or bad (there wasn't any movie in the franchise till now that was not at least decent and with good standards anyway), with the same zeal.

I have never written a review in the past, but i was so offended by this movie and so frustrated to see such high ratings, just because its captain America/avengers and the names of the cast, that i had to resort here, to warn people and hope that someone in the marvel franchise is looking out.

Don't get me wrong, I've never even bothered with reading the original comics. I couldn't care less about how the lore might defer from comics. It was outright insulting to the viewers and just a money-hoarding movie. To justify this, simply compare the excellence of every past movie coming from this marvel universe with Captain America Civil War. The difference is immense, humongous, monstrous, enormous, it's a gap that cannot be leapt.

I'm really really sorry and sad about this, it will be the first movie of those that i will re-watch only once at home simply to get all the facts and lore to be up-to-date for the next ones.

Needless to say that 1 hour after watching it at the cinema, i'm still dizzy, literally dizzy and sick in my stomach from the bad lightning and the darn earthquake camera...

Overall, I totally understand that after a certain point, when the script and subsequently, the universe, has expanded so much, there will be some gaps. But fans would rather wait for a movie to be completed first, properly than have movies just roll out fast. This movie by my simple amateur gut feeling and estimation, should at least have a development/shooting time of 2 to 3 years. The feeling we got in the cinema, was that it was rolled out in 6 months.

With all the honesty, positive aura and hope, i wrote this review, praying, making an ode to the creators and executives to climb back this steep path, come back to ""light"".",3
6 May 2016,"Hey look, this one had a story!","I had a problem with the avenger movies. They get around with too little a story to tell. There is a bad guy, he did something, then the avengers discuss something and they fight this ultimate battle that nobody can deny loving.

Captain America is not this sort of a movie. Russo brother must have given an amazing efforts, and took a chance to make a movie this long to convey a story. But it paid off, the action became sideline because the story is gripping.

The character build up was precisely done. On top of that, the new and returning characters were given adequate importance. Ant-Man was great, Spidey and Black Panther had a great intro, Cap and Stark had marvellous confrontations.

Now talking about action scenes, they were innovative. We saw a lot of it never scene before. It was fresh and kept us at the edge of our seats.

Bucky did good too. He had a fare share of footage and most of the story revolved around him. Daniel Bruhl, another new addition was mysterious and well suited in his role.

Friendship was the root cause of this civil war, so I was expecting some heated arguments between friends who are facing each other, But I got more that what I expected, and I had high expectations I tell you that.

The climax was exhilarating. With a good ending, all is set to make it one gem of a movie.",8
16 May 2016,What's so civil about war anyway ?,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

7 May 2016,A comment for Turkish readers and all others... sry guys,"I don't know what i can say or what i should say but in my opinion it was very boring and (like the other comments say)it was not the best marvel film,its a overrated teenage film, i didn't like the action things either... You know i look it in 3D and in every punch, the camera rotates 2-3 times my eyes get tired, and i became eye cancer.. No soundtrack or anything else what can you cheer up at fighting only to much superheros who they try to make their power in balance... standing 6 vs 6 in a row and with the ""ding ding ding"" they run at each other ... you know they compares it with BvS i saw that too 2 months ago and i can remember every fight scene and there was epic moments (like ""Do you bleed"" and all the other battle quotes) but here .. i cannot, the only flop's in the film is Spiderman and Black panther, and I'm a Black panther fan, Spiderman was very good, but all the others shouldn't be in the film, there was too much and it was not a ""Be"" for all them, you can explain the storyline in 20 seconds and i couldn't stand it in the theater... i even forget a time that there was a villain, and they say ""great moves"" and other things... nah, widow again with his leg around neck turning back flip moves what we see in every films she appears a 20 time, vision at the fight with only two lame laser shots, you know when you saw deadpool you cant laugh at the little jokes in here, the travel and the place switches they couldn't do it,captain fights at Africa a time 2 seconds later he is in a funeral ... you know, are my expectations to high?i don't know, the only thing i can remember panther, winter and capt. Can run faster than vehicles and twice then usain bolt sry marvel fans I'm a big comic book-film fan but this was not what we need ..",3
13 October 2016,A Disappointment,"Like so many continuing series, they always have the split between the characters -- like superman fighting himself, of the pathetic Batman vs Superman. Writers can't seem to continue a winning combination. The first Avengers movie was a 10! The characters did have inner fighting, but they were always going the same direction. Civil war gave us endless battles and shaky-camera action until I was forced to use the fast-forward just to sit through it. Chemistry of characters, fun and humorous interaction, with a common goal -- that's what these super heroes should be giving us. Instead, there's no trust -- And I mean, when has Captain America not been trustworthy? And when has Iron man become to dense to listen to reason? I'm glad I didn't fork over the money to see this at the movie. I'm wishing now I hadn't bought the DVD, but had rented it instead.

10 May 2018,Team Cap vs Team Ironman.,"I've rather stupidly watched the MCU films in completely the wrong order, which sometimes makes it challenging to keep up with who's who and why they're doing what they're doing. That said, this one is fairly easy to sum up: the Avengers have a falling out, with disagreements over how their activities should be regulated, and loyalties divided over the winter soldier, who has been framed for a series of terrorist attacks.

With the superheroes locking horns, the scene is set for some spectacular fight scenes, which is what the Avengers films do so well. Civil War also introduces us to the Black Panther and the new Spiderman and gives us a lot more of Antman, which is a good thing, these characters providing many of the film's thrills, with Spidey and Antman upfront and centre for the most impressive scene, a battle at an airport that sees the aircraft used as weapons!

Admittedly, the villain of the piece, a soldier seeking revenge for the death of his family in Zokovia, is a bit weak, but this character is merely there to serve as the catalyst for the jaw-dropping smackdowns between our heroes; in this respect, he serves his purpose well enough.

7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8

6 May 2016,"Phenomenal action, but sloppy and inconsistent. Ruined Captain America's character.","First, This should have been called ""The Avengers: Civil War"". That would have been a more appropriate title given what happens in the movie.

PROS: Stellar CGI and action. Pleasant surprises with many other Marvel characters they threw in. They made Black Widow stronger and with better fighting scenes.

CONS: Iron Man and Captain America were inconsistent to who we know their characters to be. In some ways, their roles were reversed. Without revealing exactly what happens, my conclusion is that they ruined the role model Captain America. It may very well be a reflection of society, who loves the brash and contentious Donald Trump but indicted Mitt Romney as being too perfect. Is a traditional, rule abiding, good old American values Captain America no longer appealing to the masses? It appears so, according to Hollywood.

They introduced plot lines that didn't go anywhere (and some were missed opportunities to build out further) and new characters that left you wondering why they were put in in the first place. While you always have to go into these movies with a very hearty suspension of disbelief, there is a lot you have to let go of. You wonder why certain characters were whipping up on others, or why immortal ones weren't wiping out mere humans. While I went into the movie for pure mentally unplugged enjoyment, it was hard to ignore some things.

So go into the movie deciding you won't pay attention to what you know about the characters, and try to let the movie take you on the journey the story is trying to tell you. Ignore inconsistencies, don't think too much about it, and watch a movie full of really cool Marvel characters all interacting with each other.",5
19 May 2016,"I am impressed! Also, I am now a fan of the Winter Soldier!","I'm impressed. Not just with the action and stuff but the political message, too. I am really glad they're keeping Cap true to his character. All the characters seem to be their own selves rather than turning into a background ensemble. I like. Also: I was not really a fan of the Winter Soldier character before, but NOW he reminds me strongly of the protagonist of my Punch series (both the Winter Soldier, who is referred to as Manchurian Candidate at one point in this movie, and the protagonist of my Punch series are based on Cold War era fears about North Korean mind control experiments on American POWs. This is a topic dear to my heart because of my father's service in that war.)

7 June 2016,Movie,"This movie was a triumph. It had everything that a great action movie needs to be great and it was great. The acting was on point the 3D was on point the whole movie was on point. Chris Evens truly nailed his role he was funny in every way. This movie was not as great as Deadpool but it was very close. I was on team Iron Man because Iron Man is great.

Parents this movie has a lot of brutal action sequences in it so if you don't want your kids to be exposed to that yet don't take them to see this even though it is plain out amazing film. The movie was non stop herotastic in every shape and form if you want a great action flick then this is the perfect movie to go see.

Now go get your popcorn and enjoy

6 May 2016,Spineless,"Here, as I believe this film just came out from the room. Just the fact that the film is part of the saga Catain America and not that of the Avengers made me turn up their nose (although the sequel ""The soldier in winter"" is more pleasant of the first chapter). This film has many flaws, the biggest is to have had the presumption to be able to handle so many superheroes in a minimum span of time searching for the inner self-destruction with a ""civil war"" is not a war. They're just beating and even cursory: the action scenes are fast and often you can not perceive the movements. Missing irony who had the Avengers, there are plenty of downtime and many scenes end in themselves. Not to mention the internal plot and the pseudo-villain who is the setting for a movie without a foundation. Bunch of heroes and superheroes that make you smile all together, but they can not keep afloat a movie too pretentious.

15 March 2018,Best of Mcu with Iron Man,"Best film in MCU since Iron Man. Everything happened in the franchise culminated here. Both Winter Soldier arc and Iron Man's arc started from Iron Man 3 are properly implemented along with the Accords. The actual stakes to all the actions and the moral and ethical conundrums are explored, all the while making it personal and emotional for each character.

23 May 2016,"Filler, it's all just filler","The best part about this movie was starring at the actors and seeing fresh new characters like Spiderman ""Thank the Hollywood gods that they have finally gotten rid of Tobey Maguire"" and Antman. I haven't watched Antman yet but after seeing this I think I might have to see what I'm missing. I hated Tony Stark/ Iron Man in this film but I guess that was the point. I loved Hawkeye/Jeremy Renner and Chris Evans. I didn't pay too much attention to the special effects so I can't comment on them too much like other critics can but the plot was a little boring and didn't seem like it could stand alone to well. It reminded me of the boring scenes that you fast forward to get to the end of a series so that can't be good news.

14 May 2016,Definite enjoyable piece of work,"This is one of the Marvel's good movies. But it lacks in some points. As usual we are expecting a huge action and a deadliest villain entry, but this time seems Marvel has failed to bring a great villain. Just like Loki & Altron this character seems like not that great. If you thing of joining a side of the two team I mean team Cap or team Tony Stark then you must be amazed by your decision but after watching the movie. Every character has played their specialty in this movie.

Sometimes except starting felt little boring but some immediate action makes thrill & shout you loudly. The new entry of Spidy & Black Panther definitely played their specialty. Falcon has seriously well equipped. I loved the drones used by Falcon. But the action in the Airport & last few minutes make you say waoo.

29 April 2016,A Marvel Masterpiece In Full Action,"I enjoyed this spectacular and flawless movie 100%. The storyline is absolutely 1st class which flowed perfectly like a powerful and majestic waterfall. I loved how all the superheroes played an important role in this 4 star film especially Iron Man and Captain America. The directors, producers and of course the actors, all deserve full credit in making this legendary masterpiece. Seriously, one does not view original classics like these anymore. I am looking forward into digesting and savoring this magnificent movie once again and I hope to see another one like this. Excellent Job. My compliments to the chefs and Stan Lee.

12 April 2020,Very entertaining (if shallow) movie,"Entertaining from start to finish, filled with good and sometimes great action, and probably way too many fanservice (the entire airport scene), this movie doesn't get to the Winter Soldier level, but it tries to stay as close as possible.

The use of the humor is satisfactory, put in the right places without destroying characters or moments for cheap laughs. It also deals very well with even more characters than The Avengers, letting (almost) all of them to be important to the plot one way or the other.

In the end, maybe character motivations and themes aren't as coherent as it seems if you think too much about it, but still, as a comic book movie, the only really important sin is having a very bad villain (almost unnecessary, really). Other than that, pretty good.

9 November 2016,Best friend or foe marvel movie ever,"I was so excited to see civil war ever since I saw the trailer. At first when I saw the trailer, I thought it was just captain trying to protect The winter soldier,but a lot more came than unexpected and I was very impressed. When I saw the trailer,I thought it was just explaining that captain is a dangerous man and that he should surrender to the government and that he finds Buck and then,out of nowhere,Iron man comes along,but he is involved with the government and he tries to turn both of them in. Then I saw the end of the trailer and my god cap and buck against iron man. When I saw that I was like I thought they were friends and now they're ganging up against him. That last part was intense. Now that was the trailer. When I saw the movie,it was explaining that the avengers are dangerous and that they should surrender to the government,but cap and a few of his friends didn't agree. Those who didn't agree went against iron man and his team. And the rest contains spoilers but when I saw it I was thrilled when isaw new avenger members such as spiderman antman and black panther. What an amazing movie and number 1 of marvel forever

4 May 2016,Marvel steps up their game with Captain America: Civil War.,"Captain America: Civil War is the 13th feature film from Marvel studios and their universe. It is a sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier, directed by the Russo Brothers, and is once again back to helm this one. It basically stars all of the Avengers, so this is a stack cast for a Captain America movie. It is written by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, whom of which wrote the first Captain America movie & The Winter Soldier as well.

So let me start by saying that I LOVED this film. I've seen it twice and it honestly got better the second time around. Is it a masterpiece? No. But it was near. The Russo Brothers NAILED IT once again. I consider Captain America: The Winter Soldier the best MCU film, and they managed to top it. The way they handled the characters, the story & the action was so well-done. Each scene of this film has a sense of effort and execution, and all that credit goes to the Russo Brothers. They've done a MARVELOUS job.

The story is very complex and has a lot of elements into it. These elements of which are interconnected in order for the movie to move along. The story also touches into many different themes/subject matters and I really liked that. For a film like this, that has a lot plot points and themes, an individual could easily be confused. I wasn't. Though to be honest, the first time I watched it, I was lost a few times, but all that are resolved when I watched again. The film does get busy because of it's story, but it doesn't get out of control. It's not messy. It's not tight and cohesive as THE WINTER SOLDIER, but the film still is structured well. What I loved about the story is that it's very personal. It's a character study between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. They're the centerpiece of this movie. This has been building up from the start, and to see it pay off here was an absolute blast.

All of the performances are GREAT. The original cast are better than ever, which is not a surprise. So let's talk about the new ones. BLACK PANTHER is MAGNIFICENT. Chadwick Boseman did a good job as this newly introduced character. Looking forward for his standalone film. SPIDER-MAN is AWESOME. He was so handled well. I didn't feel he was just shoehorned in. Pretty damn excited for his new movie. Tom Holland IS Spider-Man. Paul Rudd as ANT-MAN is just so perfect. From his standalone film, I was really excited to see him interact with the other Avengers and it didn't disappoint. Robert Downey Jr. as IRON MAN gave such a powerful performance here, so powerful. Basically everyone was in their A-game.

I was BLOWN AWAY by the action, it has the best action pieces in an MCU movie yet. The action was gripping, powerful, & emotional. Speaking of those things, the film was poignant but at the same time funny as well. The film was very well BALANCED. Whether it's balancing the tone, balancing the story, all of it which are balanced.

I didn't mind the villain. I understood his character. He had motives into why he was doing all his actions. Although his not a very fleshed out character. He was just there for the sake of the story. He was basically a functional villain that was used to move the story. He's not the worst, but he's certainly not one of the great things about the movie. The character was clever and low-key, and I liked that, I just needed to know more about him. Daniel Bruhl's performance was fine. I dug the soundtrack of The Winter Soldier, but this one just disappointed me. It's not TERRIBLE, but I was just expecting MORE from Henry Jackman.

Final say: With breathtaking action, complex and balanced story, CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is a superhero film that's ABSOLUTELY entertaining, and at the same time has the gravitas and depth to the story and it's characters. You understand certain motives, you understand the conflicts, you understand both sides. This is not only a GREAT TIME of a movie, it has qualities that is pretty rare in these kind of movies.",9
27 April 2016,"Mind Blowing action package, perfect in many ways","This is absolutely the best Marvel movie so far, or even the best superhero movie ever made. The story was so perfect with outstanding performance from the actors and actress. Joe and Anthony gave a new perspective for those who think superhero movie is only about action. The story of this movie was also strong, and the conflict that was made is so real and natural. Remarkable. You think you see it too much already from trailer? You're wrong. There are still so many surprise hidden on this movie. Perfect action, perfect story, perfect conflict, perfect in many ways! Marvel is unstoppable. Thank you Joe and Anthony Russo, infinity war is in good hands.

27 May 2019,Action Packed Movie,"Fun, action packed, iconic, and overall amazing, Captain America: Civil War is probably one of the most deep movies the MCU has ever made, as it highlights how a successful team full of very different people can have internal conflicts that we have seen earlier in previous movies. All in all, loved the movie.

14 April 2016,Fight Scenes were the only thing is worth watching,"Very disappointed. Look at the marvel fans. they hate BvS cause the story is too big some of them said there's no stories at all. well news flash. Civil war too. Ugh! Its going to be box office hit because of the fight scenes. But i was surprised by black widow. She's a bad ass. They developed her character more. But that's it. The plot twist was very predictable. Meh. Winter Soldier was still the best marvel movie for me. and i think it will only be a best marvel movie. Sometimes i'm wondering why the avengers movies is very disappointing movie. Solo movies was much better. Ugh! They should change their tone. its not fun anymore. its getting cheesier every time. Jokes while it in the field is very dumb and cheesy. 6/10

8 May 2016,"Lots of smaller, thoughtful moments and a focused plot make ""Civil War"" the hero-heavy blockbuster ""Avengers 2"" should've been","Welcome to Phase III of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where the solo superhero films get an ""Avengers""-sized cast and even Spider-Man can swing out of the clutches of Sony Pictures and into a Marvel Studios movie. In other words, you'd need a lot of action figures to recreate ""Captain America: Civil War,"" but you'd also need to do more than just smack them into each other; Marvel's latest is ambitious, but it makes sense and succeeds in ways beyond pure spectacle.

The same couldn't be said of ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" a film that ""Civil War"" kind of pardons by virtue of coming out just a year later and being better. Although both films demonstrate what made 2012's ""The Avengers"" a success — an understanding of the importance of humor and character-driven moments in between giant action sequences — ""Civil War"" has a more intriguing premise and more cohesive plot, even if you need to have seen both ""Avengers"" films and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" to truly get behind it.

""Civil War"" has the potential to be a beautiful disaster. Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) are at the core of this disagreement over whether the Avengers should be held accountable to the United Nations after all the destruction their ""avenging"" has caused, but Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and even newcomers Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) all take sides for various reasons. That's a dozen superheroes to manage in one film  but who's counting?

Directors Joe and Anthony Russo do a pretty incredible job considering all the super- stallions in their stable. They devote the time needed to make it clear where each character is coming from, albeit some better than others. Credit also to writing duo Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who have been with the ""Captain America"" films since the beginning, each of them completely different than the other but all very good.

The key is that ""Civil War"" never loses sight of what drives these characters, even when that motivation is spotty. If we're going to believe these heroes will fight each other, the reason better be very good, and the reason it's good is actually kind of surprising.

After years of superhero films in which the aftermath of the destruction caused by these big building-demolishing grand finales has been overlooked, ""Civil War"" gets personal and looks at the loss of innocent life caused by this devastation. It adds a powerful human touch to this massive-scale story. Yes, the heroes duke it out at a German airport way longer than they should, quipping back and forth way longer than they should, but there's a lot of one-on-one scenes that don't involve throwing punches that balance it all out.

And that's not to take away from the action. Although some of the sequences toward the beginning feel a bit blurry (and that's in standard definition, not 3D), the Russos make every moment of action count and really think about the characters involved in each action shot. The creativity, staging and thrill factor are extremely strong as they were in ""Winter Soldier,"" plus the violence is grittier and more palpable for a PG-13. It's clear that the future ""Avenger"" films, which they will direct, are in capable hands.

While the novelty of seeing several superheroes in one film has worn off a bit, even this time with them fighting each other, characters like Black Panther and Spider-Man make a difference in giving some of that novelty back. Marvel has done well introducing characters in smaller films before bringing them together, but here we see the value in doing the opposite. The fresh dynamic between Downey Jr. and Holland, for example, turns out to be a highlight of the film and will get even the most exhausted Spider-Man fans excited to see what Sony and Marvel Studios do with this younger Peter Parker next. And Black Panther gets a surprisingly effective story arch in this movie that bodes well for his upcoming solo adventure.

Reining in the chaos is the crowning achievement of ""Civil War,"" and the secret proves to be finding the small moments to put in check the gigantic stature of the film. It also helps that these smaller moments all connect to the core moral conflict of the film; we aren't following disparate story lines. Everything serves or can be tied back to the core concept of how autonomous superheroes should be allowed to be, which really ties into why these heroes do what they do, a hugely important question that gives so much credence to this movie and, in a way, the entire Marvel Studios mission.

Dozens of films and almost a decade in, it's incredible to watch Marvel continually deliver. If they use the blueprint of ""Civil War"" as a model for building this third phase of movies, there's no reason they won't continue to make film after satisfying film.

1 May 2016,A solid production of an already solid cinematic universe,"Civil War certainly presents a conflict, and it presents it in a MARVELous way.

The third entry in the Captain America trilogy, Civil War gives the audience what they hope to see in an already known universe. It definitely is a worthy sequel, and it is bound to engage the audience throughout the majority of its duration.

Taking on a more mature tone than what the MCU is known for, Civil War delivers an intriguing story that is told coherently and lets almost nothing escape its grasp. It tackles the criticism people have come to raise for the MCU and does not disappoint in that sense: a more adult-like narrative leaving out unnecessary humor.

As it is to be expected from the name, there is a fight, a conflict, and a clash of ideals that set in motion a series of action sequences that could arguably be the best in the franchise so far, though it does seem to overuse some camera techniques that have become popular in the last decade; can you guess what I am talking about? You probably can. Other than that, the action is nothing short of awesome.

The story is one of the highlight of the films, making you question whether there is a right or wrong answer in the characters' decisions, which is something fans of the franchise can appreciate. It is well told and the editing is distinguishable. However, I must say that some of the characters' motivations felt seriously forced, which makes me think that a few more minutes of running time and some adjusting in the writing could have been a boost on an already great production. Some of the dialogue could have had some tweaking as well.

Although the action sequences are also a highlight of the film, especially the airport scene which I believe no one can deny was great, I feel the excessive use of the shaky-cam also makes them seem artificial, but overall, I would assert they are a step up from previous films of the MCU. The CGI could have received some polish, but it was decent even it its worst parts, and the musical score was forgettable, standing perhaps as one of the worst parts of the film. The pace of the film is also admirable, leaving almost no moment untouched by its robust storytelling.

Acting was a mixed bag; Downey Jr. does a wonderful job as Tony Stark as always, as do some of the new additions to the MCU, but the rest of the cast did not really stand out, and in fact, some of the characters' accents sounded a little too fake to not notice.

Despite some of its flaws, Civil War stands out as one of the best of the MCU. It just is.

Recommendable? Go watch it now!",8
26 May 2016,Captain America Civil War (2016):,"Captain America Civil War (2016) : Well almost all superhero movies deal with some super villain trying to conquer world and our heroes stop them.Those movies only depend on VFX but no plot.But some superhero movies break these stereotypes by making different attempt. For example Batman series by Nolan and Captain America Winter Soldier.Winter soldier is kind of a political thriller than superhuman. So I eagerly waited for Civil War as its Cap Vs Iron Man war. Plot: With many people fearing the actions of super heroes, the government decides to push for the Hero Registration Act, a law that limits a hero's actions. This results in a division in The Avengers. Iron Man stands with this Act, claiming that their actions must be kept in check otherwise cities will continue to be destroyed, but Captain America feels that saving the world is daring enough and that they cannot rely on the government to protect the world. This escalates into an all- out war between Team Iron Man (Iron Man, Black Panther, Vision, Black Widow, War Machine, and Spiderman) and Team Captain America (Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Falcon, Sharon Carter, Scarlett Witch, Hawkeye, and Ant Man) while a new villain emerges. Plus Points: 1)Story: Well this movie do not have any super powered Villain but it deals with ego conflicts between our own Avengers.When Iron man accepts the new Act and Captain disapproves it,there starts a war.We cant chose a particular side among them because they all sound right.Both the teams intentions are good. 2)Screenplay: As I said it has good screenplay which can keep us glued to screen with new twists and hero entries.The way they introduced Spidey and Ant Man are awesome.If you are just an action lover you may enjoy only those but if you are a true movie buff you will love it. 3)Action scenes and VFX: They are just spectacular with brilliant VFX .The chase between Captain America,Winter Soldier and Black Panther in first half and the fight scene between both teams in second half are marvelous.Even the blend of humor is a huge asset for this movie. Spidey and Ant Man gave us great laughs. 4)Performances: Well as we are watching them in their roles in lot of movies we cannot describe their ability again.But Spiderman got a new actor Holland but his look should be maintained well. Minus Points: 1)Duration: Movie's duration is 2hr 30min long so some may feel bored and to those who hate more conversation and less action movies they may not like this movie much. So Civil War is another perfect superhero movie just like its predecessor Winter Soldier. My rating 8/10",8
25 September 2016,Grand adventure slash battle royale,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe continues strong with this one. The events of the second Avengers movie, combined with the events of the second Captain America movie, continue to take their toll. The Avengers have become the supreme force on Earth through the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. and their victory over Ultron. But supreme force demands supreme resistance and thus the Avengers have to ask themselves: is their very existence begetting more problems than they can solve and if so, should they be held responsible for it.

Captain America has become the central icon of Marvel movies, perhaps even more so than Iron Man and this is shown in his movies. This could easily be called Avengers 2.5: Civil War. It has almost all of the characters, it moves the universe forwards and its themes will echo throughout all the movies that come after it. Things change with this film, nothing will be the same.

And it's simply a good action movie on its own. The cast is still absolutely fantastic, especially Chris Evans as Steve Rogers and Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. Every scene the two of them are in is some of the finest character acting I've seen in a while. Especially because they have such heave themes to discuss. And while the movie itself leans slightly towards Cap's position, it makes Tony's point of view painfully clear and relatable. People should be held accountable, power requires oversight and the strongest should lead the way for everyone. It's just a matter of how they go about realizing these ideals that set these two apart.

Furthermore, the new and returning lesser characters are both very good, especially Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. I can't wait for his stand-alone film, having seen this! And, as always, the action scenes are phenomenal, the production values are as perfect as they can get, the humour works and it's just an all-around good movie.

If I had to nitpick, I'd say that it perhaps a bit grim for my tastes. It has humour, certainly, but the storyline itself is pretty bleak and the ending especially will divide opinions. Personally I can say that I respect its ambition and scope more than I actually like it. Let's just say that we're pretty far from the days of The Avengers and it's light-heartedness, and leave it at that.

Still, definitely a film worth seeing for all fans of Marvel. They haven't dropped the ball yet.",8

20 September 2016,I can't believe...but I slept,"I was really excited to see this one after the winter soldier...turned out I was really let down.

I think it is a common issue with Captain America movies - story lines are way too long... Avengers for example are to the point...I didn't like the directing, I felt the fights were way too much choreographed, I couldn't see any glimpse of response from the adversaries... in a way it seem the director tried to promote ""parkour"" more than anything. The so publicized airport scene, had me sleeping... really the sound of the blows seemed that they were not even touching each other...Giant Ant?!! The panther probably the only fresh thing... any way this movie was made with the purpose to entertain... entertains little, tires quite a lot...

1 May 2019,Another sad adaptation in the name of glorious comic.,"Why use the name of a famous comic if They seeks to do a radical different thing?.

The true ""Civil war"" comics have several important events that never come to happen in this movie. Starting with the nuke explosion caused by masked vigilante at the city residential area, the betrayal of S.H.I.E.L.D. to Captain America, the super hero battle that ends in The Giant Man's death by the hands of Thor's clone, created by Reed Richards and Tony Stark, and many other things because I should say this no Civil war but something else.

6 August 2020,Captain America: Civil War,"Captain America: Civil War, directed by The Russo Brothers, had some BIG shoes to fill after The Winter Soldier, and they absolutely exceeded expectations, pushing the MCU films to new heights! Undoubtedly, Civil War is a huge fan service film, but that doesn't discourage the fact that this film is one of the best of the saga, thus far, having so many relatable themes, and memorable scenes. The Russo Brothers set this intriguing, serious tone for the majority of the film, creating amazing tension between the characters, while they interwove their brilliantly written humor. The Russo Brothers do such a great job keeping the continuity going from The Winter Soldier and The First Avenger, while also tying into the saga beautifully, setting up some great exposition. One of my main issues I have with Civil War; Not that there is so much going on, but the way they structured and balanced the scenes. The way the scenes were set, it didn't make the sequences feel as cohesive as they could've, with some plots becoming underdeveloped.

Even though this is a story-driven film, The Russo Brothers, Stephen McFeely & Christopher Markus allowed for countless, brilliant character moments, allowing each character to shine, and get a little more depth. Every character's motive is understood and fleshed out well, because of the good writting, and the set up films prior, giving every character a few more layers. The only issue I had with the characters, is that the creative team set themselves for some balancing issues, strictly due to the additions of a couple of cameo characters, but they made the absolute best of it. With this being a Captain America film, you know he's going to have a lot on his plate, and the writers and Chris Evans handled and balanced everything great! His character was the main focus, being really well written, expanding on his genuine bond with the team, and reaching a new level of ""banter"" with Tony Stark. His argument was described so well, where you can whole heartily get behind him, and completely back him up. Tony Stark runs the same lines. His character was another main focus, being well written, and having the best character arch of the film. Robert Downey Jr. nails his role once again, being a stand-out, in someone else's movie. Tom Holland ABSOLUTELY CRUSHES his role as Peter Parker/Spider-Man! This is such a fresh take on his character, being nailed to a T! Tom Holland seemed to get almost all of the best lines, stealing every single scene he's in! Holland brings an extreme likability to the character, and I can't wait for his solo film! Chadwick Boseman also gets introduced into the MCU, as the Black Panther, and he is another stand-out of this film! His character is also well written, having a nice character arch, being one of those characters you can instantly care for. Boseman puts on a great performance, proving he belongs in the MCU! We get one of the most highly anticipated characters, make his return, in Paul Rudd as Ant Man. He doesn't have much to do, but he makes the most out of all of his screen time! Scarlett Johansson returns as Black Widow, and returns as one of the most grounded of the character bunch. Her character gets a little more importance here, but she doesn't have that much characterization. Elizabeth Olsen favorably returns as Wanda Witch, having one of the best potentials coming into the film. McFeely and Markus tried to give her some importance, but her character was sadly sidelined, compared to everyone else. Paul Bettany runs the same lines as Wanda, getting a little more to do, but I needed more from the both of them. Sebastian Stan, Don Cheadle, and Anthony Mackie all return as their respected characters. They all had their minimal time to shine, but they were just left in the background, for the most part. Helmut Zemo is in the top three for most controversial villains of the MCU. I believed that Zemo had a purpose in this film, being a subtle villain, but if they were to scratch his character, the narrative wouldn't really change all that much, if anything, it would probably tighten up the narrative.

The screenplay by Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus, shines in most aspects, but they could've trimmed down some things, and gave it to the characters that needed that extra time to develop. If they did that, and maybe added another decent risk, or two, this film would be close to flawless.

With the action being handled by The Russo Brothers, you know it's going to be a hit, but this was a grandslam! They incorporated so many great shots, with the right amount of shaky cam, being one of the most notable films for the action. The Russo Brothers always know how to bring tention during these action sequences, and it was handled extremely well.

Overall, Captain America: Civil War, is probably my second favorite MCU film, and I think it's more than fair to say that this is a film that belongs at the top of the list",8
29 April 2016,It's a really good movie,"I need to be honest, this movie will make you change your mind all the time. Is Steve right? Do we need to have a record of all the super- humans in existence in this planet? Most of the time I had to remember he reasons that made me choose the side I was supporting, but since the movie is VERY different that the comic it was hard for me to take a desicion based only in the movie(s). The conflict is real, I felt that whatever they decide it was going to directly affect me. The only bad thing about the movie was the unnesesary villain, that actually helped to have a bigger issue than super-heroes out-of-control but his part was awfully shown. But the move was really good.

17 March 2018,Hhfhjvfh,"Oh yeah, this one is still as good as I remember. Now that I've seen this again I'll give Thor part three a rewatch and I should be good to go for Black Panther. I am soooooo behind on my must watch list. So behind in fact that I deleted my must watch list and unsubscribed from ScreenJunkies. So yeah, from here on out as far as 2018 films are considered I'll just be headhunting for large pop culture fuzz. So I guess that leaves Marvel films and a few others? Oh, I hate what they are doing with the new Star Wars universe but the Solo movie looks good. But that Game of Thrones chick is in it so needless to say I will be skipping it on principle alone. That reminds me, Civil War is awesome. 9 out of 10.

31 May 2016,"Not bad, but not as good as some are saying.","This movie was really more of the same. That isn't a bad thing, but it is starting to wear thin.

What I didn't like:

As a comic book lover, it was a serious miss-interpretation of the Civil War text. It had very little to do with the comic book tale.

It was more of an Iron Man movie than a Captain America movie. It revolved around Iron Man having a horrible day, and Cap being a bystander in his own movie.

What I liked:

I liked the fact that in this movie we see more character development of Ant-Man and Hawkeye two characters that are not very well represented in the MCU yet.

Black Panther was spot on from the character that I knew from the comic books of old.

I appreciated the tie in to Agent Carter.",6
8 May 2016,The Avengers 3.0,"We are in an era when MCU (Marvel Comic Universe) productions become a tentpole staple one finds rather too big to ignore on the radar, once or twice a year, there is impending danger of being ad nauseam. Re-reading my extolling review of CAPTAIN American: THE WINTER SOLIDER (2014), I am trying to figure out why the thrill has faded quite a lot this time.

There is no shame to admit that the action-packed superheroes scuffle set pieces are the highlight, as in two THE AVENGERS, in fact the movie should be renamed as THE AVENGERS 3, which could take a more impartial stand in the internecine war. Maybe one shouldn't call it war, there is disagreement, but not so serious, which makes the two teams' group fighting look more than a grandstanding drill, every and each one is too valuable to kill off (since they have an entire future universe to plan), even the sidekicks, War Machine is the closest one to be dispatched, right, Don Cheadle still needs the big cheque to finance his personal projects like MILES AHEAD (2015), his director debut biography about Miles Davis. This ""play house"" frivolity becomes the hot-bed for bathos (Vision is unfortunately underused for his puissance, in order not to cause casualties, he even has to accidentally undermine his own teammate), that's why by comparison DC's BATMAN v SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE (2016), self-serious as it is, still eclipses this one in its narrative coherence and dialectics. If the script could reveal the key twist earlier, which would give a perfect personal excuse for a more substantial battle pathos (Bucky Barnes could be a ruthless killing machine, right?), which only fleetingly takes place in the small-scale finale, so, this is Marvel's tenor, (notably antagonises DC Comic's darkness and solemnity) - why so serious?

Paul Rudd's Ant-Man and Tom Holland's young Spidey are competent comic relief, the former's low self-esteem can be perpetually milked to induce laughters and the latter's garrulousness as a rookie superhero can only be matched by the rogue iconoclast DEALPOOL (2016). Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther is introduced to ensure a more politically correct leaning (the first one born in Africa), so what's next? Asian or Latin American? Or an LGBT addition couldn't be more exigent.

Action scenes are sleek, often in close-range which causes some hand-held ricketiness, the indelible ones are Bucky's motorcycle hijacking stunt and Captain America's bulging biceps when holding a helicopter single-handedly. The ordinary human background of Zemo (Brühl) gives his motivation a more visceral arc, but as most villains in the franchise, the chance to consummate their scheme is largely stacked with random happenings other than meticulous plotting (why on earth the script would allow an imposer of an interrogator infiltrates the faculty so easily, as if no one there has ever met the original interrogator?).

A lethargy has been officially reached after this chapter, for me, at least, one needs more time to overcome it, sadly there is no stopping of it, next instalment is THOR: RAGNAROK (2017), which might explain to us the reason of Thor and Hulk's jarring absence in the fracas on earth, where is apparently too small and crowded for super-humans, deities and monsters, preparing for the next round!",6
24 July 2016,"It could have been better, but still a well executed Marvel film","""CA: Civil War"" is an important step in super hero movies, because as known, it deals with some moral themes, asking some moral questions, it focuses on the destruction and mayhem in the cities by heroes. Therefore, it is an emotional movie also which is nice. Despite the movie is called ""civil war"", this is not exactly a war, a mini battle between the allies. This feels like an epic film, but unfortunately it is not. The best action part of the film comes at this point: the famous airport scene! It could have been much better, but still great! Recently, some super hero movies have started to inspire from ""Empire Strikes Back"" and this movie is one of them. It tries to be dark and epic like ""ESB"". Crossbones was a disappointment as a cameo, the other villain is pretty interesting though. The opening sequence of the movie which recalls ""Expendables"" movies are fun, but no more than that. The meetings among the heroes to discuss the subjects are key points of the film and very interesting to listen, but it could have been deeper, darker and longer. There is a few moments of an avenger in the middle of the movie and it is pretty touching indeed, Russo Brothers can touch your heart which is a plus, but again, the movie could have been much more touching and also intense. Black Panther is perfect! He is the star of the movie like Bucky in ""The Winter Soldier."" The chase scene is one of the bests in Marvel history. The shoots are jaw dropping! The battle between Cap and Stark which is the main focus of the story is fairly done and technically masterful, but it feels rushed. It is not brilliant or unforgettable, but touching and impressive! Iron Man is not too powerful in this movie which is an improvement (realistic) By the way, I was very impressed by the strong friendship between Steve and Bucky. ""Civil War"" is not epic or action packed, but it is very good. Spider- Man here is hilarious here and it is not a disappointment. I just didn't like his new ""camera"" eyes. Also, I don't like these frequent casting changes, but every new change means a new chance. As for Aunt May, a bold choice, but it was OK. All the other heroes do their part without question. For War Machine, I prefer Terrence Howard, but Cheadle is OK, too. Black Panther is cool, but too assertive and too self confident, but the character was extremely impressive. ""Captain America: Civil War"" is a very good and strong super hero movie, but it could have been better. I prefer ""The Winter Soldier"" over ""Civil War.""",8
7 May 2016,Best from MCU!!!!,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",10

7 May 2016,All hail Cap!,"In just a word it was the best movie in the captain America trio, but the sense of humour in the movie was a bit awful...

I mean to say, the UN how can blame Avengers for dying of innocents, during their fights?

Every one knows with whosoever with the Avengers are fighting, no one in the world can, if the Avengers won't save them there would be much more causalities, is it not good if they get save a fraction?

I accept that they let Ultron destroy sokovia, but if they have not took an action everything might have end..

so there's a bit sense lacking that such a big organisation like UN would actually not do, blaming Avengers, instead of seeing what they have done for all.

I'm with Cap.

All hail Cap!

Got really amazed at the end when it came to know that bucky killed Howard and Maria Stark, and it was the only sense part of the movie for Tony getting angry and beating Buck.

But overall the movie lacked sense, they prisoned the mighty heroes who saved the world.",9

6 May 2016,"Its definitely a war! From the height of action, to the low of death.","I went in with an open mind considering how many avengers/captain Americas i have watched and they have all been similar. This one finally got me sitting up for the whole length of the movie.

Its exactly as titled. Civil War has everything from the good, the bad and you can bet the most ugly. No punches were held back and did everyone get punched more than once.

Just like in war innocent people were killed and running with this and vengeance is the baseline of the movie. RDJ again playing iron man so perfectly no one else could fill this guys position. Along with the huge cast of super heroes all coming into one.

I wont spoil it and tell you who exactly, although it wouldn't be hard to find out. But do your self a favor don't ruin the movie, watch it before you read spoilers.

Overall i do give another 8 out of 10 but its totally deserved. Finally an Avenger movie that feels like a decent thought out movie rather than the standard superhero time line.",8

10 May 2016,"Awesome visuals, acting, and script yet, no good villain (NO SPOILERS)","Characters: The movie shines with really great acting and decent character development considering having many of them. The greatest and most exciting characters are definitely the new comers, Black Panther and Spider-Man. You can see the effort done for portraying both of these characters.

Visuals and fight scenes: GREATEST FIGHT SCENES EVER. It definitely beats those in The Winter Soldier and those were PLAIN AWESOMENESS. Every fight scene with Black Panther is especially captivating.

Humor: So easy and funny and was very helpful to lighten up the tone of the movie. Spider-Man and Ant-Man are the funniest and you'd expect that. Ant-Man probably had the least scenes in the movie but managed to get many laughs out of me with every line.

Plot: Now that's the reason I deducted a point. Civil war is a powerful comic book in terms of story and the movie version didn't live up to that in my opinion. Also, The villain is so poorly written and his scheme is so lame. I couldn't help to think that Cap is more of a villain than him actually :D

Music: Simply not as nearly epic as the movie.

Finally: This is definitely the best Marvel Movie ever and I think if they had paid more attention to the story and villain it would have beaten The Dark Knight in becoming the best comic book movie ever.",9

25 May 2016,Extremely Underwhelming (6/10),"I was really underwhelmed by this movie.

I have to disagree with the popular opinion. I was so stoked for this one, especially because The Winter Soldier is my second most favourite Marvel film after Iron Man, but I was left disappointed.

Spoilers up ahead!

Firstly, let's make something clear, it really wasn't a WAR. For 85% of the length of the film, it was a disagreement. And when we finally see the big twist happen, it still wasn't a war, because there were just 3 people fighting. I wanted every hero to be at each other's throat, but sadly that wasn't the case.

At the end of the movie, I was indifferent about which side to choose, because both were almost equally wrong. Iron Man's motivations for signing the accords didn't make sense. I mean, since the last 8 years he has been killing people and watching them die, and suddenly he meets one woman which instantaneously changes his mind. Like seriously? He created Ultron and even that didn't change his thought process, but after meeting a black woman for 30 seconds in a secluded hallway did.

Cap even once didn't mention how Hydra crept up inside SHIELD, and that is the reason they shouldn't sign the accords. The political angle should have been more fleshed out and written more articulately. They just skimmed over most of the stuff.

The only real players in the disagreement (not War) were Iron Man, Cap, Bucky and Black Panther. If you think about it, the movie would have been the same if you take away all the other characters apart from these four.

Scarlet Witch annoyed the hell out of me. Why? She kept creeping up in the middle of the fights in the airport scene and throwing the members from Stark's team away. I couldn't enjoy a good hand-to-hand combat scene between any of the members because the annoying little witch had to meddle in every character's fight. Is it too much to ask for a good hand to hand combat scene like the one in Winter Soldier? Honestly, Scarlet Witch is a bit too powerful for the MCU, and she should have been the one to die in Age of Ultron. Her accent is even more off-putting in this one. Nothing against Olsen, it's not her fault her character was written this way.

I actually ended up really disliking Cap by the end of this movie. He saw Bucky straight up brutally killing Tony's parents, and still he doesn't show any sympathy for Stark. His motivations were selfish which were clouding his judgement. For the whole film, he doesn't seem to realise that his best friend is a threat to humanity. A simple code can activate his prey instincts.

The famous Airport scene that everyone was boasting about was also surprisingly underwhelming. For the first 2 minutes it was great to see some of my favourite superheroes fight each other, but it got boring pretty quickly. Why? Because there wasn't any tension. All of the characters apart from Black Panther were pulling their punches. It was a practice session than a real straight up fight. It really wasn't War. Black Widow had the time to make jokes in the middle of the fight too.

And yeah, the movie was really predictable. Apart from the final twist, the movie played out exactly the way I had thought it would. I knew there would be an underwater prison, I knew how Black Panther would become a part of the conflict, I knew that either Bucky would be framed or manipulated to attack a major international organisation because it was all shown in the effing trailers.

One thing universally agreed upon about this movie is that the villain was unnecessary and I concur. His plan was extremely complex and it played out the way it did only because the movie wanted to. But, for a change it was refreshing to see a human antagonist who uses his wit and intellect to defeat the heroes. He doesn't have a grandeur motive to destroy to world, and I really appreciated that. That still doesn't take away the face that he was inessential to the overall plot.

The things I liked: The final fight between Cap, Bucky and Iron Man was really good. That was the point when the movie became enjoyable for me because the the tension escalated to a whole new level. The look of anguish and sorrow on Tony's face was intense. Sadly, it was too little, too late.

I liked Black Panther. He's introduced as a straight up badass, and I liked that. His motives made sense. He was part of the conflict for personal reasons and had his own agenda and that's why his character was intriguing.

Spider Man was so awesome. I was waiting to see a Peter Parker who looked and behaved like he was in high school. So that was splendid.

Finally, it goes without saying but the actors have really grown into their roles over the course of several movies and each one of them give an amazing performance. Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans are just phenomenal in their portrayals. Even the new additions like Tom Holland and Chadwick Boseman are really good.

My final verdict would be a 2.75/5",7

It was funny, got you emotionally involved and Action Packed. Yes! the action is done brilliantly. The best I've ever seen in a comic book movie. Maybe one of the best in movies in general. This movie is not your average comic book good vs evil movie. It's much of a clash between ideologies which was really interesting to see. I also have to talk about how Spiderman was portrayed in this movie. I really liked him. As expected he was not the focus of the movie. However, he was not just a cameo either. The few scenes he was in the movie was enough to like him. If i have to point out flaws there is hardly any. Marvel is almost perfect. Almost. I do have one problem with the movie. It was the main villain. Like other marvel villain, this villain just didn't work for me. The movie would have done fine even without the villain. It feels like he was just there because ...he was just there!. But it's not a deal breaker people!! The story isn't about the villain. It's about Civil War. And you're gonna get it.. I can't recommend this movie enough. Believe me guys, the 1 star reviews are all from Marvel haters. They just can't accept the fact that Civil War was a great move. Most of those reviewers probably haven't even watched the movie. Ignore the haters and watch the movie. You won't be disapppointed.",9
17 May 2016,Marvel's Best Movie Yet | Review of 'Captain America: Civil War',"This film is without a doubt Marvel's best film yet. First, let's applaud the writers here because they took a story and adapted it as best as they could to tie it into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and they were able to do that without tarnishing the story. That right there is fantastic writing. That is spectacular writing and something Warner Bros. and DC could take a page from. This is one of the reason's Marvel movies are so popular because they bring to life a story and characters while keeping both of those faithful to the original creation. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. were perfect for their roles. Everyone was perfect for their roles. This is cast who not only understands their characters, but they also understand the character dynamics not just in the story but also regarding each other, and they are friends. Everyone here is friends with someone else, and it is believable not just because they are friends in real like but also because they have such great chemistry with one another. The foundation of the film is solid, and that is the key to a successful movie.

The story is a little convoluted but only because Zemo (played by Daniel Brühl), the villain, goes through very elaborate means to bring the Avengers to their knees. He makes them turn on one another, and it's very strategic, easy to follow, especially when all the elements are laid out for the audience by the end, but, again, it does come off just a little contrived. Despite that though it was still thought out. This evil plan was without any holes, it flows and kept the underlining tension afloat. Of course, the relationship between Bucky (Sebastian Stan) and Captain (Chris Evans) did that all by itself.

As mention above, the casting is fantastic. Civil War is full of talented actors who know the characters and how to bring them alive. However, Stan and Evans, their characters have such a long history and a remarkable brotherhood here, it's not just a bromance, they are family. These two characters, they capture that love, that intensity, and that friendship so powerfully, and for the trilogy, this element is what made this film spectacular. All the characters are intense, and as the tension rises, these friendships are put to the test. They are each fighting for what they believe in, and that is putting them all at odds. It's heartbreaking because the actors make it so. Yes, the writers did that in the screenplay, and yes, the director wanted that as well, but these actors were able to bring it all to life.

This is all great and perfect to make an incredible film, but Marvel is magnificent at incorporating comedy with seriousness. This isn't just another superhero action movie, but it's also not just a drama like some movies *cough* BvS *cough*. No, this film has perfectly woven exceptionally clever comedic into it that just make everything so entertaining. Paul Rudd and Tom Holland, in particular, were such great additions to the movie because they brought out the light moments within all the seriousness. Yes, so did the other characters, but these two were phenomenal.

Captain America: Civil War is the best Marvel movie (live-action) to date. Not only does it have an amazing story full of heart, but it also has great directors, great actors, and those two screenwriters, Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, deserve some massive praise here because they adapted it to perfection.

7 May 2016,One of the best marvel movies,"Civil war is just another peach from the Russo brothers .they've nailed it and have given exactly what the fans want . civil war will entertain every fan even those of DC .I feel very happy that infinity war is in good hands .Coming to the movie, all the superheroes have done a great job linking to the crisis they face and which side they choose and it is perfectly reasonable.Talking about the new additions, Tom Holland was apt for the Spiderman role and is just damn hilarious and same goes with characterisation of black panther ,he doesn't pop out and that's where the director makes it more cinematic. The stunts were great especially the airport fight deserves special applause even though it is more of a cliché but again the director makes it rollicking . And coming to Chris Evans ,I believe no one could ever impersonate Captain America better . he always gives us the good honest guy feel and does what he feels is right. On the whole civil war is an wonderful experience for any fan who loves superhero movies and who doesn't like it when two of the favourite heroes clash against each other when the film is made this good",10
7 June 2016,My second favorite Marvel movie so far.,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

6 May 2016,Just kinda fun... That's it.,"Honestly, Civil War is like a huge roller coaster that gets you super high and never has a big drop. Entertaining, yes, but annoyingly predictable, absurdly convenient and cheesy as hell. Annoying shaky cam, annoying one liners, annoying forced jokes amid fights and no high stakes. No depth. No emotional weight. Just loop after loop after loop. In the end, it was fun but not challenging. Seriously, at some points I was actually calling things before they happened. And at this point I thought they had learned to stop making it seem like something's gonna happen and then they back pedal from it, like they're not willing to take risks in the story to make you go ""wow, I can't believe they went there."" And in the end all kinda falls flat, like all the development and tense build up lead to nothing big. It's just a puddle they drag through for a while and then they come out at the other side conveniently squeaky clean. I can't get emotionally invested anymore in these marvel movies.

5 May 2016,A Brilliant script with ups and downs in the rhythm,"Besides The First ""The Avengers"" movie, the first two Captain America films have been the only Marvel movies that I really fully enjoyed, I also liked the Iron Man trilogy, but always left me the feeling that they could have been much better. Civil War is probably the most ambitious project in the Marvel Universe reuniting many of the best characters of the comic books in one film ,adapting one of the most interesting comic sagas of the last years. Civil War has many virtues but also many defects, its greatest virtue is its very good and intelligent script that has a surprising final twist at the end that resolves the plot perfectly, but I did't enjoy the narrative structure in which the script was executed, with abrupt changes of rhythm that decreases the pace of the story. The three acts of the film feels like if they were three different movies and the action sequences in the first act of the film were awfully shot, with crazy camera movements that don't allow to see what is happening on the screen and even they made me feel dizzy but fortunately in the second and third act this seems to get better and luckily the battle between the Main Characters was shot in a more decent way . The tone of the film in the first act and the third are different than in second, the first act and the third have a very serious tone but the second act changes drastically, with more humour and adding many of the lame jokes that marvel use to put in their productions that luckily were funnier than in other movies. The film also introduces new characters of the Marvel universe, Black Panther, looks amazing, although that with all those stupid camera movements in the action scenes you can't distinguish between a punch or a kick or whatever they are doing during the fights Emoticono tongue and also introduces to the new Spiderman, who as Spiderman looks pretty good but as Peter Parker I think they choose an extremely young actor and Marisa Tomei (an actress that I love) playing a hot an extremely young Aunt May did't convince me neither . Awful action sequences,, very fun and enjoyable battle between the heroes of the Marvel universe, Awesome Black Panther, Downey Jr being awesome, Spiderkid and the hottest Aunt May that you could ever imagine Emoticono tongue and an excellent script with ups and downs in the rhythm of the story but above all, one of the most enjoyable films in the Marvel cinematic universe",

18 May 2016,It was not that good,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS

Captain America Civil War didn't blow me away. It was a pity since I'd been so hyped up for it for nearly a year and... I don't know it just fell flat to me.

See the thing with these kinds of superhero vs superhero films is that the point of conflict has to be a gray area where no party is in the write or wrong. It draws in the viewer and keeps them invested. Though I really love captain America I just really found myself not really getting where he was coming from. I just felt like what iron man was doing reasonable and couldn't fathom why people even took cap's side.

And Wanda literally just set fire to an entire building and injured hundreds; why is everyone not regarding her as dangerous? And Bucky is dangerous!Trying to get them on their side was the worst idea ever.

The only saving grace for this movie was Black Panther and Spiderman. This film could be summed up in one sentence: Tony gets angry because Steve considers Bucky a better friend.",4

2 January 2018,Another strong Cap film. Bring on the Infinity War!,"'Captain America 3' is another great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This time, the film's basically 'Avengers 3', as it features almost every superhero we've seen so far, plus a few new ones. Natasha/Black Widow (Johansson) continues her close association with Steve/Captain America (Evans) - which worked really well in the last film - but Cap also has Sam/Falcon (Mackie) as his right-hand man too. The premise is quite simple: the ""Sokovia Accords"" (instead of the ""Superhuman Registration Act"" from the 2006 Mark Millar comics the film's based on) are new laws forced on the Avengers by Ross (Hurt), U.S. Secretary of State, as the U.N. wants to see the Avengers held accountable for their actions, since too many people died in (the fake country) Sokovia during the events of 'Avengers 2'. Tony/Iron Man (Downey Jr.) is all for it, but Cap is not.

Bucky/Winter Soldier (Stan) then becomes involved and a massive man-hunt ensues (the film goes to more countries than a Bond film!) and the Avengers are divided (into an even six vs six): Iron Man, Black Widow, Rhodes/War Machine (Cheadle), T'Challa/Black Panther (Boseman), Vision (Bettany) and Peter/Spider-Man (Holland) vs Cap, Falcon, Winter Soldier, Wanda/Scarlet Witch (Olsen), Clint/Hawkeye (Renner) and Scott/Ant-Man (Rudd). The fight, about two-thirds in with only the Hulk and Thor missing, is epic - definitely something everyone wants to see. Some great quips too (mostly thanks to Ant-Man and Spider-Man - would love to see that team-up film!), as there's no malevolence, just a group of superhero friends/acquaintances fighting for what (and who, as the film's definitely Captain America v Iron Man at it's heart) they think is right.

There could still be a little more done with Bucky's backstory - which kind of get mixed in with Iron Man's - but maybe I just need to re-watch 'Captain America 1' again, as it just seems like his & Cap's chemistry isn't quite there. Also needs to explore the Sharon Carter (VanCamp) storyline more. The introduction of Black Panther and Spider-Man is handled superbly, with Spider-Man only getting two scenes, but Holland nails them - the new Spider-Man films will be in good hands. And Boseman as Black Panther is fantastic, full of poise and just the right amount of anger - plus great fighting skills. Can't wait for his film in a few years.

I thought it was better than 'Avengers: Age of Ultron', but not quite as good as 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'. The ending probably dragged out a little and didn't quite resolve everything, with Zemo (Bruhl)'s plot not being as interesting as it could've been. Still, some great action, some decent ethical questions and some truly inventive fight scenes.",8
18 May 2016,More busy than exciting,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",5

6 May 2016,Marvel Does Not Disappoint,"No spoilers here either. The film was action packed from beginning to end. With a movie this good, it's hard to pick a side in this Civil War. Whether you're a fan of Cap or Stark, you will find plenty to enjoy in this movie. I was pleasantly surprised with the latest Spiderman and Marisa Tomei was perfectly cast in the small role of Aunt May. As always, there are moments of comic relief from The Avengers, especially Spidey and Ant-man.

Leave the younger kids at home though; lots of heavy action scenes and language inappropriate for the little ones who will beg to see it.

Bravo to Marvel for making this one of it's best offerings yet!

7 May 2016,"Well, my kid really liked it","Kind of interesting, we're just off Batman vs. Superman so we've seen two takes recently on the superhero vs superhero deal. As with most else, the DC movie was the less sophisticated of the two, I would have trouble telling you why Batman and Superman were fighting each other, there wasn't much that made sense in that one. I have two (no, three) problems with this one: 1) the fight CGI (UNLIKE The Avengers) was way too fast to follow, it just looks too hokey; 2) the movie was about 20 minutes too long, there's a fair amount of chaff to get through before the civil war; and 3) the plot was just a little too complicated. Oh, and 4) Vision is too powerful to be in this mix. On the plus side Spidey was done very well, the circumstances that lead to superhero vs. superhero were believable (if a tad complicated), and as usual Marvel is spot on in their casting of the new roles. So while I wasn't wildly cheering at the end as some in the audience were it was a pleasant if a little too lengthy watch.

2 May 2016,Captain America:Civil War its just another success by the Russo Brothers,"Ater so many movies from the Marvel franchise, Civil War was one of many films that every fan was expecting to watch, and finally its here, but the question is....Captain America:Civil War its good? No.

Captain America:Civil War its great!

This movie its great, its a perfect example of how a Superhero movie should be, its funny but at the same time, emotional and intense with a good story.

I'm not going to spoil anything so i'll be quick(...as possible)The introduction of characters like Black Panther its great, the characters are great,everyone have scenes where are show interesting and i never felt boring at all,that's because everyone have something to do in this movie( or at least most of the characters) or have an arc,specially Steve and Bucky. Almost every performance in this movie its good but the best for me its RDJ, i never saw so much emotions of Tony in just one movie and this isn't an Iron-Man movie.

The story is good, Zemo is fine, i have some relative problems with him but his plan its great and at least makes sense. The soundtrack its good and the choreography its great, better than The Winter Soldier in my opinion.

Even if its great, its not a perfect movie, it has some problems, Spider-Man is awesome but the use of Spider-Man was forced,almost every joke its great in this film, but suddenly there are more serious or mature scenes and then those scenes are interrupted by a joke scene, even in the War scene, and in some scenes that doesn't fit in the movie, other minor concerns are those annoying white text of the location or the final fight. But overall its a great movie and one of the best marvel movies if not the best, highly recommended if you want to watch something entertaining and very well done.

12 September 2016,Civil disobedience,"It's hard to believe that anyone would go and watch 'Captain America: Civil War' without actually knowing what it's about. And, in most cases, already seen the eight or so million previous films in the 'Marvel Shared Universe,' so I won't really go into a major recap – that what's Google is for! I'll just assume that you know about every superhero in great detail and tell you to watch this film.

Whereas the first 'Cap' film was more or less a period piece with a bit of sci-fi/fantasy thrown in, the second was a kind of 'Jason Bourne' clone (with a bit of sci-fi/fantasy thrown in). Now, we're treated to what, although is technically the third Captain America movie, it could be looked at as being more akin to a third Avengers movie, due to the amount of other superheroes are given screen time.

But, our 'Cap' is definitely the star. It's his team that trashes one major city too many in pursuit of a villain, meaning the powers that be decide superheroes need legislating. It's fair to say that Cap America disagrees, but not all of the Avengers to, hence the split in direction.

Perhaps the best part of the story is that the opposing viewpoint is headed up by (fan favourite) Tony (Robert Downey Jr) Stark, aka, Iron Man. You've probably seen the promotional posters of Iron Man and Captain America squaring off, so you can see who each has on their side there. What we're then treated to is possibly the longest build up ever to what we really want to see.

Most people have probably already been tipped off to the massive fight scene that takes place in an airport between rival sides. In any other film, people may get bored waiting or possibly find that it wasn't worth the wait when it finally came. Not here. You won't get bored. Civil War is not a short film, but it goes pretty damn quickly and you'll be totally entertained as the tension between the two factions is gradually build up in preparation for then they go toe to toe. It's all well worth it.

Basically, if you have even only a little bit of interest in the Marvel Shared Universe then you'll love this. And most of us fan-boys have more than just a passing fascination with it, therefore we'll enjoy it more than most.

It's no wonder that Batman vs Superman didn't do as well as expected when it was up against this. As much as I love the DC films, it just struggled to match this. I'd go as far as saying it's certainly the best 'stand-alone' Marvel film and probably better than the Age of Ulton.

Yes, you can gripe about where the Hulk and Thor both are when all this is going on, but if you scour Youtube, you may just find quite a comedic answer to where the Norse god of thunder was all this time. Otherwise, sit back and just enjoy a film with more heart and soul than most people ever guessed.",9
9 September 2020,Another great addition to the captain America movies,"It is very fun and entertaining. The story of the film is great. The screenplay keeps you hooked. The CGI and visual effects are outstanding. The performances of the entire cast are amazing. They introduce many new superheroes which makes it a lot more fun. Definitely worth a watch for all marvel movie lovers.

The film doesn't struggle to give emotions, Seeing friends being torn apart like this was very emotional.

The acting was incredible and the film just flows greatly.

29 April 2016,Below Dark Knight and above Winter Soldier,"Is this the best comic book movie ever? It was close. But I don't think MCU will ever surpass a movie like Dark knight. But this is the best Marvel movie ever. To be honest this is how BvS should have been. I like DC universe more than marvel. But I like Marvel movies because it entertains and MCU took the comic book adapted movies to another level. It hit the right notes and the right mix of the emotions really work for the movie. BvS didn't quite get it right. Civil war is supposed to be a serious dark movie and one of the best Marvel comics have to offer (Seems like marvel is concentrating on movies and left comics for dead. The quality of marvel comics dipped recently, DC too but the Injustice is really good). But it fulfills the latter part only. It does have some negatives like some poor CGI shots, Average villain and sometimes the comedy ruins serious scenes. But it got too many elements that work, like the climax, spider-man, black panther, the rivalry and ending credits (oh yeah). Will it entertain you- HELL yes. Is this the best MCU movie ever- HELL yeah. Is this the best comic book movie ever?- Nope. Overall: Worth a watch in theaters and buy the blue-ray when it releases and keep it in your favorite movie collections. 8.5/10.",1

29 April 2016,Wow,"Action-packed, humorous, well balanced and well acted; Captain America Civil War is another insanely good addition to the MCU courtesy of Winter Soldier directors, the Russo Brothers. With a hero cast that greatly outnumbered any of its predecessor, one of the highlights of this battle of the titans was the inclusion of two new MCU characters, namely Tom Holland's Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther; who in many ways stole the show. Credit must be given to the full team-up confrontation choreographed in the airport scene briefly depicted in the trailers, which without a doubt introduced us to a gladiator match like never seen before. With plot twists that will divide fans and general viewers alike, Civil War inspires us to seriously consider how the events leading up to this mammoth conflict have drastically transformed some of our biggest and favourite MCU character, building primarily upon the events that occurred in both the Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron. Identifying weaknesses were minimal as the movie manages to reconcile what was maybe a very fast paced and almost confusing first half with a momentous and emotionally driven finale which justified the need for thorough detail in the beginning. While the film tingled my nerd senses throughout, delivering just about all that I had dreamed of witnessing on the big screen pre-release, I give this title a 9 and only a 9 (I wouldn't of given it quite a 9.5 if it has been an option) was the noticeable structural weaknesses in the first hour in terms of pacing, but also the ever so slightly under-whelming opening act which saw the new Avengers team taking on one of their first big threats. My own personal highlights in terms of specific characters in the movie would go to both Cap and Ironman, but also the short but amazingly sweet appearances of both Tom Holland's Spider-Man and Paul Rudd's Ant-Man.",9

1 January 2017,I had to watch this movie in 50 sittings as I keep falling asleep.,"Like most poorly written, cgi infested turds... This movie makes a great sleep aid, I usually find the so called ""action sequences"" so dull you can pass out around 2 minutes into the flat unimaginative fights, and one liner joke that M.A.S.H. would be ashamed to speak out loud.Don't worry Hollywood, even added a ridiculously and pointless love scene so you can convince your ""partner"" you didn't go to see this so you could stare at man bulges. I guess this movie is good if your 5 year old is bored and you need a nap. Side note: nothing really happens for about 99% of the running time of the movie. So basically just skip to the last 15 minutes and you will be fine, the rest of the movie is just forgettable and unnecessary to watch. At least this Marvel movie has maybe 5 minutes worth of watchable content. GO MARVEL!!!

2 May 2016,Not groundbreaking but a lot of fun,"Nothing lasts forever, a sentiment that extends to the now overstuffed and far to frequent superhero films of the modern day and where adventures like Spider-Man or the team up of The Avengers once felt like a true event, superhero films whether they be of Marvel or DC variety in today's climate feel increasingly uninspired and forgettable, which makes the enjoyment levels found in Captain America's third outing Civil War that much more surprising.

While it neither reinvents or rejigs the comic book staple that has become so stale over recent years and while it sometimes takes itself far too seriously for its own good, Winter Solider helmers Anthony and Joe Russo successfully balance a large roster of beloved characters and a couple of new ones in the form of a fresh faced Spider-Man and Black Panther to make Civil War's slightly overlong run time an enjoyable and likable event.

Delving into the idea of an inwardly warring Avengers group with larger than life personalities like Tony Stark clashing with the well-meaning and old school like Steve Rodgers, Civil War presents us with a collection of superheroes and super soldiers that aren't all lovey-dovey, rather at the point of blows within a world that no longer wants to give these creations free reign around the globe, themes that were prevalent in the recent Batman v Superman but explored far more enjoyably here in this more fun focused ride.

With its fair share of dialogue heavy situations and scenarios, the Russo's infuse Civil War with a collection of highly entertaining action set pieces filled with great moments (many that involve a teenage Spider-Man and Paul Rudd's endearing interpretation of Ant Man) and humorous quips by its now seasoned cast members that make its weaknesses like a largely forgettable baddie in the form of Daniel Bruhl's Zemo and terrible payoff of bad guy motivation and plans far more tolerable and new cast members Tom Holland as Peter Parker and 42s Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa/Black Panther seem like positive additions to an ever expanding roster of players.

Hard to hate and easy to enjoy, Civil War doesn't exactly make one feel as though the superhero blockbuster is 100% assured heading into the distant and not too distant future but it certainly enough to makes a now cynic like me feel far more willingly to be a part of the crowd pleasers for the next little while as long as they are as well played and constructed as this energetic adventure.

4 May 2016,Best Marvel film to date,"Should The Avengers be nationalised? This is the controversial idea running through the film, tearing the superheroes apart and into a ""civil war"". It is interesting to note that the two blockbuster comic-book movies which were released just weeks apart- Civil War and Batman vs Superman- each have a similar thread. They are both about collateral damage and a guilty conscience splitting those who would normally be on the same side. The key difference is that Captain America: Civil War is a far more engaging and enjoyable affair.

After a disastrous campaign in Lagos, the majority of the world's states have had enough of the Avengers' vigilante actions. By signing the UN-drafted Vienna accords, the group will surrender their independence by coming under government oversight and control. However some of them, led by Steve Rogers, will simply not have it. In an ironic turn of events, it is the privately-funded Tony Stark who is flying the flag of nationalisation while being opposed by the government creation of Captain America.

This leads to a hugely enjoyable set-piece at an airfield which pits superheroes against other, akin to an all-star game that actually matters, and answering thousands of playground arguments of ""who would win in a fight between x and y?"". Despite the serious political theme and the battle of ideas between The Avengers the film has a wittiness to it, helped by funny turns from Ant-Man and Tom Holland's debut as Spiderman.

Civil War is not perfect- it is slightly overlong- but the clashes between the characters meant something and unlike Dawn of Justice you understand why they have turned on each other like this. In short, it's the cinematic superhero showdown you always wanted.",8

26 December 2016,"Meh, not what I hoped for","Captain America appears once again in a movie with his name as the banner. Strangely however, a legion of other stories and superheroes weave through this film and it watches more like the next Avengers film. Cap has a backseat purpose.

Comic books are fun, but they're hard to get and I mean that on two levels. A good comic book tells a story in 2 dimensions. A good movie made from a comic book, transfers that ""good stuff,"" for example the story and superheroes, and translates that into a movie experience.

Because I read a lot of reviews, I can see there is an either/or in comic book movies: some say they stayed true to the comic and the movie excelled as a result. The other one is when a comic book connoisseur slashes and trashes the director for taking too much license in the making o the movie. I don't know comic books well, which might explain why I didn't like this film as much as the critics as large. Maybe I should read more comics?

My first question was: ""Why so many superheroes when this is a movie called ""Captain America?""""

I binge watched the two prequels to Civil War before seeing it at the cinema, as did my wife. I can tell you the first two really held my attention and Cap (as he is called in all of them) is the focal hero of the movies. That made it a lot easier to follow and get on board with. Civil War has too many superheroes exhibiting their individual strengths and weaknesses.

All the while there is a ploy by politicians to gain control of the Avengers due to their reckless modus operandi. Cap's reins from the other two movies is named ""Bucky"" and I don't want to give any spoilers but there is so much back story and attention given to him you might as well have named it ""Bucky: Civil War."" Still, he has some interesting abilities and his interplay with Cap is somewhat interesting. I'd call that part of the story ""just above a snore.""

We do get to see some action. There is an almost unforgivable about of people having dialog and no action. This to me was a crime. All I can imagine is that it would make more sense if I only read the comics. Because I felt the movie did not live up to its name ""Captain America"" and should have been named ""Avengers,"" and because of some laboriously long dialog with no action, it lost two stars with me. I have to say, enough comic book aficionados will go see this no matter what I say but to all the others I cannot recommend this film. I have high hopes for the next one though.",6
1 May 2016,Best Marvel movie ever( Both Marvel Cinematic Universe and other unofficial films),"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",9

30 April 2016,"Not just a great Comic Book Movie, its a great MOVIE (Spoiler free Recview)","Fantastic character driven film that makes the viewer's question themselves. Both sides are right and wrong at the same time. You will go back and forth between which side you are on.

Pros:

1) Great action scenes, especially the airport sequence

2) Spider-Man, Black Panther and Ant-Man stole the show

3) Each character gets their moment to shine (doesn't feel overcrowded at all) and acting is great

4) Extremely well written plot

5) Both sides provide valid points and reasons why they are fighting.

50/50:

1) Zemo is a great character and his reasons are solid. But his plan required a little too much ""coincidence"".

Cons:

1) Some of the characters' motives for choosing sides aren't that clear or explained.

Overall great film. 9/10. One of the best Comicbook movie of all time. And undoubtedly a great movie

Tips: Though not 100% necessary, I would highly recommend seeing ""Captain America : The Winter Soldier"" and then ""Avengers : Age of Ultron"" to appreciate this movie. And to fully appreciate this movie see all MCU movies prior to to this.",9

14 May 2016,"Amazing. Full of incredible dialogue, emotion, and suspenseful action","The Marvel Cinematic Universe's newest action extravaganza proves once again that the MCU can create a masterpiece of superhero cinema. Much courage and loyalty is put into this film by the writers and directors, and it shows. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's decision to delve deeper and darker into the plot, thus exploring thought-provoking themes like revenge, friendship, and betrayal, work wonderfully. Also the work of the directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, provide for large amounts of emotion in the dialogue and intensely gratifying fight scenes filmed at the right angle. This is not your typical superhero flick with action and an interesting plot, it is a movie that pits incredible set-pieces and choreography against life-changing choices, while throwing superheroes into the mix. At its core this film acts as three movies combined: a sequel to ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" a semi part three Avengers movie, and the introductions of popular characters Black Panther and Spider-Man. This film is guaranteed to satisfy casual movie goers, Marvel fan boys, and the toughest critics to please.

Marvel has once again changed the way superhero movies are to be filmed. With their superior and supremely creative executive producer Kevin Feige at the helm, also a large array of visionary directors and writers, and a more-than capable cast, Marvel seems to have a record of this. Starting with their original movie ""Iron Man"" which kick-started the universe, to their excellently crafted team up ""The Avengers,"" and others such as political thrillers and space sagas like ""The Winter Soldier"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" the MCU has always enticed audiences. This is certainly the case with ""Captain America: Civil War"" as they continue this trend of newly crafted and original films. Not only does Kevin Feige bring something new to the MCU table, but he also considers the repercussions of the Avenger's actions while delivering a psychological thriller dealing with political interference, which splits the sides of the Avengers in two. Another superhero film at Warner Bros. Studios attempted a plot similar to this (""Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice"") but ultimately failed. It seems like Marvel has observed and payed attention to their rivals at DC and took some notes as to the right film-making strategy. All joking aside, Marvel Studios has clearly made a spectacular film that constantly keeps your brain moving, whether it be the incredible action scenes or the perceptions and viewpoints of every hero.

There are many examples in ""Captain America: Civil War"" that signifies that Marvel Studios has a firm grasp on their heroes and plot. The first instance is the phenomenal action sequences in this film. From Black Panther versus Bucky to the New Avengers Team versus Crossbones to the titular and praiseworthy airport battle, the choreography in this film is definitely spectacular. The second example is the mind blowing ideals of all the heroes. Every superhero in this film gets valid screen time to demonstrate their views on the matter, and in this way there is really no main villain. This movie creates so much emotion within their characters and conflicts that affects the audience in turn. The third and last case are the ambitious entries of beloved Marvel heroes Spider-Man and Black Panther. The way that these two characters fit almost flawlessly into the plot instead of being shoehorned in is quite a fete. Black Panther definitely has the advantage over Spider-Man in the way that his character is more involved and better introduced in the plot, but Marvel still successfully pulls it off. Laying the groundwork for further hero's solo outings is a strategy that Marvel has done in the past. While most times it works pretty well, in this film it works terrifically. Even at the beginning of the year, it can be said that ""Captain America: Civil War"" will be one of the best films of the year, and that Marvel Studios has pulled off a rather gutsy and ambitious move.",10

17 May 2016,Got to be Marvel's best yet!,"I was very excited for this movie, and was eager to see it and when I finally did, oh my gosh I was absolutely blown away! This was one of the best movies I had ever seen in my 14 years of living! Every MCU film is great, but this is by far it's most perfect! There is not one thing I disliked about it. Acting was awesome, CGI the best Hollywood has, it's shooting and lighting were outstanding. Everything worked for it! 110 percent effort was obviously put into this movie. Whatever Marvel's doing there nailing it every single time! Action scenes were very tense, very entertaining, and an on the edge of your seat ride. I cannot see anyone hating this movie at all. Every single scene had a surprise or was just pure amazing! Tom Holland as Spiderman is the best since Tobey Maguire! Homecoming is bound to be great. As usual, Robert Downey Jr was terrific as Tony stark same with Chris Evans as captain America I adored every second of civil war. It's a must see for sure. I recommend you see it as soon as you can. Bring the kids, your date, friends or spouse. And I promise you will not regret doing so. Best film or 2016!

1 May 2017,"""Do you even remember them?. I remember all of them""","The first outing that Anthony & Joe Russo had in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, did everything for me. It landed amongst my favorite films of all time and became my favorite film within the MCU. So you can imagine the anticipation level I had for this and after my first viewing of it, I knew I loved it.

Leading up to the release of Captain America: Civil War, I couldn't sit still and I was beyond excited for it. As I watching it for the first time I couldn't believe just how great it turned out to be. Unlike previous superhero films released in 2016, Civil War hit me like a truck in its epicness and it resonated with me a lot more than I realized. Soon after that, I went to see it again in theaters and it still worked for me. Everything came together beautifully and it was a true masterpiece in my eyes.

The things that both Russo Brothers did for the character of Captain America is brilliant. They knew how to handle him - from doing his sequel - and they knew how to handle a lot of characters, like Joss Whedon did. With just two films in, they've created two of the best comic book films to date, and two great films in their own. Their direction here is near flawless. With exception of a few scenes being a little to shaky, the way they shot action is done so well.

Speaking of action, I don't think there's been great action like this since the first Avengers film. Its funny how well those two films feel like each other. In most cases Civil War is just Avengers 2.5, and I think the Russo's handled it so well. Not only does the hand-to-hand fighting feel tightly done and exciting, but the fighting done in bulk - like the airport scene - works so much better.

After the second Avengers film I didn't think anyone could handle all those characters and plot points like Whedon did and yet, the Russo's do it perfectly. I love how this is just as a Captain America movie as it is an Iron Man movie. Going in I was Team Cap all the way, but watching it time and time I feel for both sides and I ended up switching on multiple occasions. That's why I think it works so well - the way that they handled each character and their arc. Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Vision, aren't A-list characters, but the Russo's used them to their advantage and made it work.

I was really surprised on how performance driven Captain America: Civil War really is. Its political talk but its so interesting and it kept me interested. This is easily Robert Downey Jr's show because is acting here is really great. The speech he has about the young boy they kill is passionate and RDJ owns it. Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan both chip in fantastic performances and their chemistry together works. The team is also really great with Jeremy Renner being my favorite.

The addition of Black Panther and Spider-Man had me worried at first. I wanted so bad to see them on screen, but I didn't want them to be crammed in. Thankfully, they aren't. Tom Holland is perfect as Spider-Man. He has the dorky side that Tobey played so well, and he had the sweetness that Garfield had as Spider-Man himself. He was truly the perfect combination of both. Chadwick Boseman is fantastic as well. He's got this vibe to the character of Black Panther that works so well. We all know that the MCU has villain problems, but it stops here. Daniel Brühl is magnificent as Zemo. He's badass, he's smart, his plan makes sense and his overall reason for it all is done so well.

The film isn't a masterpiece in terms of film, nor is it as well crafted as some other comic book flicks before it. But there's something special about it every time I watch it. It could be my love for these characters, it could be the epic airport scene, or it could just be entertaining as all hell. I don't know what it truly is that makes this work for me, but Captain America: Civil War passed all my expectations and has made it a new favorite of mine for the years to come.",10
6 May 2016,Contrived and Convoluted - a Weak Effort From Marvel,"Where to begin with this one? First, there is zero reason for The Avengers to be fighting each other. The whole conflict is contrived simply to present an over fluffed fight scene between Avengers.

Think of a person looking for a fight for no apparent legit reason just so he/she can say, "" I kicked someone's ass last night,"" and that pretty sums up the contrived so-called fighting reason between Avengers here. No tension, nothing is at risk, attempts to insert comedy inappropriately and feels like a WWE wrestling match.

Convoluted in the sense that The Winter Soldier's back story regresses into some weird thoughtless and lazy story writing thing here. The strong bond and character development Bucky and Steve Rogers have in the first Captain America film now is contrived and shallow -- absolutely no heart.

Stark's reason to be ""pissed off"" is highly contrived and added as an afterthought in an attempt to justify his so-called 'rage' which is more in line with a boy with his feelings hurt than a man who is genuinely full of anger.

I must have missed something with this film that the majority of people (or paid reviewers?) didn't. In my opinion, this film is average at best, and on par with Iron Man 3, but better than BvS as that film may be the worst 'superhero' flick ever made.

I always know when I'm not liking a film when I say to myself ""this film seems really long"" halfway through, then check the time to verify exactly how long it's been running.

Verdict - It's not terrible but it's not good. Think of a meal consisting solely of cheap store bought preservative filled White Bread and that sums up how I feel about this film.",5
4 February 2017,"Great movie, but made for the wrong reasons","The movie failed for me, I didn't feel the motivation that the characters had and I kinda felt like the movie was an excuse for the Marvel heroes to fight one another. That aside the cinematography was good (not great) and credits to that stunt crew!﻿ I also experienced Iron Man being very annoying, which is a weird first time to see it this far. I feel like this was an opportunity for this franchise to do something endearing, but it ended up with a movie without purpose. Action for me is best when it is re-watchable and you can go back to the movie, whenever you feel like getting entertained. So 5/10 score as decent, but it didn't break anything (Other than having a good Spiderman of course)

4 May 2016,"Captain America: Civil War is Marvel at its best - refreshing, bold and innovative","Captain America: Civil War is bold, innovative and altogether refreshing. Impressively switching between character-driven dialogue development, all-to-the-wall action scenes and a depth to a war and conflict that others could only dream of (looking at you, Batman vs Superman), Civil War is impressive because of what is at stake and what we know lies ahead. It wins by building to this point thirteen episodes into its Universe run and offering more for the audience to invest themselves in - there is no winners, or losers, or good people or bad people as such, just individuals with different approaches, opinions and emotions and Civil War wins by accepting each of these and exploring them in thought provoking and progressive ways. I genuinely do not know where this Avengers unit is going next and as long as Marvel do not hit the reset and send everything back to being peachy keen, they will have myself and many others beside them for the journey.

8 May 2016,A masterfully done superhero movie!,"REVIEW (Non-Spoiler):

Captain America: Civil War is an extra-ordinary feature film that consistently balances all the characters in the film. Every character has a shining moment and the right amount of screen-time. The actors have done a splendid job but few of them had outstanding performances like Robert Downey Jr. as Iron-Man/ Tony Stark, Tom Holland as Spider-Man/ Peter Parker and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther/ T'Challa. The directors (Russo brothers) have delivered a thriller/drama superhero movie with such an intricate and well- written story, the introduction of new characters has been handled smoothly and doesn't feel forced.

Marvel has always been prominent for it's action sequences and it delivers again with Civil War in both the second act and third act fight. The airport fight sequence is one of the best choreographed battle I've seen on a cinema screen and the third act fight is simply outstanding. It is justified, raw, emotional and full of wow moments. This movie doesn't have black and white characters, the audience gets to see both sides and also faces a tremendous difficulty in choosing a side. Both Captain America and Iron Man have logically sound reasons and the right motivation to fight each other.

The villains of the MCU have been generally regarded as weak, Daniel Bruhl as Baron Zemo is no exception. The character's development could've been better, there were few areas that could be explored for this character but nevertheless he does a good job. The visual effects are well done but weak in certain scenes. These are some of the minor flaws in this movie. There are incredible twists and turns in this film. On a final note, this film has consistent story- telling, right doses of action and neatly placed humor. It is arguably one of the best Marvel movies and gets better with every viewing.",10
23 September 2020,"Great Movie, Watch it","This movie has everything a superhero movie needs. It has action, drama, suspense, and a good plot. There were at least 5,000 people who rated this movie bad and to be honest I don't know what their problem is. If you didn't like this movie, then you're not a good Marvel fan.

28 April 2020,Captain America : Civil War (2016),"Captain America : Civil war is an amazing addition to the ""Captain America"" triology. From the Russo brothers who jump started the film series with ""Winter soldier"" comes another action packed marvel film to the marvel movie universe with new characters and an expansion to the coming films in the same genre.

The best thing of this film is heroes collide like this year's Batman V. Superman : Dawn of Justice (2016) and as usual Tony Stark and Steve Rogers also known as Iron Man and Captain America gives a stunning performance going to the core of there character arcs giving the fans the feels for the next movie's to come.

The action, effects and story was unparalleled. But still when it comes to the definition of a film this is still a comic book adaptation.

Unlike Watchmen(2009) and Deadpool(2016) which I find extremely original this is still in the standard formula.

But two thumbs anyway. Ironman Vs. Captain America - may be the greatest battle in the marvel universe.

Overall - 4 / 5",8
1 May 2016,The most cinematic Marvel film yet!,"Captain America isn't just one of the best superhero films, it is an outstanding film outside of the genre. There is so much going on in Civil War that you'd think the film would never be able to keep with all of it. New characters, huge set pieces and multiple plot lines coming to a head. However the direction and writing handles everything with a resounding respect and pace that makes this film spectacular.

Old characters like Iron Man, Captain America and Black Widow are given new nuances and interactions that keep there characters from becoming stale with Robert Downey Jr. delivering his best performance as Iron Man yet. Newer characters like Winter Solider, Ant-Man and Vision are also given great moments that don't distract from what's important and Spider-Man and Black Panther are excellent new additions to the formula.

What is most effective about Civil War is that it combines the political intrigue and believability with the fun and large scale of The Avengers together seamlessly making this the most realistic and enjoyable looks into the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) yet. If I had one criticism of the film, it would be about the villain who seems very pointless and confusing until his motivations are revealed at the end of the film. Once this happens your perspective on the character changes into something quite unexpected that fits perfectly into the films tone and messaging.

Good - Fantastic Action Sequences - Multi-layered characters and storytelling - Well paced comedy and realism - A film with suspense and consequences

Bad - Villains motivations are unclear and jarring to begin with.

8 May 2016,One of the best super heroes movies of all time...,"Captain America trilogy must be one of the best trilogies ever made. I am not a big fan of sequels, and usually the sequels do not outperform their predecessors, in my humble opinion. There are a few rare exceptions of course, like Captain America: Civil War for instance. After the disastrous Batman vs Superman that left a bitter aftertaste, time had come for something more refreshing and engaging, and I must say that Captain America Civil War delivers the goods. It has everything one would expect from a movie...dynamic superheroes with awesome abilities, story, momentum, and the question we ask as to what happens next, which keeps our attention on the big screen. I watched this in the theater and not a soul stirred during the 2.5 hour duration of the movie. All the characters in this movie played out their roles with precision and realism. The fight scenes are excellent (at times funny) as each superhero is matched up against someone else but the seriousness of the fight scenes builds to a crescendo which leaves us with a very satisfying climax to the movie. I have seen most of the Marvel movies in recent years but this by far is one of the best superhero movies ever. You might want to watch Captain America: The Winter Soldier again as this is somewhat of a continuation of where that movie left us off. Overall, I give this movie a deserved 10/10 as this is of the best super hero movies.",10
27 April 2016,I never thought Marvel Studios could set the bar this high.,"I never thought Marvel Studios could set the bar this high. Captain America Civil War is a total package. Entertaining, action- packed, humorous and an emotional ride. It's just a bonus if you've invested your time starting from the first Iron Man up to now to get attached to the characters, but it's not necessary.

The airport battle royal between our favorite super heroes is the crowning moment of the film. The action sequences in that particular scene, plus the surprises, is one of the best I've seen in a comic book movie. Although every action sequence throughout the movie is nearly on par, if not on the same level. It's just that seeing a lot of characters going at each other is much more enjoyable.

Black Panther, Spider-Man and Ant-Man were also highlights of the film, but everyone did an amazing job and had their deserved screen time. Some will definitely disagree with me on this one but as for Zemo, his role manipulating and working behind the scenes worked for me.

For others saying this is Avengers 2.5, I didn't feel that way. I still felt this was a true sequel to Captain America The Winter Soldier (only partly, AoU). The conflicting ideologies of our two main heroes is still the focus of the whole movie and everything was balanced perfectly.

To sum it up, this is arguably Marvel's best movie to date, and one of the best CBMs of all time. I can't wait for the solo outing of Black Panther and Spider-Man, and how the world of the MCU progresses from here.

P.S. Honestly, I'm now having doubts that they can top this one with their line-up of upcoming solo movies, until maybe Infinity War. LOL!",10
17 July 2019,Avengers 2.5? I think not,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",9
23 May 2016,"It was okay, as long as you brought your kid to see it.","I read the Marvel comics when I was younger, but when the art and story deteriorated, I stopped buying them. This was over 40 years ago. I've seen a few of the movies, but while very popular, I found them childish and not well acted. This particular film was okay, I enjoyed watching it, but then, I had brought my grandson to it. I would not see another Marvel movie otherwise.

The only good superhero movies ever made, the ones worthy of an adult viewer, were the Christopher Nolan Trilogy of Batman. Interestingly, I had never bothered with boring DC comics as a kid, but Nolan took an old idea and made it classic.

3 September 2016,"A great movie, which annoyed the hell out of me","Many may consider this the best Marvel movie to date, and I can see why. It does a good job of adding an additional layer of depth to the current avengers, as well as introducing a few new ones. It also does a good job of capturing some of the political mess which a group such as the Avengers might cause.

Still, I can't help finding myself annoyed with how some of the main characters are portrayed. Tony Stark, who I would label as a narcissistic anti-authoritarian, is suddenly portrayed as quite easily collared. Still slightly narcissistic, but still, it doesn't fit him. Sure, this is a Captian America flick - not 'The Glorious return of the Wonderous Tony Stark', so a few oddities about the other Avengers are to be expected. But still. These oddities are enough to have me annoyed through what could and should have been an amazing film.

And, come on, Tony Stark is way cooler than Captain America. They should have made it about him. Really.",6

7 May 2016,Outstanding!,"A little disappointed that the theater I went to see this in 3D was not working. Still enjoyed the story line and the action. I'm on Team Iron man. It was great to see the new Avengers and the surprise visit from another one of my favorites. I haven't missed a Marvel movie since they started, this was another good one. It lived up to the hype. My two guests and I enjoyed it. Will go again to see it in 3D. The Black Panther appears to be a great addition to the Avengers Squad. The Disney/Marvel collaboration is working out real well. When will we see or will we see Black Widow in her own movie? And we now have another Spider Man? Will the Hulk ever return?

29 April 2016,"This is how to do it, DC!","If you see someone with a sad face coming out of Captain America: Civil War (2016; 147 mins), sidle over and whisper, ""Are you a Warner Bros/DC executive?"" If they answer 'yes' just be kind. I'd rather bathe in stinging nettles and marmots than have that feeling. Marvel, Joe & Anthony Russo, and to some extent Robert Downey Jnr and Chris Evans, have pitted against each other two lesser characters (objectively speaking) than Zach Snyder's wasted gold dust and there isn't even a competition about which is the better film. Because yes, Civil War is as good as you may have heard. No, actually, it's even better than that. Where the recent DC films have struggled with consequences of actions, this is a film all about them. Some examples: if you open with a virtuoso action sequence that thrills and entertains without flaw then you're going to have to escalate throughout the film. Check. If you have too many heroes on your hands then you're going to have to write a brilliant script that introduces/involves/evolves them all in a significant way, so that the audience doesn't wonder why they're there. Done. And if you've done all this successfully before then you're going to have to do better. Mission accomplished. What Marvel have been especially good at is finding the right balance between humour and action, between levity and high stakes. In Civil War they have reached the apotheosis of this alchemy. The moments of tragedy and pathos that come from conflict between friends, not to mention other developments, mingle effortlessly with those of genuine hilarity, from all comers. It makes for a ridiculously entertaining mix. Similarly, the balance between action and dialogue scenes is pretty much perfect. When they come, the energy and sheer inventiveness of the former makes for a spectacle that never, ever gets boring. Each set piece utilises a completely different style and the ideas just never stop, with one particular motorcycle trick inducing gasps and cheers from the audience. The latter, the story, the personal conflicts, are superbly scripted and played out, and they ground the movie in something real. Civil War is fun, pretty much non-stop, but it is a long way from silly. There are serious matters afoot and the 'bits in between' are as gripping as the action because so much attention has been paid to each word, each glance. The cast, as usual, are exemplary, and we get bigger and better turns from Paul Bettany (The Vision) and Elizabeth Olsen (Scarlet Witch), while the introduction of Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther and a certain web-crawler brings even more to the party, and without diluting the mix. Special mentions, though, to Chris Evans (Cap) and Ben Barnes (Winter Soldier) who do a lot of heavy dramatic lifting; another one to Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) because, well, I don't need a reason (she's excellent, though); but the big bucks do go to Downey Jnr, who is the best he has ever been as ol' Shellhead. In short, I loved this film. Even the two credit stings are ace, so do stick around",9
16 June 2018,Captain America 3 turns out to be Iron Man 4,"Chris Evans' acting is too bad, and is much overshadowed by that of Robert Downey Jr. In the end, you would think that this is an Iron Man movie instead of a Captain America movie. The action sequences and visual effects are awesome, although the plot lacks credibility.

27 April 2016,Everyone must see this.,"I don't write reviews of all the movies i have rated. But this movie was epic. Plus i can't get over Chris Evans' hotness & Robert Downey Jr.'s sense of humor. Tom Holland as Spider-Man is all happy go lucky & a little bit of funny. Everyone must see this because you'll laugh, fall in love, & most especially get hurt. Why? Because who would've want to fight our favorite heroes? Scarlett Johansson is all amazing. wow. To be honest i am really impressed by her moves! And my favorite powers are Elizabeth's (aka Scarlet Witch) & Paul's (aka Vision) if i got to choose. Anyways, there's a plot twist that came, sometimes i like it in movies & marvel did it very well & clean. It's a little bit confusing sometimes, of what each new villains need or want or what are their plans or what are they gonna do. But at the end of it. The storyline was all perfect! The way Marvel did it was marvelous. All the good things that y'all have been looking for are all in Captain America: Civil War movie. It was phenomenal. I am very serious. thanks Marvel studios for creating this film. 20/10 But just because i'm Team Cap doesn't mean i'm against Tony. p.s. Stan Lee never gets old. ‪#TeamCap‬",10

The characters are horribly underdeveloped and their motivation is childish and questionable, if it even exists. the camera work and editing makes no real sense, other than to l'make the movie look a little less boring. And the villains is whack. he is gonna be another one of those marvel villains, where you gonna go in a year or two, ""what was the villain of that marvel movie again?"" I really don't get why people are getting al mad about the dumb plot of movies like batman v superman. those marvel movies are at least as dumb and no one blames them for nothing.

10 May 2016,Definitely worth a viewing or two,"Although did slow down a bit at times but for good reason and seemed like 2 movies within itself which is an appropriate way to define it. Civil War is partially an introduction to both minor and major recognizable marvel super heroes, although handled extremely well, one character in particular did seem a bit shoe horned but due to his immense contribution to the film in what little scenes he was in, it is completely forgiven. The threads Marvel has been sewing within the years have finally met their resolution in this film and by god it is amazing, a fight truly fueled within the years through build up has finally erupted and it is magnificent to see. This movie can be considered crowded but is a perfect example of how to handle all aspects in a way that looks seamless. Civil War was every thing I expected a sequel to Winter Soldier to be. With scenes that literally have you on the edge of your seat. I'm so happy I can now watch Captain America as a successful trilogy within itself, with each gradually bigger and better then the previous in my opinion.

6 May 2016,Felt like a mid season finale... A REALLY GOOD MID SEASON FINALE,"This film served as a ""mid season finale"" to both the Avengers films, the Captain America Trilogy and the Iron Man trilogy.

First and foremost, this is a sequel to Captain America: Winter Soldier. We see a clear impact of the events of the previous film on Cap and influencing very important decisions he makes throughout the course of the film. We also see character arcs coming full circle in the film. Cap's interaction with Bucky, Sam (Falcon), Natasha and the Carter girls really highlights and builds upon the relationships that had been established in the earlier movies.

Secondly, this was a sequel to the Iron Man films, as well as to the Avengers flicks. We see Tony's character in a much different state of mind than he was when he was first introduced to us in 2008. We see how each of his actions, in the events in the films that led to this one, have taken a toll on him and made him more somber. We also see some form of resolution and expansion to the relationships he had at the end of Iron Man 3.

Scarlet Witch and Vision really helped tie in the Avengers films' story into the story. I felt the interplay between the two was done really well, and the film just established Wanda as powerhouse. She was intimidating and just flat out overpowered. I LOVED every moment she was on screen. One of the best characters in the film. Furthermore, the film also ties in the catastrophic events that occurred during both the Avengers flicks.

In my opinion, you need to watch all the Avengers, Captain America and Iron Man films in order to enjoy this film to its fullest and to be invested in the character motivations in the film. But even on it's own, this film rocks. Spider-Man's role in the film was so beautifully handled with love and care. He was the star whenever he was on screen. Spider-Man is essentially Marvel, and Marvel is Spider-Man. Ant-Man had some fantastic scenes. Black Panther / T'Challa just had a presence about him. Chadwick Boseman really highlighted the character's regal decent as well as the warrior aspect. Definitely another epic addition to the MCU. Black Widow was great as always, and by now has solidified herself as a legitimate badass.

Overall, this film was brilliant. It had the perfect balance of emotions, humor, grit, and action. The action in this movie was so meticulously crafted, so well handled, I feel that this film is, hands down, one of the greatest action movies ever made. What really elevated the action, were the emotional beats as well as the humor that was peppered throughout the film. It never felt like it dragged on. One slight nitpick, that I do have, is the fact that the ending of the film felt slightly abrupt. I would've liked them to have lingered at some shots, to really let the moment sink in at the end. The villain served a purpose. He was functional for the film.

I'd give this film a 9.7/10 You're in for a treat .",10
7 May 2016,The best from Marvel !,"This is the best Marvel movie yet, undoubtedly. It clearly surpasses The Avengers, Age of Ulton , all the Iron man movies , ant man , hulk , Winter soldier etc. Lets start with the story. The story is really well made. All the action in the movie seems to have a purpose , it does not look superfluous. Captain America and Iron man have a proper reason to fight. They are not fighting for some stupid logic and reason , unlike in Batman and superman. In BVS , Batman has flawed notions regarding superman and has no proper logic. The fight seems a waste. But this does not happen here. Secondly, kudos to the dialogue writers. All the dialogues are well written. Comic relief is provided in almost all the scenes. Action is flawless and is in huge quantities. In the entire movie i was wondering what the end would be. It does not disappoint. The end is great. There are so many superheros in the movie but it does not feel that a particular superhero has received less time. Its all perfectly made. No other superhero movies hold a candle to this one(except Nolan's batman trilogy).

7 September 2018,Battle of the Avengers,"Although the Avengers have managed to thwart several attempts by criminal organizations to wreak havoc upon the world, a newer problem has emerged which concerns the incredible damage done in those areas where the battles have occurred. So in order to address this issue the United Nations comes up with a plan to place the Avengers under the strict control of a special multinational panel. Unfortunately, this idea doesn't please all of the Avengers and as a result half of them decide to follow ""Captain America"" (Chris Evans) and leave the group while those that remain agree with ""Iron Man"" (Robert Downey Jr.) to accept U.N. authority over them. Unfortunately, things become much more intense when Captain America and his allies do battle with a criminal mastermind and thereby not only break the U.N. mandate but also force the remaining Avengers to attempt to apprehend them so that they can be tried and punished for their actions. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film definitely had its share of action from start-to-finish with a multitude of superheroes sharing the big screen. To that effect, while I liked the addition of ""Spider-Man"" (Tom Holland) and ""Ant-Man"" (Paul Rudd) I must admit that the abundance of characters became a bit too much at times. Having said that, however, I still enjoyed this picture for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7
11 May 2016,It comes as little surprise that the Red State Avengers . . .,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

4 May 2016,Best Marvel movie so far?,"This movie is way better than i was expecting after the trailers. it simply took away the bad taste on my mouth after seeing Bat vs Super. probably one of the best action sequences ever made on a super heroes movie for sure. a really good storyline which bring not non-sense violence, it has important lessons to learn about people, friends, relationship,etc. It is indeed one if not the best Marvel movie so far. no character has a small role or an overrated role. girls awesome and stunning. Liz Olsen being Scarlet witch... super sexy. Scarlett Johansson? well what can we say, shes the hottest one anywhere around: Black panther and his father very very good, i can't wait to see the solo movie. in few word: the movie is more than worthy to be seen!

13 May 2017,10 minutes,"Captain America: Civil War was free to watch with Amazon Prime. I figured it would be worth a watch even though Super Hero movies are a real hit or miss. Many people love Marvel movies because they are bright, funny, and filled with action. Great examples of this are Deadpool and Iron Man. Unfortunately, I turned this movie off after 10 minutes. Someone please explain to me how a bunch of super heroes need Black Widow. This was part of the problem with the original Avenger's movie: You have Space Aliens with laser cannons and flying ships and we're going to send in a 125lbs woman in leather to shoot at them with a 9mm in between kicks. IT makes no sense. What's even worse is that they can make scenes with the hulk smashing cities and fighting an Iron Man Suit, but they can't have the Black widow balance enough to actually produce force in a kick or punch. It looks stupid. Not as stupid as Falcon's wings, but stupid enough to turn the movie off. Sorry Marvel fans, You have a Plethora of amazing Marvel Characters who could replace the Black widow. Too bad the studio feels it needs to keep trotting out the same illogical character choices. (BTW, Black widow is a spy and does great at infiltration. She doesn't need to be in big action sequences to be a part of the team).",2
20 May 2016,excellent,"Not really into superhero flicks I still do watch them because everybody does and I want to talk about them. The X-men franchise can't satisfy me really and the Avengers franchise is better but do has it flows. But have seen the trailer of this one I thought I would give it a try.

What a great flick this is, and by now I do know why the Avengers causes me problems. It's the annoying Iron Man. I mean, when he's Tony Stark he really annoys me with his way of talking but here he isn't the main subject. It's all about Captain America of course. Why I did like it is the fact that it's all about the action throughout this flick. Not that many talking, it's fighting and fighting and it's the Avengers against each other using their superpowers so on part of the effects it's ultra brilliant.

I must warn that if you haven't seen another superhero flick that you can have a problem because there's Ant-man and Spiderman popping up, and we do see flashbacks from most of the other superhero flicks.

The performances are all excellent, yes, after Deadpool (2016) and Ant-Man (2015) this is the next in a row I do like. Be sure to watch the end credits because the movie goes on, and also wait until the end credits are over, there's more to catch.

24 April 2019,I could watch this all day.,"Essentially a third 'Avengers' film, 'Captain America: Civil War (2016)' easily ranks amongst the very best of the 'MCU' primarily because it's so breathlessly entertaining and effortlessly character-focused, featuring an eclectic set of charismatic characters caught on two sides of a captivating moral dilemma that has no clear 'right' or 'wrong'. It has an almost pitch-perfect tone, being serious without being gloomy, dark without being dour and having lasting consequences (both for this film and for the 'cinematic universe' at large). Having both the protagonist and antagonist be 'heroes' is a ballsy move but it pays off remarkably well. It leads to a thematically-rich experience that's much more nuanced than, perhaps, is usual with the genre. On top of all that, the flick brilliantly balances being, essentially, both a direct sequel to 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)' and 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron (2015)', tying together themes and character motivations from both to further the feeling that these past events have shaped pretty much every core player's perspective. Where they side on the central debate feels wholly cohesive with their character, which is kept firmly at the heart of the feature, and this leads to tangible motivations that constantly drive every single decision. This is what really makes all the action feel palpable, as well as the fantastic stunt-work and restrained CG-integration. Our heroes aren't fighting nameless thugs, they're fighting their friends and it hurts. Yet, everyone thinks they're doing the right thing. Because of this, the non-universe-ending stakes are all the more impactful. It's really remarkable. It's also really emotionally affecting, especially when the subversive climax rolls around. 9/10",9

(I have a crush on him, and all his simplicity, amooo), even the fights were cute with him...

2 May 2016,Superhero movie done right,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has grown and matured in all the right the ways throughout the years. Establishing a shared universe with rich characters is no easy task, let alone succeeding, without compromising the quality and ethics in such a grand undertaking. Before watching Captain America - Civil War I was very skeptical about how anyone would be able to properly handle this amount of characters and high quality actors in a balanced and meaningful way. My expectations were sky high, having genuine respect for the creative handling of century old comic book characters that has been done so far is truly formidable. From start to end the movie gives you a thrill ride of untold proportions. Never was there a moment through the movie that i found useless or not helping the plot. Best Marvel movie to date, without a doubt!

5 May 2016,Cap does it again,"After seeing Captain America Civil War I realize the Captain America trilogy is one of the best trilogies that there have ever been. The first avenger wasn't completely loved by everyone, but I enjoyed it very much and it was a great setup movie. Winter Soldier was a unique superhero movie that I thought was outstanding. Now... with Civil War it has done it again as this is emotional and powerful. The action scenes in this movie are jaw dropping. The thing I am most excited for after this movie is the fact that the Russo brothers are doing Infinity War. The focus on all the characters in this movie is done very well, even though there are characters I wanted to see more of, it was still the perfect way to focus on them. Overall, this movie had me on the edge of my seat as there is great focus and exhilarating fight scenes. Every character is this movie is either introduced well (Black Panther, Spider-Man) or has their character built in positive ways. It was hard for me to pick a side, because the arguments were valid and although contrary to many reviews I enjoyed the main villain. There isn't a superhero movie like this one... highly recommended!!!",10
25 September 2016,Best of the Marvel series so far,"If you didn't know the title, you might not guess that this is a Captain America movie. It has most of the Avengers in it and seems very much like a direct sequel to Ultron with a bit more focus on Captain America. But since I really liked Ultron, and feel the Captain America movies are the best of the Marvel series, I'm okay with whatever they want to title this.

The movie begins with a big superhero vs. supervillain fight that results in civilian carnage. This isn't unusual in the superhero movie world, but what is unusual is that rather than glossing over this, this movie shows both the distress of the superheroes involved and the trauma of those who lost people in that fight. And that trauma leads to a request that the Avengers register with the United Nations and act under their authority. Some of the Avengers agree to this, like Iron Man, while others, like Captain America, prefer to remain free agents.

What's interesting is that rather than doing something simple, like having this be a plot by bad guys or by putting the superheroes into a bureaucratic nightmare, the movie raises the idea but throws in a big attack before the new agreement can really be implemented. And while for much of the movie it looks like the writers are more on the side of the Libertarian faction, by the end the audience is left to decide for themselves which side is right (I suspect the division line will be a political one involving how you feel about the U.N. in general).

This all sounds pretty weighty, but the movie is actually tremendously fun with a lot of great action. There's a long, amazing superhero vs. superhero fight that absolutely amazing, and the movie has a good sense of humor even as it considers very serious topics.

This is not just good for a Marvel universe movie, this would be good for an X-Men movie.",9

25 December 2016,Irrelevant,"How can there be an movie without ending? It exists and was made in marvel. The Marvel Movies or the mcu, as the great Christopher Nolan (whom I love so much) said, the marvel films are not films. Who takes seriously someone who puts, scenes in credits and now films without ending. I pay at the theaters to see the full movie, i do not want to wait to see the ending in the next movie next year. Cinema is not TV. It was for this reason that I stopped reading crossovers from marvel comics. And also for this reason that I do not see more mcu movies. I do not want to see a Spider-Man movie with the boring Iron man character in the movie the Spider-Man, just to rip off a few millions at the box office. No thank you. And the action scenes of this film are always plastic. No impact, there is no excitement to see beings almost invincible to punches and kicks with others beings almost invincibles. It is boring to watch, moreover, if in the end of the movie the villain does not die, nor the hero, it sucks.There is no moment of wonder nor an adequate climax, and considering that this is a super hero movie, and half the impact was already gone, because we know that the hero has to live and win in the end. Placing invincible heroes against each other, makes the action scenes of this movie completely irrelevant. This, even at the point where this film should shine, fails roundly. The scene and the film itself are predictable without suspense or tension. Just a fan service. After all,marvel only want to see dollars from the toys which they sold to the children.

27 November 2017,A mad tour-de-force.,"This is a quite an intense superhero movie, where a UN interference attempting to rein in the Avengers' unlimited powers ends up pitting them against one another, with Iron Man going along with the UN and Captain America going against. Caught in the middle is the Winter Soldier, who was alleged to be a responsible for a host of crimes, but contends that he only committed them because he was brainwashed by Hydra.

This movie takes off almost immediately, with action and suspense leading to the two opposing teams of superheroes quarreling with one another. Differing from past Marvel films, the plot does not rely too heavily on crazy CGI and explosive action; rather, it highlights the intrigue and tension between Captain American and Iron Man, along with those on their respective groups, and the unpredictable consequences it leads to.

The introduction of Spider-Man in movie was a great treat (Tom Holland did a nice job in portraying the enthusiastic superhero), and the incorporation of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) just adds on to the fun. It is a tour-de-force seeing so many of the Marvel characters all in one movie, duking it out with each other in spectacular special effects fashion.

***spoiler ahead*** It's too bad, though, that the film was rather anti-climatic, leaving much loose threads toward the end. ***spoiler ends***

And, with so many Marvel characters featured, the movie could have used a bit more screen time for them, especially Ant-Man and Spider-Man. Too much emphasis was placed in Captain America, the Winter Soldier, and Iron Man in the latter half of the movie. I thought there was also a little too much drama placed on the characters trying to explain their position as to why they support or not support the UN accords.

Robert Downey Jr. is phenomenal as he once again plays billionaire Tony Stark and weapons-clad Iron Man, only this time packing great emotion into his character and letting us actually see brokenness in his eyes, while Chris Evans delivers as he deals with the moral issues of standing up or going against his closest friends. There is a brilliant plot twist at the end (no spoilers) and true fans of the Marvel Universe: I warn you, bring tissues. Exceeds in every aspect; great story, great acting, great visuals, etc. Makes BvS look like a joke.

18 September 2016,the best of the Captain America Franchise,"this third instalment in the Captain America franchise is the best one overall.the energy is higher.there is more action and it's funnier.plus,it introduces some great character into the Marvel Cinematic universe.the new(and hopefully improved)Spider-Man(Tom Holland)Ant-Man(Paul Rudd)Jarvis/the Vision(Paul Bettany)Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff/the Scarlet Witch.Scarlett Johanson Retuns as Black Widow.and finally Robert Downey Jr. reprises his role of Tony Stark/Iron Man.the action here is off the charts and the time just whizzes by.it's over before you know it even though it is almost two and a half hours long.for me,Captain America: Civil War is a 9/10.

8 May 2016,Caps shield was not the only thing that dropped hard,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",5

12 May 2016,"On a grander scale than before, but still more Age of Ultron than Avenger's Assemble","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

Following a calamitous tragedy in Nigeria, the Avengers find themselves being hounded for regulation, and to become accountable for their actions. Tony Stark can see the reasoning in this, while Rogers believes the team should have the power to go about their affairs in total freedom. This builds to a climactic showdown between the two opposing sides, before an even deadlier enemy threatens to throw them all into total oblivion.

The serious cinema-goer has certainly, over the last few years, been forced to have a radical attitude re-adjustment to the concept of the superhero film, and its possibilities in the grand scheme of filmic merit. It's gone from being the sole preserve of an exclusive, distinctive flock of audience, to being accepted on a more grand, theatrical level. These child-minded figures, in their peculiar and fanciful costumes, have been heralded as almost Shakespearian in their Machiavellianism, and Captain America: Civil War is the logical conclusion to this thumping pomposity.

Strangely, with all this in mind, the film is ultimately still most impressive as an action spectacular, dazzling when brought to life in 3D, and taking you on a magical, mystical action packed journey that bursts into life at various points in its nearly three hour length. This is truly aiming to be the biblical comic book film, exploring relevant, human themes and placing the various iconic characters in respective roles. All of this, though, is its curse as well as its blessing.

As sensibly impressive as it is, ultimately most of it's problems can be started with the word over. It's overlong, overblown, overwrought, overbearing, overwhelming and presumably over-budget. All of this causes it to lose the fun factor a bit, and so Avenger's Assemble remains the best of the lot. ***",7

6 May 2016,"Up for the title of ""Greatest Comic Book Movie Of All Time""","This movie gave me everything I wanted and more. It contains the greatest action fight scene in any superhero movie without a doubt (Airport scene). All the heroes had a time to shine, with Spiderman, Antman, and Black Panther stealing the show in my opinion. The plot was complex and deep, with Zemo being a pretty good villain, despite not being anything like his comic counterpart. The comedy hit hard when it needed to, but this movie contains the most heart and deep conflict compared to any MCU movie. The acting was phenomenal from the spectacular cast. Chadwick Boseman played an amazing Black Panther, but it was Tom Holland aka THE GREATEST SPIDERMAN OF ALL TIME that took my breath away with his performance. This was the film we had all been waiting for and it exceeded my expectations, becoming my favorite comic book movie of all time, which previously was the Winter Soldier and the Dark Knight. I give all the props to the Russo brothers and completely trust them for Infinity War.

I give this movie a 10/10 and I can't wait to watch it a couple more times.",10
9 May 2016,My favorite marvel movie (sorry Guardians of the Galaxy),"This is probably my favorite superhero movie since the dark knight. Wow, I didn't expect this movie to be very good at all, and for once I fell like the fanboys are right and my expectations were wrong. I mean it's got well shot action, it's got Spider-Man, it's got decent character development, it's got Spider-Man, and did I mention it's got Spider-Man? I mean first off this movie does the little things correctly (for the most part), it has action scenes that you can tell what's going on (except for when they have to hide Scar-Joe's body double with shaky cam when doing some of her fight scenes), Chris Hemsworth seems to do most of his own stunts, and overall the fight scenes are very creative and action-packed. The superhero scene with every hero coming together for their big showdown is freaking amazing. Like besides the fact vision doesn't seem to do much of anything and doesn't even chase down Captain America once he starts to escape, every hero seems to be constantly doing something off-screen as well as using their powers in new and interesting ways on screen. The score for this movie is very well done, maybe not original but it's there when it needs to be, accentuates moments that it needs to, and shuts up when it shouldn't be there. The humor is toned down but still there, and besides some missed jokes from ant-man (and some from Spidey sadly) this movie still manages to be hilarious and the comedy is actually well timed for once. Overall the story and the writing for this movie are well above average. I loved black panther and spider man and their respective introductions. I thought the villains motivations were actually really unique, which made for one of the best superhero movie twists since watchmen. Yeah Iron Man is an asshole, and Captain America is pretty obviously right after you get into about an hour through the movie, but so what. The characters seem to stay true to themselves and I appreciate that. Overall this is the second Marvel movie I can say I love, and the only real movie I love so far this year (unless you count the Witch as a 2016 movie). I think anybody, even none comic book superhero fans like myself, to check this out.",6
25 May 2016,"An Expertly Balanced, Inherently Focused & Emotionally Dense Summer Extravaganza","The Phase 3 of Marvel Studios' shared universe is off to a rousing start as the 13th instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is another outstanding example of blockbuster filmmaking that, despite being stuffed with too many characters, is able to provide them their fair share of screen time but what's more impressive is that it does so without taking the centerstage away from its eponymous character, thus succeeding as a Captain America sequel rather than coming off as Avengers 2.5.

Set one year after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War follows Steve Rogers whose latest mission to prevent few mercenaries from stealing a biological weapon results in inadvertent deaths of few civilians, following which the UN introduces measures to keep the Avengers in check. With some in favour of the Accords while others against it, the group is split into two opposing factions, one led by Rogers & the other headed by Tony Stark. Meanwhile, a new villain emerges to exploit a weak spot within the Avengers.

Directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, Civil War finds the duo filmmakers in splendid form as they successfully juggle with the arcs of reprising & new characters without deviating too far from the main premise. By capitalising on the plus points of their previous venture, the Russos make sure that the focus remains on Steve Rogers & his journey while other characters weave in-n-out of his story. The swift pacing & uniform flow is effectively maintained, plus all the heavy emotions that come into play in the final showdown feel genuinely earned.

The screenplay is no slouch either, for the writers move the plot forward by betting more on the emotions than its big-budget spectacle. Unlike previous entries, the collateral damage incurred in the Avengers' presence is consistently questioned and there is valid reasoning behind all the choices these characters make. The disagreement between Rogers & Stark over international oversight stems from their own experiences as the former's faith is shattered after witnessing the corruption in The Winter Soldier while the latter is willing to submit after the destruction his actions caused in Age of Ultron.

Captain America: Civil War doesn't sway away from the established Marvel formula. Instead it distills out the impurities by stepping back from the reckless destruction of buildings & cities, and chooses to introspect its characters & their actions on a deeper level while addressing a few serious themes simultaneously. But its effervescent wit is never lost in the process and is consistent in delivery & timing. However, apart from its top-tier editing, the technical aspects don't improve by much and retain the iconography of its predecessors.

Coming to the performances, Civil War features a marvellous ensemble in Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, William Hurt, Daniel Brühl & others. Evans remains the lead despite sharing space with so many people and his performance is very measured. With welcome depth added to Tony Stark's arc, Downey Jr. chips in with an emotionally hefty work without discarding his innate charm & magnetic screen presence. And with her allegiance torn between the two factions, Johansson explores her character's spot quite ably.

Boseman as Black Panther truly nails his part, stealing the limelight from even the big players on more occasions than one. Stan does a brilliant job in maintaining the dual nature of his character's persona. Brühl's character silently develops in the background and the rationale behind his sinister plan is believable. But the most memorable turn comes from the web-slinging, friendly neighbourhood known as Spider-Man. Appearing in costume in just one sequence, Holland leaves a lasting impression with an energetic performance that brims with vibrancy, excitement & just the right amount of cockiness.

On an overall scale, Captain America: Civil War is one of the strongest films to come out from Marvel Studios' canon. By neatly balancing more than a dozen characters in its 2½ hours runtime, the confident direction by the Russos comes as a respite & assurance that the fate of Avengers: Infinity War is in good hands.. The latest offering in the MCU is no gamechanger but it is the finest implementation of the steps the studio follows to create its recipes, and benefits greatly from its deftly written script. A thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining & satisfying extravaganza for the masses, Captain America: Civil War is the summer blockbuster to beat this year.",
7 June 2016,"Marvel continues what they've done and have done well, but for how long?","What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

28 December 2016,"Striking the balance between a good story-line and all-out ""chaos""","With 2016 bearing the year of face-offs, as it seems, Captain America: Civil War promised to be good competition for Batman vs. Superman.

Personally, Civil War had potential to be the perfect face-off-film, but there were just too many characters and side-story lines that it got complicated. The essential premise of the conflict is easy - one side is pro Super Heroes Registration, one side is pro-vigilante justice, the old fashioned way. But so many characters get thrown in, and besides the gush of seeing so many super heroes all in one movie fighting off against each other, Marvel is veering more so on the mayhem side than on the character and plot development side.

I don't see much development in Civil War. I see a rift happen for the sake of a rift happening, characters being introduced just for the heck of it. Yes, maybe this is the way it goes in the comic, but it doesn't make much for a story for me.

I'm not saying Civil War was terrible by any means, no. But it was just meh. Another superhero movie. Some new characters, but just more of the same.",7
30 May 2016,"I loved it, but I didn't love it that much?","People will probably be mad that I only gave this a 9/10, but come on, I still love this movie! Anyway, I was expecting this to be an adaptation of the ""Civil War"" Marvel comics, but it really wasn't. It didn't feature much of the story elements, although I haven't officially read the series, so I can't judge. Let's hope Spider-Man doesn't end up making a deal with Mephisto. Speaking of which, Spider-Man is probably what attracted people the most to this movie. It's amazing to think that in only ten years, this character has been played by three different actors in three different continuities. It just seems a waste to not put ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Now, of course this Spider-Man is better than that version.

A lot of people were afraid that Spider-Man would just immediately appear, or would at least only be seen briefly. As someone who has seen Agents Of Shield or more importantly Agent Carter, it was great to see a connection to the TV shows with her funeral being held. It was weird how they didn't mention Nick Fury. At least Thor and the Hulk were mentioned. It's too bad that Thor did not appear as he happens to be my favorite Avenger. I admit to being confused as to why they were deemed too powerful to be in the movie. I mean, just put them on different sides, duh! I've complained way too much.

What matters is that we get to see more development with Bucky, who probably shines here the most. He even set a record for longest time to resurrect a character in the comics, as it was forty years! It seemed downright insane, but it ended up making some great movies out of it. I love how these characters all have unique personalities. It's always great to see new developments featuring superheroes who have to deal with the consequences of their actions. The fights the characters have with each other make a lot more sense. We even get some great personal stuff with Iron Man. The action scenes are amazing with all these wonderfully bright characters taking part in these great fights.

Black Panther is also introduced and really gets a great scene at the end. This movie may not have affected the status quo of the Avengers that much, but is definitely worth watching. ***1/2.",9
14 July 2020,Most underrated MCU movie,"This one's a lot closer to an Avengers movie than it is a standalone Captain America so it was a real treat to see all of the Avengers aside from Hulk and Thor have fairly large roles in this movie. Easily the best choreography and fight scenes of any Marvel movie so far. Every other Avengers movie so far has a lot more space type action where the action scenes in this one seem more realistic because it's all Earth type foes and friends clashing. The acting brought tears to my eyes in certain moments because it goes straight to the heart. It's easy to forget about this particular movie because of all the other huge blockbuster Marvel movies that have come out within the short time span, but this may be my favourite of all of them: 10/10

12 January 2019,Explosive,"31 December 2016. Most of the time, more and more and bigger and louder doesn't often result in better. This Captain America somehow manages to assemble a lot of superhero action into one movie and make it into one totality of an experience in diversity and style and cinematography that explodes on the screen. At the same time, somehow the director is able to retain a sense of individuality and focus on a few superhero characters so that a major theme of a morality play between individuality and centralized, governmental public interest is retained. This movie may be the ultimate limit to how far a superhero ensemble can go before it becomes a helpless confused mess. Even the ultimate explanation and motivation of this convoluted manufactured conflict reveals a deeply tortured emotional underpinning, unlike most other super epics recently shown. In sum, Civil War is rather unique in standing out of the crowd with its ability to balance its many characters while retaining an intimate and personal storyline.

16 May 2016,"Visually appealing action, but lacks in everything else.","Captain America : The Civil War is the most awaited superhero movie for all Marvel and superhero's movies fans, but sadly for me, it failed as what it was supposed to be.

The movie is about the separation of the Avengers, where Captain America and Iron Man are fighting about an idea, the one where the government wants them to hide and wait for orders before acting. Though it is a serious subject and the two team leaders tries to prove their points, the movie never really goes far enough about this idea. Captain America : The Civil War is a 2 hours and 30 minutes of nothing much happening and where the story will be forgotten.It is mostly about Iron Man more than Captain America the the point where it doesn't feel like a Captain America movie like the 2 first ones.

Most of the credits of the movie goes towards the few actions scenes there are in the movies, they were well cut and explosives, though they don't feel like there are anything threatening to both teams. I appreciate the use of most of all the Avengers members and most of them shows good use of they're powers, props to Ant-Man and Spider-Man, they had good surprises. Overall, each actions scenes doesn't feels like a menace or anything, you don't fear for any characters and there are not a lots of emotions. There are evens some characters that are joking in the battlefield while fighting they're friends, it just doesn't feel serious and break the image of the ""war"" that is implied.

In the end, Captain America : Civil War feels like a useless entry to the MCU, there is not much things happening in between the action scenes and it feels like a 2h30 introduction to the next MCU movie, probably the next Avengers. Fans will love seeing they're favourites heroes fighting, but there is not any depths at all and was felt unsatisfactory when the credits started rolling. The movie felt long, but I was still surprised when the credits appeared because nothing was felt accomplished in the end. It is probably one of the weakest Marvel movie after the first Avengers. Lets hope The Black Panther can do better.",6

30 April 2016,Captain America 'Civil War' is a Masterpiece in Everyway.,"Captain America Civil war is the best Marvel movie to date. With an incredible story, action, emotions, fantastic performance and great direction. Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans show one more time that they were born to be play Captain America and Iron Man. But who really stole the show was Black Panther and Spider-Man. Marvel chose the perfect actor to portray the great king of Wakanda. But who really was the cherry on the cake was what Tom Holland. This guy is the perfect Peter Parker and Spider-Man with his great humor, which all fans were waiting. Anyway This film is a masterpiece, thanks to the Brothers Russo, now we can say that Avengers Infinity War part 1 and 2 is in good hands.

25 May 2016,Title must be misleading but...,"The movie may be titled Captain America but it is in fact, a full fledged Avengers film with all key characters getting equal roles.

Ice action packed movie..I felt like doing some action in theater. Insect guys were great..I mean ant man and Spiderman..Spiderman is just a teenage boy..but Tony Stark can convince any one..not a big deal. Antman becomes faint man and his grown up powers u can watch further in Jack and the bean stalk. Scarlet witch powers are all purple purple...don''t ask how she got her powers. Even powerless fighters like black widow picks up fight. She is least occupied because she doesn't have to sing and seduce with the hulk. Besides, it has one of the best action sequence seen in any superhero movie so far. On the tech front, the movie scores full marks for its outstanding CGI and visual effects. In short, a film not to be missed!

5 September 2016,The Vidiot Reviews...,"Captain America: Civil War

The good thing about being resuscitated today is Captain America and Bucky no longer have to hide their gay relationship.

Mind you, this action/fantasy still plays it as a brotherly bond.

When someone gains access to the Winter Soldier's (Sebastian Stan) trigger words, they order him to attack a UN conference on the registration of enhanced humans.

Now Cap (Chris Evans) and some like-minded Avengers (Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Jeremy Renner) are opposing Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) and the rest (Scarlett Johansson, Paul Bettany, Don Cheadle) in order to protect Bucky, and their right to fight ungoverned.

While it's the third entry in the Cap franchise, Civil War feels like a mini Avengers movie considering the number of cameos in it. Fortunately, Cap remains at the forefront of this multifaceted and masterfully crafted chapter.

However, unlike America's other Civil War this version has a serious lack of Mutton Chops.

7 May 2016,Best from Marvel since Guardians,"The third addition to the 'Captain America' films is here. This time our favorite hero's are pitted against each other after disagreeing when the government tries to limit their free rein. Needless to say, tensions get high and a fight between them breaks out. Or that's at least what we were pitched through the trailers. This is not what happens in the film. Surprisingly enough, It is very similar to 'Dawn of Justice'. This film offers far better editing and the stakes feel higher but that seems to be the only major differences. That was actually pretty disappointing to see. You all know my stance on 'Dawn of Justice' so I won't go into it.

But seeing these two very similar movies come out pretty close together made this one kinda boring. The entire time I couldn't help thinking I had seen a version of this already. That being said, this film is not much better than 'Dawn of Justice'. My biggest gripes are unfortunately directed right at the films biggest selling point.

The fact that these hero's are fighting each other. I liked the idea that there was repercussions to the mindless violence of the previous films. It made for an interesting bit of conflict early on in the movie. But it was handled very poorly. Surprisingly enough this was in direct correlation with the characters motives.

Which were incredibly stupid. Caps motives are simple, I'm not taking sides with the government because they are to restrictive. Iron Mans are not so simple. At first his arguments make sense. Regardless of the people we saved there are still thousands lost. And we have to be accountable for that.

But what spurred this disagreement? The film opens with a fight taking place between Cap with some others and a couple of bad guys. One guy tries blowing himself up to kill Cap but Witch lady contains the blast and throws him into the air. Right into the only building around them. It kills some people and other people get upset.

So you mean to tell me that this entire film could've been avoided if she, I don't know, threw him into the open space directly above her? Or just smashed him down into the ground? Right away the entire film feels delegitimized. They seriously could not have come up with a better excuse than, Oh a lot of people died because that witch lady can't aim worth crap?

Or the fact that the only reason Iron Man wants to side with the government is because some random lady got mad at him. Like, he walked out of a presentation and a random lady was just standing there starring at the wall. Was her whole plan to just stand there and wait for him so she could shove her son all over him? What if he went off a different way? What if he didn't care at all? Would this entire film not have happen if he just didn't care?

With in thirty minutes the only two characters that matter are given the stupidest motives ever. What about Black Panthers motives? Why didn't the blast that killed his father also kill him? He looked actually closer to it than his dad. Oh I get it, someone had to be mad at the Winter Soldier for this film to work in the slightest. All of this is at the very beginning of the film. By the end there was a mind boggling amount of plot holes and pretend risks being taking. So much so that I could spend hours talking about them, but I won't. Why? Because this film isn't that bad. All the performances were pretty great. As were the fight sequences. Especially the climatic fight scene. I won't go into why it made no sense but, logic aside, it was the only part of the film that was actually involving.

The film does a lot right. The action is gritty, the music is great, and the acting is pretty great across the board. But it's difficult to ignore the holes all over the script. It's plagued with lapses in logic, character motives, and it lacks the great story and villain it tries desperately hard to have. In the end this is worth seeing if only to watch your favorite characters throw down. Even if you'll have to wade through a lot of poor writing to get there.",6

13 September 2016,Great action and full of intensity! 8/10,"Review: I must admit, I wasn't that impressed with the first half of this film but when the action kicks in, it is truly superb. Watching, most of the Marvel heroes in one epic battle, was a spectacular moment in cinema but I'm sure that it would have been completely different if Thor and the Hulk was involved. I did find Bucky/Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) a bit dull, mainly because he was the cause of all the trouble and he didn't seem to speak or interact with anyone but maybe that's because everyone wanted to kill him. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), also wasn't his usual, charismatic self, which was a shame because the movie could have done with a bit of humour. They finally put the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) to good use, and some of his gadgets were quite impressive, and it was good to see the Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Spiderman (Tom Holland), play a big part in the epic battle. I'm not quite sure what the Black Widow's hero abilities are but she always seems to be in the middle of everything, and I think she is the only superhero to make an appearance in all of the Marvel movies. Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) seems to have the most unique super hero abilities out of all of the Avengers, to date but with a huge line-up in comic book hero movies planned in the future, I really can't imagine what direction these Marvel movies are going to go in but it's very exciting. This movie did seem more like an Avengers movie than a Captain America movie but as the focus was more on the Winter Soldier, I can understand why they put it under the Captain America umbrella. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the action scenes and the director gave each individual superhero some depth and well earned screen time. I can't wait for the next Marvel movie! Great!

Round-Up: I was surprised to see Black Widow come out without a scratch on her body, and a hair out of place, after the big explosion, which killed Black Panthers father and with all that commotion happening with the Avengers, we're was Nick Fury? Anyway, this movie was directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, who brought you Welcome to Collinwood, with George Clooney, You, Me and Dupree and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. I find it weird that these unknown directors, who haven't made anything that impressive, are chosen to make these humongous comic book hero movies! With such a huge task at hand, and a massive budget to control, I would have thought that the studios would have picked directors who have a lot of experience in this field, especially with so many different characters to bring to the big screen. In terms of the Marvel movies, these new directors are obviously out to prove that they have the ability to do something amazing, which is why I have been impressed with the outcome of the franchise so far. The Russo brothers are rumoured to be directing the Avengers: Infinity War, which is due to be released in 2018, so they certainly have there hands full, especially with the introduction of new super heroes in this movie. I do think that they done a great job with this film, even though the first half was a bit glum but the epic battle scenes were worth waiting for.

Budget: $250million Worldwide Gross: $1.1billion (WOW!)

I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/sci-fi movies, starring Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, William Hurt, Tom Holland and Daniel Bruhl. 8/10",8
11 May 2021,My perfect movie,"This film is the story from avenger age of Ultron because after that scene almost hero that fight to the monster and effect to the building which cause to the people in the city become died. The president of the USA call the congress to talk about that issue and define the new lawsuit to protect their country.

It control the power of marvel superhero this make Steve Roger angry because his friend will become illegal. But this law was written by Tony Stark who is the opposite team. In this film it separate into 2 group of hero which the first team has Captain America as a leader. The other team has Ironman. In my will i think this film tell us about the love and equality between friend and some argument that cause to the relationship of the family when it has a benefit it can broke the friendship but when you have a harmonium in your group it will help your relation and the lass I think the charm of MCU movie is the plot that is difficult to predict and it has so many surprises from the director. In the part of the actor Robert Downy Jr and Chris Evan was smart and powerful. Finally if you never watch the marvel comics universe film you should watch it ! It's very cool so i give it 10 star.",10

29 April 2016,Delightful,"NON-SPOILERS REVIEW

This is absolutely the best movie in the MCU and maybe one of the greatest superhero movies I've seen, it was absolutely brilliant. Russo brothers did it again. The tone was serious but at the same time it had the jokes and the fun, the script was organized, they show you the character motivations and let you choose side and I have to say that this is was I was expecting in BvS, the tension built and the subplots were correctly approached and the fight scenes were SPECTACULAR, the airport scene was the best action scene I've seen in my life. The acting was brilliant, special mention to Elizabeth Olsen (Wanda Maximoff). The introductions to the new characters were good executed and they didn't feel forced at all, and talking about that I have to say: Spiderman was awesome in the 2 or 3 scenes he shows up, Black Panther was incredible and I can't wait to see his solo movie. I don't have anything to complain about this movie, perhaps the villain felt unnecessary but the rest of the movie was brilliant. Look, I'm a HUGE Batman fan and I wanted BvS to be a 10/10 but sadly it wasn't and some of the reasons were that they seemed forced to introduce new characters and the script had some flaws, and this is how it has to be executed, the script was brilliant because the simple fact that they show you correctly the characters motivations and build the conflict to let you choose which side do you agree more and the way that they introduce Spiderman and Black panther was intelligent and accord with the movie's development.

Everything said, if you love comic book characters go to see this movie, if you love action go to see this movie, if you love thrillers go to see this movie, if you love good movies go to see this movie!!",10
18 August 2019,BRILLIANT!!! A TOUGH LOOK AT HERO CONFLICT.,"WOW!!! Civil War is absolutely Brilliant, the darker more serious tone of the excellent Winter Soldier has carried over to this fantastic film.

The action scenes & fight scenes are absolutely fantastic in Civil War, especially the frantic & exciting gritty opening action packed scene with Cross Bones & his terrorist team, it's outstanding.

A big cast of great actors & characters mixed into a political nightmare that's handled perfectly with a gritty & dark tone & dangerous Atmosphere. Steve Rogers is again fantastic as the troubled Captain America who is torn between what's right & wrong & friends & enemies & loyalties are broken, Civil War is a mature super hero movie. Just like the equally excellent Winter Soldier, this Civil War is handled with a sense of real grit & harsher so these characters feel like they exist in the real complicated world.

Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther is a fantastic actor & brings heart & soul to his character, Panther steals the show alot when he's on screen. There's so many Awesome characters here such as Spiderman, Ant-Man, Hawkeye, Black Widow & more great stars of the Marvel universe but it's the interesting & intense relationship between Steve Rogers & Tony Stark that is at the heart of this serious sci-fi Thriller. Captain America vs Iron man. The winter soldier himself Bucky is has a bigger & more tragic story here, he has been mind controlled for years & now has to deal with the torment of his past actions & the complete loneliness he feels as an outsider who is good at heart & best friends with childhood pal Steve Rogers but has been a deadly Assassin for so long he mind is a mess, IT'S a really well told little story arc for the character & he becomes one of the best characters in the movie.

Chris Evans is absolutely excellent in his iconic role as Steve Rogers/Cap & he's my reason for getting into these films of the Marvel universe, Captain is such a great Troubled character to follow on his adventures as he's a loner really, a lost man from a completely different world & he's always trying to find his porpoise & his meaning in this new messed up terrorist & corruption filled world.

Although this is a big budget Superhero film it's all handled like a deep serious Thriller just like The winter soldier & that's because of the excellent directors the Russo bros they know how to work a fantasy story & mixed it into a real grittier environment.

Captain America:Civil War is One of the greatest Marvel movies of all tine",8
7 May 2016,Best of the Marvel Universe,"I'll make this short and sweet....What a rancid piece of baboon sh*t!...just kidding! Actually, I consider this one of, if not the best film in the ""Marvel universe"" series! It also has, IMHO, the best super battle ever put on film, digital, whatever! Everything is here and it is a fan boy's wet dream and it is done so well. The filmmakers get it! My biggest issue is that there is way, WAY too much shaky cam during some of the fight scenes (Especially the action scene that opens the film). To get everything else so right and just not lock the f*cking camera down, so we can see and savor the action is frustrating. Thank Odin, they kept it to a minimum during THE epic super battle! Shaky cam just needs to be banned altogether. Period!!!!!! Anyway, it's great, it kick's ass and there is even a very poignant Agent Carter scene. Stay for all of the credits, cause there are 2 Easter egg scenes. Can't wait for more! PS - Tom Holland IS Spiderman and he rocks in this movie...Although I do have an ingrained vision in my head of what ""Aunt May"" should look like...And it doesn't look

6 August 2016,"Catholic Rabbits, Freight Cars, Soldiers?","And, the Black Cat! Bucky Barnes ""The Winter Soldier"" can't get a break. There seems to be a string of words that when spoken, makes him compelled to follow certain orders.

But something happened in 1991 that one weak chinned individual really wants to find out. It's locked in Bucky's Brain. But there is one other person who would want to know this secret: Tony Stark. Except he doesn't even know this secret exists.

This is the time of ""The Sekovia Accords"", the Avengers can't do a simple job without bunches of people getting killed and mass destruction abounding. Not their fault, bad guys are all over the place. Hydra is still being Hailed, but we don't see too much of them lately. Getting tired of Hydra anyway. Now, the world as a whole wants to have ""oversight"" over the Avengers. Tony Stark favors this, Cap America does not.

It's as simple as that, but nothing is simple anymore. And now, The Scarlet Witch is having a moment because she could not prevent something bad from happening, and The Vision, is he simply babysitting her, or keeping her locked up at The Avengers Mansion? Because there is an even better floating prison for super hero types who have gone off grid.

This disagreement between Stark and Cap causes an Avengers Rift and puts Cap on the other side of the law for once. All for Bucky's sake, wouldn't you do all you could for your best friend? But many people want to see Bucky dead. Others don't want him dead, just what he knows.

The question is, why? There is only one person who knows that, and he's well prepared to rip the Avengers into tiny kibbles and bits to find out about something that happened. On December 16, 1991. Look for William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, a jerk, this guy could cause severe problems in future movies.

Each one of these Marvel Movies outdo the previous ones, and I thought Deadpool was great, except for that CGI Colossus. So many Marvel Superheroes have been established, and now, more and more of them are appearing in every Marvel Entry. It's like they are writing Lord of the Rings as they go, and doing a fine job of it. This is like the Battle of Minas Tirith, and everybody shows up to play. Including Ant-Man, who shows us yet another Dimension, also true to the comics.

I was halfway expecting Tony Stark to be killed off, but that didn't happen. It is part of Marvel Canon, he was killed off and then resurrected by bringing his younger self into the future, this was a story arc from the Mid 90's. Actually I was expecting X-Men Apocalypse to be the ""Age of Apocalypse"" arc from around 1994, which lasted about 6 months, during which time the whole Marvel Universe had been turned inside out, Apocalypse controlled everything, Logan had his hand chopped off, and Magneto was the head of The X-Men. The ""M'Kraan Crystal"" which held the fabric of reality in check, had been broken by ""Legion"", who was Charles Xavier's son. But in these current films, we keep seeing these ""Infinity Stones"" that can twist realities apart showing up. And one of then is in The Vision's head!

I have seen plans for a ""Legion"" film as well. There are already holes in the X-Universe due to ""Days of Future Past"" which I thought was done well, and now with the handing off of the X-Men principle actors to their younger counterparts, how long before this happens with our Avengers? We're selfish, we want to see more and more with these same actors playing our beloved characters.

It is too bad that it takes so long for these films to be made, I just hope that RD Jr keeps playing Iron Man, Cheadle keeps being War Machine, at least for a while, these actors are all in their prime and could probably finish the whole arc with no problem.

This film gives us yet another rendition of Spider-Man, I really liked the Toby Maguire version, and I also liked the Garfield version too, he was good in that role. Should have used the same guy here, but I like this new Spidey. Odd to see Spidey as one of the Avengers, but that too, is Marvel Canon.",10
18 May 2016,Appropriately Action-Heavy and Vibrant; Overstuffed and Unfocused at Times,"An impassioned disagreement breaks Earth's greatest superteam in half and ultimately drives them to fight with more than just words. It's basically The Avengers 2.5, but you already knew that. And like the preceding two star-studded chapters, most of what makes it work is the thrill of seeing all the big names geared up together, slinging zingers and blowing dollars through the VFX budget like t-shirts from a cannon. It's a more serious take for the series, sober and steely outside of a few great jabs from the new guys (Ant-Man and Spider-Man steal the show on this front). Which is fine, it adds a necessary level of gravitas to the subject and it wouldn't seem proper for Iron Man to be going all tongue-in-cheek while he's trying to punch his buddy's eyebrows off. That heavy-duty weight can make the film feel long and overstuffed, though, and all told I was feeling a bit weary by the time it got around to wrapping itself up. There's a whole lot of action, as you'd have to expect, but this time it feels less grounded than in the past. It's as comic book as the MCU has ever been, really, with loads of Kool Aid-colored lights shining around the room, bodies flying through walls and one ridiculous chase scene in which our heroes sprint through traffic at highway speeds. And that's the focus, no doubt about it: action with a side of Bucky, whose quest for answers and redemption seems far more important than the moral dilemmas and personality clashes that split the Avengers. Personally, I was more interested in that lesser-explored gray area, but at the end of the day it's Cap on the marquee so I can understand the emphasis on his pet plot threads. It's a strong, solid entry and a fine continuation of this cornerstone franchise, but at times it tries to pull off too much. Could've easily been broken into two films, and I'm almost never one to recommend trying something like that.",7
16 May 2016,"""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016)","What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",7
28 April 2016,"Very entertaining, but far from an actually great film.","I'm not a Marvel fan and I don't really care for blockbusters, but I saw Civil War to see if it would maybe change my mind. It didn't. To say Civil War is a bad movie, though, is false. It's not a bad movie at all, it's a good movie, and that's about it, really. Just like most Marvel films - with the exception of Guardians of The Galaxy, their best - directing throughout most of the film is bland, generic, like the camera is there to show what's going on and that's it. Dialogues are shot in the most traditional and tasteless way, exposition is everywhere, editing is irritating and distracting, using way too many camera set-ups because, apparently, they think the average film goer has a 10 second attention span. Not even visually the film pushes any boundaries. There are, though, indeed good qualities to it all: the plot is very good and treated in a straightforward and interesting way, diverging from the traditional Marvel Formula plot we've seen in many movies before but wouldn't be able to hold a film of this size. Apart from that, the true standout here, where the film really is able to be a little more than expected, are the action scenes. Civil War has some of the single best choreographed fight scenes I've ever seen in American cinema, a level I had only witnessed in Korean action films, though most of the action in CW is downgraded by the frustrating Hollywood editing. In the end, even considering all the flaws, it's all very fun, and if you already like these characters, you'll probably love the film anyway.",7

22 June 2016,It's More than Meets the Eye,"It's happened: our heroes have turned against one another. Just the image above proves what the Avengers have come to: turning on one another in a state of civil war over their limit to government control. No more fun and games—it's time to really challenge what they stand for.

I'll admit that I don't care too much about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They're fun to sit through in a theater full of other excited fans, but nothing about them resonates too deeply. But now, Captain America: Civil War has become one of the better of the movies within the trope. It's packed with the excitement, twists, fun, and laughter that we all expect from Marvel at this point. While it isn't worth multiple viewings, it is worthwhile for the teens, as there's more under that shiny armor than what meets the eye.

Based on the 2007 Civil War comic books, this third addition to Captain America's misadventures turns him into a criminal that the nation has lost its hope in. It's similar to Batman v. Superman, except done right. The Avengers now find themselves in a public media predicament after a mishap in a Lagos chemical heist ends with several people dying thanks to them. Now, the government decides to let the United Nations Panel instruct the super team. Looks like Captain America now has to clear his name not only with the politicians, but his own close friends and teammates.

Minus Hulk and Thor, all the heroes you know and love are back in action: Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Mass Destruction, Hawkeye, Falcon, and Ant-Man, plus some new faces as well: the smoothly cunning Black Panther and your friendly neighborhood, Spider-Man. Now let me tell you, it's the webslinger's third reboot within a decade, and at last they got the character right! Within the first 10 seconds, you will instantly say to yourself, ""Yes! Tom Holland was born to be Peter Parker! And Spider-Man!"" His backstory is also smartly left out. After all, we already know it as this point, right? The rest of the heroes also have their share of some great laughs, Vision in particular, and they always seem to have tons of fun with each other on set. But I have one complaint though: it's the same old shtick we've always seen. We've got a super talented cast that includes Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlet Johansson, and they're doing the same thing we've always seen them do. It's not them that's the problem, it's the two directors, brothers Anthony and Joe Russo. They just don't know how to stage actors while getting worthwhile performances.

There are some cool decision that these two make in continuing the series, and some not so cool. With the action scenes, it's impossible to tell whether if they're awesome or pathetic.

But first, the good stuff: a garbage truck breaks down the arch in front of a medical center, Johansson totally rocks in combat action, there's a tunnel chase, Captain America holds down an entire helicopter by himself, the Avengers fight one another in one of the best moments of the entire movie series, and one hero has a big surprise that I cannot mention out of fear of spoiling anything.

Now, the bad stuff: It's hard to see the action because of the sped up footage and shaky camera (you know what I'm talking about), the editing is monstrous, characters who needed backstories didn't get one, the VFX looks fake a lot of the time, Black Panther appears out of nowhere and at an unbelievably convenient time, and there is too much talking that takes away the tension.

So therefore, the action is neither awesome nor pathetic. It's awesomely pathetic. Or is that pathetically awesome? Nah, I'll go with the first option.

What I love right now about the Marvel Cinematic Universe is how every hero has his own story to tell. What makes it better is how this series makes that concept work so well, almost like it's the narrative of television marrying the narrative of film! I also like how it points out the issue of heroes creating mass destruction and putting the people in danger, possibly out of reaction towards Man of Steel. Although I probably could've done with a shorter film and a clearer plot, it's neat to see how all the subplots come together in the end.

It's always a ton of fun to anticipate and sit through these movies on a big screen with hundreds of other excited fans. But you know what else? We can learn a lot about ourselves from the Avengers. It's already clear that we're a divided nation when it comes to things like whether trans-gendered people should use public restrooms of their choosing. It's just incredible how Marvel can take these abstract conditions of our country and simplify them. The Marvel Cinematic Universe may not produce all around perfect films, but it knows how to get the youth of the country out of our state of civil war. Overall Grade: C+",6

10 January 2019,Average,"This movie was heavy on action and thin on plot, but I liked what plot there was, the action scenes the interaction among the characters, and the introduction of Spiderman to the ensemble. This was a good entry to the Marvel Comics movie universe. I think the special effects were good, and I loved Stan Lee's cameo.

1 May 2016,"""Captain America: civil war"" review","With two superheroes going head to head in one movie, this movie is made to be a real turning point. Captain America: civil war is the third movie about Captain America and has to follow two movies that were great. But what can you expect form a movie where superheroes don't fight against evil but against each other?

There are two teams in this movie, on the one side you have Iron man (Robert Downey Jr.) and on the other side Captain America (Chris Evans). Let's begin with Iron man. ...

16 April 2016,Pretty Good,"This movie was pretty good there were some scenes in the movie that did not add up but overall it was good. It did not meet my expectations but it was still better than a recent movie that came out. I cannot talk too much about it as it will ruin the story-line for many people. The acting of each character was amazing but the story line had its flaws. I did not know who's side to choose iron man or captain America I was quite confused. Captain Ameriica and Iron Man were the ones who stole the spotlight and made this movie amazing. This movie was a fun action packed movie and I highly recommend it but there were little errors in the story line. But overall loved it.

27 May 2016,A Spoiler-Free Review,"Captain America: Civil War would not have been possible if it weren't for the shared Marvel Cinematic Universe. If this was attempted without all the other Avengers movies and Iron Man movies, this movie would not be as good, and it is proof that the Marvel model of making movies works when done with enough forethought.

In Civil War, Iron Man and Captain America find themselves at odds over a new bit of legislation that would have the Avengers answering to the United Nations. Cap thinks the Avengers should remain free to make their own choices, while Iron Man believes they need oversight, thus the battle commences. While there are a great many twists and turns that happen, I don't want to spoil that for anyone, because all anyone wants to really know is if this movie is worth their money, and that is a resounding yes.

Look, by this point if you haven't jumped on the Marvel Studios train, this movie wont be the thing that gets you onboard, but if you have been a fan of every Marvel movie thus far, then this is going to be an emotional roller coaster ride from start to finish. This is top notch blockbuster movie-making and it needs to be experienced on the big screen. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo really get these characters, which is why it's great that they're also directing the next two Avengers movies. Of course the greatest aspect of Civil War is that while it features a lot of Avengers and can at times feel like another Avengers movie, it still never forgets that Captain America is the main character of this movie. While I still personally would have loved to have seen another Cap solo movie instead, like The Winter Soldier, Civil War is a great substitute.

I give Captain America: Civil War a 9 out of 10!",9
3 November 2019,Captain America Civil War,"Captain America Civil War is a great Captain America and Avengers movie. It has a great plot and some of the most memorable action scenes. The airport battle and final battle were amazing. The villain was pretty good with understandable motivations but some of the things in his plan that happened were kind of convenient. The introduction to Black Panther and Spider-Man were great. This was a great follow up to Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron.

6 June 2017,Review – Captain America: Civil War (2016),"The Russo brothers, who had just mediocre films like 'You, Me and Dupree' and 'Welcome to Collinwood' to their credit, literally shot to the top with the excellent second instalment in Marvel's Captain America series. Also, Joss Whedon set the MCU ensemble bar really high with 'The Avengers' (2012) and 'Age of Ultron' (2015) (with the former being a slightly more entertaining film).

Hence, the Russos had a behemoth of a task at hand while making the third instalment in the Cap series, which by the first look and initial story-reveal looked on route to becoming Avengers 2.5. And boy, did they deliver in style. Civil War is hands-down the best ensemble MCU film by far. It is a definite crowd-pleaser by all means, although we missed the likes of Bruce Banner, Thor and Nick Fury.

Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the writers of Thor 2 and Cap 2, pen a screenplay that strikes a fulfilling balance of action, emotion, comedy, and filled with twists and surprises. Story goes as simple as this: Stark and Rogers are for and against political interference in the activities of the Avengers respectively, and this leads to the team splitting into two, and the events that follow form the core of 'Civil War'.

While Marvel crazies already knew of the plot line and had watched several scenes of the film published via YouTube, it was undoubtedly a huge task to match the expectation levels set by the previous films. But the Russos have dethroned all previous entries by handing us Civil War. The way the screenplay tackles the character of Bucky Barnes is certainly one of the many highlights in the film. Sebastian Stan returns to play his meatiest role yet, and sheds more light on his Winter Soldier persona. As seen in Cap 2, the set- pieces in Civil War (both on the ground and in the sky) look remarkably well-shot and choreographed. So many swift cuts coupled with fast-paced action elevates the movie to a different platform altogether. Upper-cuts, blows, kicks and punches are landed neatly and put to good effect. The Leipzig airport set-piece positions itself right on top of the list of the best choreographed action sequences ever made on film. Trent Opaloch's cinematography is reminiscent of his work in District 9, Elysium, Cap 2 and Chappie.

Well, it is unquestionably a treat for the senses to watch Team Cap (Rogers, Bucky, Wilson, Barton, Lang and Maximoff) go head-on-head with Team Iron-Man (Stark, Romanoff, Rhodes, Vision, T'Challa and Parker). The propaganda for each character is etched out with utmost subtlety. Captain America, Iron Man and Bucky Barnes take the bulk of the screen time and they pull off their acts quite convincingly. Daniel Bruhl's Zemo serves as a great antagonist pulling all the right strings and chooses to spread villainy by making the Avengers go against each other. Chris Evans is incredible as Cap, while Downey shines in a role that requires him to be comparatively subdued (and guilt-ridden).

While it is unmistakably Cap's and Iron Man's film, Civil War fleshes out two major additions to the MCU in astounding fashion..T'Challa a.k.a Black Panther & Peter Parker a.k.a Spiderman. Chadwick Boseman does a great job with what he's been handed out and sets the stage for his solo film. Tom Holland appears to be the most promising Spiderman yet, and he gets to show off his skills in that wonderfully executed airport sequence. Also, that scene where Tony Stark goes to meet Parker is effing hilarious. Paul Rudd's Ant Man also made the proceedings a lot wittier and enjoyable. Every character shines in their individual roles, and credit should go to the writers and the directorial duo for giving each superhero an adequate amount of screen time. Except for Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye (who I felt appeared bland and underwritten in this film), all characters leave an impression that is sufficient for the viewer to care for their futures in the upcoming Infinity War films. Stan Lee's cameo towards the end was a nice touch.

Marvel looks like they hit the jackpot here, especially with DC's Batman V Superman being a strictly mediocre film and performing way below expectations; they can allow to rest their heads for a bit because the groundwork for the Spiderman / Black Panther solo films as well as the Infinity War sequels have been laid out almost impeccably in Civil War.

Oh, and hold on to your seats for the mid-credits as well as post- credits scenes.😉",8

11 June 2017,"The Best Avengers Movie... er, Captain America Movie To Date.","Just when the Avengers stories were getting stale and very familiar, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely along with directors Anthony and Joe Russo bring us the best Avengers movie to date... except that it isn't since it's Capt's film.

Let's get this out of the way, this is loosely based on Mark Millar's opus though it could never reach the depths of characterisation or story in just the two and half hour runtime. Though the story has been pared down to the minimum basics of the original, what we do get is very entertaining. After the disastrous effects of Age Of Ultron the governments of the world are wanting to put a leash on the Avengers and all other heroes. Not all of the heroes are accepting of this arrangement, especially Captain America who goes off on his own.

The only thing I would have liked in this film is a deeper look at the psychological effects the Sokovia Sanctions, which are addressed in the graphic novels. This would have made it stronger and more accessible to adults. They could have done this without changing the certification.

It was also nice to see the other newbies to the Marvel universe - Ant- Man, The Black Panther, and of course The Amazing Spiderman. It was great seeing Spidey finally mixing it up in the with The Avengers and with the changing eye lenses in his costume and the best and most accurate portrayal yet, from Tom Holland - Awesome. Though I'm not too sure about the upcoming Homecoming movie or the role Stark is to play in Peter Parkers costume. The star of this film though has to be The Black Panther - Chadwick Boseman gives a brilliantly cool portrayal of the hero prince of Wakanda.

The rest of the cast give the performances we are used to from the rest of the series.

Thanks to the directors, the action is fast and furious, and thanks to Spidey and Ant-Man pretty funny. The effects are superb, as always, and they don't overpower the story or the screen as with previous films - the fight scene on Ultron was too busy and confusing (and too short). The pace is varied and creates a roller-coaster ride of a film which helps keep the emotions of the viewers fluctuating between excitement and the dramatic. This is a well-constructed and crafted movie.

For me, this third instalment of the Captain America series is the best; and as I stated at the start it's also the best Avengers movie too. If you've not started watching any of the Marvel Universe films yet then this is one to catch. It works as a stand-alone movie as it references the previous films in a way that you don't need to see them to know what's happening here. In regards to both Captain America and The Avengers, this is the only movie in each of the series which I will watch more than once, it is that enjoyable.",9
9 May 2016,You Chose the Right Side,"From the very beginning, story was moved in the right direction . it introduced us two new superheroes in the right manner,It made us to like or even more it made us to become a fan to them immediately.performance of everyone was excellent as always .Stunt choreography was neat,especially the airport fight scene.All the characters are used efficiently . In my opinion i liked civil war more than ultron & winter solider, this one has delved in to story more than other two movies. Russo Brothers promises us that we can expect more in Infinity war from them.

Overall Movie was IMPECCABLE.

Go with high expectations, believe me you wont get disappointed.

And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",8
7 May 2016,top 5 comic movie? maybe,"Where to begin? I went in with high expectations and was not let down at all! Civil war gives you exactly what you expect, and my fears of the film being to clustered did not come true. The russo bros managed to give you ample time with each character and each of them bring something unique, ant-man had a BIG role in parts of this and it was just perfect, black panther is probably the show stealer, his demeanor and everything is just nasty! I would say it up past avengers AoU but its not of the same scale of that movie, but the story is must see! I need to see it again just to catch all the small details that i know are stuffed in the 2 and a half hours, but for the most part you can grasp and stay along for the ride fairly easily, not a lot of slow parts, and if there is...you are definitely engaged.

22 June 2022,Hero vs hero,"The entire superhero cast is great, like Chris Evans as Captain America/Steve Rogers and Robert Downy Jr as Iron Man/Tony Stark. The rest of the heroes are cool seeing, especially with having them being divided and fighting each other.

The conflict in the movie is worth the heroes talking about. I like how Captain America/Steve Rogers and Iron Man/ Tony Stark are at odds with each other to build up the drama of the situation.

I still like Sebastian Stan as The Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes, I like how at times he will be on the run trying to hide from his past but when Steve Rogers helps him you see they have a friendship.

The action scenes are fun, especially when the heroes fight each other in an airport. I liked Zemo as the villain, I liked his backstory and that he has a reason for wanting to tear the Avengers apart.

This is a great Marvel movie that is also a cool addition to the Captain America movies. I liked Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) more than Captain America: Civil War (2016) but I they are both awesome movies.",7
8 August 2020,"Yes, this is Tony Stank,,","Again,, the Russo bros are geniuses!! I didn't think Winter Soldier could be out done,, but they did it!

After the Avengers save the world several times they are reminded that all the battles leave a lot of destruction and many people have died. So the governments of the world devise the Sokovia Accords as a way to keep the team in check. Still sick with the guilt of creating Ultron, Stark jumps on board with hesitation, as do Rhodes, and Romanoff (don't know if Vision was required to or not). Rogers and Wilson are completely against the idea.

12 May 2016,"Not too bad, not too great","It must be me, but it bothers me seeing all these people flipping about this movie, like it's the greatest thing they've ever seen in their life's when they are going to forget it after 2-3 weeks, but they must love it in order to be ""cool"". I don't blame them, I mean its been years and years since the last big great blockbuster has been shown in cinemas and they forgot what a good movie should be.

Action: 9/10 Drama: 0/10 Story: 2/10 Character: haha Dialog: if it wasn't for the ""hilarious jokes"" there wouldn't be dialog at all, so 1/10.

It was fun and fast only because of the action and nothing else. It's strange how you can make tons of money just by filming action and only action these days. I don't know, I prefer movies with a story, plots, twists, subplots, character depth, meaningful dialog, good music. To connect with something, not just with my pop-corn and soda. I can do that anytime I want for the love of god.

To me this movie was bland, shallow, just entertaining to kill 2 and half hours and thats about it. The actors are great, I give you that but they don't make the movie great.

It's like Marvel is on a loose feeling safe and secure with their huge fan-base and not putting enough effort into the films anymore. Hell, even BvS was better than this one.

Anyway 5/10 due to the action and the actors, other than that would've been complete failure.",5
19 March 2019,A mini-Avengers movie or a Captain America movie?,"A moral dilemma. Friends or foes? A good mix of premises. This is more of a mini-Avengers movie than a Captain America feature but that doesn't diminish it, quite the reverse. With their very existence affecting the larger world, it seemed right to stop and take a look at the implications of the epic battles of superheroes vs super villains on the world at large. The cast is a dream. It was a great opportunity to introduce Black Panther and Spider-Man (I'd forgotten what mad skills Spider-Man brought to the fight). A lot of dialogue for this script but the action scenes were a good balance. Even on rewatching, I give his movie an 8 (great) out of 10. {Superheroes Action Adventure}

29 April 2018,This movie is incredible.,"There's a reason why Marvel has such a big fanbase, and why I am a part of it. This movie is extremely entertaining. The characters are consistent and interesting. The action and effects are nearly flawless. The story is engaging. Its hard for me to write reviews for this type of movie, because pretty much everything is done perfectly that the review would end up being redundant. Any nitpicks are drowned out by how entertaining this movie is. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially if you're a fan of Marvel.

7 May 2016,The Best MCU Movie to Date,"Just when you thought they couldn't make a better movie than The Avengers, the Russo brothers go and make something like this. The idea of Civil War is tricky, pitting friends against one another all the while they try to remain 'the good guys'. You might be questioning why the would turn on one another, but the script actually provides some sound reasoning per character. Guilt (and a bit of revenge) consumes those who wish to sign the accords and limit their impunity, while those opposing feel the politics behind it won't solve a thing.

Captain America: Civil War (aka The Avengers 2.5) might just be the best MCU movie to date (I'm sure the general public will label it as such). While that may be up in the air, it without a doubt features the best action sequence of the entire franchise, the airport scene. Not only does it feature some new unseen heroes fighting for the first time, but it also features ample amount of humor (mostly thanks to Spiderman). It is the highlight of the movie and actually the highlight of the franchise so far.

But again, the main fault in my eyes (as usual) is that we are still treading water on a cosmic level. Thanos and his minions are still plotting their schemes and have yet to make their presence known to the Avengers. I'm still hopeful to get more screen time away from Earth and get the feeling the entire universe is in peril. One can only hope.

As a whole though, Civil War is a fantastic blockbuster. It features more avengers than any movie to date and gives us plenty of action pieces to make the two hour and 30 minutes run-time fly by.",8
12 June 2017,A pretty damn good comic book flick,"This is one of the better Marvel films. It bites off a lot of items ... continuing the Winter Soldier plot, introducing Black Panther, introducing Spider-Man, continuing the Avengers plot, bring Ant-Man into the greater fold ... but without succumbing to the ""too many plot lines"" issue that buries so many comic book sequels. It even manages to work in a climax that does not involve blue light shining up into the sky and all the heroes fighting hordes of enemies. It's not as good as the previous Captain America film and nowhere near as refreshing as ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", but it delivers what a film like this should and it does it well.

10 September 2017,"A Solid, Exciting Adaptation of Marvel's Civil War","Comic book superhero movies have been blowing up theaters for almost twenty years now. Marvel has been reigning champion for more than half that time, and DC has stepped up their game with their opening moves toward building a cinematic universe. What I'm saying is we've seen a lot of costumed heroes beating up on supervillains and foiling their plots at world domination/destruction/etc. at this point. To keep things fresh, the studios have to find ways to change it up and 2016 saw not one but two different films focused on superheroes turning their fists on their brethren (well, three if you include X-MEN: APOCALYPSE where Storm was temporarily on the villain's team). While Batman's battle with Superman failed to be the explosive intro to Warner's eventual JUSTICE LEAGUE they might've hoped it be (especially critically), the civil war in Marvel's cinematic universe went to show that you could put cram all of your existing superhero roster into a film, go so far as to introduce a few more new characters, give them all a reason to brawl, and still come out with box office gold. CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is Marvel's most ambitious film to date and had every reason to fall apart, but the team behind the camera managed to put together one of the best entries in the studio's canon. It manages to avoid the increasingly cliché superhero storytelling tropes and also shakes up the inter-character dynamics amongst the dozen or so heroes we've come to know.

Civil War is the only run of comics I've made a point to read in its entirety. I read all of the core issues as well as all of the individual hero runs that went alongside it. Needless to say, I was beyond excited at the announcement that Marvel Studios would be tackling the story arc for the third film in the Captain America series, but I was also worried because there was just so much that happened in the comics that I feared a version boiled down to two or so hours wouldn't do it justice. In the end, having seen the finished product, I love it. It doesn't hold up as well under multiple viewings. On my first viewing, I thought it the best Captain America film and one of the top Marvel films period. Since then, I've come to accept that I was a bit blown away by the spectacle (that airport battle!) and I've adjusted my opinions and recognize that, while it's most certainly awesome, there are still better Marvel films. I have had some regrets with the film though. In the comics, it goes a little darker at the midpoint when the heroes on both sides realize the consequences of their actions (the movie pulls it's punches and there are no tragic long-term consequences of their in-fighting) and I still sort of wish they'd kept the original dramatic end from the comics (you know the onewith Captain America) because of the impact it would've left.

I understand their reasons for the changes from comic to screen (can't shake up the status quo in this money machine too much) but I would've really appreciated the studio showing it was willing to make a drastic change for dramatic impact in service of the series. Instead, injuries will heal and, while there's still a rift in our Avengers by the end of the film, we know they'll reconcile when it comes time to fight Thanos in INFINITY WAR. So, in the long run, their squabbles don't mean much but they do make for a great movie. And we got to meet some new characters! CIVIL WAR introduces us to Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the new Spider-Man (Tom Holland). Boseman gives a strong performance as T'Challa/Black Panther but isn't given a whole lot to do other than brood and chase vengeance; regardless, there's the seed of a great new hero for the cinematic universe and it's increased my interest for his upcoming standalone. Spider-Man, on the other hand, was the big draw for me. I know I wasn't alone in my excitement for his arrival in the MCU after the AMAZING SPIDER-MAN franchise fell to pieces. Tom Holland is pitch perfect as the web-slinger and the filmmakers have captured the spirit of the character better than both Sam Rami and Marc Webb ever managed. It's no surprise that Marvel themselves would be the ones to do the character justice, even if it's only for an extended cameo in the middle of the film.

Despite all the superhero-on-superhero violence and new hero introductions, this is still a Captain America film and the main through-line still focuses on Captain America and the Winter Soldier. It somewhat continues from WINTER SOLDIER in that Bucky Barnes is still a wanted international criminal, though he's recovered enough of his memories that he isn't a threat, and Steve Rogers still has his back. The Winter Soldier is accused of bombing a meeting of the United Nations and Captain America goes rogue to clear his name; meanwhile, a botched Avengers mission in Africa ends with civilian deaths and the United Nations moves to pass the Sokovia Accords, a program that would require government registration of all vigilante heroes. It's Rogers' willingness to disobey the Accords in an effort to clear Barnes' name that leads to the dispute between him and Tony Stark/Iron Man, whose guilty conscience leads him to give his full support to the Accords. So the spectacle and abundance of heroes are great, but this is still a Cap story at heart and CIVIL WAR is another home run from the Russo brothers, in what originally started as my least anticipated Marvel film franchise but has since become one of its strongest.",8
7 May 2016,Wow!!,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has grown to encompass twelve films and four TV series the lions share of which have been enthusiastically accepted and celebrated by audiences and critics. That's close to a decade now where a cultural phenomenon, based on superhero spectacle, larger-than-life characters and interesting stories, has surpassed every other tent-pole to become the largest franchise ever. Captain America: Civil War (or Avengers 2.5 as it is dubbed) is lucky number thirteen. With a slate full of interconnected movies still set to 2019, it can be reasonably assumed at least one of these things has to be a dud, a catastrophe, a Batman & Robin (1997) level misfire. Will Civil War, with it's bloated cast, be the straw that breaks the camel's back? Have we finally reached a point were the massive MCU begins to crumble? Can Civil War meet expectations or will choke haphazardly on its own opulence?

The answer is not only a resounding no but a loud, thunderous hell no! Civil War is not only one of the most unabashedly entertaining popcorn blockbusters to come out of this year so far, it rivals The Avengers (2012) and Iron Man (2008) as one of the strongest Marvel films to exist since the inception of the studio's grand design. Manufactured with the determined ardor of its titular hero and forged with the surprisingly ductile malleability of the ever expanding MCU, Civil War is a rollicking ride, completely self-assured in its ability to please. Never have I seen a blockbuster so sure of itself; flexing its well toned, well hardened muscles to the amazement and guffaws of the film's target audience (which might as well be everyone at this point).

The film simultaneously continues the long-hanging character threads of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and that of Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) and wraps them into a nice little bow while leaving a little something more to keep us hungry for more. Captain Steve Rogers (Evans) and his fellow Avengers botch a mission in Lagos, Nigeria leading to the collateral deaths of Wakandan aid workers. Secretary of State Ross (Hurt) sees the growing death toll directly and indirectly caused by the Avengers as cause for alarm, and asks them to sign a treaty relinquishing their private status. After the damage cause by Ultron, Iron Man (Downey Jr.) becomes the treaty's strongest advocate and obliges Black Widow (Johansson), War Machine (Cheadle) and Vision (Bettany) to sign. Captain America and Falcon (Mackie) however refuse. Things become much more complicated when a bombing during the signing of the treaty is blamed on Cap's old friend, the mind-controlled super soldier Bucky aka Winter Soldier (Stan). What's worse, the bombing killed the Wakandan King whose son T'Challa (Boseman) vows revenge. T'Challa uses the resources of his country to construct a Vibranium suit he uses to battle foes as Black Panther. Meanwhile Cap and Falcon race to find the Winter Soldier before authorities do, and try to get to the bottom of who's behind the bombing.

Other plot points involve Ant-Man (Rudd), Scarlet Witch (Olsen), Hawkeye (Renner) and (drum-roll) Spider-Man (Holland); gingerly added on to the espionage thriller antics and burgeoning rivalry that dominates the film. Seeing all the plot elements on paper would make anyone assume the film resembles a house of cards, poised to topple at the first slight breeze. Well folks, not only does the movie stand on its own, it juggles the various side-plots in such a way that it would make even the smallest theater audience erupt in applause. I honestly don't know whether I should be amazed, impressed, waiting gleefully in anticipation for further installments of the MCU or feel bad for DC whose own expanded universe is struggling to get past the starting line. Not to bring up a sour point but Captain America: Civil War sidesteps the problems that plagued Batman V Superman (2016) in such a way as to resemble a guy on the best day of his life skipping past a dirty puddle.

Civil War is so sure of itself as a movie that its central conflict is relatively minor when compared to the world shattering exploits of Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and the Thor series (2011-2017). Our main villain Zemo (Bruhl), for all his malevolent posturing, fades into the background with intentions so intimate as to be both inconsequential and surprisingly melancholic all at once. His master plan proves simple when compared to the lofty goals of Loki, Ultron or even Ivan Vanko, yet the results he gets prove emotionally loaded. It's just as well since the infighting between the Avengers proves electrifying with everyone (yes even Hawkeye) having a chance to shine. Particular praise should be bestowed upon the minor appearances of Spider-Man and Ant-Man who despite small screen times leave big impressions in more way than one.

The MCU has officially reached critical mass. Even if the upcoming Doctor Strange (2016), Thor: Ragnarok (2017) or Black Panther (2018) are all total busts, they can do nothing to damage Disney and Marvel's endgame which as far as narrative goes is an ultimate, mind-blowing showdown in The Infinity Wars (2018-2019). What started as a risky little idea has turned into the dominant force in an entire popular movie genre and by extension the childhood and young adulthood of an entire generation. Civil War is but one of the tightest bolts in the machine that promises at least three more years of comic-book superhero bliss. Like the Death, taxes and Donald Trump, the MCU is now an unassailable reality. Here's to hoping it does us well.",9
30 April 2016,"Great story, amazing action, beautiful character design, but a bit rushed out","The story in this movie is great, it has great motives and it made audiences question which side is right. It is darker than previous marvel movies and has a more serious topic since it's about politics, human experimenting, terrorism, and the causes of the destruction caused by The Avengers.

The characters are so well written, they all have their motives except a few characters that i will talk about later. Captain having to decide whether he should help his friend Bucky and break the law or to support the government act to control the action of The Avengers. While Tony, trying to do what's right for him after seeing the aftermath of all the battle The Avengers fought before.

And of course, the best part of the movie that is, the action. The action in this movie is phenomenal. It has the same style with the one in Winter Soldier, which we all love very much. But now, we had tons of other superheroes involves. And how they introduce and design Black Panther is amazing. But with Spider-Man.. Well i really liked the actor as Peter Parker. He got the witty nerd act going on. But once he jumped to the Spider-Man suit, well he never did actually since Spider-Man is just pure CGI, a bad CGI. And how they put Spider-Man in the movie is so rushed out. The character's involvement in the plot itself aren't even significant. It went the same with Ant-Man. They could honestly left them out from the film and it wouldn't make a difference, well beside that one awesome fight scene will be less epic. But in a serious movie with these deep characters, the two characters felt really out of place with their over the top sense of humor. I really wished they were introduced slower so we get to see the character developed more.

The other thing about the movie I didn't like, is that the first half of the movie is very serious, emotional, and political but then BOOM action orgasm comes in. The action scene is awesome though, I loved them. But they shouldn't be very straight forward about it. They really just slapped it in the audience face. And how the plot progressed slow then suddenly every superhero on the earth start hitting each other up and blowing stuff up. But excluding all that, the ending was awesome and very emotional. It's certainly is better than the rest of the superhero movies that has came out this year and I even think it will be better than the rest to come (X-men, Suicide Squad, and Dr Strange). Definitely my top 5 marvel movie.

WATCH IT NOW!",7
5 May 2016,It's an OK movie and not great,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",7
1 May 2016,this can be considered as the classic of the comic action film!,"Well well well , Marvel have done it again ! What an amazing movie that was. excellently Written movie , from the start to the end this movie was so brilliant. Weeks before this movie was released I was wondering how they would fit every characters role on screen but I was excelled at how good it was. Each character had an perfect amount of screen time. The movie was very well paced so it kept me extremely interested throughout the whole movie. Also the story line was brilliantly produced that I could not have imagined. Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland played Black Panther and Spiderman beautifully which was a relief. All in all Captain America Civil War Was a great movie and broke a lot of expectations ! Can't wait for the rest of the marvel movies :) !!!

8 March 2019,"Another expertly made piece in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that makes me excited for any follow-on films in ""Phase 3.""","When it comes to sequels, I fell very few film franchises do their predecessors justice. In my opinion, a great sequel requires a simple formula: cause and effect. The ""cause"" should be in the form of the first (or in this case, previous) movie(s). Whatever happens before a sequel should drive the plot of the following movie. This is the ""effect."" While it wasn't nearly as good as this effort, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) followed the same formula. Cause: Superman destroying most of Metropolis in Man of Steel (2013). Effect: Batman and Lex Luthor wanting to hold Superman accountable. See? Simple as that.

What perhaps makes Captain America: Civil War such a great film is the amount of ""cause"" that led to its ""effect."" The driving plot of this film was in direct response to the destruction and mayhem brought about by the Avengers trying to save the world. Because of this, the difference in opinions on how to cut back on the collateral damage splits the Avengers in to two factions. Practically every superhero fan will tell you that the best fights are the ones between allies, and this film certainly delivers on that premise.

But Captain America: Civil War isn't just about having a great balance between cause and effect, it's about the deep struggles we find inside ourselves. In a film with no true villain, the struggles we find in each of the heroes are struggles we all have. Anger. Pride. Fear. These are just the main elements of the conflict inside everyone, brought about by realizations of weakness, helplessness, and loss. Each of the different characters is given ample time to reveal the reasons why they fight, without bogging the film down in unnecessary exposition. If anything, the pacing on this nearly 3-hour film is nothing short of brilliant. Plus, not only does the audience get to see a hero-on-hero free-for-all melee (with practically all the film's best comedic bits mixed in), but they get to experience a rematch where the raw emotions of the title characters are on display.

Another expertly made piece in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that makes me excited for any follow-on films in ""Phase 3"", I give Captain America: Civil War 4.5 stars out of 5.",9

21 July 2021,"Very disappointing, but very entertaining","The Good: Action was top notch Black Panther and Zemo introduced Ant-Man returns Features the MCU's best Stan Lee cameo - RIP Nicely paced Legendary opening sequence with Crossbones Fun

The Bad: Film is way too silly All serious characters are now very badly comedic Actual hero battle is crappy in every way Spider-Man introduced - I'm a massive Spider-Man fan but he should NOT be in the MCU. I think Homecoming and Far From Home were great Spider-Man movies, but they should have been outside the MCU. Spider-Man has a great universe all to himself and it is simply too big and too complicated to put into the MCU.

Soundtrack is underwhelming Thor and Hulk are absent (yes we know what they were doing at the time but did they have to set Thor Ragnarok at that same time as Civil War?)

The Ugly: Did I mention that the film wasn't near serious enough?

Did I mention that Spider-Man shouldn't be in the MCU?

Did I mention that Captain America has always been a no-nonsense character and shouldn't change to be a bad comic one?

DID I MENTION HOW CRAPPY THAT HERO BATTLE WAS?

Overall this is a very disappointing film but it should still be watched, due to it being necessary for Infinity War and Endgame. And you will be very entertained by the action and the return of fan favourite characters, but this is very much style over substance, and should never be watched more than once.",6

8 May 2016,One step from ridiculous to sublime...and this movie took that step....what a 'Marvel' to watch this movie....!!!,"Super hero/ comic adaption movies are a big gamble - either it will turn out to be a Great Movie which will make its mark in the history (like 'The Avengers') or a serious disappointment ('Transformers', Spiderman 2,3, 'Fantastic Four' to name a few).

To be completely Honest, after the recent movie 'Deadpool' of the same genre, which had an exciting and perfect comic timing and considering the past Captain America movies (sequels have a bad reputation and the last 'Vs' tag movie - Batman Vs Superman didn't raise any expectations), i didn't had much hope for this one but was glad it proved to be wrong.

As expected, the movie was an Action packed one with great stunt scenes and visual 3 D effect but what was captivating about all this was it had a story to back all that action and a realistic touch to it.

To elaborate further, each character had a time-line, a deep (and turbulent past) but which stuck seamlessly with the time-line of the other character (and there were so many such characters in this movie).

Another interesting thing is that it adds flavor by involving the viewers/ fans into this movie and let them decide which side to be on - 'Captain America' or 'Iron Man' with each team having its own moral stand.

Looking forward to more of such movies from Marvel studios...!",8

I couldn't follow after a while. That airport scene? I was doing that when I was a child with my action figures... Oh god... Only last 30 minutes and Robert Downey Jr's perfect acting saved the day for this overrated action figure fight...

29 April 2016,Best super Hero Movie This year?,"is to fast to said that is the best movie there are 4 movies that did not come out yet, but is very correct to said that this is the best marvel movie to the date, it mix all the drama, action, and fun in a perfect way, sadly marvel still can't figure out what to do with the villains of their movies, but i think it was necessary, to give more importance to the story between Cap and Iron man, unexpected twists, and the principal plot to drop tears, anyway for me this was close to perfection, with a few exaggerated things in the action but overshadowed by the awesome direction and storytelling of the Russo Brothers, there are some times that the shaky cam takes you out but it was very little, so for me awesome movie, awesome acting, great effects, spider-man is the best to the date, Black panther (T'chala) perfect match to all the bright avengers, is a must see movie, you can 't miss it in theaters. AWESOME!!!!

7 May 2016,Some Moments Were Good...Majority Was Bad,"This movie was obviously one of the most anticipated movies of this year and of the comic book movie genre. As a comic book devotee, I was very excited for this movie. However, my excitement did not meet a good movie. Moments of this film were genuine and stirring such as all of Black Panther's scenes. However, most of this movie was tiring and some elements were not needed. I felt that the villain was not needed or could have been written into the story in a better way. Besides some of the shaky footage, the action was great. There were some intense fist fights and chase scenes that really grounded the movie. However, the main showdown between the two teams felt a bit brief. Besides the main characters and Black Panther, the rest of the characters were poorly written into the story. Everything felt a bit brief and too convenient like all Marvel Movies. I feel that the new Spider-Man will divide fans. His performance way OKAY. Nothing really special, but I guess we'll have to see more of him in Spider-Man Homecoming. I did not like his introduction. It felt too convenient and a bit rushed. In the entire first act, the movie failed to capture my attention. Again, there were some really great and intense moments, but overall the film failed me personally. There are emotional moments and moments you never thought would happen, but too much set up and time wasted ruined these moments for me. The special affects were mostly good except for Iron Man. When Tony Stark is wearing his suit with the helmet off, it is easy to see how poor and lazy the special affects division was in this movie. Overall, this movie had great moments but it did not sell me on the story. I still believe that the first Iron Man and the first Avengers (except for the ending) are better films than this. I am sad to say that this movie did not meet my excitement levels.",6
2 May 2016,"Not as amazing that everyone makes it out to be, but good!","OK first off, I am no hater but I feel like I have to point out that this isn't as perfect as people are saying. I'm not saying it's bad, but there are some weak points here.

They should have fleshed out reason why Ironman and Capt'n was fighting. And like they would go so overboard, especially Ironman. In my opinion that does not suit the character as I know him.

They should also had fleshed out more what the governments are trying to do with ""supers"".

Oh and why change Ant-Man's helmet?!

Other than that the film was great! Best Spider-Man to date, made me laugh very hard several times. This is the Spider-Man I know from the comics!

Black Panther looks bad ass and looks bad ass.

Great fight scenes of course. The pacing was good, time went fast ;)

Reason I had to write this is because all this talk about it being the best MCU film, I do not agree. And I read some review before I saw it and it kinda made me expect more.",7

12 October 2018,"Good, entertaining fun.","Suffers from too many heroes and is slow to start, but it keeps the right balance of light hearted action and emotional stakes of the franchise. This is mostly thanks to the characters, their individual reasons for being involved, and their well-suited actors. Top notch special effects and exciting scenes abound, but the story seems repetitive to the previous instalments at times.

30 July 2023,Super cool movie,"Thrilling and action-packed superhero film that pits the Avengers against each other in a conflict of ideologies.

The film showcases the rift between Captain America, played by Chris Evans, and Iron Man, portrayed by Robert Downey Jr., as they lead opposing factions within the Avengers. This internal struggle creates a captivating and emotionally charged narrative that keeps viewers engaged from start to finish.

Chris Evans delivers a compelling performance as Captain America, staying true to the character's unwavering sense of duty and loyalty. On the other hand, Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Iron Man adds a layer of complexity, capturing the weight of his personal demons and responsibility.

Captain America: Civil War excels in its ensemble cast, as it introduces new characters like Black Panther, portrayed by Chadwick Boseman, and Spider-Man, played by Tom Holland. Each character is seamlessly integrated into the story, adding depth and excitement to the film.

The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular, with the epic showdown between the Avengers being a standout moment. The film's direction and choreography make every battle sequence feel dynamic and impactful.

Beyond the action, Captain America: Civil War explores deep themes of accountability, friendship, and the consequences of superhuman powers on the world. This elevates the film beyond a typical superhero blockbuster and gives it substance and relevance.

While some may argue that the large cast of characters could have resulted in uneven screen time, the film manages to balance each character's arc and provide them with meaningful moments.

In conclusion, Captain America: Civil War is a superbly crafted superhero film that successfully combines action, drama, and thought-provoking themes. With its stellar cast, intense action sequences, and a gripping narrative, it's a movie that satisfies both fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and newcomers alike.

If you're a fan of superhero films with complex characters and emotional stakes, Captain America: Civil War is a must-watch.",7
15 May 2016,Civil War? More like Winter Soldier 2: Civil Spar.,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",1

28 April 2016,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"I had really low expectations for this movie. Mainly because so many people hyped up Batman VS Superman and it ended up being one of the biggest flops in the Super hero movies I've ever seen. So ever since then i had high low hopes for movies like this. However, this time I was extremely satisfied! The plot includes the authorities or the ""high power"" getting involved with The Avengers due to them being very irresponsible and lacking respect when it comes to the citizens of the country. Iron Man and Captain America are now in a head to head battle with each other due to their different ways of thinking. Captain America wants to bring down the bad guy normally, where as Iron Man wants The Avenger not to get involved and do anymore harm. This is where the rest of the team pick sides and if it means they will battle it out, so be it! The moment the film starts it's nonstop action! Just when the action cools down and the slow pace starts to happen...just when you think it's going to be Batman VS Superman all over again, it ends up being a dark, roller coaster ride more than you could possibly imagine! You get to see a whole darker side of Tony Stark this time too. i wont reveal why or how, but you'll see when you watch it. The fight scenes between the Avengers was at least 12 mins long. That's double the Batman VS Superman fight! I really enjoyed it. The ending left me really wanting more and left me with an upset feeling, but not a bad thing! All in all, surpasses Batman VS Superman by a long shot! And I have to say add this in: Tom Holland as Spider-Man was hilarious and downright awesome! I think we have just seen the best person to play Spider-Man! 4/5 stars 8/10, Autistic Jay.",8

1 February 2019,A reaction to Batman V Superman,"This a very unnatural final for Captain America´s trilogy. THis is not his movie, but the Avengers 2,5. I binge watch the first and second movie and they were okey, but this has been confirmed to be a reaction for Batman V Superman. The first half of this movie was boring and the pacing was slow. Why couldn´t they have ended this trilogy as planned instead of a reaction to BvS? Watch BvS UE instead. That feels like a natural continuation to MoS.

30 April 2016,Brilliant,"As a massive fan of the MCU, I have been eagerly awaiting Captain America Civil War for months. I had such high hopes and expectations and the film does not disappoint. In fact, it exceeds my expectations. I personally really liked age of ultron (AOU) however this film juggles all of the characters perfectly and has learned from the negatives raised from that installment. It gives each character their moment and does them all justice.

This film is a sequel to AOU and equally a sequel to the Winter Soldier, yet each previous MCU installment is touched upon in this movie. The building blocks previously set up in previous movies helps for the politics of the film to be relatable, interesting and entertaining, an aspect which is often done so poorly in other movies (look at the Star Wars prequels!!) This allows for a patient yet gripping film from the onset and doesn't rely on constant action and fight scenes. The reasons each hero chooses a particular side is justified and understandable. Iron mans decision to stand against cap is also justified and paints the character in a new light in my opinion. You genuinely feel for both characters. The action is brilliant and is arguably the best of any superhero movie. The film has some genuinely upsetting and emotional moments yet manages to then flip it to moments of laughter and humour. The timing is sublime.

Overall Civil War is a mature movie that raises the bar for the genre. It surpasses the winter soldier which I believe was the best superhero movie to date and leaves the MCU in such an interesting and exciting position. I can't wait to see more. Get your ticket and watch!!!!! #TeamCap",10

28 April 2016,I just didn't enjoy Civil War as much as I wanted on a personal level.,"Technically it was a good film but to me it was really kind of boring overall. I will give it credit where it's due because they did a great job pulling it together (definitely better than they pulled Batman v Superman together) but personally I just didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to.

The story-telling was fine for the most part, felt a bit thick at times because of the merging story lines but I really wasn't a fan of the open ended feeling I got so they could keep in line for the next films in the franchise. The movies no longer carry a personal feeling like they are a smaller more intimate stories being told that just so happens to be connected to a bigger story. They really have started feeling a lot like bloated micro-advertisements or hooks to keep us baited until the next movie comes along but this unfortunately applies to any franchise setting up or carrying on a connected film universe, not just these movies.

Overall I give the movie a strong 9 for the technical aspect of it and I give it a strong 7.5 for my own personal enjoyment. I didn't quite enjoy it as much as I did The Winter Soldier but fortunately, despite being bored most of the time I still enjoyed the movie. On a technical level it really deserves that 9 though. The choreography was really good, the character balance/development was on point and even though the fights lacked a good bit of tension and stakes they were well put together and greatly executed. I can definitely see some Oscar nominations and possible wins for areas of technical merit though.

The costumes are really some of the best in the business so far. The X-Men franchise, outside of Deadpool could stand to learn a thing or two from Marvel Studios/DC in the costume department. The sound effects were amazing. Marvel Studios really has achieved and perfected the feeling of a comic book coming to life before your very eyes. Snyder could also stand to learn a thing or 2 from the Russo's when it comes to solidifying a story that's being told and ironing out the flow of a film's direction. It really does seem though that having 2 directors on board is a lot better than having 1.",10
14 August 2016,Surprisingly good for Marvel,"Marvel have a history of promoting hyper aggressive female characters and this movie is no exception. For the first time though, they've extended that hyper aggression to most of the cast (male and female). It used to be reserved for the Hulk and Black Widow. In order to create the illusion of extreme feats of strength, the first 20 minutes of the movie was almost unwatchable as they cut and chopped fight scenes frantically. Later scenes did not suffer from this fragmentation.

Then, there was the ridiculous speech by Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) telling us that the only people who face adversity were women and that no woman ever went anywhere before the 1950s. Maybe, the writers and VanCAmp should study people like Frances Kelsey and Srinivasa Ramanujan. This speech was just plain insulting. But, it's consistent with Marvel, so, everyone should be used to these propaganda statements by now.

However, if you can look past revisionist history by the writers and VanCamp, the story was otherwise almost flawless. There was, surprisingly, a lot of heart to this movie. Thankfully, the writers and directors spent a lot less time on hyper-violence than past efforts. However, they are still obsessed with ninja warriors. They've now added another over the top ninja to the cast.

Surprise performance of the movie was Jeremy Renner as Arrow Guy. It's the first movie where he hasn't been lame. Elizabeth Olsen also demonstrated some solid acting chops.

Visual effects were surprisingly inconsistent for a Marvel movie. There is a scene with a truck and some fire which looked particularly fake.

However, this movie was most the most enjoyable of the Marvel Universe for me. Some heart to the characters, good acting from most of the performers, believable conflict and a toned down Robert Downey Jr. Win, win, win.

If you didn't like the Avengers movies, you may like this one. It's got enough heart that you actually care about the characters this time around. However, it's still got its share of hyper-violence, although, for the first time, most of the characters get their moment of hyper-violence, not just Black Widow.",7
17 April 2016,Very disappointed,"Well,i went to see cw with high expectations.i was expecting more than flashy fight scenes but all in all,thats the only good thing about this movie.way too much cheesy dialogue that takes away the intensity of the action.if you're a casual movie goer,this movie may be somewhat enjoyable.but comic book fans beware,they butcher one of the most iconic story arcs in marvel.batman v superman was a couple steps up in many areas.civil war had absolutely no moment that made you use your brain.its mainly just mindless action with dialogue as filler.which is an extreme disappointment.it will no doubt do well,simply because it attracts such a young audience.

7 May 2016,boring movie,"This movie is so boring the most exciting thing that happened during this time was when the two attractive girls stood up next to me, almost 30mins in, and never returned.

The movie is a long winded emo dialogue with a few weak action scene's and bad attempts towards humor. While all other movies seem to sort of get back to a higher standard... This one must be one of the bottom movies. I honestly could've without wasting my time sitting through this garbage.

There is truthfully nothing interesting going on all the time. The dialogues, the ""inner struggles"", the tension between the comradery and loyalty. It's a hollow shell that has been a huge missed opportunity.

19 December 2019,Infuriating blame game of which was not even founded on a sane premise.,"No spoilers:

From a scene in the first fifteen minutes of the movie: Few movies have made me hateful. However the blaming of a character for the death of ten people when that very action saved a hundred people...w...t....F! Not to mention the complete disregard for the fact that the character had not intended for anyone to die at all......Sooo much in the movie revolves around this event ...and so...just...grrrrrr.

I have loved almost every MCU movie. Civil War and Age of Ultron are two blemishes on the stretch of great movies for me though. I liked all three Thors, all of Cap's, both of GOTG, both Ant-mans, all of the Spider-mans including Far From Home, and I even enjoyed all of the Iron Mans. I know lots of people disliked Iron Man two and three, a lot disliked Thor Dark World, and a lot disliked GOTG 2. I liked them all myself. However the bickering and blame game drama of Civil War and Ultron just contaminated those two movies for me a bit too much.

I detested the dumbing down of the governments. You see this in lots of hollywood movies. At least in Transformers Bumblebee the dumbing down was done in a humorous manner that sort of made fun of itself. This one just treated people who work in the gov't like selfish corrupt idiots.

I saw this way back when it was in theaters. I remember how I was just annoyed how they dumbed down the characters just to make them argue. It just infuriated me that they were all just bickering with each other and being idiots. Not the heroes I wanted to see. A bunch of blame game out-of-character nonsense. What is worse is that the arguments weren't even rational. It is like they just needed to create some fake drama filler as if this were a stupid reality tv show.

There WERE lots of GOOD things in this movie, but I'm keeping it at just six out of ten because these negatives really weighed on my mind throughout the movie. For the plot itself to be compromised...dang it really bummed me out. I do advise watching it if you are going to watch Infinity War or Endgame. There are some good things in these Ultron and Civil War that I am glad I didn't miss out on.",6
19 September 2016,Honestly?,"I honestly don't know if I can give a review, see, as much as I love movies of all kinds. I fell asleep half way in & I wasn't even tired.

I'm more intrigued by the Marvel universe than a fan, but I make a point of watching these as a 'popcorn' movie and don't take them seriously...

But this... This err, was just... I can't explain what this made me feel apart from sheer boredom, the opening 'fight' scene was the usual fare, choreographed cgi, noisy visuals, then someone or other said something about the Avengers are blowing up too much stuff and the world doesn't like them doing that any more, they get sulky and then some more stuff gets blown up while some cat in a catsuit chases someone from a late 90's nu-metal band video while Capt America pouts & tells him not to kill anyone. Then a grey iron man lands and the guy from 'The Guard' tells everyone off, then there's some more sulking & pouting...

I fell asleep at this point, please, please don't bother telling me what happens next, I really don't care.

The only bit I did like was the cookery lesson from a very tomato faced Paul Bethany, but I would have used way more paprika.

I'd rather re-watch Prometheus than go through this again.",1

26 May 2016,Best marvel cinematic universe movie!!,"SPOILER FREE!!! For people who say this movie is trash, I can understand why you think that way. But that's not how I think./ Pros + Fantastic direction that is realistic but not too dark (like winter soldier) + fantastic stunts and realistic action + airport scene = best action scene in a marvel movie since the train scene in Spider-man 2 +fantastic introduction and great motivation for black panther + Tom Holland= best version of spider-man and Peter Parker since Spider-man 2 + great motivations for each sides + liked how it was mainly a Captain America movie / Cons - the villain could've been removed, but I understood his motivations / Overall - 14.8/15 or 9.85/10- best comic book movie since Dark Knight

21 May 2016,Entertaining action pack superhero(s) movie,"Great movie based on the graphic template. Although, of course, impossible to convey faithfully so enormous story on the big screen and the end is totally different, but that's what I expected. This film is showed how important director. Russo brothers have done a great job at the Captain America: Winter Soldier but they also repeated the same now with the Civil War. They get great material in hand (almost all the most important characters in the Marvel) and are managed to make a very, very good film. Way to go (stupid Snyder). Motivation at the figures is clearly displayed so that everyone can understand it.A only action? Not only is it the best in the Marvel world, but also in general. The effects are in place, the perfect combination of CGI and stunt, I just enjoyed it. I do not have any major objections, eventually someone will say that there are too many characters to follow, but that's why I used the previous films as well as those who have already announced. Marvel continues with excellent films, in my opinion, do not have any really bad movie, they're good or excellent. It's a shame that the DC can not do such a good job, especially when you have a better material.",9
30 April 2016,"A great movie, definitely better than Age of Ultron","Captain America : Civil War was much better than anyone expected to be. After the semi disappointment of Age of Ultron which didn't have much of a point and a fairly underwhelming cast of new characters, Civil War actually delivers a strong Avengers movie: there have never been that many superheroes on screen and the Civil War plot - though quite different to the comic book version - provides a good premise for the conflict.

The brothers Russo deliver a similar joy to the first Avengers with the superhero fighting each other scenes. Actually the action scenes in general are great (like they were in Winter Soldier), action packed and fast paced. Great stuff for the fan-boys that wanted that.

The new characters, namely Black Panther and Spider-Man are absolutely fantastic. Of course Spider-Man is more exciting - great costume! great quips! he's so young he feels like the 1960s' version! - but Black Panther shouldn't be short changed: he's elegant and charismatic - not unlike Captain America.

But two things bring the movie down a little: the pacing. The plot is complex (too complex for a superhero flick?) so you get a lot of exposition and ""talking head scenes""... your mileage may vary but don't expect non stop action for 2hours; this is not it. And then there is the end... no spoilers, but it's quick and a little ""under the rug"".

Oh and yes, one thing: it's not technically a Civil War, it's a 2 hour battle! Other than that, fun fun movie with a clear focus on Captain America, and a lot of cool shots for the fan-boys in the audience.",8
5 May 2016,A Grand Slam,"Captain America:Civil War was everything BvS wanted to be but Warner Brothers didn't have the patience to let it become.

It's tight with a coherent narrative, serious themes and real stakes. It's not concerned with world building because the world has already been built. When heroes come into conflict, we understand the ideological and sometimes personal reasons. Nothing is easily or even completely resolved. More importantly, though, is the fact that we've been with these characters for 13 films now, mostly with the same actors. This heightens the emotional investment. Watching these guys come to blows actually matters because of their long relationship with each other and with us.

As far as the core conflict, one of the flaws in the original comics was that there was really only one side you could be on because too many crossover comics had Stark crossing the moral event horizon and basically becoming a villain. In this, you can at least see reason in both arguments, neither side is a bad guy. While Zemo is the ultimate villain of the film, he's really just the catalyst that forces the issues that have been brewing to the surface. This makes the fights that much more poignant. That said, I personally remain firmly Team Cap.

For those who have read the original comics version, they've fixed the other problems that plagued it and included some awesome homage moments.

Now for some of the fun stuff. Black Panther was excellent, the fights were epic, Spider-man was just right and showed he belonged on the same stage with the rest of these guys. I'm stoked for both their upcoming solo films, and damn Ant-Man is seriously cool in this movie.

The Russo brothers have shown that they can handle a large ensemble cast of unique characters with a sprawling story and tell it in a serious tone with just the right amount of comic relief. They have my full confidence for Infinity Wars.",10
23 June 2017,This is wrong,"Of course this movie is still Avengers stuff I Love. But the message is wrong

Some spoilers ahead.

1. This line of ""X-vs-Y"" movies Hollywood's been making all these years - gets better with every movie...A long way from Alien vs Predator to...for instance - Batman vs Superman. Still it kinda looks like they are out of ideas and playing with characters like toys for your usual summer blockbuster

2. It is tragic. I was always with Steve in this movie. Still... the script was written a bit unconvincing...probably because of the Avengers magic...like.... believe it or not - the characters themselves did not want to be in this movie and fight each other. Because they didn't want to be toys for entertainment in the first place. So the perfect Formula of Marvel's - action and deep message - actually didn't work here. The message was too deep on the brink of simply drowning in it and the action was inconsistent.

3. The message however was still there - a tragic of a drama of friends fighting each other. On both sides and these both sides are the same and good. Still the thing about this movie is that Marvel actually was not able to decide what part of the Formula -action or the message - they should make a priority. The result - lots of painful dramatic moments and unconvincing action scenes - simply because Avengers are not Batman and Superman - they are a team so they cannot impressively fight each other 'cause they can impressively fight together)",5
1 October 2023,Captain America's trilogy is a masterpiece,"Captain America: Civil War, the superhero showdown that left my heart pounding with exhilaration, earns a resounding 8/10 in my superhero saga-an unabashed love letter to its stellar cast, pulse-pounding action, and complex narrative. The ensemble's performances, especially Chris Evans as Captain America and Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man, infuse the film with emotional depth and conflicting ideologies that elevate it beyond a mere superhero spectacle. The film's strength lies in its deftly crafted storyline that navigates the intricate web of loyalties and consequences. While the ensemble cast can make the plot feel crowded at times, the editing manages to juggle the myriad threads with precision. The musical score, a dynamic symphony of heroism, enhances the gravity of the conflicts. Cinematography captures the kinetic energy of the superhero clashes with a visual finesse. Captain America: Civil War, with its underlying theme of friendship strained by conflicting ideals, emerges not just as a superhero epic but a compelling exploration of the human side of heroism.

7 May 2019,Hindsight is 20/20 but this film makes me feel like I need a bath.,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",6
27 April 2016,"I don't think it's actually a Civil War Story. ""Captain America v Iron Man"" might be a more suitable title.","Just saw Captain America: Civil War. Just a heads up it's not about the superhero registration act (like the comics). It's a continuation of CA: Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron

Review: -Loved the Newbies (Spider-Man and especially Black Panther). It's fun to see Ant-Man with the other guys too. -Not enough Black Widow tho :( but might just be me -Loved Wanda and Clint's friendship -I don't think it's actually a Civil War Story. ""Captain America v Iron Man"" might be a more suitable title... or ""Captain America fighting for his b̶o̶y̶f̶r̶i̶e̶n̶d̶ bestfriend against Iron Man. -It's great. WATCH IT

Might be a minor spoiler... I guess. IDK: -This movie could be a great prologue for a Real Civil War movie. not an Avengers: Civil War movie but a MARVEL CIVIL WAR movie. In the comics Cap, along with some super powed pips, are against the Superhero registration act. They then formed a team and started helping people in secret (like Daredevil who is a part of Cap's team in the comics). Then the fighting and the civil war started. -THEY CAN STILL DO THIS. -They have @Daredevil and The Punisher on TV. They'll have Dagger and Cloak soon. Plus the inhumans in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. -They could strike a deal with Fox to get the rights for F4 and some X-men characters. -THEY HAVE TO DO IT.",10

18 March 2022,Captain America 3 (or Avengers 2.5),"This film is fun and entertaining, but only in certain parts. The rest of this film is kinda messy. The issues between the superhero's gets kinda dull and one sided, and there is a lot of problems with the narrative structure.

2 May 2016,Another amazing addition to the MCU!,"I was optimistic but cautious going into this movie. Marvel has been on such an amazing run recently that I thought that they have to slip up at some point... right? And with so many superheroes in 1 movie without Whedon at the helm, I was concerned.

Needless to say I was worried for nothing! The story was set-up brilliantly and continued going strong for the remainder of the film. The Avengers have had their problems here and there in the past, but things finally reached boiling point after a mission turned south and more innocent people died.

Our 2 new characters were great, Black Panther and Spiderman both had great introductions and both felt like they actually had something to do rather than just be there for the sake of the plot. Speaking of Spiderman, Tom Holland did a great job! When cast people thought he didn't look the part and that he looked too young, whether you still think that or not you can't deny he played the part really well and I for one am really looking forward to 'Homecoming' and seeing what more Tom has too offer.

Overall brilliantly crafted movie, the Marvel juggernaut continues to keep moving forward without a hitch. Bring on Doctor Strange.",9
19 July 2016,Civil war is NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!!,"Hey! This is my first review EVER!! why? Because I watched Avengers, Winter soldier, thor 1 &2, ant man, but this one is just stupid!!!! why??? Because in other marvel movies things make SENSE!!!If I am your friend I wouldn't just go against you!! I would TELL you I am gonna do it!! Vision is so powerful he can take all of them together yet Cap and Barnes escape!!!I know this is a Captain movie yet you can't just include the other guys yet ignore there thoughts and POWERS!!! its a superhero movie after all!!! I mean logically Stark could have destroyed the plane Cap was after BUT then ant man wouldn't have a scene!!!!

27 April 2016,Great blockbuster! (Non-spoiler review),"I went to see the first screening this morning, and it's a great movie (with some flaws). Let's start with the good things: The actors absolutely delivered, Chris Evans & RDJ are amazing in their respective roles, Spiderman & Black Panther were wonderful (couldn't have hoped for a better introduction for either of them). Scarlett Witch is great too (we get to see her power better now); and even Black Widow is an (much needed) improvement over AoU! It's an action-packed movie, with emotions, humour.. Anything a blockbuster should be. The cinematography was great, good storytelling, hats off to the Russo brothers. The Captain America trilogy finishes on a great note.

However, it is not without flaws: The main issue is that once again, Marvel didn't get the villain right. He was completely useless & I believe the movie would have been better without him. His plan was surrealistic & couldn't possibly happen. The humour was sometimes inappropriate, in the way that people wouldn't crack a joke when getting beaten I praised the action-scenes earlier, but they dragged and in the end, you are left quite tired. Then.. the relationship between Bucky & Cap, while enjoyable some times, felt forced -- but that is minor. The soundtrack was okay-ish, nothing memorable (like most Marvel movies) Last but not least, I felt the movie is.. forgettable. It doesn't stay on the mind, all the movie's depth comes from the characters, not the story itself.. and in the end, it has no impact at all.

----- To sum up, even if it has some issues, I believe Civil War is a highly enjoyable movie, and is worth every cent of the ticket!",7

11 January 2018,The best marvel movie i have watched,"Captain america already had a solid series so far so i knew come civil war i wouldn't be disappointed and i was not i really enjoyed this one in his series and as a marvel movie altogether and the set pieces were solid and the story keep me engaged for the entire time i was watching . to me the stand out members of this cast was Chris Evans as Steve/Cap and Robert Downey Jr. as Tony/ Iron man but also new comers stole the show like Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa and a younger new star Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spiderman and those are just the main two characters and the new ones you still have so many stars returning to this marvel hero vs hero showdown like Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan,Anthony Mackie,Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner,Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen,Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp and special return of Frank Grillo as crossbones so a solid cast of returning actors and that's almost all of marvel in one movie so that's very impressive. our villain is played by Daniel Brühl and zemo is very good at what he does and makes sure that he can tear the avengers apart and appreciate a villain who can do that to our heroes. this was by far one of my favorite movies of 2016 and it really made me enjoy every second and this is one of the best marvel movies that have been released and it will set up the future of the entire MCU in a very good way",10
3 February 2019,Team CAPTAIN AMERICA vs Team IRON MAN,"Captain America: Civil War is phenomenal. It's the #1 Movie in the World. Lots of Action, whole lot of fun, and Intense fight scenes at the same time like Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

10 May 2016,"Entertaining, but quite lame superhero movie","Captain America: Civil War is quite entertaining, but empty superhero movie. Somehow I don't understand, why they have named it to Captain America movie? Iron Man is as least as predictable in this movie, that it could be Iron Man movie as well. It is better to call it Avengers movie. Movie is quite long (2,5 hours). It has inflate to almost too big. Somehow it feels, that it won't take too long when audience starts to get bored to these superhero movies. It has too many characters to tell well enough any of them story. It feels like presentation of all Marvel's superheros more than a decent movie. The story won't actually start and end nowhere. It is very entertaining thou and you easily spend 2,5 hours with it if you have enough candies, popcorn and soda to flush it all down. Movie has filmed in 3D format, but they won't get almost anything out of it which is quite surprisingly with this kind of digital effect movie. Primary movie leaves quite empty feeling, even it has a lot of action. Lee Falk's cameo is nice surprise at the end of the movie. At least it is his legacy to Marvel. Entertaining, but quite lame superhero movie.

17 October 2020,OH MY GOD!,"I had no idea that this movie would be that GOOD. It was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! It links back to Age of Ultron from the Sokovian battle and it becomes a major issue between the Avengers, especially Iron Man and Captain America. The story hits the right emotional beats with the themes while this movie also gives some of the best fight and chase sequences in Marvel history. Winter Soldier and Civil War are both the pinnacle of stand-alone superhero movies for me.

27 April 2016,Marvelous Triumph,"Just came back from a screening... I am trying so hard to think about ways to nitpick my way out of it. but this movie is one of those rare achievements that can juggle between being so gleefully exiting, serious, tense and foreboding yet remain so cohesive and committed to it's narrative. I had high expectations, the Russo's didn't even care about my comparatively lowly expectations, because they had their own.

this movie is the overachiever of the MCU, it brings you the goods, and THAN SOME. everyone has their glory moments, but at the heart it's an epic dispute between friends, idealists and pragmatists. what's amazing is that it's not only a struggle between Cap and Iron Man (and also Bucky) it's their own internal struggles, and that echoes in all the characters.

it's actually the newcomer who come on top of it all, and that is Black Panther who is easily one of the most well put together heroes I've ever seen come through such a short introduction. he along with Winter Soldier get to make choices you wouldn't assume a comic book character would, choices that get into resolutions through unconventional means.

Spiderman is a glorified cameo, I gotta admit he is, but good god Marvel is in so much swagger they can get away with it! Tom Holland finally nails it and you know why? because he doesn't try so hard to be a silver age impossible nerd ala Maguire or the market approved ""millennial"" Garfield Spider-Man. you just look at him, and he totally naturally IS that nerd, you believe he is Peter Parker from Queens and you believe he is Spider-Man.

the beginning of the movie sets the precedence for everyone incredibly well and it's all just a natural progression that gets into the airport. now the airport fight was so amazingly choreographed, everyone gets to do something absolutely amazing and it had so many moments straight out of... yeah, I know it's been chewed out that line ""straight out of a comic book page"". I've heard that said before, and I think it's arguably true- this might just be THE best or at least the most grandiose fight ever to put on film between superheroes.

Civil War even beat Batman V Superman in what BVS set it's goal to be- CW is way darker at the heart of it's conflict, it touches dark violent history behind some characters and thematically it approaches dark material with incredible maturity, a maturity BVS's infantile teenage like angst attitude couldn't approach. the climax is tense, it holds no reservation about how violent the clash between our heroes can escalate into and it makes us understand everyone, even our villain do what they do.

Civil War is a triumph, it shows us just how far Comic Book movies can reach when they put their A game into it. it also shows that absurdity and nuance are not oil and water. we should all celebrate this triumph, we earned it!",10
18 March 2019,Avengers 3 excluding Thor and hulk,"In 2016, DC and marvel came up with their superhero vs superhero film. First DC came with dawn of justice which failed both critically and commercially. So eyes went on captain america civil war whether it meets their expectations or not. Does it meet?

Plus: 1. Conflict point: The biggest plus point of civil war is the conflict point shown between Steve rogers and Tony stark which would leave you confused to take sides unless you are a fanboy. If you have seen previous MCU movies you will understand the motive of the characters. If you have seen winter soldier you will know that cap was in a situation where he couldn't trust anyone other than himself. His insecurity towards the government forces him not to sign the accords. And if you have seen age of ultron and iron man 3 you understand that tony is regretting for his hasty creation of ultron which lead to several casualties and damage. Also he is upset with his temporary breakup with pepper for whom he destroyed all his suits and wanted to settle down with her. I was like in a position of black widow who is though in Tony's side still shows a soft corner towards cap. 2. Robert Downey Jr: Among performances it's rdj who once again shines as tony stark. In this you get to see an entirely different tony stark who is not humorous and reckless but practical and emotional. Despite not being the main lead, RDJ leaves a mark with his performance. 3. Villain zemo: Zemo is an underrated villain where audience don't realize that without any superpowers or extraordinary human strength successfully rip apart the avengers. 4. Airport battle: The airport battle between team cap and team iron man is the main highlight of civil war. The interaction and action choreography was kickass. 5. Direction: Though Russo brothers direction is not racy like winter soldier, it successfully helps in building the tension. 6. Climax fight: The climax fight of civil war is very emotional which makes you divided. On one hand you can feel the rage of tony and on the other hand you can feel the desperation of cap to protect his friend from his teammate and friend. The climax fight makes both cap and iron man fans emotional. When I was watching I felt like shouting 'STOP FIGHTING'

Minus: 1. The color tone of the film is dull at times. It is greyish which does not really suit the film. 2. When black panther came to know zemo's intention why he didn't stop cap and tony from fighting?

Verdict: Captain america civil war is more an avengers film than a cap film. It gives you everything which bvs failed to give you. It has emotions, friendship, tension, politics and loads of action. A successful rehearsal for infinity war.",10

10 May 2016,A decisive Superhero vs. Superhero extravaganza!,"Captain America: Civil War is essentially like a battle royale between superheroes like one has never seen before. And that too, in a way that doesn't bludgeon your senses into numb submission, like some other superhero films we've seen of late!

It's full of sensational action packed scenes which prove to be an eye treat for action and the comic lovers! Iron Man and Captain America's showdown is just one of the many that will keep you absorbed in the movie. This fast-paced, intimate film is full of happy surprises; Tom Holland's Spider-Man is one.

The scenes with Tom Holland's Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther are some of the best in the film. They lead up to their individual movies and prove Marvel's true superpower is its casting. The movie perfectly vindicates the awesomeness of Captain America's trilogy.

9 May 2016,Finally there was a battle between Cap And Tony,"I'd like to start the review by saying.....that with my hands down 👐 this is so far, the most thoughtful movie made by the MCU.....it has established a kind of supremacy over all of the other marvel movies out there..especially the first one(Ironman 1 i.e.).......

Marvel has tried it's best keeping up with the comic book adaptations and has done a pretty good job...the only problem in this ""adaptation-buisness"" was the fact that they had to introduce a new spider-man and had to portray him as not much of an interfering guy....his role was huge in the comics but in the film it was more like an amateur entering an arena with new heights of seriousness....another thing I would wanna point out is that the fighting sequences were too clearly sorted out with everyone in the team fighting against the others team's equally powered opponent...come on now...that is an incredible coincidence which does not really happen pretty often....there were not much cross-overs like Cap fighting the Vision, of course that's not possible though...so I think Vision should've been kept out of the scene......

Now....the pro's!!

One of the best undeniably inspiring moments was when Ironman beats the crap outta Cap.....but he still goes on say ""I could do this all day""... And also the comic book adaptation of the scene when one of the woman (who lost her son while a bunch of superheros were battling against a bad guy in a school which led to a huge blast) spits on Tony's face for making false claims about making the world a better place...

That was beautifully interpreted into the film where that woman looses her son in Sokovia during the battle of the Avengers with Ultron.....

But however the best scene for me would be the post-dramatic scene where Ironman flashes his energy beams and Cap on the other hand obstructs it with his vibrant shield and with all his might and will.....wow that's the moment when it clicks...that's the moment when you know that you're no more watching a fight between ding-dong sissies..man this is real fight between two men, one working with a sense of morals and the other being calculative and keeping up with the score.....

In the end...Captain America Civil War is not a war between to different teams....but a breathtaking battle between two people destined to urge to fight against each other.....it's a grand ShowDown...

Future predictions...Can't tell",8
18 May 2016,"Another would be 10, in which the missing bits become the heart of the issue","Once again I have a very good movie, which I loved, and I find myself being annoyed by the little bits that went wrong. OK, maybe not so very little, but still, most of the movie is superbly done. The acting, the pacing, all the technical aspects - every thing is first class. Even what I think is the core of all good comics adaptation - the moral debate around which the entire story revolves. What do you do when you can do almost everything, or in other words what do you do when almost none can stop you. To this very important discussion that many fail to notice because they pay too much attention to the magnificent action scenes and all the fireworks and the CGI. Another layer of moral debate is added, about the nature of all consuming revenge. And again it's done with full respect to matters discussed, not just superficially as an excuse for all the twists and turns of the plot. But then we arrive at the but, the unfortunate annoying but.

Here goes: with all the scheming and superb planning, the ending works only if we get these very specific three characters locked together, like they obviously end up. But there's no way anyone could forecast that they will be the three arriving there, that they will be the only three arriving. I can't elaborate without adding spoilers and I won't but this means the stitches holding the plot together are all too evident - this film deserved better. When everything else is so perfect, the plot should be up to par and not the weakest link, and the plot is going all through the film, not in bits. Every time I think about it, I get angry again, and I did like the movie a lot. That's just plain shame.",9

6 May 2016,Great Action! Weak Villains,"Civil War has awesome Avenger action. Strong character interactions. Spidey and Black Panther were definitely the highlights of the film. Crossbones looked great but was underutilized. Zemo.. another underdeveloped villain.The airport scene will probably be the most stand out scene of the film. Even though this is a Captain America movie it sometimes feels like Avengers 2.5. I still really enjoyed Captain America Civil War. Even though Zemo wasn't that great, it didn't ruin my overall enjoyment of the film. Some of the story elements were meh. Civil War is by far my favorite Marvel movie to date!I would give Civil War an 8.8/10 or a B+.

3 November 2016,"Should've been called: ""Avengers: The Argument""","After the entertaining second Captain America installment ""Winter Soldier"", three other Marvel Universe movies (Age of Ultron, Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy) we kick off the third phase of the Marvel flicks with Captain America: Civil War. Starring almost the complete cast of the previous marvel movies and introducing new members, will it still be a Captain America centered movie?

The movie opens in Lagos, Nigeria, where four members of the remaining Avengers (Scarlett Witch, Black Widow, Falcon and Captain America) are trying to stop Hydra from stealing dangerous bio weapons form a medical research center. While they are successful, they cause huge damage and hundreds of civilian causalities. This is the final nail in the coffin for the United Nations who come with a set of rules that should prevent the Avengers from acting on their own, but form now on will fall under supervision. Tony Stark (Iron Man) and half of the Avengers agree that hey should sign the Accords but Captain America and the other half do not. When Captain America's old friend, Bucky, is accused of bombing the UN, he rushes into action (supported by half of the Avengers) to keep Bucky from falling into government hands, while the other Avengers (led by Iron Man) tries to stop him.

Civil War is certainly entertaining. The action looks great, the special effects are off the charts (apart from some cgi effects looking less impressive) and there are hardly dull moments in the movie. I enjoyed the story, but it feels a bit forced and only act as a device to let the Avengers face off against each other. Why did the UN take four years to come with this action? I mean they destroyed half of Manhattan but when they cause damage in Africa they suddenly come into action? That feels a bit strange. The villain in this movie also didn't feel menacing at all and I hardly noticed that there was a villain in the first place.

My main issue with this movie is that there are way to many characters in this movie. It would have worked way better if they just focused on the conflict between Captain America (it's his movie right?) and Iron Man, with Bucky, Black Widow and War Machine as supporting characters. It's all so bloated now that it doesn't feel like a Captain America movie at all. It is just another Avengers movie used to show as many superheroes as possible. In the middle of the movie there is a big fight between (almost) all the Avengers which is highly praised by many people. For me that fight looked like a boring commercial which advertises super hero action figures. The fight did nothing to bring the story forward, nothing to develop the characters and you know that they all survive so what's the bloody point? And yes I know it's not a realistic movie but if I remember correctly, most of the Avengers are just human right? So how do they all shake off massive damage like falling 5 stories and getting punched in the face by a man dressed in Iron or with super human strength?

While the final act of the movie was entertaining and brought back the focus to Captain America, I must say that this was not a Captain America movie. If you love the Avengers movie and can't get enough of all the superheroes, you will certainly like this movie. For the rest of us it is an entertaining movie but not without flaws.",7
6 May 2016,"It's easily on par, if not better, than the first two ""Avengers"" movies.","""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) is nearly everything I hoped it would be; it's easily on par, if not better, than the first two ""Avengers"" movies. (And I can't help but think of this as the third ""Avengers."" Yes, Cap's name is in the title, but this is necessarily an ensemble story about the divided superteam.) I'd give it a 9 out of 10.

I honestly just need to be very vague in this review  this is such an eagerly awaited film, and I want to be extra cautious about spoilers. No, there are no twists in the movie, but there are surprising character and plot elements.

The movie surprised me in a couple of ways. One, this film appears to follow the original 2006 comic book crossover only very loosely. (I have not read it, but I know the story.) There is no ""Superhero Registration Act"" that would directly affect countless people in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's much narrower than that — a demand by the United Nations for direct oversight of The Avengers.

Two, this is definitely the darkest and most adult outing with The Avengers so far. Don't get me wrong — the levity and gee-whiz comic book fun that is the MCU's trademark is still there, and it's no Christopher Nolan movie. But the movie's central story device is set in motion by the question of who should be held accountable for civilian deaths. And so many individual major characters are motivated by grief or rage.

This is notable throughout the film, for example, in the characterization of Tony Stark, and his portrayal by Robert Downey, Jr. He's no longer a wisecracking billionaire playboy who all the guys want to be. Instead, he's a troubled, pensive leader who often seems out of his depth. We watch as his team and the events surrounding him spin out of control, and we no longer want to trade places with him. He's more sympathetic. But he simultaneously fails to engender the viewer loyalty that he so quickly and easily won in every other Marvel movie he's appeared in.

And yet  he isn't, as I had suspected, a cardboard adversary for Captain America's underdog to stand up to. There are some sad things going on in his life, both during the events of this movie and in ""Iron Man 3"" (2013), and his failings and poor decisions are perfectly understandable. (I won't say more, besides that viewers will definitely get a different spin on ""Iron Man 3"" after this movie.) And Downey displays a great range in playing this far sadder Tony.

One character in the movie even makes a quip about ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980), and it feels like a meta reference, as that film is regarded as the darkest in the ""Star Wars"" original trilogy. (And their are story structure similarities as well.)

But don't get me wrong — ""Captain America: Civil War"" still brings loads of fun. It's an effects-laden, geeky, hero-against-hero, superteam gangfight that is straight out of every Marvel fan's dreams. (And, needless to say, it's far better than its analog this year from DC.) Tom Holland might be the best Spider-Man yet. The action is damn pleasing, and the one-liners made me laugh out loud. (""Made ya look."")

The bromances (including the broken ones) seemed real to me. I found myself liking and caring about  Winter Soldier, of all people, and I kept hoping things worked out with his friendship with Cap. (Sebastian Stan impressed me in the role for the first time.)",9
11 September 2022,The best in the series,"This is how you make a movie! I watched this again and I never left a review but thought I would log on because I am tired of people trying to placate to certain demographics for profit. Look how that turned out with other countries who now wont even play these films! So ha! Do what you love and be creative and stop trying to chase TopGun taught us to just give people what they want to see and stop trying to create you're own narrative. This film makes you realize that the stakes can be raised even in a film about super heroes. I enjoyed seeing the different dynamics and love the pacing of this film.

13 June 2023,A Complex and Emotional Superhero Showdown,"""Captain America: Civil War"" is a complex and emotional superhero showdown that pits the Avengers against each other in a battle of ideologies. The film tackles weighty themes such as accountability, loyalty, and responsibility, making it one of the most thought-provoking entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Chris Evans once again delivers a standout performance as Captain America, but this time with a more conflicted and emotional edge. The film's supporting cast, including Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther, all shine in their respective roles, adding depth and complexity to the story.

The film's action scenes are some of the most thrilling and intense in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with each character utilizing their unique abilities to full effect. The fight between Team Cap and Team Iron Man is a standout moment that leaves viewers on the edge of their seats.

But what really sets ""Captain America: Civil War"" apart is its emotional depth. The film explores the consequences of past actions and the toll they take on the characters, making for a more nuanced and mature superhero story. The conflict between Captain America and Iron Man is heartbreaking, as their friendship and trust are shattered by their differing beliefs.

Overall, ""Captain America: Civil War"" is a must-see for fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and anyone who loves a good superhero story. It's a complex and emotional journey that delivers thrilling action and thought-provoking themes, leaving viewers satisfied and wanting more.",7
5 August 2018,CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR MAKES US PROUD,"A POST COLONIAL work without and within; through because of failure to be born during those times. Recognition to CAPTAIN AMERICA and the crew are together and we are grateful. Gratitude towards SIR ROBERT DOWNEY JUNIOR and SCARLETT JOHANSON as they are in the movie. CAPTAIN AMERICA here played by SIR CHRIS EVANS who suits the role with immense physical stamina through thick and thin. Then the aspect of failure or to accept failure because Super Heroes who fail are not real. The fight is on here; do watch and share.

13 June 2016,"Better than the recent crop of superhero films, Captain America; Civil War looks at dilemmas many heroes face.","Captain America: Civil War

I saw this because it was 100+ degrees out,there was nothing else to see in town, and it got good review. So, a short review is in order.

Pros: No Pepper Pots, No Hulk, No space aliens, (Head) Human villain played by Daniel Bruhl. No Thor. Spider man's acrobatics. Antman was cool, shockingly, Plot had some surprises, Trailer for Dr. Strange played by Benedict Cumberbatch, Black Panther kicks ass! Captain America is actually not a rule following, annoying, frat boy, kiss ass in this one.

Cons: Rhodes in an Ironman suit. What a self-righteous prick. Spiderman's dialogue and childishness, Hawkeye is a waste of time, Wanda the Witch is misused, Vision was NOT a sight to behold, No one died in all the fighting, The plot has big holes, if you care to look, a dearth of decent female superheroes, a weak origin story for Black Panther, Set up had flaws like the fact that no one admitted that without the Avengers, things would be worse.

Push: Wanda still a cool character even if out of place, Black Widow also seemed out of place here, Special affects sometimes special, other times, not so much. Rogers is still Captain America.

Rating: Matinée

There was enough entertainment and an actual plot to bring out the characters. The final battle was not overblown, and while the middle battle was, it was still fun. An actual moral dilemma present in a superhero action film is refreshing even if it is too simply presented.

Now, can we have Spiderman and Black Panther join up for a movie without all those other clowns? Call it, 'Good Friends Defeat Umbrella Corp', or some such thing.

Peace, Tex Shelters",7
29 April 2016,The film certainly interesting,"The film certainly interesting but super heroes too much and often removed about a super exchange, human spider. Maybe you need a little more action, that they did not fight with each other as well as helping to combat the forces of crime and not a super human beings who have the same abilities. Each film Marvel falls bag reviews like ""OH MY GOD THIS IS THE BEST superhero movie, it such an original, with such a plot, such characters and unrealistic twist, THIS ten out of ten."" And in fact it turns clowning with jokes through word fights, which destroyed the city in which no one dies. A super cool, interesting villain or evil because it is evil, or his mom and dad did not like, or he was disappointed in humanity. Heroes quarrel, after 20 minutes, putting up and give the villain.

5 July 2020,Spider-Man's Marvel movie debut....,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",8

29 May 2016,"High-Flying, Dark, and Delicious","This is the best Avengers movie as of yet.

Yes, yes, I know it's not officially an Avengers movie, but it feels like one. It's chocked full of Avengers, amazing action sequences, hero on hero conflict, a lot of quips, and some good character development sprinkled here and there.

However, it also feels like a sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It works off a lot of those same themes, and it was directed by the same guys: the extremely talented Russo Brothers.

I'm kinda glad Whedon is done directing these movies. He's a talented man, don't get me wrong, but his talents are much better suited for Buffy and its ilk. It's pretty clear that he's a TV guy through and through. There's a lot of overwriting going on in Avengers 1 and 2, causing the scenes to take too long and the plot to not advance as fast as a movie plot should advance. It's all right for a good director to be self-indulgent, but while the Russo are self-indulgent in an upward direction, Whedon is self-indulgent to the side, which is good in TV but not so much in film. Yes, I know the Russos have done a lot of TV work too, but they don't feel like 'TV directors' to the extent that Whedon does.

There are less quips here, and a lot of the ones they do include feel like they benefit the story more than the quips of Avengers 1 and especially Avengers 2. A good chunk of them are delivered by or about Spiderman, who I am glad to see in this film. He's the best movie Spiderman by a good margin. What a lot of people forget is that Spiderman is supposed to be a dorky teenager. His invention was a way of saying, ""Yeah, all you awkward comic-book reading teens, you can be superheroes too."" I don't know how I feel about watching a whole movie based around this kid, but I love watching him and Iron Man play off each other. There's a 30 year age difference between Tom Holland and Downey and it shows. I also love his interactions with Captain America. I can see Cap being like an older brother to him if all this fighting stops.

And it is an if. The story, of course, is that the Avengers are divided by an act that would requite superheroes to basically put themselves under the control of the UN. Over a hundred nations are in favor of it, as are Stark and most of the Avengers. Captain America is the outlier, but he refuses to move, and we're in for a Civil War. The UN wants to neutralize Bucky, especially after he supposedly attacks the conference in Vienna where the Act was signed, killing the king of Watanga in the process. Cap wants to help out is friend and free him from his mind control. By the end of the story, a lot of the mess has been resolved, but the deep ideological differences that started up the whole conflict in the first place are still there. I have all the respect in the world for the Russos for doing this. It makes it feel like what happens in this film really matters, a problem that Avengers 2 had a hard time trying to solve.

Of course, when Thanos comes to town, the heroes are gonna have to band together, but I hope what that time comes, it's done well. The Russos are still directing, so I don't really worry about that, but it is a legitimate concern. The war this film most resembles is not the American Civil War, but World War I. And how did that end? In the Treaty of Versailles, which directly led to World War II. While I hope the Avengers don't end up in a World War II, I also hope not everything gets nearly resolved.

The best parts of these movies are the Avengers themselves, and this film seems to get that, as it has its villain stay out of the spotlight and put the focus on the Avengers, and said villain's scheme has a lot to do with watching the Avengers fight. It's more than enough, particularly when the conflict between Avengers is made interesting and complex. The addition of Black Panther adds another wrinkle to the fray, as he really isn't on Cap's or Stark's side. It's complex, interesting, and completely entertaining.",9
23 May 2018,Third time is the charm (for Captain America),"I watched this movie in theaters in the summer of 2016 when it was first released. I had seen the first two Captain America films and they were decent for me, if not great. But this exceeded my expectations. Not only do we get the Avengers established by the 2012 film but we also get several more of them. And you know what? As Homer Simpson would say, ""It's good! It's good! It's good!"" The characters have a lot of chemistry and no one is left out. Plus Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man. I haven't seen Homecoming yet as of now, but it's on my to-do list. This movie had the best schism between our main heroes like the name applies. Who wouldn't want to see our heroes disagree and fight? The X-Men had their disagreements too, especially Cyclops and Wolverine. Anyway, that's not the point. The fact that the heroes squabble makes them more human. It makes them more relatable. Anyway, go see it!

9 May 2016,The best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far!! :),"Civil War is the closing chapter to the Captain America Trilogy and it rocks. To add to that ,altough its unlucky numbering, (it is the thirteenth installment of the MCU) it managed to be what we wanted and much more. To start all the characters were awesome and the new Spiderman.. THE BEST, Tom Holland is the most comic book accurate portrait of the friendly neighborhood we ever had in the big screen. Also Black Panther was great and now guys we have a royalty in the team ( OK another loyalty because there is Thor, but is more a God than a prince). The action was mind blowing thanks to the Russo Brothers ,these two are the Coen Brother of Action Flicks. Last but not least the arguing between Captain and Ironman was amazing ,because from either way they were both right and you could get why the had this ideology. I more than like it and go see it now, if you want to see Superheroes battling out , but you wished Batman V Superman be better. Well your wishes came true!

1 May 2016,Good movie but not great,"Captain America civil war was good not great i loved the characters and how they brought in the new one, the air port scene was fantastic but the fight between Iron man captain America and barns was epic, the only things i didn't like was how vision hardly used any of his powers during the movie, unlike age of ultron there wasn't as much action as i would have liked in this movie,and this movie was supposed to a little emotional but i didn't see any emotional spots during the movie,and the boss Baron Zemo was very weak i didn't care for him at all the only other thing that bugged me is that the only time you see antman and spiderman is only when there at the airport, i kinda wish they had a bigger part in the movie,

13 November 2018,a great superhero movie,"Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you the giant egos within the avengers and what team work actually takes to balance it all out. The direction is really good. The screenplay is really good. The casting is really good because the casting team added to just the avengers by including black panther, ant man and various other future characters and successful blends them all together. The acting is incredible no one actor really stands out which is really good from a ensemble perspective. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.

5 May 2016,Interminable,"I found this movie to be quite tedious. Fight scene after fight scene separated by slow parts of dialog. Some parts were funny and well written, but the entire movie is not well written. I have seen most of the Avenger movies, but still did not recognize all the characters or know their back story. This is the typical action movie where the government is stepping in to shut down the action figures. Just like in Bourne, Bond, and Mission Impossible. Must be written by Republicans who think all government is evil. Can't we have a different threat or bogey man? The real bogeyman here is not that interesting and has capabilities way beyond a his stature in life. And, how many superhero movies do we have to sit through where superhero fights superhero. Hey they are indestructible so why keep fighting? The scenes just take up space on the screen and add to the CGI budget. The fights don't advance the story at all. There was four adults who saw this movie in my group, and all of us could hardly wait till it was over.

16 May 2016,I love it!,"I like this movie so much because it makes the Avengers movies look bad. I wish it had less people but it makes it work because it's so well written. This is not the type of movie I want to smash. It's too good. So I like it a lot. I want Chris Evans to be mine and I want to keep his safe. He gets so much crap this movie. His friend does too. But he's not as cute.

I want to see Civil War 2. Not Avengers 3. Does that make any sense because it might not. I really hope this kind of movie is what Marvel wants now because it is so much better than the old Marvel movies. I want to see this more.

29 May 2016,More of an Avengers film but still worth watching,"When I heard the title Captain America: Civil War, I reluctantly thought it was going to be the Marvel version of Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice and I am glad to say that it didn't compare (in a good way).

Whilst BvS struggled to portray the building animosity between the two title characters, Civil War did a fantastic job at splitting up the beloved Avengers and ending in an epic final battle. Which brings me to my next point – it didn't necessarily feel like a stand-alone Captain America film and it become more akin to another Avengers installment instead (sans Thor and The Hulk though).

Another qualm I had was the fact that Elizabeth Olsen's Russian character Wanda had somehow lost the terrible accent that we heard in Age Of Ultron and had become an all-American Avenger. Whilst not having to endure the horror of it again, it still didn't sit well with me that they chose the easy way out.

The film also introduces a few new faces: Tom Holland as (yet another) Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther – we can expect two new stand-alone films for these guys in the near future.

All in all, it was an enjoyable, action-packed saga and with all of its CGI glory, my eyes wouldn't budge from the screen.

15 April 2016,Mediocre like most Marvel movies,"Listen, don't listen to the deluded critics and Marvel fan boys giving this crap ratings higher than the Godfather. Those are shallow and deluded fan boys. The movie was mediocre at best like most of the Marvel movies out there. Batman vs Superman was for sure a better film with more in depth character development and the movie actually made me care for the characters. I couldn't care less what happened in to the characters in this film. The musical score was once again a mediocre score with nothing special about it. BvS had a decent score and you could tell that they actually went for something. This movie shows no effort in making a good musical score at all. The movie gets way too much praise while BvS gets way too much hate. I don't expect jokes to pop up when the world is at stake or people are fighting in the middle of a battle. Why this keeps happening in Marvel movies is beyond me, probably to keep the shallow kids and fans going through the movie. BvS got criticized for being too dark and having too many characters yet this is one of Marvels ""darkest"" movies and has the largest cast of any super hero movie and this gets praise? The amount of plot holes I found were laughable, but no, people are going to ignore it because it's a Marvel movie and the action is eye candy. But when DC does it it's the only thing people notice. I have a suggestion, instead of watching this mediocre and copy and paste Marvel film, go watch something else. Here are some suggestions, want to still watch a Marvel film? Go rent one or find one on cable, it will be exactly the same, trust me. Want to still go to the theater and watch a real super hero movie? Fine, watch Batman vs Superman. Want to watch a good super hero movie? Go watch The Dark Knight Trilogy. Want to watch a good movie? Go watch the Godfather or Shawshank Redemption. Have fun, don't watch this boring movie!",1

30 August 2016,"It was disappointing, because it is much of talking than action ! and There is no hulk !","I hate this last movie, I mean what they thought when they did the movie ? like lets fight ! they could come up with something even nicer like fighting with aliens something like that ! but instead they went and fought with each other ! come on ! really ?!

One more disappointing thing is that there is no Hulk or Thor in the movie ! I mean why ? what happen ! obviously because they hated the plot so they said no way we will join this sh*t !

0/10 to this movie ! I hope they fix it !

Thy are talking and talking and talking and the voice is so low unless the action starts then it is boom ! you need your remote now ! because it is freaking loud ! and then they speak again ruin the moment kill the joy destroy the movie",1

9 May 2016,Entertaining and silly at the same time while the writers manage to not make a mess out of this huge ensemble cast,"""Wow!! A Super-Hero movie"" days are gone with one releasing every month and the interest levels getting saturated with the audience. In these times, the studios, artists and technicians are always trying to find ways to out-do each other, come up with something fresh and innovative each revision which sometimes work. Marvel seems to be a clear winner in the genre war against DC which seems to be imploding with its heavy-handedness continuing the strategy successfully used by Christopher Nolan in the Dark Knight trilogy. On the other hand, Marvel seems to have understood the pulse of its mass audience better and kept churning out blockbusters with relative ease - but not sure how long the same strategy works.

The storyline is very close to ""Dawn of Justice"" and many other recent superhero ventures dealing with people's tolerance towards vigilante justice and accountability for collateral damage. After an operation to thwart a mercenary from stealing a bio-hazardous virus goes bad in Lagos, Nigeria leading to deaths of innocent civilians, the Avengers are held accountable and an accord is passed to give control of their missions to a UN committee. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Natasha a.k.a Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) sees reason in this request and plays ball but not Captain America (Chris Evans). When a bomb explodes in the accords convention at Berlin, and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) comes out as a prime suspect, battles lines are drawn and each member of Avengers are forced to take sides.

What Marvel is getting right in the Avengers series is the treatment - after all these characters and story lines are straight out of comic books. While they try to build mature character arcs and brings in a serious plot involving death of some characters, the treatment is still on the lighter note focused solely on quick and cheap entertainment. If a viewer takes especially this storyline seriously, there couldn't be a sillier premise with the two groups of Avengers fighting each other but not seriously enough to hurt each other. Another attribute that Marvel has been doing so good is how to write a script that gives enough screen time and importance to this plethora of characters.

Starting with the technical departments, the special effects are slick and on par with other recent movies. A special credit goes to the writers for coming up with a smooth screenplay with so many characters each having their space. While it features some of the best actors that Hollywood could offer, there isn't enough in the script which requires them to play out of their skin. Most of the actors are veterans in this series who has established characters and mannerisms, so rather than indulging in their performance analysis - I would rather go over some new characters in the Avengers series. Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther doesn't come off as menacing as he wants to be without the costume, but the effeminate mannerisms with the costume makes it highly inconsistent. Paul Rudd (Ant-Man) has built his entire career on his comic timing and the writers have ensured they leveraged the most out of it. However the revelation has been how good Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man (Tom Holland) has been integrated into the Avengers universe with lots of wit, charm and heart - which the web wielding audience favorite is know for. Overall the pace is brisk, the battle scenes of the actual premise is entertaining and silly at the same time while other action scenes are worth a watch, the actors seem to be having a good time and it shows in their performances. The makers have overstayed their welcome for sure with the repetitive gags and banter between their lead characters across multiple Marvel movies, I am not sure if I am ready for more of this.

Entertaining and silly at the same time while the writers manage to not make a mess out of this huge ensemble cast.",7
6 February 2019,The best MCU movie of them all.,"Without a doubt, by far the best MCU movie of all time and Marvel overall. An amazing CLASH of the titans, where everyone fights everyone, no one believes no one, but everything is fighting for a cause in which they believe in. The Avengers divide over a serious political debate which tears them apart into two seperate sections of the Avengers, one led by C.A. and the other by Iron Man. Every superhero gives his best in this movie to proove his worth and specialty as a Marvel Comic character and that is why it is so special. Alone the fact that this movie doesn't need a real villain to be good prooves by point first hand. The Spider-Man apperance was beautiful and so perfectly timed that it feels more natural than any situation in which we've seen Peter. He is obviously a young kid, but a kid aware of the dangerousness of being a hero so small amongst the real giants like C.A. or Scarlet Witch. This is the perfect MCU movie.

5 May 2016,The Best Marvel Movie Yet,"I'm not prone to hyperbole and I toss around perfect scores like they were lead balloons. But HOLY COW, THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!!!! The action was great. The fight scene between the heroes that was teased in the trailers is so awesome. I wasn't in favor of the young Spider-Man because in the comic Civil War story line, he's the one who turns from one side to the other and I thought it would be less meaningful if it were a teenager who was manipulated, as opposed to a man in his 30s but considering everyone else is an adult, the young Spidey is a nice change. He has some really great dialogue with Tony Stark and Steve Rogers.

There's a twist at the end of this movie that maybe some people will see coming but I didn't. It had me whispering ""Oh no, oh no, oh no"" into my hands. As opposed to Batman V. Superman (you know the comparisons are inevitable) where it's not clear why the heroes hate each other and are fighting, what makes this movie almost tragic is that you know that they don't hate each (in fact, there's a lot of dialogue that states how little these friends want to be fighting each other) but you understand why each hero feels he or she has to.

Black Panther and Spider-Man are really awesome. I guess I could criticize how this movie really didn't set up how Black Panther is able to do what he does but on the other hand, BVS didn't set up Wonder Woman very well and she likewise was one of the best parts of that movie.

Overall, I hope this movie brings in more money then BVS because it is near flawless. This is how you do a team-up movie, D.C. You give us a chance to get to know your characters, little by little, have them grow to like each other and THEN break them apart. You tried to skip to the end, without laying the groundwork and that's one of the main reasons your movie is inferior. I wanted to love BVS but I'm sorry, this is just the better movie.",10

23 July 2022,Boring for adults,"I know I'm the wrong age to view these superhero movies but I actually enjoy some of them when there is an entertaining story line. For example, the final Wolverine movie, Logan and Gal Gadot's first Wonder Woman were superb pieces of film making that adults can enjoy. Captain America Civil War which I've just viewed was the most crashingly boring and over long movie I've seen this year and it's now July. It was something to do with politics, which I had to look up as I didn't have a clue what it was about. It seems that Captain America's team were anti government intervention (Republicans) and Iron Man's team were in favour of government telling them what to do (Democrat). Bringing Right and Left politics into comic books would be above the heads of the demographic that the movie was aimed at, ie, teenagers and young twenties, so it beat me why this dreary bore fest ever got filmed. The kids don't care or would not understand anyway and only want to see the action or glamorous women like Scarlett Johansson surely. The only minor relief was the introduction of Tom Holland as the new Spider-Man who at least is entertaining but we only see a very small amount of screen time. How these actors like Chris Evans and Robert Downey can spout such banal infantile crap with straight faces like they do is beyond me. Loads of money I guess.",2

19 January 2019,Great suprises and action but questionable plot,"I caught myself a few times calling bullsh#t on the plot, even though they had good ambitions for the main idea.

The movie had some awesome surprises, I really did not expect some of the content. Also the action was great, new gadgets to see which havn't been in previous MCU movies.

Probably one of the better MCU movies.

I could go on and on but that'll give you an idea about how much of a disappointment it was.A civil war with like 12 people isn't a civil war.And if Marvel actually cared for making a civil war adaptation,they should've acquired all the character rights instead of jumping the gun just because DC came up with the original idea of pitting superheroes against each other on their second movie while Marvel has been doing the same boring linear story lines for the past 12 films.That being said,civil war comic book lover might want to look the other way because this piece of crap was made for the pure reason of introducing black panther and spider-man.Instead of them getting their own movie first,Marvel again did it the DC way by introducing characters before their solo film (like wonder women on batman v superman).I understand doing it the DC way but butchering a great comic book for that sole purpose isn't just how you do it. Now onto the goods:

Spidey and panther,great characters done justice by their actors.Also spidey looks like a poorly done cgi

The Action,the stunt team from john wick never disappoints especially with their practicality.

That's about it.Can't say I enjoyed it as much I'd hope to but whatever,its just another cash grab from Disney.If you're a mindless Marvel sheep I KNOW you're drooling over this right now but for the rest of the people who saw it knows that it wasn't the ""masterpiece"" the critics have been painting it out to be.That being said,can't wait for the next Marvel crap fest.

29 August 2016,Great movie but without game of throne balls,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",8
11 May 2016,Great start to phase three.,"I had a great experience, great movie with good effects I watched this movie in IMAX 3d and the CGI is out of the world, some scenes may lack this is only reason I rated it 9 of of 10 otherwise it's hard to find a negative point.This movie have everything, emotion, drama, great action scene and also good story line. I would suggest people who all aren't marvel fan, please read background story of the characters who all are in this movie which will help you to enjoy this masterpiece from Russo Brother. I personally enjoyed a lot because I am a marvel fan, lot of people will say it's boring and they will try to compare it with Dc's batman vs superman, but it's completely different. Don't listen to anyone guys go for it.

23 October 2021,OK,"The whole movie is built around a conflict that's genuinely stupid. Nothing stands out, the music is formulated, the humor aren't funny but the action scene is somewhat pretty cool, though it would've been a lot cooler if they actually have risk. It is as fun as a Marvel movie can be I guess and it's definitely better than the other captain america movie.

31 May 2016,Not A good movie and it don't deserve that much rating,"Not a good movie as i expected and as they (MARVEL) over advertised it ........................ first of all when the first trailer was released i was amazed and so on as movie released, i watched it and i was like WTF is that movie ........ Winter Soldier was so much a great movie than Civil War ......... although the actors acting was totally awesome especially Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and also the Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) new Armour Bleeding Edge Armour ................................... this movie don't deserve that much rating.....................

............... I hope that MARVEL and RUSSO BROTHERS will make better upcoming movie Avengers: Infinity War – Part 1 & 2 ........................

My best wishes to them good luck MARVEL :)

2 May 2016,Wow!,"After watching Captain America civil war i can surely say all i want to do now is watch it again! I'm not going to spoil anything in this review, i just wanted to give a huge shout out to Tom Holland who was an absolute brilliant spider-man! In fact every character in this film done a superb job, all of them leaving memorable scenes. I would also like to add that before seeing this film i was hesitant on having so many comic book heroes in one film, but the way they were put into the film was fantastic. At no point during the film was i bored, it's completely action packed with a very strong story line, not only that but it has that sense of humour that everyone can enjoy! 10/10

7 May 2016,All You Need To Make Your Day!,"Hi, This is my first Movie Review. I had a lot of hopes of this movie cause after all its a Marvel movie and moreover starring Robert Downey Jr. in it. And I am glad to say all my expectations are met. I am truly satisfied. The movie's highlight was supposed to be Chris Evans but Robert Downey Jr. steals the show.The suspense is heartbreaking yet its worth it. The story takes a surprising turn towards the end. Sebastian Stan was a total game changer.This is the movie where all your prediction goes wrong. Tom Holland Makes a type of Guest appearance. Chadwick Boseman is a surprising package. Martin Freeman has a short yet dominating role.Paul Rudd has a big surprise of everyone. The end is so thrilling and suspenseful that waiting for the next movie is like waiting for the next season of Game Of Thrones. The teaser at the end blows away everything you thought. At Last the movie is worth your money and is better than any previous Captain America movie. Thanks Folks, I hope this review was helpful,

10 May 2016,I'm getting old,"Man oh man, these superhero movies don't thrill me at all. I fell asleep when I went to see Age of Ultron in downtown LA, Deadpool seemed like the worst movie I'd seen in ages and then there is this.

It seemed like the exact same thing to me. Same plot devices, same structure, same plot twists, same characters, same dialogue, same action sequences. There was no freshness, not creativity at all. When the protagonists came face to face in the airport-scene, it seemed like a ballet. It seemed cool, but a little silly and very staged. This movie lacked urgency, it lacked sharp plotting and creative action set pieces.

While watching the movie, I was thinking about whether there had been superhero movie that had that, superhero movies that were fresh and sharp. And I started reminiscing, while watching this movie, about movies like Xmen (2000), Spiderman (2002), Kick-Ass and The Avengers. Movies that had a sense or urgency, were fresh and sharp. Between them there are dozens of movies that are lazy and boring. And this is one of them.",6

5 May 2016,This is why I love Marvel Cinematic Universe!,"This movie is awesome!

I watched this movie last week. And everything is PERFECT! The story, humor, characters, conflict, script, everything <3 EVERYTHING IS PERFECT

I love how they portrayed Spiderman in this film Finally they got Peter Parker/Spiderman right! And the Black Panther was introduced nicely too!

I won't spoil anything because it's too good to be spoiled.

Oh, I suggest you to search WHIH Newsfront channel on Youtube and watch their recent videos before watch this movie.

P.S. Do not expect the villain will do much. Because this story is about Capt. America vs Iron Man, people!",10
31 August 2016,When titans clash,"Everything flows, everything changes. And the superhero movies are no exception. The times of characters whose human side resorted to a single facial expression are over, now the world wants to see heroes who are more human than godlike.

Steve Rogers, a character I hardly knew before the new era Marvel films, is arguably the most prominent landmark of that switch. He started off as a human, whose humanity was his only strength, and remained a human even after having been turned into that super powerful machine called Captain America. Batman, Hulk or Iron Man are all fancy and stuff, but it's Captain America whose films make it one level deeper and one step further into blending the CGI action and the real drama of human relationships.

Last two times these Cap's qualities were used to fight super villains. Now, when there seem to be no sinister forces on the horizon, Steve Rogers must face a new challenge, coming from within the very nature of the world he pledged to defend, and from the very league of extraordinary gentlemen he's teamed up with to do it. Of course, we are our own worst enemies, so there's nothing new. But when politics starts meddling in, there's no worst thing that couldn't get any worse.

There's no point re-telling the events of CA:CW. However it's clear that Marvel really wanted to push every aspect of the film to the limit, even the smallest details. Because when even for the small episodic roles you cast such solid figures as Martin Freeman and Marisa Tomei, it's clear that you don't want to leave anything to chance. And since the action was always a selling point for the Marvel movies, one can be sure that CA:CW won't fail to deliver.

Yet, while exploring the almost uncharted territories of the questions like whether humans should try to subdue a force that they can't control or whether a public consensus is worth casting aside your personal beliefs, this film treads a bit too carefully, unwilling to burn any bridges leading to the old unanimous days. The antagonism between Tony Stark's corporate ways and Steve Rogers' faith in individual freedom was clearly there from the very first meeting of the two guys, and The Age of Ultron has brought in Stark's overprotective and paranoid delusions. Yet, as the conflict unfolds in a more violent way, no side manages to move it past the point of no return, either by incapability or by unwillingness and forgiveness. Which, despite the fact that our superheroes don't shy away from publicly flashing their bruises and black eyes anymore, is a promise of a happy ending one bit too obvious to be compelling.

CA:CW is without a doubt an excellent and gripping movie, and letting the second echelon of Avengers participate on par with Captain America and Iron Man was a pleasant refreshment which hopefully will lead to their characters having enough depth in the future. And of course thank you Marvel for introducing the new incarnation of Spider-Man, because even though we saw Tom Holland for just about ten minutes, he is already more natural and appealing as Spidey than Andrew Garfield was throughout both of his films.

Yet despite a bit of green in the blue of his eyes, Captain America is still way too flawless, both outlook- and performance-wise. And no millions of dollars in school grants, political approval or traumatized past make Tony Stark's flaws genuinely appealing. So there might be a civil war going on, but when it doesn't induce an inner conflict in yourself, dividing you in half and making you guess which side is the good side, there's only so much engagement such war could provide.",8

12 May 2016,Action packed movie but not better than Batman V Superman,"First of all I want to say this is an Action packed movie but it's not better than Batman V Superman. There are so many heroes that it will impress you, the action scenes and story line are tight and the action is non-stop, you wont be disappointed. There are a few breakout stars, Tom Holland is big in this movie and stole the show, also Paul Bettany as the Vision is just Awesome, he brings an intellect and presence that is better than the Vision ever was in any comic adaption since the beginning, yes he's good, and he must be in Avengers 3! Also Jeremy Renner was really good in this film, he really proved his usefulness, he just gets better with each film, he was good in AV2 so I hope he will show in AV3 and any other Marvel films he shows up in why he's an Avenger. However once we get the Excellent action sequences and the excellent story line, there's the unfortunate consequence of loosing a lot of Robert Downey's marvelous charisma and wow factor, we don't get to see too much of the magic that we've seen on AV 1&2 and the Iron Man movies, the story keeps moving along which is good but we miss seeing his good side, remember he is still a good guy, he's still a hero at the end of the day even if he's not a role model, we don't get to see that good, funny charismatic and charming side of him which makes him radiate. I hope he will in Avengers 3 and we also missed those little brainsy verbal interchanges where they point out surprising and thought proving parts of each of their characters as they did in Avengers 1&2, please keep those sharp verbal exchanges coming they really make the film. Also another consequence of the fast moving story is, there are no supporting characters, Gwyneth Paltro, but they did include William Hurt which could mean another Hulk Movie? To tie in with Avengers 3? I hope you realize how important these supporting characters are and hope to see Stellan Skarsgard, and Natalie Portman, along with Paltro, and a few others at the Final in Avengers 3. However before then please make sure Thor 3 Rocks and if possible have Hulk in it, Ragnarok and Hulk smash, sound great together like peanut butter and Jelly and please make sure Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is there he is just fantastic! Finally Thanos must be not only a force to be reckoned with but should look the part, and the kitari should be done away with for another better alien army like oh say the Skrull (you showed the Kree in Guardians)and maybe you could throw a new F.F. this time get it right (the last one was bad) stick to the comics, Reed Richards is a serious scientist, get a whole new cast this time, better and more serious this time (although the thing and torch should still joke around) lets see Galactus and Terrax the Tamer and the return on a better Silver Surfer this time get his powers right, they don't come from the board, an appearance from the Watcher, and the Celestials would really be sweet. Make sure you get a director that loves the F.F. Like Sam Raimi loved Spiderman, do make Doom look like Doom with the mask, an Iron man type armor, with the dark green robes hood and make him have presence please, a heavy character. It would be great to have the Skrull invasion they are the most visually striking and interesting aliens and they should be kept the way they are, yes green, with the weird chin and the shape shift, and the Super skrull as well as Annihulus could pop in, the Imperial guard and the Kree all very exciting stuff. I mean if we are geeking out then get Geek done right, look up some of the John Byrne inspired comics for these stories no one wrote them better or more intelligently or as exciting as he did. Speaking of which look up his Hulk comics probably the best and before he left he did the incredible to the hulk and banner, on his last issue, check it out and we never found out what would have happened when the two were separated.

The last thing I will say is Batman V. Superman made great use of their supporting characters and the story as interesting and tight as it was made use of the characters everyone shined, including the music, the special effects, the attention to detail, the lighting cinematography was not lost on the eye of the beholder and I hope Zack Snyder does not listen to these critics who were ever so wrong about that movie being a flop, he proved them wrong, and I hope he continue the exact train of execution for this cinematic masterpiece, well done Zack. Last thing I have to say After Avengers3 there must be a Avengers V, Justice League film where the public will vote who wins in each fight, this is thrilling stuff the both camps have done, never before has something as wild as this been put on screen, make this happened you hear me out there Marvel, DC? You will make billions!!! and break every record out there and the excitement level will be off the charts!!! P.S. Bring back the Comic Code Authority, don't try to pretend you don't know what it is, protect our kids from objectionable content that these wild writers are penning, you hear me talking to you, alright I'm out of here.",8

18 October 2018,Civil war between two?,"Well the title of this film with 'civil war' is a bit over the top, I say this as I am not a massive follower of Marvel having only started watching marvel this year but civil war it isn't it's between a few of the Marvel characters and headed at the realm of each team is Captain America and Iron man.

Having said that the film was filled with CGI generated action. The story is one of politics within the Avengers being that the government want them to have them only avenging when they want them too. You know kinda like any government lol. The avengers are split and war breaks out.

It's well worth a watch and as marvel films go it's one of the better ones.

Acting great, good (kinda how governments interfere) story visually perfect

22 June 2016,"Flawed, but still a great superhero film","(SPOILERS)

Captain America: Civil War is one of the best Marvel movies and superhero movies to date. It's not particularly groundbreaking story-wise and, at times, falls prey to formulaic nature of the previous films in the MCU. If you're not a fan of the Marvel universe, this film won't change you're mind. However, if you are a fan, I don't see any flaw strong enough to incite dislike of the film as a whole. It boasts every element that fans love about these movies: the action, the humor, the interesting and entertaining character interactions, etc. Despite the title marketing Civil War as another Captain America movie, it's much more reminiscent of the Avengers films. The focus is spread evenly among both Cap and Iron Man. Both sides of the ideological warfare are shown, with no clear- cut ""these are the 'good-guys' and these are the 'bad guys'"" element. Both sides are attempting to do what they believe is right. Even the character of Zemo, who is more or less the villain, has a clear and understandable motivation for tearing the Avengers apart. Each character is given just enough time to shine and, more importantly, each character is feels relevant to the main story. The action is entertaining and filled to the brim with wit and creativity. The airport scene is easily the best superhero brawl ever on-screen. I loved the dramatic tonal shift during the third act. The battle at the airport was largely a big comedic skit, with each character seeming to have a fun time fighting each other for the most part. However, a series of events including Rody being injured and Iron Man finding out that Bucky was responsible for his parent's death lead to the final fight between Cap, Bucky, and Tony to be an epic, intense, and almost dead-serious climactic clash. Despite all these great aspects of Civil War, the movie has it's downsides too. I have two major gripes:

1. The lack of character death takes away from any palpable tension and feeling of possible consequences. This isn't so much a problem specifically with Civil War, but for entire superhero genre. Major characters don't die and, if they do, they won't stay ""dead"". I ranted about this in detail in my Batman V. Superman review, so I'll keep it brief here. For a movie that is supposed to be a game changer for the franchise, I would think that at least ONE major character would die. Just ONE. Is that really too much to ask? On the bright side, they didn't pull a ""Batman V. Superman"", by pretending to kill off a character, only to bring them back in the cheapest way possible. Characters simply don't die. War Machine, who I think we can all agree isn't super important in the franchise, is wounded, but, of course, doesn't die. Don't worry; he will be back in the next movie. Even though I am strictly against judging movies based on loyalty to source material, I can't help wondering why they decided not to kill of Captain America like in the comic books. As awesome as the final fight scene was, there was very little palpable tension for me as I know that neither Iron Man nor Cap would bite the dust in the end. Even if Rody/War Machine had actually died, that would have at least created some sense that there are actually stakes. Nope. Everybody survives and everybody is friends again in the end. Yay.

2. The cinematography is, for the most part, bland and unmemorable. Both Avengers movies had ""the one"" long shot amidst the action that stood out, showing all of the Avengers kicking ass together. Civil War doesn't have this. They missed a golden opportunity to have a long shot of all the heroes fighting at once. As the fight is about to begin, we get a nice, long shot of all everybody running at each other, but just as they are about to clash, the camera cuts away and begins showing brief tidbits of two individuals fighting, followed by another shot of another two fighting, and so on. There is never ""that one shot"" that stands out. Don't get me wrong; that entire sequence was great; I just wish there was more to cinematography.

Obviously, there are plenty more Marvel films to come. Heck, ""Phase 3"" is only just beginning. However, thus far, Civil War is the best of the bunch. In my opinion, it's the best Marvel film we've had yet, and the best superhero film since The Dark Knight.",9
28 April 2019,The biggest threat is yourself,"This movie is everything that Marvel should be. Let's start with the villain: Zemo. Phenomenal, he has a motive that makes sense, he is creative, uses his intelligence to fight the Avengers and not his strength, and is shown to us not through conflict but through small snippets of his plan throughout the film. The red herring plan is great and allows for the perfect conflict. Breaking the Avengers apart is the perfect concept for Marvel, it creates tension between characters that will have to be overcome in the future. We learn about Bucky, learn about Tony's past, and we get a massive insight into Steve's morals. Steve has already been seen doing what's right and just even if it disobeys direct orders, but this time he does it not against the government, but against his best friends as well. This movie also provides an introduction to multiple characters that were previously either not yet seen in the MCU, or had just not yet been introduced to the other characters. Overall it really is the emotion and story and development of Tony, Steve, and Bucky that drive this film to be as good as it is.

1 May 2016,Age of Marvel,"Despite the rather similar line up, it has obviously been decided that Captain America films would involve a little more of the adult world, leaving the Avengers movies for pure SMASH. Hence the Age of Ultron was a bit of a mess, but the Cap is ahead of the curve. Another clue is the leaving out of the ultra cartoons Hulk and Thor.

One of the advantages of Captain America is precisely his lack of charisma. That throws the laugh lines to everyone else - even the Vision gets to clown about. And it's the humour, interjected in the action and intrigue that is handing these films a massive boost. The Black Panther is mainly given space to be Noble (joking aside, he is the one actually enhanced black guy, not mere sidekick). And Spider Man, take 3, is probably the best man / boy for the job.

Once you get used to the sudden switches of city (usually with the name written across the entire screen) the frenetic pace doesn't trip the film up. There are still a number of plot holes and lacunae, but these are forgotten about because we got to see gems like Tony Stark sitting in Peter Parker's student room, chatting up Aunt May.

The plot is certainly one we've seen before, but is a better way to house this type of titanic film than 'beat the super villain.. GO"" or battle for the super thing-my. One of the strongest lines is given to the injured War Machine (or Iron Patriot. Or War Hammer) - who expresses his support for the hardline position right to the death - giving the film a palette of grey that allows for a serious review.",7
11 July 2016,Up there with the best comic book films of all time,"Ill keep this review spoiler free. This is quite simply the second best mcu movie only surpassed by the first avengers and easily up there in the top 4 or 5 comic book movies. I put it up, dare i say, with the dark knight (though obviously not AS good). The fight scenes where exquisitely choreographed, it was funny where it fit well but serious when it needed to be. It had real emotion in parts (namely the final fight) and the acting was stunning.The villain was great and i really enjoyed how he used tactics and smarts to defeat the avengers rather than brute force and in a way he succeeded. Though the movie got a bit messy at parts, jumping between locations and characters, it all came together in act 3 and the plot was all tied up.One thing i would say is having watched the winter soldier as well as age of ultron prior to this movie will make the plot more tidy and easier to follow, making it even more enjoyable to watch.

All in all, this is 100% worth a watch and its a superbly directed, well shot, well scripted, exhilarating film that is up there with marvels best as well as this genre of action super hero films best.

(Btw i would give this about a 9 but since the overall IMDb rating is unfairly skewed because of haters i gave it a 10 as the overall score)",10
5 April 2018,probably the best marvel movie I have ever seen till now.,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",10

16 December 2021,So lots of money,"Oh, they spent a lot of money to accumulate so many special effects... Oh, they spend a lot of money to accumulate so many big-name actors... Then, they should also spend a lot of money to describe the bunch of things like this grocery store as real art... After so many years, they should be about to succeed.

Come on, American mainstream culture!

On that day, the United States has real art, China has real democracy.

The world is really perfect!

23 May 2016,The safest hands are still MARVEL's own.,"'Captain America: Civil War' delivers on all cylinders as MARVEL and the Russo brothers serve up the best MCU film thus far.

1. The plot is quite intriguing yet simple at the same time, as the movie opens with the Avengers trying to thwart a terrorist attack lead by former SHIELD agent now mercenary; Brock Rumlow/Crossbones. Things end with casualties, leading the Avengers to not only have to answer for their previous mission, but the events from earlier films (The Avengers, The Winter Soldier & Age of Ultron). Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron-Man (Robert Downey Jr.) are divided when when accords regulating their activity is presented, thus leading to high tensions and an ultimate all-out war. What's even more interesting are the sub-plots involving Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) and Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) respectively.

2. This film consists of more characters in one film thus far and the Russo brothers balance things just right (even better than Joss Whedon to an extent), giving each character their time to shine yet keeping the focus on Captain America since he's still the focus of the film. The action is spectacular and the best MARVEL has shown so far. 'The Winter Soldier' had one of the best hand-to-hand fight sequences and this film also has an outstanding fight and chase scene between Bucky and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). Of course the main set-piece is the mind-blowing sequence between Cap and Iron-Man's team as they clash heads during the airport sequence. IMAX is used to superb effect for this sequence so the action leaves the audience breathless.

3. Even though the movie is mainly focused on Captain America, Black Panther, Spidey (Tom Holland) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) are the standouts to the film (of the latter I can't say why, but if you've seen the film, then you know what I mean;). They never seem forced or misplaced, even though Spider-Man was a late addition to the cast, they all just leave you wanting more and hyped for their future respective films. I believe 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' and 'Thor: Ragnarok' will play a bigger role in setting up 'Infinity Wars', cause this film is undoubtedly more grounded than the others. If anything else, it leaves you wanting more and curious as to where Steve Rogers' story will go from here.

4. If there are some complaints, they are very few and far between. There's one thing I can say without spoiling anything, is that a very interesting and potentially threatening character (who was introduced in a previous MCU movie) is eliminated near the beginning of the film. Bucky feels a little less sympathetic than he did in 'The Winter Soldier' considering he plays a major part here. A potential love- story arises in the midst of the film, but it seems just a bit misplaced in an already crowded film. However, these really aren't major complaints to linger on in the film because everything else is so fantastic that it makes you forget.

The Russo brother have outdone themselves once again, and it's safe to say that 'Infinity Wars' are in the right hands. Joss Whedon only wishes the previous 'Avengers' film could have come together as well as this did. 'Captain America: Civil War' is surprisingly unique and presents elements audiences haven't seen before, and that makes it a fun and action-packed feature.",9

13 July 2018,A fantastic thriller with some amazing action sequences.,"With amazing, heart-pounding action sequences, an intriguing character-driven storyline and several fantastic character introductions, 'Captain America: Civil War' is definitely of the MCU's best and also one of the very best in the genre. This is largely due to the way in which its 'superhero' aspects come second to its 'thriller' ones, meaning that the film is about much more than CGI extravaganza. All of the action feels entirely grounded, despite the inclusion of various clearly ungrounded superpowers, and the focus on practical hand-to-hand combat makes the film feel much more palpable. The movie is also full of emotion, as we see characters that we have grown to love pushed to their limits and forced to do things that go against their 'hero' personas, which again adds a sense of weighty realism to the picture. It's a constantly enthralling political thriller, and a lot of fun that never drags, despite its 147 minute run-time. 9/10

6 October 2019,Almost Avengers Light,"Not as superb as the directing Russo Brothers first one ""The Winter Soldier"", due to a complexion of being almost an ""Avengers"" movie; ""Civil War"" builds up to a kind of thrilling potential in the final confrontation between Steve Rogers vs. Tony Stark.

Production Design and musical score are behind expectations in this super-high budget Marvel movie. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. play the hell out of doctored script preserving the enormous as delivered spectacle in ""Infinity War"". Too many characters reduce the fun factor, when the story's spine should have been simple enough by taking sides for the cause of protecting a friend from prosecution.

Nevertheless new introductions to the ""Marvel's Avengers"" universe as ""Black Panther"" portrayed by highly-gifted African-American actor Chadwick Boseman, known for Universal's ""Get On Up"" (2014) and Warner's ""42"" (2013), keeps the modest entertainment drum in this Phase 3 Marvel movie pumping.

6 May 2016,"No matter how much good you've heard about this movie, you cannot ""oversell it""","Captain America; Civil War demonstrated,.. The best superhero action any generation has ever viewed. If you are are true Captain fan, and your concerned about him sharing screen time, I assure you, there is more Captain tear-downs than in any of his other movies. That being said, the movie also showcases the very best sequences from many other formerly introduced Marvel characters. The new characters as well, got better treatment than some may have felt about ""Age of Ultron"", (for me personally), where I felt I got just a taste of Vision and Scarlet Witch, and a very dead Quicksilver.

The most emotion we have seen from any Marvel movie, and very delicately handled. If you have any feelings for the characters that have been build up over the years, you will probably shed a tear or two. Vision and Scarlet become more solidified which was very satisfying. I went into Civil War with Black Panther very low on my excited about list, but I must say, he was impeccably cast, and added a great deal of heart, (as well as major action) to the movie. An absolute ""win"" for his introduction, and I actually look forward to his 2018 solo film.

The most diverse and well played superhero interaction we've seen to date. A gripping plot that will have you riveted from the very start. This movie has more depth than what I was led to believe from the clips, interviews, and reviews.

Get your snacks and empty your bladders because you will be cemented to your seat.",10
22 June 2018,Too many cooks spoil the broth,"Marvels comes back but this time with too much unrelated stuff that made it difficult to grasp and understand. This was based on the fight among the avengers themselves out of misunderstanding but turns out to be a bitter clash. The fighting sequences and effects were obviously good but the storyline sucks. The unimportant fights and events are introduced that may be good to watch for visual effects but these do little to make us like it on a closer look. Most of the events seem to be unrelated and cut-off from the main story like Ant-Man entered as a sudden and so did the Spiderman. The concept of the misuse of powers of avengers is very well a good idea but it could have been presented well while simplifying the story. It seemed like everyone out there is a superhero leaving no room for commons...... Nevertheless, I'm still a Marvels lover and come back to see what there in the next parts.

10 August 2020,Great Kids Movie. Expensive Toy Commercial. And That's It!,"Back when this mammoth of a movie was released, I was not really impressed with it as a whole, but I liked the action, set pieces and parts of the story. I originally saw it as badly written, expensive fan service meant to sell a lot of toys, and for manbabies to overobsess about it for months, like they always do.

I rewatched it recently, and apart from a few scenes, I find it hard to enjoy as a whole even now. However, I realized 'Civil War' isn't badly written - it's written for gullible kids as the main audience in mind. I was disappointed with myself for setting high expectations on a toy commercial.

The writing is atrocious, but I was still surprised, since McFeely & Markus wrote 'Captain America: The First Avenger', a movie with a way better story and tighter script. The dialogue switches from childish and inane to preachy and pompous. The directing is what it is; I didn't expect much from the 'Community' guys. The 2nd unit team did a hellova great job with the action scenes though.

The color grading is so boring and uninspired for a supposedly colorful comic book movie; hence why the 1st 'Captain America' is supreme. The constant change of locations is a cheap copout for lack of engaging storyline. As is the segment with Pepper Pots, the dead relief workers in Sokovia. And let's not talk about the supposedly closed society of Wakanda. Or letting terrorists like Cpt. America walk free.

I deeply disliked the inapt shoehorning in of Black Panther, it was unnecessary, but it wasn't as bad as his mentally challenged character with no depth. The entire movie is a glorified, expensive toy commercial. As a whole, it's dumbed down for mass consumption and often I rolled my eyes so hard, I got an aneurysm. Not worth another rewatch.",6

How these stupid movies rated 8!!!

It is a popcorn movie . I guess this movie just made for money . Not even care about content.

There are a lot of stars . And people eager to see what they want to do . But each of them just appear for 10 minutes. Doing stupid fight with each other and the rest of the movie was messed by stupid Stark .

I guess most of the people that vote for that movie are under 18 only kids want to see which super hero is stronger .",2
12 September 2016,NOT another Good MARVEL Movie? surely? well YES Actually,"My memory is not what it was but as I see it there's only ever been one poor MARVEL movie (Iron Man 2) and even that at times was entertaining.

So what of CAPTAIN America : CIVIL WAR?

To me it plays out as almost two movies in one...

PART ONE is an interesting, almost action free debate on how far the Avengers can go and on who's terms? this could have been a little boring for many Marvel fans but it's intelligently & entertainingly done and sets up Part Two perfectly...

PART TWO This is what MARVEL does best...putting up on screen that which many of us dreamed of back in the 1970's & 80's as a young lad. It's true it's not actually an Avengers movie in words but it's as close as you can get without ever calling it such (only HULK & THOR two terrific characters are missing here...but i think in THOR : RAGNOCK we are about to find out why they were not here) We also get an almost scene stealing turn from Spiderman (pretty much as we remember in the comics...wisecracking and commenting on pretty much everything he does, he's even picked up on it as a kinda in-joke)

ANT-MAN shows up in a fun cameo and boy has he grown :) This scene on the airport runway was FUN with a capital F.

Is it as good as CAPTAIN America : A WINTER SOLDIER?

Tough call, this is a little different with the quieter & thoughtful first half but I LOVE that MARVEL at least tried to consider things and tone down the BIG SFX showdown's until the final half which still leaves our two sides poles apart and us wondering well what happens now?

SUPER STUFF...now onto DOCTOR STRANGE and let's just hope that it's more trippy and better than simply an INCEPTION clone? with all the buildings twisting and turning...there must be more to this? the different dimensions and trippy effects are being held back I guess from the trailers? we'll see but the lead role looks nailed on to be good, just need the story and staging to be as good as Cumberbatch almost certainly will be.",9
1 May 2016,Civil War: Best of Marvel,"Well its finally here! Many people have waited for this film. Me included. This film seems to have everything. The humour in this film hit spot on! I laughed every time. I have had enough of DC fans saying that if it's funny it can't be dramatic. Thats all bullshit. This film goes from hilarious, to (Mostly in the final act) extremely dramatic and heartfelt. Even though I am a Marvel fan boy, and I would have seen this film anyway, the main reason I had to see it so early was Spiderman. I am a massive spidey fan and to see him in the MCU was fantastic. So obviously spidey was my favorite part of the film. I think Tom Holland got the perfect balance between dorky as Peter and confident as spidey. The one thing that took me off slightly was the slight overuse of cgi for spidey. I can overlook this though and I had a great time with him. Cap again is great, but Downey showed us a whole new side of Tony which was fantastic too see. He was so dramatic and at times angry. It was new and exciting. It seems that the one problem everyone had with the film was the villain and how he was wasted. Because people had said this I was expecting some random villain to show up in the final act like Doomsday for BvS, but that wasn't the case at all. His plan was interesting and well worked and we really got a good insight of the character. For me this was one of Marvels best villains put to screen yet. And the airport scene... well what can I say. Again spidey stole the show for that too. If you thing you have seen the airport scene through the trailers, you are so mistaken. You've seen nothing yet. Black panther for some reason I thought I wouldn't like, but I really did. They some how got me to love him. The characters all got a good amount of screen time and they all got a good story arc. The action is just so much more enticing because we have motivation behind it and a good story. Overall this is my second favorite comic book film (1 being dark knight. There is just no beating that) and defiantly my favorite Marvel film yet. This is a film I could watch 1000 times and never be bored. This isn't just a fantastic comic book film. It's a fantastic film. Period.",8

6 May 2016,Great movie but really more of the same.,"I enjoyed Batman versus Superman so much more than this movie.

This movie just felt terribly unoriginal, boring, and the same old stuff I've seen over and over again.

Nothing interesting about the plot. More of a showcase of all the characters, leaving the dialogue absent of anything intriguing.

Great special effects, it's also fun to see all the new characters interacting. Had a good take on Spider-Man.

Out of all the Marvel movies, this was one of the weaker ones. Better than Ant-Man.

But no where near as interesting as Batman versus Superman.",7

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",10
21 May 2016,Twizard Rating: 98,"If we're being honest with each other, I can't say I've enjoyed too many installments in the Avengers series since 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger. I mean, REALLY enjoyed them. I liked most of them, but not to the point of needing to rewatch them. The first Avengers film was very enjoyable. And so was last year's Ant-Man. But other than that, it's been growing a bit tiresome.

And within the first ten minutes of Captain America: Civil War, I thought it wasn't boding well for this one either. There was a random action scene, which felt more like action for action's sake. We weren't sure why things were happening. It was more self-aggrandizing than anything else.

But soon after, we realize it was supposed to be somewhat unimportant. Merely setting up the theme for the rest of the movie.

The Avengers are trying to stop some bad guys in Nigeria, but kill some civilians in the process.

Afterwards, the superhero team faces a lot of adversity across the entire world. The United Nations issues an act that will oversee and control the Avengers' missions. This divides everyone in the group. Some feel that not fighting every battle they hear of is a waste of their abilities, while others are affected more by the death toll of the innocent.

I wasn't expecting the ""civil war"" to be much more than a verbal conflict, but it escalates pretty badly. You know something really catastrophic is going to happen as a result of this.

Halfway through this movie, I've already realized that it's better than most that came before it.

Here's why I like it: More than almost any Avengers film, there's no convoluted premise or overuse of impenetrable fanboy references. Everything here is clear-cut. There are no alien races trying to takeover the planet. Nothing here feels like it's beating a dead horse.

This film also contains the best cast yet. Chadwick Boseman ups the ante playing Black Panther, as his acting abilities almost seem too good for this franchise. We also get some great character surprises, as well as a few minutes of Marisa Tomei.

It's a refreshing mix of each character's personality and wit, without it sacrificing the film's intent or them stepping on each other's toes.

Like any of Marvel's Avengers movie, this one has tons of charisma. But it's different this time, because it isn't forced. It becomes top tier in this glorified franchise, and moves into my top 3 favorite Marvel films since the series was launched in 2008--along with Iron Man and the aforementioned Captain America: The First Avenger.

It isn't perfect, but it's pretty close as far as superhero movies go.

It's also important to note that you should probably know some background on the whole Bucky-Captain America relationship or you might be a little lost. Also, for those of you who've never seen ANY Avengers film, this will probably all be lost on you.

7 May 2016,Russo bros are in full form,"First of all I would like to say that the Avengers franchise are in safe hands of Anthony and Joe Russo(Russo Bros).Russo bros are spot on this movie like their previous movie Captain America :The Winter Soldier.I think they know every pulse of a marvel comic fan.This movie had everything marvel comic fan wanted name it action,comedy,emotions, adventure,etc.

The casting of spider-man and black panther were spot on.Tom Holland fueled that much needed young energy to spider-man to a whole new level.For the rest of cast members,they do what they do the best like their previous movies.

Overall, Captain America : Civil War is a perfect entertainer for everyone this summer.

29 September 2018,Great plot but need Bucky Barnes more grittier not pathetic.,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

31 May 2016,Crouching Spider Hidden Panther,"In short, this is an American Wuxia movie. Superheroes are similar to those martial art warriors in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon genre, who can leap over building, have superhuman strength, bend physical law etc. Each has his/her unique fighting style and weapons. And just like a wuxia movie, the plot is about love, friendship, revenge and betrayal.

Even you can relate some action scenes to Asia's martial arts movie, like when Cap is gunned down and fall from building to the ground, Jacky Chan's stunt has done that 'fall' before. The way Black Widow/Romanoff doing 'parkour' in the market, just like Donnie Yen did in ""Bodyguards and Assassins"" and so on. The Russo's brothers seem to be a martial art fans and it's good, they made the action scenes awesome by combining the grace of Asia/Hongkong's martial art and the explosive/spectacular of Hollywood's CGI and special effects.

However, I always see Captain America as the one who obeys the laws while Iron Man always breaks them, so throughout the movie I couldn't get rid the feeling that their roles in the story are mismatched. Another thing, while it's a superb action movie, it somehow lacks of emotional depth. Their motives are just rational. Therefore, Spiderman and Black Panther are able to steal the show, hence I put them on my title review. Really looking forward for their own films.

Perhaps for the next installment, the Russo's should also add spices of Korean drama to the mix :).",7
12 May 2016,The most mature Marvel film ever,"To be exact I probably say this is a 9.5/10.

This movie works on so many levels. It is so amazing and is a great follow up from Captain America: The Winter Solder. There are so many great and amazing moments in this film and they all work and it doesn't fill to crammed in. The Russo Brothers have done what Joss Whedon was unable to do in Age of Ultron which is find a way to connect all these MCU movies in a way that makes sense.

The movie starts off with all of this political drama that is going on in what are some of the most emotional scenes I have ever seen in my life. There all so interesting and they work on so many levels. The film makes you almost want to well up in tears at times with just how good it is.

I will admit it does going on a little too long, but it still keeps you invested and makes you want to no more and learn about these characters, and how they are feeling.

This movie also makes Iron Man 3 relevant again. Something I thought Ultron would do but didn't. In the film we get this broken down Tony Stark who is wounded and hurt so much by what had happened previously. He has lost Pepper now and finds himself alone without anyone else. He is more angry now and more unhinged because he created Ultron who almost destroyed the world.

This movie makes you understand why Iron Man has chosen to take the side of the people and protect them by locking the avengers up.

However it also lets you see Captain America's side who is against the government because he seen the corruption within them after Hydra had taken over. You also see that he desires to protect Bucky who he loves dearly.

Both have there reasons and you get that and you really don't want them to fight and it makes you feel so sad when they do.

The standout stars were great.

Black Panther had a full arc here. He started on one path and ends on another. It is amazing and makes a full circle that is interesting and compelling. Chadwick Boseman also gives off a great performance and accent as well that makes it even better. I really liked that Black Panther didn't tell any jokes or quips. He didn't care he was all business.

Spider Man was also great too. This is the Spider Man I wanted since I watched Spectacular Spider Man in the 90s as a kid. He is young, a kid and not so overly hot make actor. He is just the nerdy Peter Parker and I like that.

Scarlet Witch and Vison's relationship was also great. I liked the humor there.

I also liked Black Widow who gave her all.

Really just all the Avengers did well in this film.

This film does a good job mixing its humor with its serious moments. One never over takes the other. It all works in many ways. There is a really good mix of everything her that I really had enjoyed.

The film does have some bad.

Baron Zemo I didn't mind him.. I liked him more than Lex Luthor in BvS, but he wasn't needed. When I went into this film I was going in ready to hate Baron Zemo. Why do these films need a villain. You already have heroes v heroes why do you need some really bad villain to be in it. That being said for the plot of the movie it worked and it worked it spades. The film manages to use the destruction caused by the Avengers to be the crux of why this guy is here and is willing to tear up the Avengers.

I also really didn't like the big giant title cards when they changed locations. I thought it was really strange. Just have little words geez.

Anyway that is my review of this film. I really enjoyed it. I thought it worked in all cylinders.",9
11 June 2016,Fun for the whole family! A keeper for any superhero movie buff!,"On May 6th, 7:00 PM, at a packed IMAX theater, there once was a group of four- a movie enthusiast, one of his best friends, his brother and his mother that was watching a little film released by Marvel Studios titled Captain America: Civil War. The previews before the film were either already viewed previously or largely unappealing(with the exception of a preview for Finding Dory). During the first act of the film, the group was certainly getting antsy due to the lack of events going on, despite the occasional great scene. However, once the first act starts to come to a close, lots of things started to turn up and as the film gradually moved on, it got better and better, one scene being topped by the next scene. The amount of humor starts to increase at major levels, the action starts to become more inventive and exciting, and the characters start to develop step by step. The two reasons why I have to give this film a 9 instead of a 10 are because one, the politics did confuse and bore me quite a bit during the majority of the first act, and two, the amount of non- action scenes with little to no tension did become bothersome to me. The rest of the film's quality- well, it's just pure gold, no doubt about it. Every set-piece that knows it's tone executes the scene so perfectly- the action is often engaging and having a high intensity level, the characterizations are fully fleshed out, the comedy is extremely brash yet frequently hilarious(Spidey had everyone in the cinema hall rolling) and the script is full of sharp quips and smart twists and turns. Not only that, but seeing all these Marvel heroes fighting each other for an estimated 17 minutes(such freshly imaginative use of IMAX 3D, by the way) will bring back childhoods of many(including me) that loved Marvel in the past. Overall, Captain America: Civil War is a slam-dunk great time at the movies, full of humor, awe, excitement and reasons why superhero movies can be even be enjoyed by non-fans of comics, and it will definitely stand as one of the best Friday nights I've ever had, and the rest of the audience in the theater I was in can agree with that, as they cheered the movie on fairly loudly at the end of the movie. Also, stay tuned for two post-credit scenes; you won't regret it for a second! And while the movie has great 3D effects, especially on a huge IMAX screen, the 2D version would be just as great if you don't care for 3D.",9

11 May 2016,#TeamCaptainAmerica !!,"Marvel does it again! What an excellent superhero movie, a must-see! This movie was everything I hoped Civil War to be. In addition to what you'd expect to this kind of ""action"" movie, the characters have a depth that is very palpable adding a psychological side to the story. The screenplay is nicely tied up, the action scenes very well choreographed and there is an amazing chemistry between the ensemble cast. Great acting too, the characters were spot-on! This movie is not your average good versus evil movie. It's much more a fight between ideologies which was really interesting to see. You see the Avengers split into two different sides and it is interesting to see the complexity behind their respective approach toward saving the world. I love the Marvel movies and this one is by far my favorite.

7 April 2020,Better than Age of Ultron! Has enough characters to be another Avengers!,"This movies plays out the many who would win between ____ & ____? It was fun to see certain heroes combos fighting each other, and the introduction of newer characters was done smoothly. Spiderman, Ant man and Black Panther solid in their performances. The fight between all the heroes in Berlin was easily the best part of the whole movie. Even watching it a second time I was waiting eagerly to see this scene again.

Captain America and his story seemed to play second fiddle to the over arching civil war. His romance was a bit a of a waste time, especially in the fact that his love story has hardly any return in the next few MCU movies. His bromance with Bucky was interesting enought to keep watching over the length of two movies.

The humour was relatively absent from any scenes including Captain America. The only laughs to be had were when other characters were in the scene.

Ironman almost gets more character development than Captain America through learning to submit and not be so proud. How does Captain America change as a result of this movie? He has asserted himself as a capable leader and a sacrifical friend. But I had hoped for a bit more. Although this movie is a much better Avengers movie than Age of Ultron. A better story and a much more relatable enemy, and even the enemy within your own heroes.",7
28 April 2016,"Civil war is fantastic , a new classic of Marvel Studios","12 movies that your model of cinematic universe, Marvel Studios is showing a coherence logic and narrative to teach in many sequences and movie universes that are being planned, all culminating in Captain America: Civil War, a film that is both long a fanciful sequence Captain America: Winter Soldier, ""a sequence"" Avengers: Age of Ultron, an introduction of two characters pivotal to the house of the ideas that are the Black Panther and his All Star, Spiderman, how to this in a movie with so quality? The Russians Brothers could not only that, but made the best film of Marvel and say more, is by the Dark Knight as one of the most important works of the genre, with fantastic action scenes (especially one that takes place in an airport, where each character can make a more epic thing to another, using fine powers) the downtrodden whole script in vigilantism, almost post Snowden references, Robert Downey Jr justifies its very high salary and his best performance as Iron Man, a performance as magnetic as charismatic, Chris Evans creates a Cap full of nuances and layers, we feel how their decisions weigh on his journey, the new additions of the Avengers are spectacular, Tom Holland simply creates the best Spider-Man the big screen, Bosseman embodies the Black Panther with all power and majesty that the character deserves and Scott Lang Paul Rudd with his comic taken almost always well- aimed. Although sin in your villain not giving developing the character deserved and some small mistakes and lack of courage here and there, the stage is Captain America and Iron Man, with his motivations, views and his power of influence, this makes the movie relevant and opens a new range to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 9.6 / 10",10
9 May 2016,Nothing new,"CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR: This is Marvel Comics' answer to DC Comics' Batman V Superman, and just like the latter, the conflict between the Avengers, with Caption America and his team vs Iron Man and his team is rather contrived. And just like Batman V Superman, when indestructible forces collide there is considerable collateral damage to the surrounding environment as well as huge civilian casualties. When an accident causes a building to be destroyed and lives lost, the UN plans to form a panel to oversee and control the Avengers, who, while defeating threats, apparently have no regard for the ensuing damage that occurs as the result of their battles. Tony Stark thinks this may not be a bad idea, while Steve Rogers feels he alone is fully capable of deciding what actions need to be taken. Thus, the lines are drawn and all hell breaks loose. There are the requisite action scenes; the car chases, air assaults with our flying heroes, etc., etc., nothing we haven't seen a hundred times before, but exciting never-the-less. The many hand-to-hand sequences are especially effective despite the usual over editing typical of the genre. The production design is fantastic as always. There are some lighter moments and scene work which are well done. Stay for all the credits. A little better than B v S. Score: 8. Go. Mayhem galore, but nothing new.",8
6 October 2018,It's ok nothing special,"Movie started off great but then i dont know it kind lost me a little the airport fight was ok i guess nothing amazing with so many heros on screen but its an ok movie but its overhyped.

3 August 2022,Not Really Fighting For The Right Reasons.....,"The Bad= As the Title suggests it doesn't feel like they are fighting for the right Reasons, and what I mean by that they are supposed to be fighting over on rather or not superheroes should be Keep In Check. But instead it just feels like they are fighting because Captain America made himself a Fugitive all because he wanted to save his Brain Washed Friend Bucky. And Ironman has to stop him. And as for the team themselves it doesn't feel like the members on each team that they are on, because they Believe In or Against the Segovia Accords. It just feels like the members are on the teams that they are on are one of two reasons, the first is that they are just Big Fans of either Captain America or Ironman, and Idealized them to no end. Or two they simply have no choice in Team Ironman's case. The Airport fight scene was much less Epic than expected specially how everyone Hyped it up to be. Oh don't get me Wrong There is lots going on, but there lies the Problem as one of the other IMDB Reviewers Stated ""It's like a Kid took a Bunch of his Action Figures and Smashed Them Together."" And I Agree Full Heartily as I feel there is so much going on I literally didn't care who one. And that also sort of brings me to my next point, just like with BVS they don't need a Villain to Manipulate the Heroes in to Fighting Each other, as both Heroes and in this case that would be Ironman and Captain America. They where already on that path since the First Avengers Film, when they where arguing on rather or not Tony Stark would make the Scarface Play By Choice or not. The longer the Film went on the Less Impotent The Segovia Accords seems to be.

So either way their Rivalry would have Boiled Over one way or another, and so what's the point of having a Villain in Manipulating the two in to fighting? They clamed that the reason that they didn't want The Incredible Hulk or Thor being part of the fight was that either one of them would be too OP for which ever Team that they would be on. But at the same time just Vision or Wonda alone are Both way more OP than both The Incredible Hulk And Thor Combined. And having Thor or The Incredible Hulk There wouldn't change much just as long as they are on opposite teams to help balance Each Team Power Dynamics out. And there are a lot of Plot Holes and Issues in this film. And Finally I just don't feel the End Credit Scene with Spiderman just doesn't mount to anything. At least the one with The Winter Soldier in the Mid Credit Scene had some sort of purpose.

The Good= I kind of enjoyed how this filmed introduced the MCU Spiderman and Black Panther. Then even if didn't like the Fight itself but I still loved the Idea of Hero Verses Hero I think it's that much more entertaining and unpredictable. Because when it comes to a Hero Verses a Villain it always results in a some what of a Predictable Ending. And Finally I kind of like the Poster but my little Nip Pick about that is that instead of having Captain America's Shield on Both Sides. I would have Had on One Side is Captain America's Shield and on the other side is Ironman's Chest Arc Reactor.",2
9 May 2016,Captain can surely fight all day long!!!,"Though it has its share of pitfalls in the beginning but a rollicking second half makes it wildly entertaining!!! What's good in the movie is that the screenplay improves gradually (all through out the movie) and leaves the viewers on a high. Chris Evans expresses beautifully.Robert Downey displays the same attitude that personifies him.Overall all the actors have done a nice job. Action sequences were top notch in the second half!!! You might feel disappointed with how SPIDEY is handled but overall it is a good watch. To sum it up it was more of an AVENGERS assemble fighting the enemy within. Highly recommended. Just go for it!!!It is worth every penny. For more such honest reviews follow me on ""Kshitij reviews"" page on FB.

5 May 2016,This is essentially Superhero porn (Revelry Review),"I rarely have high expectations for Marvel movies, but if it is a Captain America film I tend to set them a bit higher, along with the mostly positive reviews the film was receiving I had to go to the cinema to see it. It didn't disappoint me, but yet again it didn't WOW me.

This was definitely Marvel's most ambitious attempt to date, bringing in a bit of a darker approach to the film, bringing out characters inner and deeper thoughts, this added a greater amount of value to the film as we got to see them as more 2 dimensional characters rather than the 1 sided action ones that we normally see in the Marvel movies.

The humor was your normal Marvel type, witty and quirky, but I felt as though it was really inappropriate at times, especially when there was an important feud between two parties and one of the characters stops to insert a witty joke which really didn't fall into the flow of the film. Although it didn't affect the whole feel of the film it happened a couple of times and it was noticeable. So some of the time it was hard to differentiate the humor and emotion, which I feel Marvel haven't quite nailed on the head yet, the pacing of a film is important and this wasn't spot on.

Onto the the new characters; Spiderman and Black Panther were great entries to the Avengers alliance, I feel as though Tom Holland is a perfect fit as Spiderman and I look forward to future films that he will be part of. The villain Baron Zemo is quite under cast I thought, the actor was great in where he appeared but Marvel's use of him being a threat as a villain was very underwhelming, once again it felt like there wasn't any real issue with the character, and we barely saw much screen time from him.

The soundtrack wasn't terrific, as with most Marvel movies, it didn't fit where it should have. If Marvel had the orchestral pull of Hans Zimmer this would add a lot more value to the creation of their films. That being said, music doesn't necessarily always make a film, it was substantial in this one but wasn't enough to make me feel any more emotion or epicness during any scenes that were meant to make us feel that way.

VERDICT:

I liked this film mostly for its awesomeness factor, for what it was it was great, the new heroes and existing ones choosing their sides to go to war was cool and the actions scenes were exciting.

But essentially this film was merely Superhero porn, there was so much substance in the fact that these heroes were fighting each other that we lost the point of the story altogether.

I don't feel this was as good as The Winter Soldier, but it definitely entertained me right to the end, a worthy entry in the Marvel collection",8

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

12 May 2016,Marvel films are usually pretty good. This gets only a 6 from me.,"I always loved Marvel films with all of the comic book characters coming to life. The action and special effects are always great and they are here too. Tough to beat what they had in Deadpool though. This is is little too long and had silly cross stories to fulfill the Civil War prerequisite. They want to fight each other and it gets a little silly through most of the film. If you are into explosions and such, this is fine. But to work your mind and follow what is happening, not so much. I guess I need to write more so I will to get his review in. I really don't have that much to day about the film since none of really sticks to my brain. Great films do that. This one didn't The great part of all these Marvel films is the cameo role of Stan Lee in every film. This one is very late in the film. Also, there is great info about a new Spiderman movie coming in the future with Marissa Tomei as his aunt. She has more lines in the but after al the credits roll than in the film.

20 May 2016,A fantastic way to start Phase 3,"A rare thing just happened; 3 movies in a trilogy where all 3 are good. But the Captain America is a special one. This is a trilogy where the films keep getting better with each film. The first film directed by Joe Johnson was a good film, then everything changed when the Russo Bros. stepped in to direct its sequel. It was unlike any movie in the MCU, with a much more serious tone and a political thriller sub-genre. Now the Russo Bros. return to direct the third Captain America film, and the thirteenth film in the MCU, and adding the Avengers to the mix, minus Thor and Hulk.

This film takes place right after The Winter Solider and Age of Ultron. Captain America (played once again by Chris Evans) is still leading the Avengers, and even have some new recruits like Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Things start to heat up when suddenly the Avengers divide over political differences. Where the Avengers have to sign what is called the Sokovia Accords, a registration act that will control what the Avengers. On one side, Iron Man is pro-registration, on the other Captain America is anti-registration. Thus the Avengers are now divided where also Captain America continues to search for his longtime friend, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). One I love about this the most is yes, it does happen to star most of the Avengers, but the Russo Bros. do an excellent job of still making it Cap's story. The Avengers are in it, but Captain America is front and center in this movie. The film is also really emotional, especially in the end. After something truly horrible is revealed to Cap and Tony, the movie plays with our minds and suddenly, you are no longer on Team Cap or Team Iron Man, but instead, just wish to see them stop fighting, and that's what I truly love about this film. It's not biased towards the other side. Both sides have right agendas and wrong agendas

Our favorite Avengers are here too, including Iron Man, Black Widow, Falcon, and Ant-Man just to name a few. However, this movie does introduce us to brand new characters. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is the young prince of Wakanda who wants revenge on the Winter Soldier. Baron Zemo (Daniel Brühl) is our main antagonist in this movie, whose plan is for the Avengers to kill each other, and have them fall. And introducing our favorite web-slinger to the MCU, young Peter Parker (this time, played by Tom Holland), an intelligent high school student who lives with his aunt and stops crime in New York as Spider-Man.

While we've seen these characters in multiple movies now, they've really grown. Iron Man for example now blames himself for the mistakes he's done in the past movies, such as creating Ultron. Captain America is still the little guy from Brooklyn who cares much about his friends. The ones that stand out are the new characters. Chadwick Boseman nailed the part as Black Panther. From the first scene he was in costume, he just killed it. Tom Holland nailed the role as Spider-Man. Marvel finally got the character right, and I look forward to both of their movies coming soon. Another stand out is Paul Rudd as Ant-Man for his comedic presence. There is a scene where something big happens to Ant-Man that took me by surprise, and was the highlight of the movie. However the one that didn't stuck out from the rest was Baron Zemo. He's barely in it, but I'm sure he'll play a bigger role in future MCU movies.

It seems that studios that own the rights to any comic book character can't seem to get that third film right. Spider-Man 3, X-Men 3, and to some degree, The Dark Knight Rises, have all been criticized for not living up to their first two films. Captain America: Civil War is that rare example where the 3rd film is the best in the trilogy. Great direction, great characters, and amazing visual effects makes this film a joy to watch. And don't forget the action here, it's incredible. The first scene in the movie makes me feel like I'm watching an action scene straight out of a Jason Bourne movie, and that airport fight between Team Cap and Team Iron Man might be one of the best fight scenes in a Marvel movie. As to where I place it in my top MCU movies, I list it at number 2 behind The Avengers. Had it not been for another weak villain, it might've topped The Avengers for me. However, the Russo Bros. delivered once again and passed the test with their Pre-Infinity War movie. I believe Infinity War is in good hands with the Russo Bros. and were worthy successors to Joss Whedon. I very much look forward to rest of Phase 3.",10
14 July 2020,There are better Marvel flicks,"I find it hard to care about this film. It's a direct sequel to Age of Ultron, the worst Avengers movie, and whilst this movie is definitely better than AOU but it's premise is odd to me, like how would the government enforce their regulations on super humans? Do they answer this question? I don't remember because I got bored, and usually Marvel movies are at least entertaining. I also thought that the conflict between the avengers was kind of dumb. But then again I'm not a Marvel Stan and never have been.

30 April 2016,Expecting something different? Prepare for a treat!,"Captain America: Civil War is probably Marvel Studios' finest movie to date. The superhero registration act resembles that of the comics great, but halfway through the movie you can realize that the plot device is moved out of the focus, which you can either love or hate, depending on what you want to see. There's a lot of characters, and I really mean characters because of their distinct personalities and traits (Unless you haven't seen the other Marvel movies, in that case they are kinda good at best.) The characters developed a LOT in this movie (which is something to say since the other Marvel movies basically followed a formula.) So you will definitely see them changed to a certain degree in the next movies. One thought that crossed my mind in the cinema was: Was there too much going on? I'll admit, there was slightly too much going on in the movie, but what was in the film, they got the best out of. Another thing I personally thought was great about the movie is the change of tone. You get to see The Avengers in a different situation than before, and I think it's refreshing to see a very serious film. I'm also impressed that they pulled it off, since all of the other movies have always been light-hearted. Over-all this movie is incredible for any fan, and I can't recommend it enough. If you haven't seen the other MCU films then you won't like as much.",9
28 January 2018,It was good,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character.

18 May 2016,"Good, but suffers from being massively over-hyped","Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoyed this movie, but it certainly did not live up to it's 90% ratings, which honestly just seem to be spite ratings toward the critically bashed Batman Vs. Superman, which was very similar in plot, similar is kind of an understatement, just with a different tone (campy, Wagnerianly epic, and just downright weird). I love the Marvel movies, but the formula is getting a bit weary. The Avengers is perhaps one of the most balanced and best, the original Captain America and Thor were completely fun homages to their source material, Ant Man was surprisingly unique and refreshingly fun. Age of Ultron was godawful and more deserving of 20% scores than BVS.The rest are good but fall into the sequel bin, this one is close to being bin material, but is saved by the most deservedly hyped element, the airport battle. But unfortunately, the rest of the movie seems like two hours of filler. I love the characters, so I enjoyed the ride, but because I know the characters so well, I kind of questioned everything and came up with a lot of pros and cons, I'm so torn on this one, I think a pros and cons list will do best. PROS As previously mentioned, the main hangar battle is perhaps the best superhero fight since The original Avengers. Amazing in IMAX. Ant man, is great, Paul Rudd lends a laid back spirit that the plot heavy character heavy movie desperately needs. Spider-Man is fun, but honestly, there's been so many Spider-Mans at this point, it seems a bit odd, but I do like how young he is, it's a new concept for film Spider-Man. The final battle is amazing but kind of underplayed, which leads me to my first and biggest CON The last epic battle between the two protagonists is not even in the IMAX format!??! It's like after the hangar battle (which is more like playful sparring), they just stopped giving a crap, I could have lived without the initial Africa James Bondsy intro action sequence in IMAX but I know they have to have their beginning IMAX sequence.But really, without the awe of the grand scale effect, the last battle left me wondering about the spotty details of the last reveal and the horrible lame ass unnecessary villain, which leads us to Zemo... wtf, so many ridiculous plot holes, google them if you're curious but wow... Just wow. Number one, his diabolical plan is exactly the same as the also underwhelming Lex Luther in BVS... Like framing a super hero for a blowing up a government building and all just to start a fight.... Honestly, for anyone who watches Agents Of Shield, you're sitting there wondering why the Avengers are farting around with each other when Hive is on the loose. Last Con The necessary but cringeworthy spillover from the god awful Age of Ultron. The Scarlet a Witch holds up well but Vision is just as stupid as he was before. Thank God only one embarrassed mention of the awkward Hulk/Black Widow romance is mentioned. Hawkeyes once again abandons his wife/girlfriend whatever with a bunch of kids out in the middle of nowhere to avenge something or rather while hanging out with his best friend, the Black Widow. And as with all Iron Man involved movies, the inevitable Robert Downey Jr. wannabe tear jerker I'm so concerned speech, eh, why couldn't the last scene have been in IMAX format... Tsk, tsk.",6

10 April 2019,The MCU (So Far) Ranked: #11,"The fight scene though!

Captain America: Civil War is one great fight scene that is all anyone ever wants to talk about. I think the rest of the movie is also pretty good, this was our first look at how the Russo brothers would handle a larger ensemble cast and every character gets the screen time they deserve. Really though the airport fight is amazing!

11 May 2016,so finally we get to see the civil war,"So I watched the movie today with a lot of expectations and really had a great time watching it.It was again the Russo brothers who brought a uniqueness to this story like the other parts as well and did a great job. Acting wise the performance of each and everyone is top class.It was great to watch team cap and team iron man battle up against each other but the only thing I felt from the first half that what would be the conclusion.So the movie went on with a smooth pace until we got to see the epic fight.Finally at the end I thought the Russo brothers might have missed a bit of essence in it which would have really made it an innovative movie. I just felt from the beginning the movie was very logical and realistic but the conclusion part somehow lost its logical focus.On the whole this was a nice end to the trilogy and will be eagerly waiting for infinity war.So for all the comic book fans this will be a refreshing comic book adaptation.

28 April 2016,1st Avengers + Captain America 2 = EASILY The Best Marvel Movie Ever,"I was shocked when I was watching this movie on how great it is. It was not only pop-corn kind of great like The Avengers, what shocked me was how fantastic and neatly the characters were developed and how smart the movie is. The movie is the combination of the best things of The Avengers+CA: Winter Soldier, resulting the perfect combination smart grown up thriller (yup there I said it), fantastic action (action, not only CG destruction), and actually incredible dialogues and jokes that actually works.

The characters of Stark, Rogers, Black Widow, Scarlett Witch, Falcon, etc had developed, and it actually didn't feel weird how characters' point of view changes just because how organic the script is. It's well known that the whole point of the movie is Team Cap vs Team Iron Man, and both character actually have good reasons on why they choose what they chose. Like Seriously, some of my friends debated intensely on whose point of view was more on the side of good, that's how good the character development was. Aand all I can say about the new lovely Spider- Man is this Peter Parker is EASILY the best one yet by a mile. All of my Spider-Man fatigue that has been developing is completely gone, and he's the character I'm most curious to see even more in upcoming movies.

Captain America: Civil War is unpredictable and unexpectedly thought provoking, yet you would not be confused watching it because the director knows how to construct multiple story arcs. In spite of that, this film is still a perfect action-popcorn movie. The action was certainly one of the best things about the movie, yet people would not say much about it because it got overshadowed by its great directing, acting, characters, editing, just all around a great film, not just a great superhero film. I rate this movie a 9, and I usually only give a 9 rating for near perfect masterpieces that will remembered for decades to come. Captain America: Civil War is literally a perfect blockbuster, it succeed in every way possible, and Marvel proved that they are only getting better.",9

6 May 2016,one of the best by marvel!,"I never expected this movie to be this good , great job! I loved the action scenes they were amazing. The end was unexpected but was good enough for me to give this movie a 9.the hilarious punches in between will surely make you laugh specially ant man and spider man and falcon . little disappointed that spider man was not given enough of the camera story line is amazing . If you ask me I liked black panther more than captain America. Tony stark as amazing as always . Yeah its not perfect but still excellent piece of direction ,animation and acting and some epic duologue's . I supported team iron man but came to the conclusion that even cap was not wrong enough. so it deserves a 9 n is must watch for marvel universe fans.

12 May 2016,Captain America: Small Internal Struggle,"First of all, it's a given that this is no piece of art, being a Marvel movie. There won't be deep thinking or any thinking at all for that matter. You're expected to see action, explosions, awesome shiny creatures flying around and more explosions. My vote of 7/10 is after taking the genre into consideration.

Why 7? Let's start with a perfect score and move down from there.

I usually disconnect, unplug and turn off my education when I watch these movies, because I want to be a child again and enjoy them. However, sometimes my inner child decides to be smart and a little ""why?"" or ""how?"" slips out and ruins the movie a bit. Here's how it lost 3 points: Civil War is an adaptation from the comic books, but the title didn't keep the meaning. Marvel has been taking end-of-the- world super interesting scenarios and reducing the scale a lot. See Age of Ultron, for example, instead of a machine that could control most of the modern world and use it to give dawn to a new age, an age where humanity has been brought to its knees (*gasp* Age of Ultron...), we get James Spader making jokes and failing at being moderately menacing. It was barely the week of Ultron. Similarly, Civil War was a war that put humanity versus humanity and invoked a real moral dilemma that reached to everyone, turning family members and lovers against each other. It was a matter of people's own nature being possibly harmful to others. It had meaning. It reached you. The first main difference from the comic to the movie, in my opinion, is that the number of affected people is very different. Instead of millions of people that you and I can relate to, there's a dozen characters. The second one is the nature of what makes these characters special. In the comic, it was their powers, something that was part of them. There was no option to quit. They had to sign, and have their identities and powers made public, or fight. In the movie, most of the characters have no powers, just equipment. They have the option to pass it to someone, which also makes the act of signing an agreement kinda futile.

This was a story where the Hulk would have mattered and he wasn't there. Marvel moved the Earth trying to get Spider-man because he was crucial to the plot, but in the end he was there just for the action scenes. No impact at all. Thor's perspective (not human) would have been important, but he wasn't there.

So, it failed at being a Civil War movie.

On the other hand, there are so many characters that you forget who the main character is. It definitely did not feel like a Captain America movie (ok by me, more explosions).

In the end, we could have had another Captain America movie and/or we could have had an awesome Civil War movie. In my opinion, it failed, because it tried to be both. It succeeded in being something... different (who cares? explosions) I think minus 3 points for the disappointment is fair enough. It only disappointed, because there was an expectation. If you refrain from comparing to the comic or to previous Cap movies (or to anything that makes sense), it can be an entertaining movie. Again, explosions and jokes.",7
5 September 2016,A comic book fan's dream come true!,"Never before did I believe a perfect comic book movie could exist, Captain America: Civil War has proved me wrong. Where do I start, with the cast of characters so well balanced and executed, or maybe with pulse pounding action that is perfectly sprinkled throughout the movie, then sum it all up with SPIDER-MAN. Before I get too carried away, I will admit that this film does have some minor issues, they are just that, minor issues that have absolutely no impact on the quality of the film. The most prevalent issue throughout the movie lies once again with the villain. Now I think most people are way too hash on Zemo as I thought he was one of Marvel's better antagonists. He received much more character development than previous foes, and also had a convincing motivation. However, he still pales in comparison to the rest of the cast. Despite this, even with the conclusion of the movie, you can see that little bit of extra attention Marvel put towards making a adversary that didn't fall into the category of their previous, weaker villains. Now even with that explanation, I know I still seem extremely biased as I really failed to elaborate on how Zemo was flaw of the film, but that shows just how good Civil War is. Now its finally time to discuss the pros. For the sake of time, I will just talk about the three previously mentioned. First, the characters. MAJOR props goes to Civil War's screen writers as well as the Russo's who accomplish the impossible and find a excellent balance between all 12 of its super-powered characters. Each character has the part necessary for their role in the story, with minor ""Hawkeye-like"" characters not taking up too much screen time from the other major players. Even with these characters minor screen-times, they are still given the opportunity to shine, and no character exhibits this better than The Amazing SPIDER-MAN! Of all the absolutely amazing comic book superhero's, Spider-man has and always will be my favorite, and the announcement of his involvement in this film was, for me, initially met with disbelief. The slightest possibility of Spider-man being included in the MCU was literally the definition of mind blowing. Then it happened, and in the absolute best way possible. Everything from the opening shot of QUEENS to the tune of alt-J's ""Left-Hand Free"" to his heartfelt and especially comedic conversation with Tony Stark to his scene-stealing performance throughout the airport battle, Tom Holland's Spider-man left an impression in 15th minutes that, in my opinion, may have given the world a glimpse at the best on-screen Spider-man we will have seen yet. I know, that was only 2 or the three mentioned topics, but I think by now you get the idea. Civil War is filmed to the brim with comic book goodness that is sure to please fanboys, the causal audience, and everybody in between. It serves as the culmination of the events that have occurred over the past twelve MCU movies, while also being a Captain America movie at its core. It boasts some of the most mature themes ever seen in the MCU while never loosing that classic charm. There is no shortage of action, which is guaranteed to generate oohs and aahs from beginning to end. Add that all up and throw in one of the most recognizable and historic superheros of all time, and you have a perfect comic book movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",9
25 June 2016,Imagine the Avengers sitting on a couch instead of fighting,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",4
2 September 2023,Back when the consequences of the major tie-in films could be felt,"The Russos proved in The Winter Soldier that they were able to take a bland lead character in Captain America, and create a very interesting and thrilling story around him. In Civil War, they are able to take this up to a whole different level by proving that they are able to smoothly balance a dozen of different prominent characters, while still having the film focus on its lead.

This film has maybe one of my favourite stories in the MCU, how the conflict is set up, how its built as an aftermath from previous films, how it occurs and divides the heroes, and how it's consequences trickle down to the next instalments. In the end, Zemo is truly able to achieve his goal, and it's a very brave thing for the film to do and I believe it is an aspect that tends to be overlooked when looking back at the MCU.

All the characters work really well together, and the highlights for me are Steve, Bucky, and Tony. Great introduction to Black Panther and Spider-Man too. The airport fight sequences are beautifully choreographed, and will forever excite me as much as they did when I was 14. Although I do agree that that particular scene could have benefited from a better creative look and more vibrant setting than a European airport.

Overall, I now think this is the best Captain America film. Although I used to like The Winter Soldier a lot more, this film has a much stronger third act which the previous one lacks.",9

13 May 2020,If only this could be rated a negative,"Giving it a 1 star is way too generous. A minus 1 would be more apt for this travesty called a movie which should have definitely been nominated and won the raspberry award that year. There is not much by way of plot. As usual, there is an overload of unnecessary useless ""comedy"" at inappropriate times that made me roll my eyes everytime. And the villain.. where do i even begin!! Its almost 4 years and i still dont get why he was IN the movie in the first place. Anyone having an iota of common sense and self respect can give this movie a very well deserved hard pass. I pity the people giving this movie a 9 or 10. For the love of god there are better movies that deserve to earn more money than this garbage.

4 July 2017,Epic Showdown between Avengers,"After seeing the amazing second Captain America movie, Winter Soldier, I was excited for Cap's third solo movie outing. As always, Marvel didn't disappoint me. Civil War lived up to the hype. It is a great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's worth the watch for any fan of the MCU.

The story line for Civil War was really good. It kept me engaged through out the movie. The problem with the story is it can be confusing for those who don't keep up with all the different MCU movies. Also, some of the story was to set up the Black Panther and Spider-Man: Homecoming movies that haven't been released as of yet. Civil War also felt scaled down compared to the 2006 comic story line. The movie deals with the aftereffects of the Sokovia Incident and another one in Lagos which both events involved the Avengers. These two events divide the Avengers in two groups led by Captain America and Iron Man respectively.

It was amazing seeing Spider-Man finally show up in the MCU. Tom Holland nailed it as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Glad that Sony and Marvel/Disney made an agreement to share the character. I was disappointed by the last few Spider-Man movies and Marvel fixed my worries with the intro of Spidey. He was one of the highlights of Civil War. Another character introduced to the MCU is Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman was great as T'Challa/Black Panther. After seeing him in action, I can't wait for the Black Panther movie to come out in February 2018.

The rest of the cast gave great performances as well. It was good that the 2008 Hulk movie was acknowledged in the MCU by way of Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross played by William Hurt. Another problem I have with Captain America: Civil War is the villain. Daniel Bruhl's Helmut Zemo wasn't that memorable even though his actions in Civil War has a lasting impact in the MCU. Most of his actions seem like coincidences and good luck on his part. Despite that, I really enjoyed the movie and can't wait to see how the Avengers come together in Infinity War to fight Thanos.",8
5 June 2018,Stop shaking the camera,"Shaky-cam + rapid-edits + zoomed-in-too-close tight-angle-shots = the worst style of action/fight scene. This movie is plagued with this excessively shaky camera style. Frankly, I don't know why viewers tolerate this kind of thing. It looks horrible. I prefer to actually see what's going on during a fight scene, to see the fighting moves the stunt performers are pulling off, and not feel like I'm having a seizure. Let's count the Russo Bros directed Captain America movies among the worst offenders of this style, alongside the Taken and Bourne movies.

I blame the directors, the Russo Bros, because the first Captain America movie in this series, Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), which was made by another director, actually did not have this problem. That's why the action scenes in that movie are so much more watchable than in Winter Soldier or Civil War, both directed by the Russo Bros.

To be fair, the visual effects shots in this movie actually look fine. I'm convinced that different people were in charge of the effects-heavy shots vs the hand-to-hand combat shots, because whenever there are a lot of visual effects onscreen, the camera doesn't suffer from the shaky problem; for instance, when the visual effects-heavy characters (Iron Man, Spider-Man, Ant Man, etc.) are fighting, it looks fine. It's when the hand-to-hand fighters (Black Panther, Black Widow, Bucky, etc.) are fighting that we're subjected to excessive shaky-cam and choppy editing. Stop shaking the camera, please!",6

25 February 2017,A collective good like no other!,"Blessed with a star-studded cast, this sequel makes sure that each of the bold-faced names gets his or her moment in the sun, resulting in a film that's sure to satisfy Marvel fanatics. And director Joss Whedon makes sure the action is as big as its stars: Androids do battle in breathtaking scenes, worlds literally fall apart, and superheroes rescue and do good from one breathless moment to the next. The dialogue moves pretty quickly, too, inflected with humor.

But this many important characters makes for a crowded movie, with little time to allow a complicated story line actual room to unfurl. But, there's definitely enough here to please fans of the movies and the original comic books.

23 April 2022,"Take your toys, divide in half and let loose the dogs of toys.","To sum up this movie, it's like if you take a kid and all his toys and separated the toys in half and have them go at each other to see which side one...that would be this movie. Two sides, one that wants super heroes to be responsible and have government oversight and one that doesn't want that. So it splits the avengers and they start recruiting like a ton of characters to both sides, like jam pack it full of heroes. So many that they have to have them briefly appear or it will cost hundreds of millions to produce this show...oh wait it did cost like 275 million to make. It was a mess but a fun mess to watch.

6 May 2016,"Good, but not great","Civil War is a good movie. There are great heroes, a nice twist in the end (don't worry, I won't spoiler anything that's not already known from the trailers), a bad guy with believable motivation. However, it also has some flaws: At 2,5 hours it feels too long - after one hour the conflict between the main characters didn't even started. It has too many subplots and way too many characters - and especially Antman and Black Panther, this male version of Catwoman, are simply ridiculous compared to the other heroes. Overall it feels like watching Avengers 2, which had similar problems, a second time. It's a good movie, but it can't compare with Iron Man 1 or Avengers 1, the best Marvel movies so far. I think I also liked Captain America 2 slightly better - although this one has Ironman in it - because Captain America 2 has more focus on it's story and not so many characters. This one feels more like X-Men than like Captain America.

6 May 2016,Video Review for Civil War! Excellent but flawed.,"Captain America Civil War was a flawed Masterpiece! It has everything I could ask for with Spider-Man and Black Panther being great new characters. Iron man and Captain America having amazing motivations to be fighting. Every character feels so down to earth and real in this Marvel movie. There are a few things I do have problems with though. This mostly points to the fact that the movie does feel a bit too crowded in the beginning. The villain is pretty lame, feels like that type of villain that just sits around, doing stuff from his laptop, and not really feeling that intimidating. He also just feels unnecessary. I also don't like how Marvel is not willing to take risks with their characters. I am not the best typer so if you'd prefer to check out my movie review on youtube instead here is the link.

17 October 2016,"Mixed bag, but good action","Don't get me wrong this is a very good action movie.

The action scenes are strong and funny, loved seeing Spiderman in action with the Avengers.

Unfortunately the plot suffers from having to be incredibly contrived and forces our favorites heroes to be psychotically stupid in order to get the to Avengers vs Avengers that it wanted to get to.

In some way this is Batman vs Superman the good edition. Just as stupid and contrived, but much better action and punchlines.

Though if you just want a movie with good action, go ahead, you will love this movie.

2 December 2018,"Yes, I hate the MCU.","Superhero overload, nostalgia fest, part of a longterm plan by Disney to take over the world. The directors of this movie don't make good movies. This is a waste of money by producers who could've put their money and time towards actual good storytelling.

In the end, I just wish movies like this didn't exist so we could have more great movies and not just mass produced superhero garbage.

4 May 2016,Yay! It's better than the mindless garbage that was Age of Ultron!,"*Real Rating: 7.5/10*

My title says it all. Yes, I was not the biggest fan of Age of Ultron. I thought it was very average and as the months went on, my opinions split from my review: I thought it was worse than it originally was.

Civil War is a breath of fresh air but I'll have to start off with the negatives first.

1. The plot structure is a bit messy: I feel like Civil War has a bit of an identity crisis. Is it about terrorism? Is it about Bucky? Is it about Captain America? It is about Cap vs Iron Man? Is it about this new team of Avengers? Is it this? Is it that? I feel like there are too many plot elements and unfortunately the strings were not pulled tight enough. One moment the movie was about Cap vs Iron Man. Next moment it was about some terrorist.. All these elements together made it a bit confusing. Yes, things tied up at the end, but it still felt... sloppy. Just a little.

2. Bucky: I feel like Bucky is just a little moron who needs to leave these movies ASAP. No questions about it. Just GET OUT! One moment, Bucky is EVIL! SO EVIL! *GASP!* Next moment, he's supposed to be.. good..? It all feels very forced, very unnecessary. I definitely see why he is very useful to this movie and further installments, but I just don't see why he is so important. In this movie, he is literally nothing. Just imagine air. He's there, but we can't see him. Nothing to him. He is just plain air. Now imagine plain air is SUPER, SUPER IMPORTANT to the plot for some reason. He is really annoying and I don't see how I can ever like his character EVER after this movie.

3. Crossbones: what was that all about? If he were actually the villain in this movie, this movie would have been better. Is it even a spoiler to say that he is irrelevant?

4. Underused characters: Vision? Scarlet Witch? Ant-Man? Oh, you mean those characters who didn't get to show off their powers as much as I had hoped?

5. Editing in action sequences: sometimes it was good. Seconds later, I found myself aimlessly staring at the screen as the cuts were too quick and the use of (dare I say it) SHAKY CAM was annoying.

---

Time for the good stuff.

1. The airport scene: YES!!!! JUST YES!!!! That scene was almost perfect. What would have made it perfect for me is if I got to see Scarlet's powers more and Black Widow use some of those amazing moves we see in earlier scenes.

2. Black Widow: yes, she gets her own section. She's just so good! There's something so satisfying about this character. The choreography of her literally crawling like a widow up her enemies and tackling them down was AMAZING.

3. Visuals: once or twice, there was an odd visual that didn't blend in right, but overall they were beautiful.

4. Action Scenes: they were AMAZING! Editing on them could have been better and they could have used some wider, slower shots, but I loved them. My favorite has to be Black Panther's introduction. It was truly beautiful to see this dark creature looming over his prey with the sun glaring behind him. It was beautiful. The scraping of the claws against the walls... His introduction was very well done.

5. Directing: overall, the Russo brothers should be very proud. This movie was very well made.

So that's my review I guess.. A well-made movie. Some glaring issues for me that simply cannot be disguised by the positives, but at least the positives are able to balance them out.",7

13 March 2023,WHO WILL WIN ?,"Captain America: Civil War, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, is a thrilling action/adventure film that pits members of the Avengers against each other in a conflict over government oversight and personal loyalty.

The film benefits from a strong ensemble cast, with standout performances from Chris Evans as Captain America and Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man, as well as newcomers Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man. The dynamic between the characters is compelling, and the film effectively balances character development with high-stakes action sequences.

The cinematography and special effects are impressive, with thrilling set pieces and fight scenes that showcase the characters' unique abilities. The film's themes of personal responsibility and the consequences of unchecked power are thoughtfully explored, adding depth to the film's fast-paced action.

However, the film's complex plot and large cast can at times feel overwhelming, and some characters don't receive as much screen time or development as others. The film's humor and lighter moments can also feel out of place at times, detracting from the film's more serious themes.

Overall, Captain America: Civil War is a thrilling and well-executed superhero film that delivers on action, character development, and thought-provoking themes. While it may not be perfect, it's a standout entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a must-see for fans of the genre.",9

21 May 2016,The best Marvel movie I've seen,"I'm not a big fan of the MCU films, but on this weekend, I chose to watch it instead of The Angry Birds Movie (which is getting ugly reviews). But anyways, I thought it was great, much better than any other MCU film I've seen. Here's why.

I found the story in this movie solid. It was entertaining, it mostly made sense, and it was funny. In it, the world considers Super Heroes dangerous, so Iron Man wants limit to their actions, and Captain America doesn't, which causes conflict between the two. But in the process, a threat rises. I find it also deep, and well craft. Age of Ultron's story on the other hand, was simple compared to this, and not solid. But one flaw I find is there are a couple of plot holes. But I won't tell them, because it might be a spoiler.

The characters in the movie are more dynamic than they are in other MCU films. There is clearly some struggle in them, and with good reason. Also, the special effects in this movie are amazing, and very realistic and believable, despite the CGI.

So overall, I recommend this movie to anyone over 10, even non-Marvel fans. It is amazing, and I consider it better than Star Wars: The Force Awakens.",9
21 September 2016,Very disappointing,"This was a very disappointing movie.

First off the first 40 minutes or so had me and my wife yawning.

The rest of the movie had my blood pressure rising with the very apparent globalist agenda propaganda BS intertwined.

I'm done with this series and honestly I am thinking about just giving up on the ((())) run Hollywood.

America the defiant in the face of the wise, globalist, billionaire Tony Stark.

Did the Russo brothers really think that this would go unnoticed?

Hollywood had best figure out and fast that making such political statements will eventually backfire in your face the same way that Ghostbusters did pushing their feminist agenda. Beware your own propaganda Hollywood.",1

29 April 2016,The MCU has grown up and is tackling mature themes,"This is by far the MCU's darkest and mature film. The action has become more gritty, realistic and violent. The acting has gotten more serious with some humour thrown in for comic relief. Themes are no longer childish and involves terrorism, death, betrayal, politics and vengeance. The writing no longer panders to children, but to all demographics. Overall, the quality has improved drastically from previous MCU entries in writing, acting, direction and technical aspects. However, the film isn't dark and serious like Nolan's Batman because it sticks to its comic book roots and is able to distinguish itself, and not become generic. This is up there with The Dark Knight and Spider-Man 2 for best cbm ever made.

7 May 2019,"One of the MCU's best, brilliant","I wanna start off saying that the editors for the trailers should be fired as they featured non of the good and just focused on lots of whining. But the movies REALLY surprised me.

The Good: Acting is great, the best performances in the MCU by far. Tension actually exists here, some fight scenes are intense, and the story is GREAT!

The Bad: There's an annoying forced romance, a couple of action scenes had weak CG.

Overall Captain America: Civil War is excellent, propelling the MCU in a direction it should of been going all along. Thumbs up!

24 April 2019,Thrilling and Emotionally Impactful,"After finally getting around to watching this, it replaces Infinity War as my favourite film in the MCU.

It's near perfect in its depictions of its characters, and in the ideological debate it presents which divides them. It's also emotionally impactful and really meant something to me, which despite liking most MCU films, I can't say they did the same.

Evans and Downey Jr. are at the top of their game here, whilst the addition of Boseman and Holland are also superb.

Every action scene is thrilling, especially the encounter at the airport which was endlessly inventive and thrilling. That's not forgetting the final battle between Cap, Tony and Bucky which became exceedingly brutal.

11 May 2016,As exciting as a senate hearing,"Captain America: Milking the Franchise.

There are rumors that the Hollywood movie industry manipulates the IMDb ratings (this is going to get me banned so I might as well stop typing) and the score for this movie does not in any way make these rumors less plausible, en contre, I am now convinced it is so (this is my own personal opinion based upon no facts whatsoever, even tho the facts are there to be checked, I claim no knowledge of such undeniable facts). Plausible deniability - Check.

Ever since my long days of boredom in all my years of school, I have wanted to experience the ultimate experience in boredom. I'm talking about the kind of boredom that stops time. I looked long and hard, I signed up for boring jobs, got boring friends and went to boring parties. You know the usual stuff. Nothing could scratch my itch for boredom. I had to go deeper, and deeper I went. I was looking at the UN website trying to find a nice boring hearing of ca 2 hours and 27 minutes, which happens to be the length of this movie, but I couldn't find any. Earlier I was looking into US senate hearings on some boring subject such as Foreign Relations, yummy I always wanted to be bored to death on US relations to some backwater Kingdom somewhere in the middle of wherever. BUT, I found this movie instead and boy oh boy was I BORED. This hit the spot! I'm amazed at how bored I was. I wanted to walk out, but the boredom had propelled me into an out of body experience where I could not control my body, I could only watch my self bored literally out of my skull sitting there bored. This is like bored-ception.

Anyway, now I no longer owe Satan 2 hours and 27 minute of my life time due to that bet we had a while a ago.

What about the movie and the things that were happening in the movie? Surely the action was good at least? Well, if you've been in a coma for the last 100 years, then the person watching your comatose body for 100 years would be less bored than watching this movie. To illustrate the action: I have seen cars before, so when someone comes at me with another car, I'm not impressed. The action in this movie is an excellent mid-range car that will ultimately not turn any heads. You have seen the action done better somewhere else. But, if you are a boredom affectionado like me then you have to watch this movie in 3D. Now you can be bored in three dimensions!

There was some kind of moral message, that we should always do something that is not the wrong thing even tho it might appear to be not the right thing to others at the one before second sight and friendship as well... Also civilian deaths were like maybe not bad but not really good either? In the end I wanted everyone to die to spare us the rest of the movie.",4

There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",9

4 March 2023,Dumb as a brick,"The fact that people die due to fighting very evil bad guys and that is bad is beyond stupid. I found this movie annoying when I first watched and even more so now.

I'll give the 'writers' credit for not engaging in the typical drivel of 'everyone everywhere is racist' but this is just as ignorant. Kinda like like if there are no cops let's steal everything not nailed down.

Good acting and good special effects. Certainly better than anything DC can come up with by any stretch. Yadda yadda yadda. Hey Heather!

Now I'm typing to meet the arbitrary required characters by this stupid site. Eat a 🍆 Anazon.

27 June 2019,Nothing like it!,"An epic choose-your-side story that pits friends in the movie and in the theater against one another. The moral debate of the movie between government control and non-government control is fascinating and leads to some of the best superhero action in the MCU. Yet underneath it all is a story about how far Captain America will go for his best friend. Add a fantastic, creepy villain to the mix, you have a great blockbuster movie. Slight nit picks about conveniences and details might bug some but still great.

22 March 2017,Civil War is a masterclass in how to tell a great story and dazzle the senses,"The three Captain America movies have all defied expectations. The first one was a great origin story that dated all the way back to 1940's but was still told in an engaging way and was far better than anyone thought it would be. The second C.A. movie, Winter Soldier, was set up as an espionage thriller that put a whole new spin on what a super hero story could be, beating even The Dark Knight at its own game. This third film does something even harder, and takes what many people thought was a subpar sequel to a great fist Avengers movie (Age of Ultron) and makes another Avengers movie within a perfectly good third Captain America movie, continuing the story of two engaging properties while expanding on both and tying them all together. It also successfully introduces classic charters like Black Panther, Baron Zemo, and the new and improved Spider Man. It also successfully improves upon the comic book origins on which it is based without losing any of the stories internal integrity. No wonder when comparing it to the other superhero team movies of the year (Suicide Squad, Batman vs. Superman, X-Men: Apocalypse), Civil War is a masterclass in how to tell a great story and dazzle the senses. Here's hoping people take notice.",9
13 May 2020,DC fan with mental illness issues,"Giving it a 1 star is way too generous. A minus 1 would be more apt for this travesty called a movie which should have definitely been nominated and won the raspberry award that year. There is not much by way of plot. As usual, there is an overload of unnecessary useless ""comedy"" at inappropriate times that made me roll my eyes everytime. And the villain.. where do i even begin!! Its almost 4 years and i still dont get why he was IN the movie in the first place. Anyone having an iota of common sense and self respect can give this movie a very well deserved hard pass. I pity the people giving this movie a 9 or 10. For the love of god there are better movies that deserve to earn more money than this garbage.

1 January 2017,Best Avenger movie yet,"When nations get together and decide the Avengers need to be supervised rather than allowed to fight evil on their own terms, it causes a split in the group. The Iron Man leads the group that joins the government, but Captain America refuses to surrender his independence and leads a group that is going its own way in pursuit of an evil man who is using psychological control to deploy terrorists.

The dialogue is a bit hokey in places, but, that's the beauty of the Avenger movies, it's about a more innocent time when such hokey dialogue was the way people really talked. Lots of extra characters in this one, including an African king's son who is a cat figure with amazing powers, and Spider Man, an adolescent fighting with the grownups.

While this one is typical Marvel action, there are also some philosophical messages skillfully inserted in this, the best Avenger movie yet.

19 May 2016,Another killer movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"This is a spoiler free review so please read for information regarding if its okay for kids to watch and if its a good movie(WHICH IT IS). Alright hi, Where do i start? This is a another amazing super hero movie which is totally different from an average super hero movie. This movie is like Avengers 2.5 and I would rather have this be the Avengers movie from last year which was Age of Ultron which was disappointing. Age of Ultron was setting up way too many future movies coming out like the third Thor movie. Age of Ultron was going in a million directions and you would be clueless and ask questions like Why is he in the movie if he isn't related in any way to the story line? However this movie was on topic and had a great story and by the end of the movie you would be like that all made sense. Now lets dive in and see what made this movie amazing. After the events of Captain America The Winter Soldier and Avengers: Age of Ultron, we see our hero Captain America doing his job which is saving people. Captain America alongside with the other Avengers: Black Widow, Falcon, and Scarlett Witch and the last two have become Avengers now, are on a mission when suddenly something bad happens and a building blows up with people in it. 170 countries unite and create the Sokovia Accords which states that any super hero must sign this and register their information just in case something bad happens and you don't get the blame for it. Captain America thinks its a bad idea (which I will not spoil why). While Iron Man thinks its a great idea( Which I will also not spoil). Then it becomes small argument which then becomes a ""war' when a bombing happens and Bucky Barnes aka the Winter Soldier gets the blame for it. Captain America knows it wasn't him and goes against the law to protect his best friend. This movie introduce two major characters who I already started loving right when they got on screen. Spider Man who I thought was like the best character of the movie right next to Captain America and Black Panther who was a bad-ass. Both just fit in the movie and made everything perfect. Spider Man was hilarious and when he came in the movie and enchanted his stuff, I was like he is what made this movie one of the best. Black Panther was a bad-ass. When they introduced him in the movie, he was being fired at by a helicopter and bullets bounced right off his suit and I was just blown away. Im not going to spoil anything else so please go watch this movie. Sadly there was one flaw of the movie, the villain. Yeah there was a small villain who didn't have a costume but in the comics he's amazing! In the movie he isn't :(. Im talking about Baron Zemo who wasn't appealing at all and has a terrible backstory but is a really good mastermind! You will see why in the end of the movie. The action in this movie blew my mind away, the airport scene was one of the best action scene I have scene in my whole life, it was beautiful, well choreographed action and each character got their own solo part which told us why we grew up loving them. So please I cannot stretch it enough to go watch this movie. IS IT OKAY FOR THE KIDS? Yes its perfectly fine just like a couple of uses of S--T which you barely hear so its fine and there was this one quick kiss that wasn't teasing any kind of sexual interaction, just a sweet kiss and was funny, you will know when you see it. This movie also has great positive messages from Captain America like you don't leave anyone behind. Chris Evans has done it again as Captain America and told me why Cap is my favorite superhero. So please go watch this movie and have a great day!",9

21 February 2018,Epic fight scenes gonna blow your mind,"I don't like popcorn movies like Avengers. However, this film is fuckin awesome! You can enjoy cool battles and fight, it's much better than messy and boring fight in Avengers. Moreover, the story is clear, easy to follow, deep, and reasonable.

Japanese Film Industory and Advatisement companies are suck. They use EXILE (Japanese dancing idol)'s valad song to promote this film. Never do such kinda lubbish promotion please!

21 May 2019,Winter Soldier + Avengers = Marvel's Finest,"Civil War is not only an excellent follow-up to the Winter Soldier, it is a far better Avengers film than Age of Ultron. This film adds the stakes Marvel has been struggling with, and it does it with a nuanced but compelling villain. It adds fantastic characters like Black Panther. It takes Tony Stark and Steve Rogers' characters to new heights by bringing them to new lows. It manages to utilize dozens of characters and still does them all justice. It brings up interesting moral dilemmas and political questions. The action is also fantastic in this movie with several cinematic fight scenes being better than in the previous Avengers, but also close-quarters duels that sport excellent choreography and weight in the emotions behind them. This is a near flawless film and perhaps the best film Marvel has released. After seeing Endgame, I must say Civil War's consequences still feel relevant and it remains one of my personal favorite superhero films.

30 April 2016,Best Marvel (not just MCU) Movie For Now,"For a while, many fans were worrying about how this movie will compare against a particular movie which the title I forgot maybe because it's awful, something that rhymes with ""Blackman"" I think.Well,no need to worry anymore, because this is by far the Best MCU Movie to date (for me). No spoilers here,just want to say how awesome this movie is. We have the best action scene, the best story, and also the best Spiderman that Marvel movies have given us till now. The Airport battle, as you hope for, amazing, absolutely amazing. The characters have so much complexity and depth that you can see a big change among them especially Tony and Cap. Emotional ending, brilliant, the only letdown probably is Zemo, maybe Marvel really wants to stick with Loki . But, that doesn't matter, with all that's going on in this movie,I give it 10/10

10 May 2016,Some great fight Scenes but a stupid plot!,"I first came to see the reviews before watching the movie. And when I saw that most of them were above 8/10 I said this is a must see movie. But while I sat down watching it I told myself WDF is happening.!

The story line is too girly. Lots of people crying. Always too much care for the humans. Yeah they will die, yeah there will be collateral damage, but what if the heroes didn't help at all.

One scene you will see Vision reading on a paper, to prepare some food, a receipt. While he has the brain of a Super Computer and can be connected throughout the world, babysits a girl who will send such a powerful being 100m under the earth! WHAT, seriously this guy has an infinity stone for nothing!

Some fight scenes are so stupid. Captain America holding a helicopter down with his bare hands while standing on a heliport. I didn't know he weigh 20tons! Ant man being a giant but when he throws a kick it is in slow motion! Spiderman got younger and more stupid!

All this to end up with a guy who wanted to destroy the avengers just for revenge and got Iron man,Winter Soldier and Cap America in a bunker to show him a Video of who killed his parents. Couldn't he have just sent a simple mail. Very very bad movie!! Watch this at home,doesn't deserve your time to go to the Cinema!",5
4 May 2016,Amazing movie that makes up for the mistakes in the first two Captain America films,"I was simply in awe after watching this film, because it was just that good. I had read the comic previously, and they still managed to somehow make it a similar but different story at the same time. The best thing about the movie were Spiderman and Black Panther, and let me tell you that I've never been a huge Spiderman fan, but I really liked him in the movie, and his next solo movie is definitely in good hands. As for Black Panther, I didn't really know a lot about him until this movie, but he was an amazing surprise to me and I can't wait for his next appearance.

The writing was so good that as a Marvel fan, it was really hard for me to choose, and even after seeing it, I still don't know who was right.

Maybe the only bad thing about the movie was the villains, specially Crossbones, because he barely got any screen time, and I feel like he deserved more as I thought he was finally fully developed. Baron Zemo wasn't the best but he still was very good, although he was necessary for the film and his first steps in the MCU.

However, I liked the movie so much that I forgive them those mistakes. 10/10",10

12 June 2018,Captain Avengers,"Which side do you take in this star-studded cast? Before I answer that question, let's establish the ground rules. The political intrigue is very similar to Batman vs. Superman, and you can't really fault Civil War for coming out just a couple months later. Basically, after the opening action scene causes much destruction, the government wants to take over the wheel and pin some accountability and control over these meta humans. After montages of previous Avengers moments and some sob stories for personal reference, Tony Stark thinks for somebody besides himself and signs with the government. This is supposed to put a band-aid over the rift and still allow for safety; Steve Rogers disagrees. If they have to obey a superior officer to give the green light, it may be too late, he argues. And both have valid points and the rest of the superheroes take their sides.

That's the gist of it. And I mentioned the opening action sequence. Well, I kinda lied because first a flashback to how Bucky became the Winter Soldier was needed to create another divide in the heroes. I'm not sure if a simple flip-flop would work, you would probably need an additional scene before the transition, but to have a flashback and then an opening action scene is like you wanted to open the movie with one of them but needed both scenes and decided to simply put them back-to-back.

Now, the biggest flaw of the film is staring down all of us. Captain America: Civil War... Wait, so what point am I making? There's a dozen heroes or so in this film, but the title is still technically a Captain America movie. What this does is try balancing two aspects: a personal focus on Captain America, but also providing a broad stroke with all the Avengers. The result is slightly muddied and not as crisp as it should be. And the reason I may be being a little tough could be contributed to The Dark Knight Rises. I love that film; one aspect it couldn't control (although I thought Nolan handled it so well) was the fact that it had to follow The Dark Knight. Similarly, the previous installment The Winter Soldier is easily in my top 5 superhero films, possibly and probably top 3. It's smart, crisp, and full of terrific action. And Civil War hits most of the marks-- just not as many as the previous film and that's okay and understandable.

What the Captain America movies have always succeeded at the most in the hand-to-hand combat. This movie continues with those great fighting scenes. Before we get to the obvious showdown, I do still have stuff to complain about. With the Winter Soldier acting as a fugitive for large portions of the film, there's a couple chase scenes. And the movement of jumping from a building into a cartwheel to avoid impact doesn't look smooth; this continues when Black Panther is introduced and there's a big chase with cars in a tunnel. The movement isn't fluid-- this hearkens back to the sub-par CGI from the first Captain America movie.

Okay, okay, my heart isn't completely spattered with black ink spots. The showdown excels on every mark. This isn't nearly as dark and fatal as Batman v Superman, so the dialogue that ensues is full of pep and hilarity-- and yes, Spider-Man is one of the funniest along with Ant-Man. Of the newest additions to make their appearance, my favorite goes to Black Panther. His motivation is pretty typical, but I think he was handled really well and with an overall air of coolness and royalty. Additionally, Captain America's suit looks really good, and the way all the different superpowers clash is a blast to watch.

Behind the back-and-forth between our heroes, there's a story that keeps itself going, but again not to the same power and tenacity as Winter Soldier. And after the initial action, there was too much exposition afterward that lulled on. As I described the more light-hearted aspect of the fighting, I said that it helped that there wasn't really a fatality aspect involved. And this is absolutely true, but it also affects the climax briefly seen from the trailer. The grittiness of Dawn of Justice had more tension in wondering how far these characters might go, but with this film no matter how bloody a face might get, there wasn't really a concern that a major death would take place.



All in all, there's a couple scenes in the film that make the entire film more than worthy to watch. And it's a solid piece in its entirety, but there's still cracks in its framework that prevents it from being one of the best. It's been awhile since I've seen Age of Ultron, but if I were to compare it to that, I'd easily recommend this film more. It doesn't surpass Winter Soldier, but there's enough to hold its own-- and setup future installments for that matter.

28 April 2016,Awesome!...,"Without any question this is the best Marvel movie ever made. Its perfect paced with emotional parts, dark parts, funny parts and the thriller elements. The action looks just awesome and the new characters are SO good i can't tell you how good they are. I'm totally happy with the end of this perfect movie and i think infinity war is in good hands.

The sad part about it...

The DC fan boys show us their character with the 10% 1 star ratings. I saw a user who rated Civil War with 1 star and BvS with 10 Stars and the best thing about it is that he writes about the Marvel fan boys in his CW review...

8 May 2016,Marvel's form of Angst.,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",8

1 November 2016,A terrible movie that might work for kids,"This is the biggest letdown of a marvel movie so far.

I Cant believe that it got 8/10. I made an account just so i could share how bad this movie is.

Everything is to happy go lucky, The fight scenes, the plot, the villains, and all of the characters are so bland. Ironman is the only person that even holds this movie from being a 0/10 instead of a 1/10

And I'm to disappointed to even give it a review.

This is by far the worst movie in the franchise and i wouldn't recommend anybody to watch this movie..

15 September 2023,Really good,"As not a huge marvel fan i will consider this film to be one of the best marvel films I've watched so far, among with Guardians of the galaxy. (I've been watching them in chronological order) I think that although it is a long film it still has you hooked and wanting for more it's well paced and entertaining. Like all Marvel films it has really good cgi but I would say that all marvel films I've watched are visually appealing. To be honest I would recommend it. I'm not a big marvel fan and I still enjoyed it. I would say it's maybe because we got to see all the superheroes that made it interesting and overall the plot is pretty solid.

9 May 2016,Better than the first two....,"I saw The First Avenger and was expecting a lot more after seeing IM/IM2/Thor but those movies were just so much better than CA. Same thing happened with The Winter Soldier after seeing The Avengers/IM3/Thor: The Dark World/GOTG. After seeing Age of Ultron and Ant-Man I wasn't really looking forward to seeing Civil War because A2/AM were boring in my opinion, same with TFA/TWS but I saw Civil War tonight because it has been getting extremely great reviews and I have to say I was really, really impressed. Great story, amazing effects and most of all incredible action sequences. This is by far the best Marvel movie yet (besides Deadpool) and would highly recommend it to anyone to see once if not twice.

15 June 2016,"A perfect summer blockbuster, but only in parts!","I was waiting for Captain America: Civil War since Avengers: Age of Ultron to see that have Marvel learnt how to handle a set of superheroes together with so much diversity in a grounded story. And I must say that Civil War is better film than Avengers 2 in terms of talent management, but as a Cap film, The Winter Soldier was a level above. Marvel has made money and raise expecting every time with their shared Marvel Cinematic Universe while pleasing critics too over last few years now. But will they continue? Won't audience get bored of the same superhero story lines after a point of saturation? The answer is not clear, but there always would be something new to keep the audience glued.

Captain America is one of the most important character in the shared universe, with deep down grift and pain which keeps him going. Chris Evans has come a long way as Captain America/Steve Rogers in this third installment and I can't imagine anyone else other than him as Cap. He has the right flexibility in his body and on his face to deal with all the actions and emotions in the most apt way. If Ironman is the heart of MCU, Cap is the soul.

Civil War starts with a mission which ends up with civilian casualties and world wants all the superheroes to work under their supervision. Bucky (Sebastian Stan) gets involved in an attack on the summit and things starts rolling when Cap comes in to save his good old friends. Cap knows that his friend is not the same one which they were in their good old days and Bucky has committed very bad things, but he still helps his friends going against all the odds because he is a good man and this is what keeps audience invested with Civil War. Iron Man/Tony Stark tries to convince Cap to give in which after a point feels to be very repetitive. When Cap goes rogue, Tony comes in with his gang and a new recruit to stop Cap and Bucky with their set of friends with super powers. And we also have Spider-man.

Civil War keeps you glued for the first 2 acts with some good dialogues, battle of ideologies, solid motives and impressive action. I loved the airport scene were Russo brothers have gone all out to squeeze all that they can get from their super heroes. Russo brothers know what can be done with Cap and they have done it best with an experience of The Winter Solider. Third act starts losing its grip as the intentions of the main villain Zemo (Daniel Brühl) blur down, out focusing his agenda. Martin Freeman had a very small part, but as we comes near the end, I hope he might be a new nemesis in the future.

Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) has a spark as always but sometimes looks less involved. But he has his own tricks and tools, with witty lines to keep you engaged. Black Widow has done some serious action and has grown with every MCU film. Falcon fly's and give Cap a good support. War Machine & Hawk Eye are good in their part. Vision is trying to evolve as a human and Wanda is still guilt ridden trying to control her powers. Chadwick Boseman is Black Panther and has some cool actions with his solid motive to avenge his father. He is a bad ass with an awesome costume and would love to see more of him. Scott Lang/Ant Man does some amazing size shifting which you can't miss.

And then we have Spider-Man. The friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Tom Holland has all his charm in place to play the third Spider-Man after Tobey Maguire & Andrew Garfield. And everyone would agrees that Spider-Man is the best thing in this film. He is so much into the story and then he can be separated and nothing much would happen. Tom Holland is the perfect choice after Tobey Maguire. And how much Spider-Man comics I have read, I believe Tom Holland is the closes to the comics. He literally steals the show. Thanks God, Marvel cracked the deal with Sony and we got Spider-Man in this film. Let's hope the same with Fox and who knows we might get Wolverine in the next Avenger film, against Iron Man or Hulk. Fingers crossed.

Airport battle sequence is the best part of the film with Spidey in full costume as a cherry on the top. The fight is worth the wait and exceeds the expectations. People will remember the action and intensity behind it. And due to this high-octane action sequence, the emotional ending looks energy less. But wait, you have a mid- credit scene with a surprising post credit scene. Keep on guessing. Finally, I will admit that Civil War is a flawed film which shifts interests from one point to another in swift of a moment. But Marvel is known to present the same old, world at stake kind of a story with new punches and actions. Civil War is no way near The Winter Solider, but the action lifts the film. And one of the best depiction of Spider-Man. Go watch it!",8
22 June 2019,A Nation Divided,"Captain America: Civil War is so so messy in the best way. A nation divided. You can see both sides and sometimes it's so clear who is right. But people are right in the wrong way. And people are wrong in the right way. The darkest of the marvel films to this point. Everything that has happened is finally holding major weight. And now everything matters so much more. This is a superhero movie, but also a political adult film. It's like the superheros are maturing and being put into the real world and now have to deal with real world issues. Also Black Panther is a bad ass. This movie is so deep it could ruin friendships. The best marverl movie in this saga so far. 91%

17 May 2016,Best super hero movie to date.,"I knew that the comic version of Civil War would not translate to the movie version, and I was right. But that wasn't the problem. In terms of other MCU or Capt. America movies, Captain America Winter Soldier was a more complete Marvel movie, and held by many as the best Marvel Movie for good reason. What was missing from Civil War is that the story line and villain that Marvel did go along with was not as well planned out or as important to the overall picture of the Marvel Cinematic universe as other movies or Winter Soldier. Without giving away spoilers, the ending and twist in the movie have no real consequence in the MCU, and one could argue that you're pretty much in the same position at the end of the movie as you were in the beginning. All this is besides the comparison of the comic to the movie, which would be endless.

Having watched the movie in theatre, I can say I'm glad I did, and will be buying the Blu-ray once released. Marvel continues to do Justice to these characters, and its exciting what's to come in the near future with the Black Panther, Spider-Man, and Doctor Strange. Personally, I feel that the movie for me was 4.5 stars, definitely better than other reviews I've read, and better than Batman Vs. Superman. This movie did not disappoint, and was a worthy addition to both the MCU and Capt. America Franchise.",10

7 May 2016,Starting to be a bit too onerous...,"I was quite underwhelmed by CA:CW. For starters, I found the story vacuous and that the motivations leading to the conflict did not to strike a chord with me: so much so that I could no longer remember them anymore on the following day!

Yes, combat scenes are impressive and daftly edited for a brisk pace, but they are so plentiful - and the characters so many - that occasionally it gets complicated to work out who's fighting who and exactly why.

This, in fact, may well be the main problem with CA:CW - there's now so many heroes with so much back-story in other movies, that the whole thing is beginning to collapse under its own weight.

12 February 2017,Don't bother,"The reason Im writing is to show my disappointment with IMDb and its ratings. Usually I go to this site to look a movie up, and usually it gives good info and honest rating. But this time, for this movie, its just nothing less than a travesty. There is NO way this movie can be regarded as high as it stands. And after reading many of the reviews on this site, it shouldn't. The movie is so heavy with its own sense of importance its actually painful to bear. The stories, and there are plenty, are shallow and childish, but the viewer is told that no, they really are deep and matter and you should understand that. I felt jumped by a morale that it tried to present, that the characters were actually fighting something deeper than just spider webs and things thrown at them, that they actually were to be taken seriously. Just for that, the movie tired me. But worse, it bored me. And not because there was not enough action in it, or that not enough things happened, because on the contrary, the scenes were filled with crap it felt an urge to show me. And more and more and more. Man! Puh. But OK, some people like to make this kind of stuff and some people like watching it. But please ... don't treat it like its Sophie's Choice. Don't try to tell me that it is intelligent and has a deeper saying. That it treats real problems, that it tackles important social issues. Don't tell me that this film has something to say. Because it doesn't. It isn't important. Its a super hero movie and its light and should be fun. Nothing more. But it does not, not for me anyway, deserve a 7.9 rating. No f***ing way.",1
26 September 2016,Excellent!!!,"I give this movie a 10/10. I enjoyed the whole movie from beginning to end. It's completely impossible to lose interest in this movie, even with it being 2 hours. I love what Marvel did with all of the characters and how they were portrayed. Captain America and Iron Man are the heart of The Avengers and without them there's no order in the team. The team begins to fall apart as the government splits them up. Which caused a spark between the two because Captain wanted to continue to save citizens without the government interference. While Tony wanted to only fight for the country only if the government says so. Let me say that I like how the plot unfolds between the two because of the characteristics they have. Captain America believes The Avengers are doing the world justice by fighting threats bigger than the military's control. Although deep down Tony knows Captain is right he still thinks that they are just hurting people. Before the movie came out, I was only excited for one character. I still like the other characters and enjoyed them but The Black Panther was the most legit character. The Black panther is one of my favorite African American superheroes and he was amazing in this movie. His fighting style is more elite than the Avengers and his Panther like reflexes makes him a better fighter. I also liked how they portrayed Peter Parker. Marvel did an excellent job utilizing Tom Holland's high school like appearance to play as Peter Parker. In the Comics Peter Parker is a young, high school student. But I'm the previous Spider-Mans, although they were all good, they did not give that young, high school persona. All in all this movie is the best Captain America movie. I look forward to seeing Black Panther and Spider-man get their own individual movie.",10
15 February 2023,MCU Succeeds Where DCEU Failed In Hero vs Hero Blockbuster,"Whether intended or not, a competition took place in 2016 between MCU and DC to see who could make a better movie pitting their two biggest heroes against each other. Batman v Superman may have turned out to be a disaster, but Marvel hit it out the park with Captain America: Civil War, which set up a, well, war between Captain America and Iron Man, centered on their opposing views on whether or not to make the Avengers government-owned after the reckless destruction of Sokovia in Avengers: Age Of Ultron. The line up of superheroes in this film ranges from War Machine to Spider-Man, Ant-Man to Vision. A strong cast of heroes in a spectacular fight against each other that delivered fully as an epic clash of superpowers that definitely goes down as one of the best in movie history. Even just the 2v1 fight of Iron Man vs Cap and Bucky was amazingly done in it's own right. This movie certainly didn't hold back on the action, and we love it for that reason!

15 April 2018,Standard fare - but that's fine,"If you're into the MCU, this is a solid offering. Interesting story, some good set pieces, new characters add to the dynamic without feeling intrusive, and it delivers on its title (despite necessarily pulling one or two punches for logic's sake). Does have a little too much of the recent tendency of feeling like an episode rather than a standalone film - it is independent enough to be enjoyable, and I understand this is sort of how the MCU works, but by this point there's so much going on you'd almost rather some of the threads were a little more self-contained. Nevertheless, aside from a few slightly over-convenient/inconvenient jumps in the storytelling (probably necessary given the runtime) it's actually impressively well crafted. It would have been easy for this to be a bit of mess, but it feels slick, and doesn't lose its way. Overall, nothing groundbreaking - difficult now that we can pretty much predict most of the characters' actions throughout - but it's a good solid effort, and worth a watch.

6 October 2020,SPIDERMAN TOM HOLLAND 1ST APPEARANCE,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",10

One camp is led by Steve Rogers and the other is led by Tony Stark.

Marvel's new highly anticipated film has finally arrived, and I'm of course talking about Captain America: Civil War. My expectations were very high for this film, since I heard nothing but great things from Critics and fans alike. So, is Civil War a comic book masterpiece? Well, to me it isn't. Look, I'm not disappointed by any means. But I just expected more. The movie is widely entertaining and the action scenes look amazing, but it never felt like there was anything at stake. This film also features another weak villain, which I think shouldn't have even been in the film in the first place. My other grip with the film are the few misused and thrown away characters. Characters like Crossbones and even Spider-Man didn't even had to be in this film. But none the less, I have to admit that it was fun seeing them on the screen. Now. Let's stop complaining and let's get into the juicy stuff. The battles between all the different superheroes throughout the film are extremely fun. Especially the fight sequence on the airport. Some unexpected and amazing stuff happens on that airport. Especially something that Ant-Man does is mind blowingly great. Something that Comic Book readers will truly appreciate. As I mentioned earlier, the action is executed very well and filmed stunningly by the Russo Brothers. Although the comedy wasn't as great as it was in Ant-Man or Guardians of the Galaxy for that matter, I still had to chuckle a few times. Overall, Captain America: Civil War is a fun summer blockbuster that will keep interested and entertained the entire way through.",5
1 May 2016,Mixed feelings - Could have been much more,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

21 September 2016,Solid Marvel Movie,"These movies keep creeping closer and closer to what I like about action movies, but they never quite get there. Points though for this one for not climaxing with a giant airship crashing into the Earth.

The central conflict in Civil War revolves around Cap's friend Bucky, still known as the Winter Soldier. The Avengers crew are torn from within by a decision made by The Secretary of State to monitor and oversee the group. Half of the Avengers are willing to accept this decision, half of them are against it. They have ideological reasons for their decisions, but they don't really matter because in the end their reasoning for their decisions are much simpler and emotionally-driven and are pretty much entirely about Bucky. Who do we side with? What would be the right thing to do? Well, the answer is obviously to side with Captain America, because his name is in the title and these movies are much to popular with general audiences to have him choose the wrong side.

I still don't like the action scenes in these. They feel clumsy in their camera-work, saved only by the sound editing. And the sense of where the characters are in relation to each other is really off.

But I think, for once, I felt invested in these characters and their lives. They're usually so...distant, untouchable almost. The first 90 minutes are the typical Marvel set up, with the final hour giving way to something a bit more ambitious. Steve Rogers and Tony Stark are the most human people in this universe, and to have them square off is the best move they could have made at this point.",6

Definitely recommend to everybody who loves old and new superhero movies.

27 May 2023,Avengers 2.5,"This movie was a little bit of a let down. It's called Captain America but it really is more of an Avengers movie, meaning if you didn't watch all the marvel stuff up to this point you'll be lost. It's also called ""Civil War"", but rather feels like a sandbox tussle most of the time.

The film heavily banks of putting our heroes against each other but the narrative around it feels pretty forced. The battle itself takes place on a grey empty airport under a grey empty sky with piles of cardboard boxes conveniently placed everywhere someone gets tossed. It is really not as epic as it could have been.

At some point the movie fortunately remembers that it had a plot and that plot is actually pretty decent. The final confrontation between Cap and Iron Man feels much more believable and emotional than the big brawl beforehand and it's nice to see a smart villain with a believable motivation for a change.",7

I gotta say this was an excellent film, and I further posit that anyone who does not agree is merely unqualified in any of those subjects, and incapable of even giving an educated opinion. Enjoy my opinion, people who disagree and are wrong. 😉 People who liked Deadpool and kick ass will love it. Those who like good movies will love it. People who like action will definitely love it. People who enjoy a thought- provoking story will love it. So will people who love super hot women will absolutely love it. Just watch the shat and see for yourself.

4 June 2016,A Hit!,"Captain America: Civil War is a superhero ensemble movie directed by the Russo Brothers and starring Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Sebastian Stan, Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Paul Rudd and introducing Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man.

Just by the opening paragraph we see we deal with a huge cast, this movie almost being nicknamed Avengers 2.5 or 3 by some fans. It is really amazing how the Russo brothers managed to handle such a huge cast and yet make a movie that focuses on the main character, Steve Rogers/Captain America. This movie starts the Phase 3 of the MCU and now the heroes start dealing with the consequences of their actions. The United Nations comes up with a treaty called the Sokovia Accords that wants to oversee The Avengers and also control their actions. This will split the team into two factions, one led by Captain America (the ones who refuse to register) and the other by Tony Stark.

The Russo Brothers return in the directorial chair after the critically acclaimed Captain America: Winter Soldier and they keep delivering a winning streak. Their effort combined with a very good script deliver a fantastic movie about friends who turn on each other and fight for what they believe to be the right thing. The performances from the cast fire on all cylinders, everyone is doing such a good job acting wise. Chris Evans defined Captain America for the big screen and Downey Jr. brings yet a new layer to a character we assumed we already knew.

The supporting cast also delivers but we have to talk about the new players. Tom Holland as the new Peter Parker/Spider-Man is a revelation. He is considered by many to be the best Spider-Man portrayed yet, and I tend to agree. Even though his role is not huge, it will satisfy every Spidey fan out there. Chadwick Boseman portrays T'Challa, the prince of Wakanda, a country from Africa, who gets mixed up in the conflict because of some personal reasons. Boseman absolutely kills it as Black Panther, even going as far as coming up with a wakandian accent for his character, based on his own research of the African continent.

The Russo Brothers amazed everyone with how they handled action scenes in Winter Soldier and in Civil War they turn up that to 11. This movie has some of the best fight scenes in all of the MCU, with some gorgeous stunts and CGI. There is the much talked about airport scene which was teased in the trailers. That is a scene that steals the whole movie and it must be seen in the theater. You have never seen superheroes fight like this before, it will blow you away.

Captain America: Civil War presents a great script beautifully directed by the Russo Brothers with some of the best performances seen so far in the MCU, with greatly shaped characters and fantastic action set pieces. The only weaker element for me was the villain who wasn't fleshed out enough and had some cliché motivations and the fact that this movie is 15-20 minutes too long. Having said that, Captain America: Civil War is one of the best Marvel movies out there and it deserves a 9 out of 10!",9

The story is great, interesting, and keeps grabbing your attention. Everyone plays their characters very well. Black Panthers is a great new welcome. And the fight scene? Some of the best I have seen in quite a while. Especially the airport!

I won't give anything away here. But, do yourself a favor and see this incredible new installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I can guarantee it you will not be let down.

16 July 2016,Battle royal of the Marvel Cinematic Universe!!!,"The Russo duo has managed to handle this ensemble cast of superheroes and their personalities with a certain deftness of touch that has to be seen to be believed. Black Panther, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Widow, Winter Soldier... well, pretty much all of them put in some seriously convincing performances. Downey Jr's Stark-isms have been dialed down here, allowing us to get a glimpse of his real side, as being more than just a one-liner machine. But truth be told, it is Evans who steals the show.

As for the action and cinematography, one word - amazing. The climax action sequence at the airport is something that might just leave you breathless. It is 17 minutes long (but you would be craving for more) and is straight up the stuff of legend. And no, entire cities and buildings need not be leveled to make a good group fight scene.

Rogers' mistrust regarding new-world values (compared to the time he was from) is nicely explored. His unwillingness to compromise on his code is seen to great effect. There is darkness, there is depth, but the important thing is that the element of fun is also most definitely present. Oh and needless to say for Marvel-movies, do stay for the post-credits scene.",8
19 June 2019,Absolutely amazing!,"Captain America Civil War is one of my favorite movies in the MCU and is one of the best comic book films of all time. The writing is great and the whole conflict is very interesting. I absolutely adore the airport fight scene. Spider-Man and Black Panther are great additions to the MCU as well. I also love the ending to this film as well. Captain America Civil War is absolutely amazing!

24 July 2017,"One of the best, if not the best MCU movie so far","One of the best, if not the best MCU movie to date. The Russos and the writers managed to blend in the actions, mystery, emotions, and of course, the quips. ""Captain America: Civil War"" is an appropriate finale for the ever-improving Captain America trilogy. While it doesn't break new grounds in the genre (""The Dark Knight trilogy"" and 2012's ""The Avengers"" have that honor), it certainly did enough to offer something new to the audience (In a much better way then the other Superhero vs Superhero flick earlier that year).

While some people think that the villain is weak and boring, I think it's one of the smartest villains in MCU. While a great many people see this is an Avengers movie, there are some (including me) would still see this as a Cap movie. The Civil War event and the other Avengers are build around the Cap/Buck story arch, a continuation of ""The Winter Soldier"". Yes, this is a busy movie (Also the longest in the MCU), but it doesn't feel that long and/or boring, thanks to the lighthearted moments

As far as box office go, this was the box office king of 2016 (Internationally, not just North American Box Office), and deservedly so",10

9 September 2020,Great payoff for MCU fans,"Captain America: Civil War is a movie that pits the Avengers against each other over the issue of registering with the UN. It combines some of the best aspects of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to develop character arcs that have been going on for several movies now. At the same time, I think the movie is a bit bogged down and the main character, Captain America, tends to get a bit lost in the shuffle.

There's two major plotlines going on in the movie. First is the Civil War story line, which focuses on the Avengers fighting over registering with the UN. The second story line continues from the Winter Soldier, Bucky is on the run and has been framed for the death of the King of Wakanda by the villain Baron Zemo. Helping Bucky and not signing up with the UN has pitted Cap against Iron Man.

The movie definitely plays more like an Avengers movie rather than a Captain America movie (I've heard this movie called Avengers 2.5). Iron Man gets a lot of screen time here, and the movie introduces Black Panther and Spider-man. I'm not opposed to the movie going for a larger ensemble, since Cap himself gets developed over the Avengers movies as well, but it does feel like there's too much going on here. The two story lines have enough meat on their bones to be their own movies. They do interesting things with these story lines and arcs though, and the movie really wants you to see both sides of the argument. You can empathize with both major characters and that is great, it really sells the Civil War idea. On top of that what I really love about that idea is that it feels like a natural point in their character arcs, based on previous movies. Baron Zemo though doesn't get much screen time and he's largely forgettable outside of a couple scenes at the end.

I watched this movie right around the time Chadwick Boseman died (RIP) and so I want to take a minute to talk about him specifically. Black Panther has a great little arc here and probably stands out the most among all characters, save for Cap and Iron Man. He doesn't say a lot, but makes that silence part of his character and works great as a counterpoint to the Avengers, really a breath of fresh air for the team. I'm really sad that he passed and wish we could get more of him.

The visual effects are great here, no surprise. The Super heroes are colorful and the set pieces are big end explosive. There's a lot of big action here with lots of color powers and none of it clashes visually and its not hard to see whats going on. The Russo Brothers have an eye for cinematography and know how to fit big ensembles within a shot without audience getting lost. The musical score is your usual MCU flair, nothing really to note here.

Overall, this is one of my favorite MCU movies. There's a lot of talent in front of and behind the camera, so I think they largely smooth out a script that is a bit messy. It's a lot of fun at the movies and great pay off for being invested in the MCU for many years and many movies. Not as tightly written as the Winter Soldier, but the movie is so big and has so many great character moments I might like this movie better. I'd recommend it to all fans of Super hero movies, but it requires previous investment in both Captain America, Avengers and Iron Man movies.",8

5 May 2016,"The votes are in- this ones ""da"" best","As Robert Downey Jr's ribald characterization of Tony Stark would say, this film is ""the shiznit"". I think. We've had a couple of twists and turns over this journey, but now this one is finally here. I am not sure if it's some kind of landmark, or maybe the start of a different kind of Avengers film (more Avengers per film?), but this one is definitely the one that it is, and it's the new one. There's more Avengers in this film than have ever been in a film before. More than the 98 Avengers or 2012, or even more than has ever been featured in any of the MCU movies owned by Disney. There's Spider-Man... he's the new kid on the block, always flashing his eye at the old Iron Man and the big boys. In this one he becomes one of them. Also flashing his points is Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, the ant man. He becomes one of the big leagues in this film. If you've never seen an Avenger film before, don't start here. You'll be confused. This film is mainly easter egg throwbacks to the other films, but done in big fashion. Remember the joke in ""Iron Man 2"" about Iron Man Tony Stark putting on his underoos? Well, there's a big payoff for that joke here.

The plot of the film focuses on Captain America, but really this is the story of Tony Stark coming to terms with the past, present, and future of the entire GALAXY! So there is no nationalism here... not just the entire world is included, but the whole of space as well as the Guardians of the Galaxy. There is so much meat here it's like all you can eat fried shrimp at Red Lobster. Bucky the Winter Soldier is in this film and he is better than ever in the third installment of the Captain America franchise. Go see this film! The film culminates in what is one of the most exciting sequences of television I've ever seen: ""the airport battle"". This is a good battle and the best action ever put to film on film. Robert Downjey R does his own stunts.

So... let's see. Is there any reason not to see this film? Only if you don't like it. But for the rest of us, and I do mean ALL of us (this is one of the most inclusive films ever made), this is the newest Avenger film so let's go see it and also it's the best. As a sequel to Winter Soldier it's thrilling, as a sequel to Age of Ultron it ""expands"" on the story, just like Spider-Man's new ""expandex"" costume. Go see him.",9

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",8
8 July 2016,good but not the masterpiece,"Hi guys I'm just watched CA:CW and it's a good movie and also a good entertainer but as the critics are calling it as a master piece ooh !!! it's definitely not because the critics don't even know the meaning of masterpiece.and also the critics are calling the airport fight is the best fight scene.and also it's definitely not.because of shaky cameras and cheesy one liners .and the directors told the film will be more dark.But it's nowhere near the word dark but the pro's are the new additions.black panther is awesome and his suit looks amazing and the next is the friendly neighborhood Spiderman!but one con is the his suit is completely looked like cgi but overall it's a fun filled film

6 April 2018,Another Flawless Film Under Marvel's Belt,"Captain America: Civil War, stars Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan and a bunch of other Avengers and new faces in this emotionally driven action, drama, mystery, with a split of the team too for a very good purpose.

The Russo brothers from The Winter Soldier come back to direct this masterpiece of a film and they have established themselves as one of the greatest directors in history from this film. With it's slower scenes feeling emotionally impactful and having a proper role to drive the story further and line up some of the best action sequences to date in marvel is one of the infinite things that makes this film perfect. With having the biggest cast out of any movie and the longest run time, this movie feels just like the others and that two hours and twenty-six minutes run time goes by in no time and makes you wanting more after that end credit sequence comes up.

The writing by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely makes this movie the most grounded and realistic feeling film to date with it's fluent dialogue and great scene construction on paper. I honestly forgot that these were actors while watching this film because of how real they felt and the emotion in each scene. There isn't a single line of dialogue out of place in this film and making it by far the best script to date for marvel. Even the jokes that came into the film and some of the more comic relief characters made some of the most nail biting scenes funny and joyful at the most perfect times. And with it having such a big cast. It still feels like a Captain America film with the primary focus on Cap and Bucky and them finding the truth about some things.

The acting is perfect, more perfect than any other film I believe in the MCU and that's thanks to Marvel casting the most perfect actors for their films and making them some of the most talked about names in history because of them. The biggest highlight for me is the sternness between Rogers and Stark in this film with some hints throughout the previous films on their possible blow up and this film uncorks that tension beautifully. And by the end I was in tears for the overall outcomes and finishing scenes showing the immediate aftermath of the events that have happened in the film.

Captain America: Civil War is a flawless film with not a single problem to it between everything it has done and what is has lined up as well for future movies.

Captain America: Civil War gets a 10/10",10
28 May 2016,"Very fun, but very flawed","OK... I saw this movie like half an hour ago, so this review is as fresh as your neighbours mowed lawn on a Saturday morning. Please keep in mind that i did not read the comics, and don't know a ton about the characters backstory, so i'll only review this based on the movies. A movie should be able to stand on its own.

As is custom with my reviews: good sides first.

It has proper acting: This is basically a no-brainer. Marvel always has good casting choices so even the new comer Spiderman (Tom Holland) did a pretty good job as a jolly kind of Spiderman. All of the characters do their jobs and give you a feeling like time is not even passing. Thumbs up.

Proper CGI: It is a Marvel movie so there will be tons of CGI, and it payed off quite nicely. Remember the third Hobbit movie? That moment when you saw the Elven army? HOLY CGI! That is not the case here. It all looks good, so i got nothing else to say here:) Thumbs up.

The Story is also nice: The movie has a nicely developed story-line, and with a few twists and turns along the way, made it very entertaining to watch. Again; thumbs up.

Now for the bad parts, cause the movie does have them.

The story is weirdly developing: I know i said that the story is nice, yet there are also moments that are weird. Characters jump into the action without any previous knowledge about said characters, and they seem to change their opinions about each other very quickly. There is little consistency in a bunch of characters when looking at their opinions.

Plots seem to disappear: There are several plot moments that just seem to vanish in the background because other stuff is happening. Someone stole a deadly virus, and we'll never hear from it again after 10 minutes.... What? What happened there? (Also, very quickly, there are more references to The Avengers movies. Like Marvel really needs to remind us about those movies that were already shoved down our throats)

Characters jump in suddenly: We get to see a new character: Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), but where did he come from? Honestly he just shows up and everyone is like; ""Ok... new character. Welcome to the club."" Who is this guy? What do we know of him? What are his powers? Does he have powers? I want to know Marvel! Don't keep me in the dark here!

No consistency: We have seen how Cap' can hold his own against Iron Man, but in this movie he gets tossed around by characters who (as far as we know) have no special powers. There is also this moment when he runs past cars on a freeway, so like 50ish mph. But that happens only once. Later, when speed is needed, he just runs like a normal person... He couldn't run any faster? Whas there a speed limit now?

These and more moments make the movie very flawed, but i'll never say it wasn't entertaining. But i guess that is what Marvel does. It is always very entertaining, but when you search for the logic, you can just keep searching...",7
7 May 2016,The Captain America not so righteous and Iron Man out for vengeance.,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

13 May 2016,captain superficial : war drama reality show,"this movie has same story line as batman vs superman.but batman vs superman has serious content unlike captain America- civil war which has content of reality show .none of characters have seriousness,very predictable and immature. only fight sequences are well choreographed and fight sequences too lack reality and are of cartoon like.it looks like they have made story to make sequels intentionally,they don't have a real story or substance to tell audience.

one can understand movie only if you remember all the stories of all marvel superheroes.they just go on introducing one superhero after another without much detailing.you will get confused and later after accessing your memory database of all marvel movies you have watched will bring some clarity.they just want to make money with superheroes,they don't have intention to tell real compelling stories.after watching this movie,i felt numb.what did i watch? nothing serious or substantial.just some fighting sequences to show off.",5
10 May 2016,"Sometimes a roller-coaster, sometimes a really boring boat ride","If you, like me, didn't watch Agents of Shield, read the recent comics or watch and read all the other extended content Marvel throws at you, the first hour of this movie is going to be boring and confusing. It doesn't really pull you into the story (if any) either.

We get a movie with a boring political premise, after that, characters and heroes we've come to love over a couple of movies suddenly go haywire. Characters we've seen bonding over several movies, been through almost 326 apocalypses and were ready to die for each other 47 times suddenly hate each other. Why? Because politicians divide them. Or something, I'm still not quite sure.

Then popcorn time starts. Special effects splatter the screen in a fantastic manner, the colors in this movie are simply awesome. We gaze at superheroes clashing it out and it simply looks extremely good. Black Panther does some awesome stuff, some talking, more fighting. Fighting. Fighting. And eventually it ends. The movie is 3,5 hours, but feels a solid 5.

If you forget the story (which is easily done) this is a visually stunning movie. Too bad that's all it is.",6

23 May 2016,FANTASTIC - Except for Zemo and the Ending,"CA:CW Where BvS was a fairly significant letdown for me, this film - while fantastic - is still a very mild letdown.

The flaws(the 1st 2 kinda overlap): 1. This is what I mentioned in my BvS review. I was not a fan of the somewhat mentally unstable Lex Luthor. But I still stand by my opinion that Luthor was a far more effective villain than Zemo. Zemo in the end was just a criminal/terrorist. And he was just a dud IMO. 2. CA:CW up until the end sequence in Siberia is significantly better than BvS, but then it falls kinda flat at the end. That ending was just a big fizzle for me. And where BvS - though extremely dark - ends on a brighter, hopeful note. CA:CW is not as dark - up to that end - which is darker IMO. (Now, before the marvel guys start emailing me death threats and viruses ... I acknowledge that this is in line with the direction of the MCU, and the dark ending is supposed to setup the IW movies. But honestly, I think the ending setup in BvS was a tad bit better) 3. The battle scenes in Nigeria were shot all shaky so that they were kinda hard to follow. I don't remember that in TWS. The rest of the action scenes were all top-notch.

The really good stuff: 1. CA:CW intro'ed Spidey and BP perhaps even a bit better than BvS did with BM and WW(though I think they both did those well). 2. Really well-done comic relief from Spidey and Ant-Man. I loved how those 2 played into the story. 3. Aside from Zemo's story, the writing was fantastic, near perfect. The story does flow and is easier to follow that the 1st half of BvS.

So - for me - the net result of it is that - yes - CA:CW is better. It is a fantastic movie even with the somewhat disappointing ending. But I don't see it being a 10 nor BvS being a 1. It's more like 8.7-8.9 compared to 8.0-8.3 IMO.

14 July 2016,"Great film, well-rounded plot; confusing at times","Captain America: Civil War is the third and final film in the Captain America trilogy. But I don't think of it as the third film, rather the thirteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. This film has a rich plot which will leave viewers entertained and thrilled, alongside the further development of the main characters that have graced the screens since the start of the MCU, including the title-character Captain America, and impressive action scenes.

Yet this film struggles to keep Captain America in the limelight, with a plot those unfamiliar to the MCU will find confusing. Once you get into the film, although not as good as The Avengers films, this is a thriller and a must-see movie for 2016.

The basis behind the movie is simple; set one year after the horrible events in Avengers: Age of Ultron, the team must sign a UN treaty which effectively denies the Avengers any rights of free movement, stripping them of their ability to fight crime around the world and create a path of destruction along their way, as has happened in the other movies.

Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) or Iron Man, who has had to deal with the burden of having created Ultron in Avengers 2, decides it's best if the team signs this treaty. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), who is Captain America, disagrees and believes that signing the treaty is not the best thing for the Avengers.

This entire concept of two of the most powerful men in the Avengers team against each other forms the basis of the film; a Civil War, namely between the individual Avengers themselves. Perhaps a little conveniently, half the team sides with Stark, half with Rogers. And so begins the war, each side fighting for what they believe in.

What I liked about this Civil War idea was how it leaves the whole ''bad guys, good guys'' allocation to the audience for quite a portion of the film. We are aware that Tony Stark is a good guy, having seen the other MCU films, but so is Steve Rogers. Hence, while it soon becomes clear who is ''right'' and who isn't, having two ''good'' guys and two ''good'' sides opposing each other opens viewers up to a different kind of enemy, one of which is harder for viewers to pinpoint definitively.

However, in reality the entire basis of the film is not just the Civil War, but also encircles that of the Winter Soldier, James Barnes (Sebastian Stan), returning from Captain America: The Winter Soldier. He plays a pivotal role in the movie, the audience's perception of him being changed from Captain America 2.

Returning from Avengers: Age of Ultron are the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), alongside other characters from the MCU including Falcon, Ant-Man and War Machine. New appearances include the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland).

All these characters star in the fight scene, featured in the trailer, which is easily one of the best fight scenes in the MCU, almost outshining those in the Avengers, simply for its ever-so simple concept; a Civil War between the Avengers.

On the downside, it is this huge line-up of characters that forms part of the problem with this film. It drowns Captain America away as the title role in the film. He isn't completely submerged, with the film still able to identify him as the main protagonist. However additions such as Tony Stark have the inherent ability to dim away Steve's voice in the film. As the film progresses so too does Captain America's role diminish slightly. While fears of the film becoming Avengers 2.5 or Iron Man 4 before its release were thankfully not realised, this movie did still struggle to keep the limelight focused on Captain America himself.

More notably is how the film struggles to find focus. It shifts between the Civil War of sorts, and the underlying protagonists of the story, attempting to give each character some attention. This was to some degree a mistake; while this will entertain those who know the MCU universe well, those purely watching for Captain America will be confused for sure.

But I must digress; if you are going to see an MCU movie, any of them, it is best to at least know some basic background information about the timeline, to help your understanding of the film. This flaw of confusion is not intrinsic with this film but the fact that the MCU flows less like a collection of movies and more like a series, with each one flowing on to some degree from the last. Watching Captain America 2 then moving straight to 3 is not a smart choice, at the very least, watching Avengers 2 is necessary.

To an extent the movie struggles to find its voice for half the film, as the building blocks are slowly put down for the film. This can be good too, though, allowing for more character development. Unlike the Avengers films, this movie is not teeming with fight scene after fight scene. Rather they are more spaced, and rightly so; any more fight scenes and this movie would have been indistinguishable from any other Avengers film.

Having watched the other Avengers films, this movie doesn't quite live up to them, though it would be disappointing if this film outshone the Avengers. Instead, this film allows for an almost side-conflict set aside from the battles the Avengers are usually fighting together, instead exploring the consequences when a series of ''enhanced humans'' turn on each other.

Captain America: Civil War is a stunning film which has helped withhold the reputation of the MCU. It is a film that has been well-developed in almost every important aspect, and certainly has helped hook viewers and set up for a dramatic conclusion in Avengers 3: Infinity War.",7
8 May 2016,It is brilliant incredible a masterpiece,"As a comic book reader my expectations were really really high but again Marvel didn't disappoint and gave its fans the best adaptation this comic can get.Not even for a moment I was bored,I didn't even blink so I won't miss a second of it.The movie was so action-packed and the fight choreography was mind-blowing.Also it was so intense and showed us each hero has a dark side but at the same time extremely funny.I was having heart attack watching but also laugh my self into tears.This is what you really expect from a movie,to give you a little bit of both.The Russo brothers did an excellent job.Not just bringing all these heroes together but also introducing new ones.It is not easy.They come up with a story that it is not just a political incident but also an emotional showdown.We finally got to see how the world really feels about heroes.We see the damage they have done.Yes they saved thousands but what about the ones we have lost.It was the best answer to the people who think that Marvel isn't realistic.I ask you can they get more realistic?!Another thing that got my attention was we finally got a movie that does not end with saving the world cliché. We also see that heroes does not always win.Another point that needs appreciation was the visual effects.As someone studying software engineering I'm very strict about basic points and they did a great job.Everything looked so real and they gave us a fight scene that will leave its mark in history.To the ones saying there is too much CGI.Try shooting without the CGI and just good luck.I really believe that the visual effects is the thing that gets our favorite heroes out of the comics into the real world.Finally all I ask is just forget about your prejudgments and stop comparing this to BVS.Just enjoy one of the best comic book movies of all time.",10

30 July 2017,Bring on Black Panther,"Civil War should have been called the Avengers Civil War, but things would've turned out different with Thor and the Hulk. Great fighting scene of the back and then during another great fight scene we get the Black Panther! Holy cow! He owns this movie! Marvel just can't stop kicking it up. Oh we're not done yet we get a taste of our friendly...you know the rest. The kid is awesome! Culminate treachery and having to chose sides they should have come out with a second part, no Thanos or other worldly intervention just the crew going at it! Lots of fun action and new characters! Go see it!

5 March 2023,Should have been called Iron Man vs Cap - not Captain America 3,"Captain America: Civil War is a 2016 superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. The film features an ensemble cast, including Chris Evans as Captain America, Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man, and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow.

The movie received positive reviews from both critics and audiences, praising its action sequences, performances, and themes of friendship, loyalty, and responsibility. However, some fans of the Captain America comics expressed disappointment that the movie did not follow the source material faithfully, especially the iconic storyline of the same name.

The Civil War comic book series, written by Mark Millar and illustrated by Steve McNiven, was a massive crossover event that involved almost every major superhero in the Marvel Universe. The story revolved around the Superhuman Registration Act, a government policy that required all superheroes to register with the authorities and reveal their secret identities. Captain America and Iron Man had opposing views on the law, leading to a massive conflict between the Avengers and their allies.

While the movie borrowed some elements from the comic book series, it deviated from the source material in significant ways, such as the absence of many key characters, the simplified political context, and the different resolution of the conflict. Some fans felt that the movie missed the complex themes and character development of the comic book series, and that it was more of an Avengers movie than a Captain America sequel.

Overall, while Captain America: Civil War is a well-made and entertaining movie, it may not satisfy die-hard fans of the Captain America comics or those who were expecting a faithful adaptation of the Civil War storyline.

However, as a standalone superhero movie, it delivers on its promises of action, drama, and spectacle, and sets the stage for future Marvel Cinematic Universe movies.",7

9 May 2016,Nice,"I really excited about this film and i've been waiting fir several years ti watch this. While some may claim showing the scenes in reverse is just an annoying trick to make a simple plot confusing and add a plethora of twists, I wholeheartedly disagree. Any good story teller knows it's not what you say, but how you say it.

By playing the scenes in reverse you experience the confusion Lenny undergoes throughout the film. Showing some of the scenes in chronological order (BTW, the use of B&W instead of color to make the time distinction was ingenious) creates suspense which builds as the two time lines converge. The somewhat rushed pace (compared to a written format) doesn't give you enough time to adequately analyze the events during the movie. This has two advantages: firstly you're going to talk about it after you leave the theater adding to experience immensely, and secondly you don't have time to think about what has happened (will happen) so you're experience better follows that of Lenny.

19 May 2016,"Hand to Hand Combat, ,Lack epicness of Super Hero fight,lack emotional attachment","This movie is as good as any real action sci fi movie ,though i won't say it has epicness of Super Hero movie fight like Batman vs superman .Civil war is better constructed than Batman vs Superman maybe cz it has really simple plot of going right into action from the start.Civil war don't spend separate time in character or enemy development but its more like characters & enemies are developed through fight from the start.One problem with that is Main Characters become less important & fight/mission overshadow the depths of Characters

The Movie lack better dialogues as usual as any Avenger/Marvel movie .Acting wasn't that great .Facial expression of Iron man & Captain America & few other character almost remained same .Maybe they are told to look bad ass, so thats why not much expression with Face i guess .Some long ,Boring meaningless conversations with no emotional depth .Lack of any background music & sometime complete silence in the background when conversation made it sound really annoying .

Airport Scene !!! I really don't get it what so epicness about it like what Some Fan boy talked about instead i feel the First fight scenes & the last one was better .Airport fight scene lack seriousness & that take away the thrill that it should be involving its audience into . With good background music,good emotional dialogue ,some good flash back to show bonds between characters could have made the emotional attachment to the film stronger .I felt something after Batman vs Superman & it stayed but can't say same for Civil war .Its like every emotional attachment gone after the movie ended,Bad Acting & failed Main Character build up to blame for that though memory of real good fight scene still there .Civil war failed to become"" The Dark knight ""instead its more like ""The Bourne Identity meet Terminator"" with less depth & less attachment to the Main characters",8
18 March 2018,One of the best MCU films ever,"This movie has both the intense comic-book action expected of a Marvel movie and complex character conflict. (MILD SPOILERS) It is centered around the Sokovia Accords, which gives complete control over the Avengers to the UN, and how it splits them into two teams, Team Cap and Team Iron Man. Iron Man, who helped create the Accords, believes that, as he puts it, they ""need to be put in check,"" while Captain America believes that a) the UN, and the government, are ""run by people with agendas,"" and that b) - when it comes to safety, ""the safest hands are still their own."" Basically that the UN might use the Avengers for their own doing, and that the UN isn't going to know about every threat. I can see both sides to this argument, and don't 100% agree with either, although I'd probably say I lean towards Iron Man. The film also acts like your traditional sequel, as it continues the Winter Soldier's and Captain America's character arcs from Winter Soldier (which is also excellent) by having Cap go after him and try to help him be Bucky again. Overall, great action, great plot, great characters, great film.

22 January 2017,Worst story ever,"I'm basing my review on the Storyline that is published so no spoiler will be found her. This is the most ridiculous story of a movie I've seen in a long time. The Avengers are blamed for the victims of the attacks of various villains. The entire movie is based on this idea, they ARE the new villains. In addition, you can read in the Storyline that a war-like battle between them begins. Again, ridiculous. It is obvious that in reality they won't fight over an idea. I gave it 5 points because the action is very good, so one can see and enjoy the movie, while giggling at the story. The movie received a good grade in total but this is due to fans (like me) that vote in favor. You should vote as you really think. Last, the movie is more like Avengers 3 then Captain America 3.

12 May 2016,Thoroughly underwhelming. More is less!!!!,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",5

5 September 2019,Masterpiece,"Civil War is a masterpiece. And in my opinion the best marvel movie. Just like get out I watched this movie when it came out in theaters and I still love it. Captain America and iron man had been in a good amount of films and had dealt with their hardships. So when this movie came along there decisions have a purpose. This movie has some qualities that I wish more movies had. It has really good dialogue. Characters sit down and talk and it just feels organic than usual. It's mostly because of the energy the Captain America movies have. This movie makes these characters feel real and that's awesome because it gives the universe a nice change of pace. There are other great stuff. Great acting. Great script. Has some of the best action. If I could think of any issues I would say the music. I don't like how marvel changes the score of the films, people made videos of that. I also really don't like the shaky cam it's a headache. The villains plan is also pretty dumb and complicated. But these problems aren't too bad so I can let go of them. This is the movie that made me a marvel fan so I have a huge attachment for it.",10

Still, the characters they did have were favorites, and they introduced a couple of more. Great film, and the Iron Man/Captain America interactions were great.

10 June 2016,One of Marvel's Best,"This is just the beginning of my full review. To read the entire piece, please visit my blog at http://GuyWithAMovieBlog.blogspot.com

By now, the Cinematic Universe (MCU, for short) is either for you or not - there's little middle ground. If you're a fan, you're going to be pleased a couple times each year. If you're one of the many who bemoan a new addition to this ever expanding series, you've got something fresh to complain about on a regular basis.

For me, the MCU contains films I love (Captain America: The First Avenger, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy), films I like (The Avengers, The Incredible Hulk), films I have no interest in ever seeing again (Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3, Thor, Avengers: Age of Ultron), and even a couple I haven't seen yet (Thor: The Dark World and Ant-Man). I'm by no means a fanboy, but even the worst of these films (Iron Man 2) isn't terrible by any stretch of the imagination. For a series stretching 13 films (and counting), it's shown a fair amount of consistency.

The newest addition to the MCU is Captain America: Civil War, the third installment of the Captain America series. Before watching it, I was a bit worried it would be more in line with The Avengers films rather than the Captain America films, which is why it took me nearly a month to get around to seeing it.

I needn't have worried.

Civil War is a tad more bloated than The First Avenger and The Winter Soldier, primarily due to the influx of The Avengers (minus Thor and Hulk, who were apparently off gallivanting across the universe and couldn't be bothered to make an appearance) and several other new characters, but it still felt like a Captain America movie to me, which is definitely a good thing.

The film starts with a very well done action scene. It's not only exciting and intense, but sets up the plot perfectly. After an incident occurs in a foreign country where innocent people are hurt and killed, the United Nations wants The Avengers subjected to a strict and binding set of guidelines and government oversight. Captain America (AKA Steve Rogers, played by Chris Evans) doesn't like the sound of that, knowing first hand how government agencies and people in general can develop their own agendas. He clashes with Iron Man (AKA Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey, Jr.), who feels guilty about the destruction, even though he knows it was done for the greater good.

In addition to this strife, the two also clash over how to handle The Winter Soldier (AKA Bucky Barnes, Rogers childhood friend, played by Sebastian Stan), who was brainwashed by the evil Hydra organization and has resurfaced again, leaving a slew of bodies in his wake. Captain America wants to get to his friend and save him while Iron Man wants to find and arrest him. Since you've seen the previews and commercials, you know that eventually the two come to a head and end up splintering The Avengers. Some side with Cap, some with Iron Man.

5 November 2020,Entertaining and Funny like a child comic story,"The Story and the plot seems to be well set but the depiction and the participation of the characters was sadly very biased. The story could have been far better. No major nomination also proves my point. Some characters who are mightier and significant in the next movies are almost neglected or presented as useless in the story such as Vision, Black Panther and even Ironman. Ironman seems to be unnecessarily depicted to be failure and subdued from its capabilities. There is clear evidence that the entire movie just wants to exaggerate the role and might of Captain America, who is actually nothing more than a physically strong and determined soldier. The entire movie revolves around him while others just appear to fulfill their part of the story. Spiderman seems to act like a comic-jocker like 'The Mask'. He could have been presented far better and responsible. Antman has been admitted to the scene without any reason or cause or justification. Vision seemed to like a funny video game Robot without any significant role in the entire movie. Falcon could have been presented better. He has been presented as like a Pet Dog of Captain America and his role is given much importance over others; I think that is very disgusting as he is actually nothing more than a mechanized flying bird. Overall the movie just revolves around Captain America and proves him to be far superior to all others and overlooks the importance and power of its superheros like Ironman, Vision, Wanda and Black Panther. Hulk and to do nothing with whatever happens in the story; there is no justification for the same.",6

11 April 2017,"""Captain America: Civil War"" Review","Eight years ago, Marvel took the reigns of the superhero genre with ""Iron Man."" Twelve films later and Batman, Superman and the X-Men are still playing catch up. With both the comic book fan and casual moviegoer in the palm of its hand, Marvel could have played it safe with this one. A run-of- the-mill action fest would have brought in the dough, while also entertaining the masses. But, yet again, Marvel showed us why it's number one.

""Captain America: Civil War"" poses a question that may have crossed your mind while watching ""The Avengers"" or ""Age of Ultron"": in the midst of the mind-blowing action taking place on screen, how many innocent civilians were killed?

Within the first half hour of the film, the Avengers are shown footage from major events in past Marvel movies, but rather than enjoying a shot of the Hulk smashing a few aliens into a building, the heroes see pieces of that building crush a bystander filming the chaos from his phone. Instead of watching Captain America throw his mighty shield, they are treated to the lifeless eyes of a woman caught in the crossfire of superhero and super villain.

Shortly following this, Earth's mightiest heroes are presented with a document, called the Sokovia Accords, which states that the Avengers must place themselves under the command of the United Nations or retire. Tony Stark signs. Steve Rogers doesn't, ultimately pitting the two heroes against one another and leaving the rest to choose a side.

While technically a Captain America story, ""Civil War"" plays out more like an Avengers 2.5, which works in the film's favor. The Russo brothers mesh the darker tone of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" with the humor of ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" masterfully balancing a plethora of characters new and old. The dialogue is thought provoking, the action is spectacular and the performances have never been better.",9

3 May 2016,The Best Marvel Movie,"The character conflict in this movie is built up so well. It takes it time and lights a fuse, making not so great Marvel Movies relevant and demonstrating that there were consequences in those films while also having thrilling action and a story that you can really get invested in because of how well-realised the characters are in this film. Forget Avengers. This is the pay-off to those stand-alone movies that ranged in quality that we sat through. We have twists, broken people and relationships, enthralling action and an amazing well-done emotional undercurrent. The action choreography is so well-done and instead of having standard fight choreography like in Winter Soldier the settings combined with the great idea to make a legitimate action sequence instead of some bloated CG fest prevent any action sequence from being repetitive and dull and all of them are quite phenomenal and the character conflict make it more meaningful.

And the motivation behind characters is so understandable because of their past experiences and that clash of belief ends in a dark, emotionally intense finale. Though it is still entertaining. There is humour and this movie has most fun character ensemble in a Marvel film ever and just gives out so much fan service while still feeling tangible and Civil War is throughout always entertaining. There are some flaws, most noticeably a scene at the start of the film that gave me deja vu of the most terrible parts of AOU though luckily that was one scene. There was also a bit of a lull and slow-pacing during one point in the film that affected the building intensity this film had ever so slightly and took me out of the film a little bit and there is one funeral scene that was a bit executed ever so cheesily but that is just a nit-pick. All up this film has tiny flaws and is definitely the best Marvel Movie. I love this movie and I'm pretty sure it is an 8/10 but I will have to view one more time to solidify that rating so for now I am giving it a 7.5/10.",6

15 July 2020,Strange conflict,"I found the fundamental conflict here very confusing. It's about whether the Avengers should be bound to international legislation. The international community has already voted yes. If Avengers say no, they are in breach of international law. If they say yes, they are not. Obviously they should say yes, because if the international community asked them to do something they didn't want to do, they could still refuse and breach the law. The question is just should we decide right now to breach the law, or wait until a problem comes up?

16 June 2016,When action and story become one,"First of I've got to say that this is a masterpiece in combining a story with action. Yeah explosions, fighting and stuff - but you actually care about it all.

Secondly, here is my good/bad summary:

+ A damn good story! The conflict is built up believably and there is a reason for every choice a character make. It's a dramatic good vs good fight and you are conflicted in who to root for. There are several parallel stories, like the introduction of the new character Black Panther. Such parallel stories risk to mix badly with the main story but here that isn't the case. 10/10

+ Action (duh). Not only it's fantastic visuals, but it also help telling the story. If you love explosions and fist fighting: you'll love it. If you love fleshed out fights where you really feel something: you'll love it. 10/10

+ Cinemaography. What to say? The visuals perfectly set the tone of every moment 10/10

+ Acting. Very good. Every character feel true and relatable, you can feel their inner conflicts. 8/10

+ Spiderman, Black Panther and Ant-man. Do I have to say more? They are all seamlessly introduced and even Black Panther who has a pretty strong story arc are perfectly built-up without taking any focus from the main story. And by the way: this Peter Parker is my favourite up to date! :D

+ The blending of each element stated above is done so good. Great action scenes and a lot of storytelling tend to be difficult to blend, resulting in pointless action sequences and a lot of ""character development"" that feels out of place. This clearly isn't the case here. 10/10

Now my biggest (and only BTW) complaint about the movie is - ironically - about the story: it could have been even stronger. You do have a big conflict between good and good, but I think it's to much to call it a ""civil war"". So there were multiple things that split the Avengers up which I feel could have been built up even more, and possibly intertwined to make a greater impact, making the split more final than it were now.

So all in all: very well-made, very enjoyable with great action and story. Highly recommended! :)",10

27 June 2016,Fan!!,"Are we not happy that first of all - Avenger Characters are not being replaced every 5 seconds with new actors. .... (spidey excluded.. lol)

You actually feel closer to an actor and them playing a super hero, when its the same actor. You start feeling part of the character. I mean when new actors replace a hero, it takes away the plot as you probably sit half of the movie trying to compare this new guy playing the previous guy's part. I cant see another guy playing Iron Man better than Robert. I cant see anyone playing Captain better than Chris. Wow and these guys really bring new improved action skilled scenes and moves every time. In advance thanking the martial arts guy 😆. ' Wow what a move.. ' that was me already getting the action in beginning of the movie. Thanks for that.

Yes it sounds like I am a total Marvel fan. Its only because they truly make the effort to making a bit of effort in fitting the avenger movies into a storyline which the average person can understand. Its puzzle but it fits one by one. A well oiled machinw. Might not always be spot on to the comic books. But it makes sense and it never ever has been boring.

Looking forward to Avengers next year.",8

16 June 2016,Why Civil War is the Greatest Comic Book Movie Ever,"The Super Hero movie is a genre (note: CBM is not) which all of us have come to cherish and criticize for our own reasons and through our own lens. We talk ad nauseam about which one is the best, which ones are superior/inferior to others, and all the other nuanced opinion- based, fact-backed, rationales for why A is good/best/worst/better.

I posit that Civil War IS the greatest of the genre. To explain why, first we have to look at what we want out of these movies.

A TRUE HERO. Captain America, without a doubt the fastest rising fictional icon today. I can't be the only one seeing Cap T-shirts everywhere I go? How did we get here? Prior to CW, 2 starring roles in excellent films (Winter Soldier is TOPS) and supporting roles in the flashy and wondrous Avengers flicks. We KNOW Steve Rogers now. We do. He's not a prototype, or an archetype, or a symbol, he's a guy from Brooklyn named Steve who has suffered heartbreak and loss and through his backbone of unwavering morality has persevered. We believe in his moral code, and Civil War brings that trust to the forefront of this film by forcing us to view it through not just our lens but other characters we've come to appreciate like Iron Man, as well as through the eyes of our fictional counterparts, the typical citizen of MCU's Earth.

A SPECTACULAR FIGHT. AIRPORT AIRPORT AIRPORT. Holy Sh!t! I was riveted for 20 minutes straight by that set piece. It combined scores of characters we love with different and nuanced power-sets clashing together with kinetic and jarring results. Never has there been a better fight in CINEMA than this one here. Civil War is an embarrassment of riches in this department as the climactic battle between Bucky, Cap and Steve is core-cutting, pulpy, madness. The Romania escape scene, with the stairwell battle -> rooftop Buck v Panther was f'ing SICK. Never has a CBM had this much glorious, character-motivated, plot-driving action before.

A SURPRISE. Spider-Man. Yes, we saw his costume design in a trailer. Personally, I knew nothing more than that eye squinting image and the actor playing him's filmography. Of Spider-Man I know much more, and on the big screen have seen him 4.5 times (turned of ASM2). The surprise that was the delightful, fulfilling Spider-Man on screen, wise-cracking, web-shooting, wall-crawling and heartfelt as we've never seen before.

A CONTINUING STORY. Super-Hero genre is derived from the Comic Book, and the comic book is a serial. To pay true homage to its roots, you can do a number of things, like rip the cover page off the book you're adapting and throw it up on screen for an extra beat (which they did in this) or name check creators, etc. But the truest way to homage the medium is to create an evolving story that lays story seeds that are nurtured into central conflicts in later films. That's what we got here with the revelation that Bucky killed Tony's parents. Bucky himself as a character is also a perfect realization of the continuing story as the Cap Trilogy (GOAT!) creates this saga of Bucky throughout. The ending of this movie is satisfying, and yet... we NEED to see more!

A WORTHY FOE. Iron Man and Zemo and Black Panther and Self-Doubt and all the other antagonistic forces that challenge our heroes in this film are perfectly pitched and create a harmony of conflict throughout that the audience can do nothing but root root root for the home team. Crazy thing is, with Iron Man, our allegiances are tested and at times we sympathize with our antagonists. This is a mark of a great film.

In conclusion, in Captain America: Civil War we have the truest, the most rewarding, the most riveting, emotional, suspenseful Super Hero movie that has ever been created. Wonderful movies in the genre have come before. Some with excellent villains like Ledger's Joker, some realizing moments on screen that most never dreamed we'd see (The Avengers) and others that offered us a taught thrill-ride (Spider- Man 2, Days of Future Past). NEVER, and I mean never, have we gotten a movie that delivered EVERYTHING we could hope for in a single offering like we got with CIVIL WAR. It has NO weak spots, indeed this movie is all STRENGTH and that is why it's the Greatest of All Time.",10
8 May 2016,A movie so full of characters and story it can't keep up with itself.,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",6
14 May 2016,Below Expectations.......,"I watched the movie yesterday and it was a bit disappointing.Could have been a lot better.

1) All the superheroes did a fantastic job except 4 spiderman

2) Ant-Man was surprisingly better Spiderman

3) Spiderman was kinda douchebag and annoying

my top 5 superheroes in this movie

1. Captain America (obviously) 2. Iron Man 3. AntMAn 4. BlackPanther 5. Black IronMan

Is it better than Batman v Superman and Deadpool = NO (my opinion)

the movie could have been a 9/10 if there was deadpool",8

5 May 2016,"Review from a realistic, neutral point of view.","Captain America: Civil War is a movie that serves as opening to Phase 3 of MCU, and is 2nd MCU movie by Russo Brothers. That means we are bound to have it different. Considering Dawn of Justice came out month and half ago, and with all DC vs Marvel nonsense, and duels between heroes, it is hard not to compare those two movies. Which is a reason I decided to write this review, as both DC and Marvel fan - because I read a lot of both Civil War and Dawn of Justice reviews, and I can't help but notice some... irregularities.

Civil War is NOT best superhero movie ever (title still belongs to The Dark Knight from DC, and Guardians of Galaxy from Marvel), and it's NOT how Versus movie should be done either. But that doesn't mean this is bad movie.

Movie starts way too slowly, and it takes almost whole hour to pick up. when it does, everything happens too fast. Main battle between characters feels chaotic, and not in War-like, good kind of way. It feels rushed. not to mention that it's quite overcrowded movie (which I happen to find funny, because no pro critic mentions that), some characters don't even get justice, and their point of view remains... untold? This IS Avengers 2.5, not Captain America 3, as whole Cap's goal, and Cap's story doesn't get necessary depth.

Movie lacks good continuity. It is fun at moments, then at some you are wondering how long until movie ends. Movie shouldn't last 2.5 hours, filled with cheesy lines, unnecessary parts. Movie would maybe be best superhero movie ever if it lasted hour and 40. Plus from me is that there are no usual Marvel jokes, and whole movie feels SLIGHTLY darker than usual, which is plus from me.

of all characters, development was left for few. Spiderman (Tom Holland is BEST Peter Parker we ever had. As for spider-man himself, I need to see more. there is great potential, but for now I think Garfield's one is better for just a hair), Black Panther, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, Falcon - all got developed greatly. On other hand, Vision was quite disappointing, along with Iron Man, Black Widow, Warmachine. Tony is annoying as ever, but this time it feels that writers juggled way too much with his development. Ant man, along with Spidey, is something that made movie MUCH better, but still - Ant man felt way too rushed. still, amazing addition. You'll enjoy every second when Ant Man and Spiderman are on screen. I could watch whole movie with just two of them. If those two weren't in movie, movie itself would be mediocre. Which is silly, because movie shouldn't be pulled that much forward by two side characters.

Main Villain - Zemo, is forgettable. Even Crossbones was much more impressive. Zemo was so bad villain that you will forget about him after few days. It's nothing we haven't seen in past iron man movies.

There is really stupid analogy to Dawn of Justice, which no one cares about, because it's Marvel. It's not same, it goes opposite direction, but boy, it's so... Dunno. Disappointing.

All in all - Civil War IS better than Dawn of Justice, for sure, but this is not best superhero movie ever (people said same for Age of Ultron, yet... that was far from truth) . One fight does not make whole movie, and whole versus thing is incomparable to Dawn Of Justice - it's two different kind of versus, both aren't what we deserve. We are now getting too much Superhero movies that we have to set bars higher each time. Civil war did not follow that through, although it appealed to general fans in certain ways. Still, Civil War kept marvel spirit, looking forward to infinity war (only). Sadly, predictability was also kept, so as most of marvel movies - story is bit predictable.

I rate it 7/10, same as I rate Dawn of Justice. Is it amazing movie? it's good. Does it have predictable moments? Sure. And unneeded ones? Of course. Should you watch it? Sure, man, it's nice flick, especially with friends. Decent opening to Phase 3, but I expected better. Guardians of Galaxy and Winter Soldier remain as better movies, in my opinion, while this story is as good as Iron Man 1, or Ant man.",1

10 May 2016,"Love it, but...","I'm a fan of the Marvel movies, looking forward to the climax. This is a good movie, I highly recommend you watch it, but it felt like a filler. All the other movies had a great united sense about them(the movie), the characters and story was coherent if cut a bit short for theaters. This movie was jumping all over from one character to another as the story needed. Felt like poor planing the whole time, like they just had to get it out fast so they can move on. If your a fan of the Avengers you have to see this movie, like all Marvel movies it is part of a massive story that is not yet done. I just wanted more, more of this, more of that, why are we leaving, no go back, oh come on are all things I was saying to myself. Also the ability to predict what will happen was high in this one, even if you're not up to date with other media of the franchise. Whenever you can predict what will happen, you know that's a bad sign. If this was a 6+ hour movie it would be a epic tale, as is, it's just good. I watched this with high hopes, like all Marvel movies, I was disappointed but not enough to stop me from watching it again.

29 April 2016,Greatest superhero movie of all time!!!!,"Ignore the insecure DC fan-boys down voting this film and giving it 1 star. It was a masterpiece and quite possible the greatest superhero film of all time. Marvel continues to display its superiority with another masterful addition to the MCU. Everything is prefect, the action, the direction, the pacing, the effects, the performances. Spiderman is amazing and ant man also steals the show here. The conflict is explored masterfully and doesn't feel ridiculous and fake like it does in BvS. We actually feel and care for these characters and understand their motivations. The Russo brothers make zack Snyder look like a complete amateur. Do you see Warner bros and DC? This is how you make a movie!!! Do yourself and favor and watch this masterpiece!!! Absolutely incredible stuff!

18 October 2016,An exciting addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"Captain America: Civil War is a film that has an engaging conflict, strong characters and thrilling action that creates a fresh and exciting addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The film is set in the world of Marvel, an alternate version of Earth that is home to popular heroes such as Iron Man, Hulk, and Spider Man, along with more previously less popular yet beloved personalities like Ant Man and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Civil War, the third film to center on Captain America, also features a multitude of characters from this universe.

After the extreme destruction that the previous films brought, the world's governments have come together to create the ¨Superhero Registration Act.¨, which, as the name suggests, requires all superheroes to register before they can operate. Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man, believing that it will keep people safe, accepts the new law, while Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America refuses, believing that the Avengers should be able to fight off alien and robot armies without government intervention. Soon, the rest of the heroes take sides, and two and a half hours worth of chaos ensue. Due to its large cast, this may seem like an Avengers film, but the focus is kept on the main characters, even when it goes wide. While wasting no time throwing the audience into the action, Civil War slows down to make the conflict feel personal, showing interactions between the characters that emphasize the ¨human¨ in ¨superhuman¨.

But the heroes are still as fantastic as ever. One part that stands out is the airport battle near the end of the movie. It utilizes the formula of special effects, quick humor, and action that Marvel has perfected. Every hero has something to show off, and both sides have tricks up their sleeves. Even though the Earth isn't in peril, the stakes still feel high during this battle.

The film manages to close the curtain on the current heroes for the time being and make room for the newer additions to the universe, like Black Panther, Spider-Man, and Doctor Strange, with an ending that is a cliff-hanger yet also satisfying. If Marvel can keep it up for its upcoming films, Captain America: Civil War is only a small glimpse of the studio's potential.",10
20 May 2016,Wonderful Escapist Fare and a GREAT Film,"Way back when I first heard that Captain America was being brought to the screen I kind of cringed. How could they translate the complexity of character and his true coolness but stay away from any cheese? Dress a guy in the flag and remain true to the seriousness of the Depression and World War Two era? Well, they managed to pull it off quite well in the first film. The director knew that you had to establish and truly care about the character. Making it a period piece really helps give it a flavor unlike any other comic adaptation. The Raiders of the Lost Ark flavor was there. In the second film, they met the new challenge of depicting Cap in the modern era. Now, everything established in both Captain America films and both Avengers pays BIG dividends in this Civil War movie. The universe has been established wonderfully and this film does the best job to date playing in that universe. Everything and every scene packs some sort of punch and resonates with true style and heart. They really let the action flow but also allow for key development of the overall story and over concept. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's personalities. And I'm talking ALL the characters even the ones with smaller roles. This heightens the tension, so often missing from lesser comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. Add more than a dash of thriller aspects and a few new characters that steal every scene that they appear in.

I honestly can't think of one way to improve this film. The result is a sequel that's just flat out exceptional and a trilogy that's the best any genre has ever seen.",
3 August 2016,Watch it now!,"The CLAW here, bringing you another, should you see it in theaters, or wait for the DVD. Here we go:

Captain America: Civil War, and what a civil was it was! Winter Solider so far has been my favorite superhero movie, sorry DC fans, and this one ups it even more. This movie executes on absolutely every single level. The action is amazing. The Russo brothers do a great job of using practical effects, and it definitely shows. The fight and action scenes look more realistic than any other superhero movie. The story, once again changed the MCU forever. Who side are you one? I'm Hail Hydra(and so is Captain America, apparently). Some people are calling this, Avengers 3, since so many characters are in it, which is true, but at its heart and soul this movie is about Captain America and Tony Stark. The other characters are just pawns in the showdown. Some chose to be over watched by a governing committee that will now doubt become corrupt, and some choose the side of continuing being a non governmental entity. What caught me in this movie was in my opinion the best villain to date. He was cool, subtle, and had a layer of loss and revenge. He wasn't out about world domination, but rather to destroy the Avengers world, which was a nice change of pace.

I am going to end my review here. Why? Because do you really need that much convincing or insight to go see this movie, absolutely not. This is one of the best movies this year, and by far the best Marvel Movie. So stop reading this, and go WATCH IT NOW!!!

Recommendation: See in Theaters!",10
7 February 2017,Summery of a movie,"For me its a boring movie. A long one considering the effect's and camera choice's new angle new angle and all those lame comments. But I can understand the apriciation of the fanboys and i mean fanboys in a good way, as I see and think of this movie. As a gift to them. Therefore my rating 5. For people outside the marvel universe. I understand the many 1 reviews. Hate the 1 star reviews normally. Its more like a review of themself and then words like them taking a (SoHeIsTo) in public. Which i rate 5 to. Well the movie failed me smile, så created my own happy face.

Bad movie, god for others.

My recomention: take a chance

Will stay with spiderman, ironman and hulk

7 May 2016,Marvel Misunderstandings should be the name of this movie.,"just saw Civil War...well to tell you the truth...more like the title should be ""Marvel Misunderstandings""...don't kid me wrong..I like the movie but did I love it?..is it a 10 out of 10?It's clear this is a film Marvel wanted to make, but why on earth rush into it? One film could never service this iconic plot line. It should have been gradual..It felt like two separate films weaved together to try and make a film that makes sense. But it didn't It's one half a Captain flick/ the other half a mini Avengers film. But they both drown each other out.Some of the positives were the Winter Soldier and BLACK PANTHER! (on point and perfect..saved the movie!!)...the big negative..Spiderman(felt rushed into the movie and cgi was horrendous on him..also weak acting)...Villain in this movie is sub- par(not in Loki,Yellow Jacket,Red Skull level)almost don't even remember him.But saying that I was entertained throughout most of the film..yes... it left me highly anticipating the black panther solo film.The intensity between Iron Man and Captain America was perfection...Robert Downey Jr acting is good as when he first played Iron Man..not like in Iron man 3.In all fairness,is a good movie but not a great movie as earlier reviewers has said.People sometimes need to stop drinking the Marvel Kool Aid and realize Marvel once again made another film that is just a facade of what they used to be.",5

9 May 2016,"Great, but overburdened","I definitely liked Captain America: Civil War: the story touches on some important issues, the action is top-notch, and it has a couple of really great character moments. It still doesn't qualify as the best Captain America movie, let alone MCU movie (that's still Winter Soldier), simply because I think it really would have done better with a couple of trims.

One of its biggest problems was in my opinion the whole plot line regarding Zemo, which for the most part felt like an unnecessary red herring. I do concur that, in the end, it added a nice twist to the movie's main topic of the rift between the Avengers, and it did lead to the final (and worthy to be called ""epic"") showdown between the Cap and Iron Man, but for the most time, it simply distracted from the eponymous ""Civil War"". A stronger focus on the Avenger's internal conflict, its reasons, and its repercussions would have done the movie good.

The second biggest problem is the over-full cast of heroes. Even if we ignore that someone who hasn't seen every other MCU movie before Civil War (I luckily have) will have a difficult time to comprehend who all these people are and what the heck they are doing in a Captain America movie, a bunch of the characters simply don't add anything meaningful to the movie, except maybe filling up the roster of ""Team Iron Man"" and ""Team Captain America"". Especially Ant-Man (despite his huge role in the team brawl at the airport – pun intended) and Spider-Man seemed pretty much unnecessary. I do understand the importance of Spidey's cameo in this movie to bring the character ""back home"" into the MCU, but his drawn-out introduction felt completely out of place and made the story grind to a halt for almost ten minutes. That said, I was impressed that they managed to give almost every character well developed and insightful moments and their time to shine. Black Panther was an interesting addition, and I'm looking forward to see what they will be doing with this character in the future.

And maybe to point this out again: for the general audience, which didn't follow the MCU slavishly, large parts of this movie must be incomprehensible, due to the sheer number of different characters and allusions to events in the past MCU movies.

Anyway, for MCU fans, Civil War is definitely a treat, and - due to its importance for the future of the MCU - an unmissable addition to the series.",8
15 May 2016,A Flawed but Entertaining Time at the Movies,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",7

24 March 2019,More like an Avengers movie,"Another great film by the Russo Brothers. They did such an amazing job with this one, that I don't know where to begin. Let's start with the story, compared to the comics, this is a lot different. I kind of feel like the storyline was wasted in the film. There were no consequences to their actions, which makes it seem anticlimactic. But, this film is still one of the best entries in the MCU. I love the introductions to Black Panther and Spider-Man. They were some of the best parts of the film. The action is another great thing about this movie. All in all, an amazing movie, but the premise was kinda wasted.

19 May 2016,One of the best superhero films ever.,"Captain America: Civil War is Marvel's best movie yet and blows you away with a great story, humor and solid performances from Chris Evans, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman and Robert Downey Jr. The movie has faults such as limited development for some characters and some forced things in the plot but the positives simply outweigh the negatives by a large margin. Tom Holland gives us an amazing Spider Man that I look forward to seeing more of in the MCU and the plot gives us some valid points to Stark and Captain America's side which adds a flavor to the movie t. Characters such as Black Panther, Black Widow, Falcon and Wanda Maximoff are emotionally torn apart between Stark and Steve Roger's sides. This is the best movie so far of 2016 and the second best superhero movie behind The Dark Knight. I look forward to seeing more of the MCU and their upcoming projects in the years to come.

6 May 2016,Marvel Studios' finest movie yet !,"Captain America: Civil War (2016), the opening to Marvel: Phase Three was incredibly stellar. 'Twas phenomenal and is the Marvel Studios' finest movie yet. I've literally waited for one and a half year and finally it didn't disappoint. This is 2016's third superhero movie in a row after Deadpool and Batman v Superman which I've completely enjoyed watching.

The Russo brothers have nailed it and I can say the 'Infinity Wars' are in good hands. The conflict in ideologies makes it believable why the characters fight here. I know both the movies BvS and Civil War could be kept for comparison but we are actually emotionally invested in all the characters from both the films. All your favourite guys split into teams and fight is visually a treat. Who needs a villain when you have Steve Rogers and Tony Stark? Both protagonists. Both antagonists.

The 17-minute airport fight scene is one of the best action sequences in the history of superhero movies. Every character feels respected. The not-an-usual kid from Queens had an amazing presence and a satisfying screen time. Welcome home Spidey! And, the Wakandan Black Panther was absolutely remarkable. Thor, Banner and Pepper were missed.

Special mention: Those power-packed dialogues, flawless action scenes, Spidey's cool action-comedy, Baron Zemo (though not a great villain but he has motivation), Stan Lee's cameo and of course Martin Freeman (our John ""Hamish"" Watson 😀 ).

I give my rating a clean 9 out of 10.",9

5 May 2016,Really great movie!,"Is captain America civil war a perfect film? No, but it is so close I can nearly taste it. This movie had me smiling from start to end.I never seen a group of directors balance such a large cast so effortlessly, it still amazes me as of right now. Let me tell you that if you were a little bit worried about spider-man or black panther, then I can safely tell you that Tom Holland maybe the best Spider-Man yet. The action was really great, the story was pretty well written, and all of the characters came together and a Perfect Blend that will make even non comic book readers be filled with joy. The only thing that I could see which wasn't so great in this movie was the main villain, but overall everything worked in this movie and I am really glad I went to go see it.

6 February 2023,I haven't seen better action sequences in my life,"This movie is one of marvel's best. I think this is marvel's most to save action packed film. Great plot and story line. All the characters are presented well. I love how they created a conflict between a really strong team. The funny thing was everyone was there to save each other on the exact moment the villain caught anyone. I still don't think the movie should be named captain america. Instead it should be Avengers Civil War. I have to admit that the film's too long. But it's worth it. The starting is slow no one will understand what is happening but the movie builds up. I think in the first hour we understand the background and what is happening. The ending is a little dramatic but its good. I'm glad black panther was in the film as well.

WATCH IT!

23 January 2019,Please read the comics,"Of course the book was way better. The civil war spanned the entire marvel universe (or at least the us). It wasn't just centered on the avengers. This could of been an even bigger movie deriving the culmination of mini series and other films just off this one movie. This movie was a hit but also a miss. Movie by itself without background info is a 7-8.

29 April 2016,Best Spiderman ever!,"I am kind of new to superheroes and comics, and has many times though that they are reusing the epic moments from Avengers when the Hulk smashes the big whale-snake-floating ship, and I thought that the Thor movie was pretty B and 3D- infested mess. But this movie is pretty awesome! Using all characters and making them feel like you know them, when watching their single movies to the big civil war fighting is awesome! But I got to say awesomeTHAT SPIDERMAN!! I never really thought much about the actors they used in the portraying of Spiderman through the other Single-movies. You can never really relate to them, and they feel a bit like, they put a 30 year old man to play a high schooler. A high schooler who is really good- looking, not awkward at all and feel, in Garfields case like a douchebag, more then that weird ""science-geek"" he is suppose to portray. ""I am a high-schooler"". But really they are not! They don't have that awkward set up like you do when you are that age. In the way that they break in their voice or in the way they act. But this Spiderman does!! First when I saw Peter Parker i Civil War, I was confused thinking he was someone else. But when he started to act his part!! PERFECTON! This is the BEST Spiderman I have ever seen, with or without the costume! Well now I am just blabbing about the spiderman-moment... But just giving me a sneak-peak of these characters awesome setup and the big fight! Gave me all the Epic-Movie moments I could ask for this summer!

30 April 2016,The Avengers 2 That Should Have Been,"Truly and utterly one of the best superhero movies I've ever watched. It encompassed everything I had wanted for an Avengers movie, and it goes as far to a point where I would gladly call it my Avengers 2 movie that should have been.

It was perfectly nuanced, showed all the abilities that each hero can bring to the table (except for Ant-Man, he was a bit too gimmicky this time but I'll let it slide, because duh, Paul Rudd). I found it hard to choose between Iron and Cap, despite the fact that I was rooting for the latter at the start.

The last fight of Act 3 nearly had me tearing up because the whole morale of the fight holds close to my heart. It was realistic and relatable, just with a large dollop of superhero action added to it.

To add on to that, the cinematography was absolutely incredible. Walking into the cinema was a little nerve-wracking for me mainly because of the bitter feeling that remained as I walked out of Age of Ultron. But within the first 15 minutes of Civil War, I knew this was going to be something different, something special.

I honestly believe that this movie is the one to go down in history, and will be the benchmark for many other superhero movies out there that is to come. Absolutely well done.",10
7 May 2016,Packed with awesomeness... but it's getting old,"I loved this movie. Great cast. Good character development (although some of the characters said little more than mildly funny one-liners). Nice action scenes. Beautiful. I absolutely love the tech upgrades they've done on many of the characters.

And yes, you will love Spidey. He's the Spidey we've been waiting for. (No offense to Andrew Garfield, who was perfection.)

I think the biggest challenge to this movie is that it doesn't bring much that's new to the table. The villain wasn't that novel. And as I know from having to sit through the movie with my parents next to me, not everyone is going to latch onto the idea that they're fighting each other. Seems rather petty, no?

But meh, I loved it. There were some aspects of the Civil War comics I'd wished they'd added in, but it was still good. Lots of laughs. Lots of action. And Vision brought up some interesting plot bunnies for future films.

Highly recommended, but with hesitation. It is more of the same stuff that we've already seen. For now, that's fine, but I hope they kick up the story a bit in the next movies.",8

That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",10
8 May 2016,"Great Film, But Very Underwhelming","Best comic book movie ever? Yeah, right.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was a far better film than Captain America: Civil War.

Zemo was completely underused in this film. In the comics, he was a very manipulative man, like in the film, but is a very skilled fighter and can go toe-to-toe and hold his own against Captain America. In this, he was basically a terrorist, who was out for revenge. Very original. With Lex Luthor in BvS, he wanted to destroy Superman, both physically and mentally, and he wanted absolute power with it as well. They wasted the potential for Zemo in this film.

The story overall was very well done, like it's predecessor, The Winter Soldier, but it could've been so much better. It didn't feel like Civil War, it felt more like a school yard brawl. The action sequences were great though. I loved them, but action doesn't make a film great. They barely touched on the original storyline, and just took the title, ""Civil War"", and slapped it under Captain America. Like Marcel Tim said, ""Should have called this Winter Soldier 2 to be honest."" In BvS, Lex made Superman look more like a threat to Batman. That was better executed than Zemo in this film.

It seems Marvel/Disney is coughing up money to the critics and give this film acclaim. What every critic is saying about Civil War are complete exaggerations. I think MCU films are losing steam.",6
27 November 2019,I'm on Team Iron Man on this one.,"Capt America's reason for me was a bit childish at least. Impressive fights, and with this one, the superheroes were forced to make choices and choose which team would they fight for.

25 August 2022,Solid MCU entry,"This is the weakest of the Captain America movies. The Cpt. Was still cool, but the villain and Iron Man were weak links here. It's a good flick, it just didn't deliver the suspense or feels that the other Captain America films did. Black Widow was the character I felt the most for. Spider-Man and Ant-Man were nice additions. They delivered most of the wows and levity. Glad they made it in.

14 May 2016,was this a movie or a documentary,"The first 35 minutes where pointless! to many flash backs to 1991! worst bad guy ever! this movie was over hyped!!!the CGI was lack lust it seemed they hit there budget amount! where are all the pedestrians where are the extra's after half the movie i seen maybe 10 extras should be called Bucky vs iron man. p.s. if any says this movie was good ask if they know the name of the bad guy. I Hope all of you decide to save your money! I have met 5 people who have slept through the movie. my nephew said he was board when he has tons of avenger toys. I hated the part where they blame the avengers for past events where they save the world from ending.

24 May 2016,could be better.,"It was entertaining and very watchable, but left me wanting more and not in a good way. I'm not usually one for wanting Hollywood to make more movies so they make more money, (ticked about the multi-Hobbits and things like that) but I feel this one should have been cut in two, given us a movie with a longer period to cause the break and a longer period to deal with it. It would have been really great if they could have had all their titles to work with, F4 and such. They should've split the two between Stark and Capt. and given us better perspectives of both.... and for crying out loud, the why... I mean don't get me wrong, they had better reasons than BvS, but there needed to be more meat to the cause of the divide. It seemed shallow and forced, too easy to make happen, like no one was trying not to make it happen. If I were losing my best friends/long time teammates, I would've fought harder to keep them together. While I do want more, I think with what they had, Spider-man and how they added him, could have been left out. It made the time with him cheesy and the suspension of disbelief more difficult to achieve. In a nutshell, holes.... it left you with and added holes and more... Okay, so I've ragged on it, but in truth, if you go in expecting another MCU movie with its comedy and action mix, you'll get it, and for that it gets a 6. However, if you go in wanting the depth of story that was in the books, you'll leave as disappointed as I was. 'nuff said.",4
6 May 2016,"One of the better Marvel films, still not Amazing though","What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

13 June 2018,Bringing all (almost all) your favorite charters together in a grand fashion!,"Many people worry when you bring this many characters together that each character gets diluted. This can be true in some cases but this movie does a great job balancing it all. The fight scenes are amazing and really set the MCU up for some interesting sequels.

24 May 2016,Incredible!,"This movie was amazing! From start to finish, I enjoyed every scene so in the Captain America series, this is my favorite and in my opinion, the best of the three films. I did not care for the first film but winter soldier was an excellent sequel to it and then Civil War does the unexpected and is even better than Winter Soldier.

One amazing thing about the movie is the choreography in the fight scenes. All of the scenes were very clean and polished. They reminded me of a Jason Bourne or James Bond fight with superheros which was something that I did not know I wanted but apparently I did because every time there was a fight scene, I was on the edge of my seat. The best fight was the scene in the trailer that everyone has seen, the scene at the terminal. The way the superheros were implemented was very intricate and you did not feel like one superhero was overshadowed by another. I felt like I saw all of the abilities of each character.

The new characters in this movie are amazing too. Tom Holland as Spider- Man and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther were magnificent. I still do not know who I liked more but both roles were performed excellently and I can not wait for their individual films. This is Ant-Man's first time with the Avengers and he held his own as well in this movie as well which I enjoyed.

Also, the story was mesmerizing. I was intrigued by what was going on and understood the reasoning of each character. The story was not the main thing I enjoyed though. Overall, this was a great film and if you have not seen this movie, you need to.",9
17 May 2021,It deserved 10/10,"How can the fans rate the one of the best mcu film less than 10!

Actions:10/10 Storyline: 10/10 (I would given more 😏.... Bcz it's excessively good) Acting skills: 10/10 ( Nothing to say about the acting.... Precisely Chris Evans and Sebastian did overly well acting) Editing: 10/10 Conclusion: I becomes the best film of MCU.... Even though other films like Captain America :Civil war.... Thor:Ragnarok.... Infinity war.... Endgame are also at its peak.... But if personal opinion was the matter... Then it is indeed my most favorite film.

7 March 2021,Finally some controversy from Marvel,"It's not politics that got between the Captain and Iron Man - it's the fact that because of his old buddy Captain America chose to antagonise everyone. Oh, and also the fact that he always knows best. It's so exhausting with these movies how they always promote going rogue cuz when you're powerful you always know best and laws don't matter. The only thing I don't get is why everyone labels Tony as arrogant when usually they are both are equally arrogant and think they know best; it's actually the first movie where Tony shows such regard for others and humility to accept that over 100 world leaders might be righteously concerned that 5 people do whatever they please. I gave it a high rating though, cause for the first time in quite a while a Marvel movie will make viewers think a bit further than the standard black and white reality of the MCU. And because the special effects are great as always :) #teamironman

7 May 2016,Greatest MCU film YET!,"Captain America: Civil War is an absolute masterpiece. My only con with this film is that the 1st act is pretty weak, and it left me pretty bored. But it IMMEDIATELY got better! First, Spider-Man was just an absolute JOY to watch. He was funny, he was cool, and he was just a great character. Black Panther was also a phenomenal character. He was an absolute kick-butt guy who made for some great action scenes; Which I LOVE! Seriously, EVERY SINGLE battle scene in the film, (Yes, even those in the first act), had me feeling great about this film. In conclusion, Civil War might just be the BEST film in the MCU so far; And I am proud to give it an 8.9 out of 10.

28 April 2016,The most human Marvel movie to date,"The marketing hype asked us to choose ""Team Cap"" or ""Team Iron Man"", presumably to set the stage up for a confrontation between these 2 friends. The cynic in all of us would be justified to think that no studio would be brave enough to make a movie that pits their 2 main tent-pole protagonists in a no-holds barred confrontation (unless they were tricked into doing so like another superhero film recently featuring a flying alien and a billionaire with a Halloween costume fetish).

But I was wrong.

With Civil War, Marvel did a very mature take on the whole superhero genre with genuine explorations on the themes of friendship, loyalty and duty. With this, it is one of the best film that they had produced so far and also the one with the furthest implication on MCU Phase 3.

Whether you are rooting for Captain America or Iron Man, the film fleshes out the motivation for the divergent paths that each character chooses to take. For me, the action of this film (and there are tons of it) are not as interesting as the human drama that the directors have cleverly and patiently unfold for its audiences. And the ensemble cast delivered the drama perfectly and effortlessly.

Highly recommended.",9
29 April 2016,Well yes I was one of the strange individuals that watched all the CAPTAIN America FILMS BACK TO BACK,"Well what a night, Captain America 1, the winter soldier next and last but not least civil war....

After five and half hours of captain America I wasn't sure what to expect for captain America civil war but I wasn't disappointed. I am a massive fan of the winter soldier story and have to admit after the first captain America film I wasn't sure what this would bring but civil war picks up where the last film left off. Great story telling and awesome monologues between the main characters, and brilliant fight scenes, overall a really good watch and even at 2.30am in the morning I still wanted more and wasn't dying for the film to just finish already.

Any true marvel fan will enjoy this film, if I am honest I am not sure if it is as good as winter soldier for me but thats always a matter of opinion, I will be watching it again and hopefully this time it wont involve a litre of coke cola and a 12.45am start time but what the hell.",10

4 March 2018,Russo's did it again!,"Russo's Winter Soldier was a successful attempt in blending a superhero blockbuster into a political action film that is relevant in today's politics with privacy vs security. They took another crack at it again by blending registration vs freedom. Iron Man and Captain America are on polar opposites fo the issue with Bucky in the middle. The other characters involved in the movie made it feel like an Avengers movie but there is no doubt that it centers on Captain's point of view. It is amazing that Russo has maintain this tether while including the many characters and not feel oversaturated. They are the right directors for the Avengers film.

17 May 2016,Same-Old Same-Old,"Captain America: Civil War is a fine entry in the MCU. I use the word 'fine', because this definitely is not a game-changer. First the good stuff: The character motivations are well drawn (it is actually hard to pick a side), the overall story is tight, the performances are generally good and there are some truly emotional moments. Spider-Man and Ant-Man are awesome. However, when you look at the number of superheroes involved in this film, you expect to find something extraordinary. Unfortunately, this isn't the case, except for a couple of bright spots.

This film turned out to be exactly the kind of film I didn't want it to be. It's inconsequential, however much it may try making you believe otherwise. Also, this movie follows the same formula both Avengers movies have followed till now: Bad guys fight good guys, good guys fight among themselves, good guys fight bad guys again. The villain is again weak. The action too, which felt fresh in The Avengers and The Winter Soldier, feels a lot been-there-done-that (except the airport scene). Black Panther felt somewhat shoehorned in the film. It's fun, but not as much as The Avengers. It's engaging, but not as much as The Winter Soldier. You know, in a movie with almost a dozen superheroes, when you come out remembering only the scenes which featured two of them in cameos, there is certainly something wrong with the movie.

People hate on BvS a lot and are comparing it unfavourably to this film. While BvS surely had its own flaws, the good moments in it were absolutely breathtaking. And it dared to be different. This one, not so much, inspite of a more serious tone than other Marvel movies.

PS: Spider-Man: Homecoming is the most I'm excited for a Marvel movie now, besides Doctor Strange.",7
8 May 2016,most intense marvel movie ever...,"This movie is definition of comic-book movie...It doesn't matter which side you are on you will question your side at the end of the movie,Speaking briefly of the movie, it is an emotional roller coaster with an absolutely beautiful end. Spidey had a satisfying screen time. As for the acting, by the time the movie ended, I was a happy man. Russos are handling Infinity War, and after watching this movie, how they did justice to characters, I'll not worry. A movie we wanted as well as deserve. The cast is perfect and everyone is used exceptionally well. This IS the best sequel the genre has ever seen and I know tat's saying a lot. It could be Marvel's best effort ever.

I haven't seen this film yet but saw the rating of 8 and it certainly looks like it will very likely be a good movie......the critic reviews

are also very good....so therefore the likelihood that this movie is a ""1"" is very far from likely.

I rarely ever write reviews but am compelled to say this as all you 1 rating people are very stupid because people will generally ignore you as it's clearly not a 1 movie!!

7 May 2016,"Fun, movie but not as great as people are making it seem","I'm not bias. I like DC and Marvel. I honestly like BVS better than this movie, and thought Winter Soldier was way better too. This movie felt so lazy honestly. I think people are just obsessed with Marvel, and their cheesy/corny one liners in every scene. The villain in this movie sucks, and it's all about making them split up or whatever his goal is, due to his loss. I watch every superhero movie, regardless if it's DC or Marvel, and like I said BvS is way better than this movie, and had me more interested in the story and plot. Winter Soldier had the same effect on me. I think the majority of obsessed Marvel fans are just liking this movie because it's Marvel and the characters, but if you take the time to look deep in the movie, you will notice at the very end, what the heck was the point of all this. Black Panther was the only character I was interested in seeing, and he barely got any screen action. The movie should have been called Team Iron Man or Team Cap. A. Some of the fight scenes also look so cartoonish, I don't know what that was about. The conflict between all of them seems very stupid to me, since there has been all sort of cities destruction, and killing in every movie, and now they want to address the same bs again in this one, by showing what someone can do when they take someone they love from them due to war.

Other than that, if you're just looking for the same ol' Marvel cheesy/corny one liners, and action go see it. It's a fun movie, but not one I would go see twice, as I did with BvS, and Winter Soldier.",7

It's awesome fights sequences are great but only one complaint, which is, I felt that the final fight could have been better, because in the competition 'DC's Batman Vs Superman: dawn of justice' proved to be an underated master piece and it's final fight between batman and superman was actually something that gives you chills but the one in this movie was not up to the mark. Again Marvel's VFX team did an awesome job in this movie and also the acting done by the cast was flawless. Talking about directory, this movie is directed in a simple way and is easy to understand. You can't expect anything in the artistic perspective of this movie, it not an a artistic masterpiece and also the tone of the movie was not constant, in some scenes the tone goes a little dark while in some it becomes very light, and also the unwanted comedy ruins some serious moments. And another thing that I noticed is that the movie did no justice to some characters, like Spiderman, Hawkeye and war machine.The biggest was Spiderman, even after having a character like him they only gave him a very little screen time and also they introduced him as a sidekick, which totally does not justifies the character of Spiderman. Overall it is a good movie, must watch!",7
9 May 2016,Bad Aftertaste (Spoilers in the review),"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",6

4 April 2018,Pretty Damn Good,"I haven't read a single coherent review for this film yet as IMDb seems to be full of angry fanboys that don't seem to realise how ridiculous comic book films are.

If, like me, you are a little disenfranchised with the MCU films, and you tried watching BVS and realised D.C. will continue to produce utter bilge as long as Zack Snyder is around to make them ""dark and gritty"", you'll understand my trepidation before watching Civil War.

I couldn't be more surprised at how good Civil War was. A comic book film that earns its dramatic moments, gives everyone a motive and a relevant amount of screen time, throws in some truly spectacular action sequences AND can make light of itself every now and then when it gets too serious BECAUSE IT'S A FILM ABOUT SUPER HEROS FFS.

This film isn't perfect, I found myself trying to keep up with the plot in places as everything moves quite quickly. Additionally, the beginning feels a little rushed to get to the main bulk of the story and themes, but I can forgive it for actually having a good story and strong themes that it sticks to.

The issue is the Fan boys / Zack Snyder fan boys that need to realise not everything needs to be super serious as that makes dull cinema. Nolan achieved it with his Batman trilogy BECAUSE HE'S AN EXTEMELY TALENTED FILMMAKER WITH A GREAT WRITER AS A BROTHER. Snyder consistently tries to make things more poignant without actually earning the right to be, resulting in boring cinema because we're not invested in his characters.

Anyway, I could go on for hours about how moronic some of the reviews from fan boys are but overall this film is a great action adventure that I'm more than certain you'll enjoy if you watched the other MCU films.",8

9 October 2016,"Fun, exciting, and yet builds its characters with layers.","Ever since The Dark Knight came out this has come close to the best superhero film ever made. The Russos have done it again giving us the same political themes from the Winter Soldier of safety and freedom and blending it in with personal themes of friendship and conflict. The characters in this movie are so fleshed out more then they ever where especially the when you combine the star power of Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. who by now can literally sleep walk through their performances.This film isn't all just action as the action i this movie has purpose and reason especially the final fight which builds emotional bonds with theses characters. Oh and did i mention the addition of Black Panther and Spiderman? now i am beaming for their solo movies especially Spidey. Its crazy to see how all these characters can be juggled in 2 and a half overs and get so much development and spotlights to shine. Before i even seen this movie i heard critics absolutely loved this film but had a gripe against the main villain of the film, Baron Zemo. Tbh i don't know what hole their talking through Baron Zemo was such a refreshing villain because he didn't want to destroy the world or rule it, he just wanted to destroy the avengers for personal reasons. Over all this is one of the best blockbusters of all time with enough fun and action to please general audiences and enough story and character development to please critics something Batman vs Superman should have been.",8

3 July 2016,Excellent Movie,"Captain America: Civil War will be known as the Godfather II or Empire Strikes Back of the comic book movie genre. The Russo Brothers emphatically show their mastery of how to blend fantastical, comic gold with honest, complex struggles and emotions any moviegoer can feel or recognize in our reality. The writing that went into the grand action pieces, each character's role and development, and the overall conflict was nothing short of pure genius and heart. This film does all the clever comic book interactions and quips we've come to expect with Marvel, but it takes itself into another threshold of brilliance by providing audiences with a gripping yet balanced plot filled with highly understandable logic behind each characters' motivations. Marvel has given us its pinnacle masterpiece to date, leaving audiences with even more reason to feel happily invested in the MCU. The films listed above were what our parents were passionate to share with us, and I'm glad to say I have found my own.

4 May 2016,The best marvel movie of recent times.,"Having watched the trailer and all the build up towards this film, I had high hopes and my god were they met. Completely blown away by how amazingly well choreographed with the scenes of fighting! Tom Holland (Peter Parker/Spider-Man) was better than expected, funny charismatic and overall brilliant. He done the Spider-Man role justice and now I cannot wait for his reboot in 2017. As for Chadwick Boseman (T'Chala/Black Panther) just like Tom Holland done his role justice and was another great addiction to the set. Marvel definitely picked the perfect guy for the job as usual. The storyline was action packed, full of surprises and everything I wanted the film to be and more! My only critique was that Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) nor Thor (Chris Hemsworth) are in the movie, however both are expected to reprise their respective roles for the third and final movie in Thors trilogy for ""Thor: Ragnarok"". Again I repeat, the best marvel movie of recent times in my own opinion.

22 May 2016,The Russo Brothers Did it Again,"After Captain America Winter Soldier, I didn't think they could top that with another Captain America movie. Maybe an Avengers movie, but not a Cap movie. I was wrong. Civil War is one of my favourite Superhero movies to date, it had a bit of everything. It had a good cast, developed characters, new character introductions, great fight scenes, a good villain, a good story for the most part. I left the cinema screening feeling like I needed to go back and enjoy it a second time, which I did, and a third. It hasn't replaced Avengers as my favourite Marvel movie, but it's definitely close. With the disappointment of Age of Ultron, I was so happy to see this movie succeed, I had high hopes for Ultron and was crushed by how it turned out, and this really made up for that. It even made Falcon and Scarlet Witch so much cooler than they were in Ag of Ultron. Although it's not an Avengers movie, it did have aspects of being one, but with the core focus on Captain America at all times. His relationship with Bucky, his struggle with his moralistic views and the signing of the Sokovia Accords. You really feel as though it is still a Cap movie, but with a really big cast. The Russo Brothers did a great job in bringing Black Panther to life on the big screen for the first time, you could really feel like they put effort in ensuring this Black Panther feels like the one we grew up with in the comics and cartoons. Whenever he was on screen, I had a big grin on my face, the way he moved, even Chadwick Boseman's acting and accent were fantastic.It makes me really look forward to Ryan Coogler's Black Panther solo movie. Spider-Man's first time on screen in the MCU was brilliant, even though I've enjoyed previous versions of Spider-Man, the 30 minutes of screen time that Tom Holland performed as Spider-Man made all of those other movies look like child's play in comparison. It was very much on point with what we've grown up and I am so excited to see Spider-Man Homecoming, especially now we have Michael Keaton confirmed as a villain, and the most likely inclusion of Downey Jr's Iron-Man. The fight scenes were pretty much on point, with the airport scene being one of the best on screen superhero scenes ever made, full of excitement, fun, humour and action. Ant-Man was fantastic too, we don't see much of him, but from what we do see, it's great, especially in the airport. Baron Zemo as a villain is, for someone with no Superpowers, a really intimidating, cold and calculating villain. I really liked what he did, his manipulation of the characters. It was refreshing to see a villain that wasn't bent on destroying the world, as with most villains in superhero comics. If i had any gripes about the movie, it would be that dots seemed to connect quite conveniently to Zemo's advantage and for the friction between the Avengers. But apart from that, an awesome experience of a movie leaving me very excited for what the Russo's have in store for us with Infinity Wars.",8

3 May 2016,"One of the Better Marvel movies, yet still didn't break the "" it's awesome"" line.","Alright, I see many reviews are biased from Marvel fan boys and say BvS was sht compared to this one. So I will try to give an honest review and try to avoid all this DC vs Marvel fight.

First off THE PLOT. At least from my perspective, the first half was a bit rushed, new characters didn't get proper introduction. The movie seemed during this first part like it was trying to be serious but wasn't sure, then switched back to the old marvel style of jokes and hollow dialogs. I hoped that Captain America will truly fight for justice, which I turned out to be wrong. Don't want to spoil anything about his development throughout the movie. Then after hour and half of boredom, sparked with few jokes and mediocre/good fighting scenes (yes even the one with black panther, for reasons I will write later) came the reason why people call this movie awesome. Fighting scene on the airport. As far as the ""choreography"" and fights go, it was a well made part of the movie. Superheroes coordinated well with each other. The final battle was in my opinion the best part of the movie, (seen in trailers) especially when Bucky and Cap go both at Iron Man.

I personally didn't like in the story, new characters were introduced very fast and some of them even immediately revealed their identity (I guess new rule for Marvel superheroes).

THE CHARACTERS: we all know the good old marvel superheroes from previous movies, so I'm not going to talk about them. I will focus on two new guys Spidey and Black Panther. While Black Panther's development and introduction was good, new mysterious guy appears and is very angry, it was ruined a little bit with immediate reveal of his secret identity. Although I must say this was made up with excellent fighting with very few flaws. And Spidey? It feels like Marvel got rights back for Spiderman from Sony in the middle of the movie shooting, and they didn't fully think it through how to properly implement and introduce him into the movie. It went more or less (spoiler? wanna join? yeah why not). Other than that he was the funniest character and was in the lead of bringing the fun back from the first boring half. Sadly as far as his character goes, that's it. It felt like the only lines he had were jokes.

THE CINEMATOGRAPHY. Here is where I have to give Marvel a big minus. First off the fights. Often you could see characters 4-5 meters away from their enemies, and in next shot right next to them beating their asses and yes I am mainly looking at you Black Widow. Some of the scenes mainly from first half felt inconsistent. Second one and which bugged me during the entire movie. CGI. I expected much more, and to be honest it looked like work of 2nd grade college students or visibly fake internet videos. Some scene's CGI was so cringe worthy, they looked like they weren't made in Hollywood but Bollywood. And it seems like Spidey got what Deadpool was afraid of. ""Don't make my costume green, or animated."" And last but not least the physics. You know you have terrible physics in your movie, when even the movie itself has to make fun of it. The objects and people were flying around like in ""goat simulator"". There isn't excuse like they are super heroes. It was sloppy. Nothing had it's weight, and it was very visible during the fights (for example the panther fight as mentioned above). And one note to the producer. If someone is mortal and will fall from height bigger than 15 m, they will die or at least end up in coma with almost every broken bone. Again some scenes felt because of it almost Bollywood like.

OVERALL This movie did break the mediocre line of Marvel movies, yet still wasn't awesome. Marvel has yet to surprise me with a very good movie. Other than 2 good fighting scenes and few jokes I didn't take anything else from this movie. Maybe bad memories horrible cgi.

LAST WORDS: As you can (maybe) see from my review I like a little deeper movies. Marvel movies from my perspective are mediocre, and keep their standard of an easy ""popcorn movie"". Good to watch once, but not many times after. I tried to stay objective and point out the very good or very bad things about the movie. I myself was and still am a big fan of Marvel comics, but don't like Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of Iron Man, yet in this movie, he improved my opinion of his role as he wasn't a complete douche. And people should really stop comparing Marvel and DC movies. They are clearly made for different demographic and are taken in two different ways. The only thing they have in common are people/aliens with super powers.

This movie deserves max 7.5/10, definitely not more than 8 if you compare it with other similarly rated great movies.",7
7 May 2016,"They did well, but i'm not feeling excited anymore","I still remember my first Marvel movie, the iron man I released in 2008 when I'm still in high school.(Spiderman doesn't count) I've never heard iron man before neither marvel universe, I went because I happened to have to one coupon and it was the only action movie at that time. My big-boy personality was brought up by all the cool armor stuff. And since then I watched every marvel superhero movies in the cinema. 8 years after it. I'm still sitting in the cinema watching Captain America III. The whole scene is even better than the avengers, gathering new team members and enhance the old. Even Spiderman get re-made. The scene at the airport is awesome and clearly they have way more budgets than dead pool. But I'm not getting excited any more; all they do are just hunting villains saving the world and people are still stupid enough to live in the super crowded cities waiting something bad happens. Maybe the only one who changes is Tony; he used to be a typical playboy and gradually grown up into someone thinks of the society. 8 years later, Tony's boyhood is over and so do I.

23 May 2016,"As complex as the division line between Democrats and Republicans, the division of the Super Heroes in Civil War...","As complex as the division line between Democrats and Republicans, the division of the Super Heroes in Civil War - the conflict driving force of the plot- comes from the question, ""How do we hold the heroes accountable for their actions;"" a question posed soon after the massive destruction from the previous Marvel movies, which is answered by Iron Man and Captain America as they head up the two opposing factions attempting to answer that question with their own: ""to accept government oversight... or not.""

Marvel, in my humble opinion, has proved its superiority over DC in the realm of live-action movies for the current generation, posing real world, thought provoking questions such as ""Is security worth sacrificing freedom?"" Particularly in Civil War, where that question is posed to the super heroes who take up a place in the fantastic world of Marvel where they can give security without taking away freedom... or so it seemed, until their actions resulted in the recent destruction of major cities in Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and even Thor, Captain America: Winter Soldier, and Thor.

Though DC posed religious and social questions in Batman V. Superman, whilst simultaneously trying to keep up with Marvel's rigorous pace of pumping out super hero movie after super hero movie as it heads towards the most ultimate of ultimate super hero team-up movies, it cannot compete with Marvel's combination of Quantity AND Quality. In this movie, viewers can enjoy wonderful fight scenes, a near-perfect pace that is only somewhat hindered by having to take what was presumably a 4-hour movie worthy script and editing it into about a 2 hour long movie, and a star-studded cast (as they say) who all have trouble playing well with others on screen, but seem to boast a wonderful collaboration off camera.

The only down-side is that character development is all but removed from the script, for the sake of moving the plot along towards it's wonderful conclusion. This is understandable, however, since Marvel has had all of Phase One and Two to set up the characters.",9

5 September 2016,10 because I couldn't give it 17,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",10

3 May 2016,"Good for one time watch, don't expect too much","Its good enough for a one time watch but its not that great. Too many characters make it look crowded. The story seems clichéd and Captain Americas roles seems prejudiced. Robert Downey Jr is great as usual, Evans also does justice to his role too. Rest of the characters like spidy, ant man, hawk eye appear for one fight scene which was shown in the trailers. Action scenes are well directed which has become a hallmark for Marvel. The movie over all despite its aww and pomph movie lacks the usual Marvel punch. The ending of the movie is very emotional and creates an upset in the Avengers story line. We will see how they follow up this plot twist in the coming infinity wars series. Don't set your bar too high if you want to enjoy the movie.

31 May 2016,Captain America: Civil War (2016),"The bad news is, there are about ten movies going on in ""Captain America: Civil War,"" which is at least seven too many. The good news is, most of them are fun, and there are enough rousing moments to elevate the movie to Marvel's top tier.

Although Thor, the Hulk and other recurring characters have gone missing this time (with somewhat vague explanations for their absence), nobody's going to mistake ""Civil War"" for a chamber piece. Trailers sold this installment as a tale of intra Avengers warfare, set off by the government's demand that Captain America (Chris Evans) allow the arrest of his old friend The Winter Soldier, aka Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), an assassin whose moral compass has been scrambled by brainwashing, so that he can be punished for his presumed role.

There are more than a dozen major characters and another dozen minor ones, including Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland), all running, flying, stomping and blasting through a long, lumpy story inspired by the 2006 Civil War graphic novel arc. Thematically, it's potluck. Like ""Avengers: The Age of Ultron,"" ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and ""Iron Man 3,"" ""Civil War"" is simultaneously about the ramifications of US intervention in a post-9/11 world; the responsibility of private military contractors (which is basically what the Avengers are here) to defer to their government and the United Nations; the question of whether civilian casualties negate the righteousness of a noble mission; the allure and price of vengeance; and individuals' ongoing, never-finished struggles to understand how their pasts drive their present-tense actions. (Several characters confess that they act from compulsion and then find ways to rationalize it.)

There's a fair bit of ""The Dark Knight"" logic, or ""logic,"" to the storytelling. Characters do things to other characters because they know it'll set off a chain reaction that'll eventually lead to a very specific moment at the end; luckily for them, each step goes according to plan, because if it didn't there would be no movie. And, as in the inferior yet thematically similar ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" the hero-versus-hero slug-fest only seems to spring from real and deep philosophical differences. It turns out that the real problem is that these characters don't talk to each other when they should.

All that said, this is a satisfying film that takes its characters but not itself seriously, and mixes sequences of wonder, visual wit and pathos in with the world-building and dramatic housekeeping. Reuniting the Cap creative team of directors Joe and Anthony Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, ""Civil War"" gets better as it goes along, both as an action movie and a sprawling ensemble. I've seen reviews complaining that no character gets enough screen time, but to me the distribution felt just about right. We know a lot about the established characters by now. There's not much this film needs to say about Peter Parker except that he's a lovable wise-ass spider-teen who lives with his Aunt May (51-year old Marisa Tomei, looking more like Aunt February) and has only been slinging web for six months. Nor does this story require much more of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) but that he act starstruck by Tony and Cap and the gang and try too hard. Black Panther, aka T'Challa— subject of an upcoming Ryan Coogler solo movie—is defined by his righteous anger over an injustice perpetrated against his family and his nation, and that's exactly where the character needs to be for this film.

The action is solid, sometimes inspired. The best set piece in ""Winter Soldier,"" Cap taking out a bunch of would-be assassins in an elevator, had a frenzied smallness that was much more exciting than watching heli carriers crash and monuments crumble; it seems to have inspired the better action scenes here—not just a stairwell punch- fest that finds Bucky swinging from a torn-up stretch of railing like Tarzan on a vine, but in a bigger, louder, wilder clash between Avengers (including emergency ringers Spider-Man, Ant-Man and Black Panther) on an airport runway. Although the clichéd hand-held, whipsaw-crazy action still lacks beauty and personality (a problem throughout Marvel's filmography, which has an assembly line quality) it's clean and exact, it makes clever use of the various heroes' powers, it's more comedic than vicious (Buster Keaton and Steven Spielberg are clear influences), and it leaves no doubt about the characters' angles and methods of attack, where they are in relation to one another, and what's at stake.

The script never convincingly squares this film's vision of Cap as a guy who's willing to go it alone against government forces (led by William Hurt's Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross) who want to regulate super-heroic interventions with the Captain America of ""The Winter Soldier,"" who decided he'd rather go against his own government than allow one of its highest ranking military officials to order extrajudicial assassinations. ""We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own,"" Cap tells Tony, a sentiment that could easily have been placed in the mouth of Robert Redford's ""Winter Soldier"" character Alexander Pierce. It's as if Cap is a hypocrite who thinks vigilantism is OK as long as he's the vigilante—which would be a solid point if anyone in this movie raised it.",7

24 April 2018,"Not the worst thing in the world, but not the best","Now, you have to hear me out on this one. The movie was good, I get that, but what was bad about this movie is that it is just a set up for infinity war. yes there were some very good intense battle scenes and it was very exciting to see my favorite heroes battle it out, but there were weak moments that lacked my attention. and then the ending felt kinda empty. No one died, no problem was really resolved, it was just a set up for Infinity war. but, I would watch it again, because it was a good movie and did contain good dramatic elements that I enjoyed, and I look forward to seeing how this plays in Infinity war.

22 May 2016,Civil what?,"Civil war was a good movie but missed out opportunities to make it a great movie. All acting was good, action was good, story was.. OK?

Seriously though, 6v6 is a civil war? This movie had a real villain? This movie was dark? Since when did 12 people fighting become a civil war, marvel should have waited until more characters were introduced so it could actually be a civil war. Crossbones was definitely not the villain, and Baron Zemo was just annoying. Civil war was dark.. some of the episodes on Arrow are darker than Civil War. OK Civil War was pretty dark but they didn't do it right, like they immediately made the tone dark just because a lot of people lost their family.

CA: Civil War was the movie where all the people's family dies so there could actually be a plot. Everything was so rushed it felt like iron man just wanted to have a fight with other avengers for fun.

Still an enjoyable movie though, better than BvS.",7
2 May 2016,BEST Marvel movie ever!,"First of all, this is my first review on this website as I've just joined yesterday. This review won't contain spoilers.

Watched it yesterday, and wow. I'm amazed what I've seen. This was what all I ever wanted in a team-up or/and a fighting-each-other in a superhero movie that both previous Avengers were failed to impress me.

The trailer of this movie gave us so many features, including the new characters such as Black Panther & Spider-Man. But little did we know, it just gave you so little details about the whole story.

The plot is not too simple nor too complex, it's just a perfect fit. It gives so little at first, but reveals so much more later in the 2.5/4 of the movie. They also constructed the storytelling carefully but in a decent pace. Not too much information nor too less. I am pleasant by the head counts in each team, too many superheroes fighting each other would be like swallowing all the good food but not tasting or biting any of it, IMO. (8/10)

If you're just here for the action scenes, you won't regret seeing this, not even after watching it twice. The much anticipated fight scene at the airport is amazing & one of the best fighting scene in a superhero movie to date. You will literally love it! (100/10)

Other than that, the acting is spot-on. The returning casts of course are perfect as they were in the previous MCU films. But let's talk about the new heroes here, Black Panther & Spider-Man

Black Panther/T'Challa plays an important character, and Chadwick Boseman successfully delivers that underdog role. He performs really well despite he has to develop a new accent. And his suit looks badass! Oh and don't worry, this Spider-Man may be the best Spider- Man we've ever seen, finally. Tom Holland did an amazing job at it & made Peter Parker looked so fresh than the previous ones. If you didn't like him, please give him more time, he's still young and learning and just got into the MCU universe. (9/10)

The visual graphics were beautiful which I didn't expect at first! From Ant-Man's ant-size, to Spider-Man's suit. And the last fight, too. ;) (7/10)

Lastly, the soundtrack during the action sequences were low-key EPIC. Especially during the last fight. You'll know what I'm talking about. Kudos to Henry Jackman for producing, yet another stellar soundtracks. (9/10)

==TL;DR==

Plot, storytelling etc. = Better than any other Marvel movies

Action/Cinematography= GOD BLESS THE RUSSO BROS

Spider-Man & Black Panther = Rainbow pukes

Soundtracks = Music to my ears

CGIs = Good but aren't perfect.

In any case, PLEASE SEE IT, EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A MARVEL FAN, OR DON'T WATCH SUPERHEROES MOVIE. YOU WON'T REGRET SPENDING YOUR MONEY ON THIS!

Oh, and #TeamIronMan as always.",9

8 May 2016,"""Like Pymm always said Never Trust a Stark.""","This is my first review so please be kind. Solid film

I just recently saw CA:CW and i will say that it was a pretty solid film as far as Superhero movies go. While i think that this movie was good cinematicly it did not bring anything really new for me. The first half of the film was the usually superhero formula of kicking but. I do like how the make everything tie all together making the avengers look like they were a danger to society, better than BvS with Superman. (Sorry i do not mean to compare the two, i know i sensitive people are with both fan bases. Though i will say there were a lot of similarities) The acting was great, I thought the inclusion of Ant- man and Spider man was a little weak, but it was great to see them. I did think spider man was a little bit annoying though. What was missing for me is the stakes were not high, there needed to be something that was lost but, i will buy what they did with the film anyway. The film really got my attention when the third act took place. No Spoilers.

Acting was great as usual, the shaky cam sucked when they were fighting. Spider mans aunt was weird, cause she was attractive, but hey its something new. It was also weird that Cap got with Peggy's niece. I guess i he likes to keep it in the family. And i wish the inclusion of the bad guy was a little stronger, i was confused and who was who cause they all kind of had similar characteristics. I know that marvel and superhero fans will love this movie and consider it great as they will, whatever film marvel releases, but it was not the best marvel movie. It also didn't really feel like a Cap movie, it felt like a miniature avengers movie.",7

5 May 2016,Best Marvel Film in Existence,"When most people (including me) see that Marvel symbol come up, they know they are in for a treat! This movies is fantastic! The Russo Brothers (who directed Winter Soldier) did a great job with the action scenes and made them look fantastic! The film also had the perfect balance of Action & Comedy (which we have grown to love from Marvel). One thing I was hesitant about going in was Tom Holland as Spider-Man, but he absolutely killed it! He is the best on-screen Spidey to date and everyone will absolutely love him! Another character that was introduced was Black Panther (played by Chadwick Boseman) who did an amazing job as well. I have loved all of the great portrayals of Icons that he has done, and he definitely hit a home-run with this character as well. Go see this weekend as soon as you can, so you can see the best Marvel movie in existence!

4 September 2016,This is just good film-making,"A lot of people hate superhero movies for it's commercial nature, and they're just made to squeeze money of our pockets. I was one of those people, but this movie gave me a new perspective on the subject matter. It's true that a lot of these movies are just hyped up to make a lot of money for the studios and they don't do anything worthwhile cinema-wise. But with this movie, it's not. Sure it made a gigantic amount of money, but it was a well made film. Of course, unless you haven't seen a lot of good movies, the plot of this film is pretty meh, but the action is incredibly well made. You can feel that the directors put very much thought into every shots, there are some very clever editing moments, the actors and stunt men practiced hard for the choreography, a lot of scenes are done for real then combine with CGI so they look very real, especially the fights with captain America, Buck, and black panther. This is an all out action film, and it delivers, and much more if you're an action fan like me. It's so rare these days for filmmakers to make a good action film. And yeah they do try to set up later movies for spider man and black panther, but at least they put some thought into it, and they don't try to do too much, unlike Batman V Superman, god that movie was ""booooooring"" ( said in Scott Pilgrim's voice ). So if you want to have a good time, pleasure your eyes with actual good action, action that is well thought out, and well practiced and well shot, not just scenes of some stuff blowing up, give this a watch, throw the whole superhero movie thing out the window, this down to it's core is just an action movie, and it will deliver.",7
3 May 2016,Who stole the show.,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

13 April 2020,Awesome and truly appreciated movie,"First off I used to be the person who watched movies like Braveheart or Goodfellas and never was into Marvel's except Wolverine and Spider-Man. However, I gave it a chance and do not regret it at all. I really enjoy Marvel's now. I always liked Captain America and really enjoyed the first avenger even more than any single super hero like Ironman, Hulk or Thor. The return of the first avenger is even better but this Civil War is great and I really enjoy it. However, it is slightly less as enjoyable to me than the other two captain america movies. The reason more due to Ironman and the producers Kevin Feige who seems to have an affinity with Germany and Europe. He implements a lot of unnecessary and ridiculous commercials for Audi a German automobile manufacturer and for Europe itself. Ironman tells Spider-Man how great Germany is or he would enjoy Paris. Well, Ironman is supposed to be an American super hero and Marvel's are American productions so why not implement Chrysler or something like that to foster American automobile manufacturers. European dislike America and I was born and raised in Germany so I know that besides the beer and a little vacation Germany sucks. So does Paris who is more an Arabic style city than anything else. Kevin Feige is trying to implement this multinational diversity perspective that America is not as good but others are. Germany even had to scrap the name captain america of the title so people would go to the theater. After bad revenue and critics of the captain america the first avenger they realized that they need to change the title to the return of the avenger- winter soldier and civil war. So why are they hyping Europe? This is my only critic which keeps getting annoying. Other than that awesome flick",9
8 July 2017,I love the introduction of the new characters,"The introduction of spider-man and black panther was so awesome!The only thing I didn't like was baron zemo.I loved the story and the characters.Ant man and spidey was the best in my opinion.The black panther chase scene was incredible.All the actors acting good. The post-credit scenes gave us a hint about the upcoming mcu movies.The scene where zemo and black panther talks was good.The fight between cap,bucky and tony was amazing. The stan lee cameo was okay.The movie was not the best in the mcu but it was good

24 February 2023,"A great movie, but I have 2 big complaints.","I'll address what I consider is excellent about this movie before I share my criticisms. I do not consider this film bad, I am simply addressing these critcisms as they aren't pointed out much.

The characters in this film feel very real, and the overall conflict is quite compelling, to put it mildly. Zemo is a fantastic antagonist; it feels unique from your typical superhero movie and is quite realistic by MCU standards.

There are, however, two aspects of this movie which I don't enjoy.

1. The Humor.

The humor in this movie is unbelievably terrible, especially in the airport scene. It seems like it was written for young children, but a small child wouldn't really appreciate this film as much as other Marvel films.

2. The Sudden Action Scenes.

The action sequences in this film are definitely entertaining, but at times they seem to happen only to keep the kids watching from getting bored.

Overall, if you are knowledgeable enough with the Avengers and everything else, I still recommend seeing this movie.",8

21 June 2020,Underrated,"One of the three best in the series!! If we take infinity war and endgame as one. Ages of alteon is the second and then comes civil war. Don't know why it's under 8. Thi final fight is great. Mass fight wasn't as good as it's wanted to be, but you still enjoy watching them beating each other... lots of marvel jokes, great job as always. It's 9 for me, but I give ten to raise ratings

3 May 2016,"A good movie, just not sure if its a good superhero movie.","OK, let me start by saying i actually really liked this movie, is an awesome flick. Having said that it falls short of being the epic, awesome, mind-blowing movie i thought it would be, and in know the reason, the Russos didn't try that hard to make this a great superhero movie, they just wanted to make a great movie, and I'm not sure if it works.

First, and what is actually my biggest complaint is the cinematography, the sometimes overused shaky cam along with the super dull color grading made this for a totally awful to look at movie. And it wasn't dark in a way it looked cool and let the primaries pop, it was just dull, and come on, this is a superhero movie, you can't just take the color way from it. Just look at Age of Ultron, the cinematography in that movie felt grand and epic, as the dark though not dull color palette allowed to the super colorful suits of our heroes to shine. The only scene i thought did look decent was the airport battle, and even that didn't look as mind-blowing as it should have. Im actually concerned for Infinity war, since the context of that movie would totally need epic cinematography along with super colorful grade.

OK, second, and just as concerning is the soundtrack... dude i had never heard such a forgettable soundtrack in a mare movie. i would only be able do describe it with the same word of the cinematography... dull.

Another big problem i had, and probably is an effect of the last two points is how short of epic the movie felt as a whole. The avengers never felt so small as in this movie. Even tho we had a bunch of locations you still felt like everything was happening in the same block. That bothered me as hell.

Having said all of that, don't misunderstand me. If this wasn't the SUPERHERO movie had been waiting for like my whole life i would have probably liked it better. I mean the acting is fantastic, the plot is cool, and it has a lot of emotional weight. Is also has a lot of enjoyable moments and some pretty good humor, especially in ant-man and falcon moments. The characters are super interesting and the new ones are fantastic and I'm looking so forward this characters. Seeing spider man for the first time in the MCU was an almost religious experience and black panther is one of the most bad ass, cool characters in the MCU. Dialog is amazing and is amazingly deep. And the final battle was stunning. I'll say it again, it is an awesome movie, just not an awesome superhero movie, not even close to the awesomeness of the Avengers.

Finally i would like to ask the Russos to try harder for Infinity war, and especially in the production aspects of the film, try as hard as you can to make it feel as epic as the conclusion of all the MCU deserves.",

6 April 2017,I guess it helps if you were into the comics,"Nothing really stood out for me while watching Civil War. Of course you have your neat action scenes and some enjoyable actors, but I have no interest in ever seeing it again. Maybe if I were into the comics or had watched the prequels it would have helped me with character development.So if you are content to watch one fun and expensive action scene after another, this is probably a good pick. I must be getting old. This is the first I can ever recall Aunt May being hot. Oh man do I miss the forums on here. Please bring them back!

10 September 2016,A not so marvelous marvel from MARVEL,"The best part of a marvel movie is that they always save it for the end. And when it comes to AVENGERS they make sure that you remain bound to your seats. If you really think you know the story after watching the trailer, my friend you need to learn to stop judging a book by its cover. Once you come to believing that the movie is about to end, from there starts the actual part, and the entire movie takes a turn. But you need to wait till the end. The first half seems to be wasted. Also they should have kept a few things for a surprise. It would have added more beauty to the movie. I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com. It not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch the movie online.. Highly recommended.

9 October 2017,My Favorite Movie,"I just keep watching it over and over again, its never enough, its the main reason I decided to watch all MCU movies.

This movie hardly calms down, it puts you in a series of great action and fighting scenes from the beginning with fantastic effects that keeps you entertained, it combines a group of likable actors in a beautiful and exciting environment, story wise, I think it totally makes sense, it gives very convincing reasons for conflicts.

Hats off Marvel, Please make a dozen of movies like this and I will happily enjoy watching them.

10 November 2021,Worst marvel movie,"I'm not the biggest marvel fan but do enjoy some of their movies like the iron man movies and Thor 2. And I guess you can't expect much from them giving it's only action and little good plot (for the most part) and a lot of bad fight lines but I have to say this is by far the worst one. Everything just felt unnecessary, the whole movie seemed to be just to fill out and set up for other marvel movies in the future. None of the avengers decisions in this movie makes sense and just makes you irritated; if you liked Captain America before get ready to absolutely hate him. Have I never seen how annoying he is or is this just a terrible movie? Who knows. The only reasonable person in this movie is Iron Man. Do not watch this movie if you are not a Marvel super fan and can see past it's obvious flaws. Otherwise: read a synopsis and get to the other ones.

18 July 2016,Captain America: Civil War Review,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",9
29 April 2016,The Most Epic Marvel's Movie But....Not The Best,"PROS:

-Black Panther -Action scenes -Fights choreography -First 20 minutes -A conflict well raised -Downey and Evans performs -Peter Parker (all of him) / Spiderman (eyes, attitude and fighting style) -Falcon -Deepening of characters like Wanda, Vision, Falcon -Final Fight ...just brutal -A bit more polished jokes (sometimes) -Comic references

CONS:

-Ant Man (Not him, since he delivers very good funny scenes and an epic scene) but it feels that he was wasted in the film and the way he was integrated into The Avengers has no sense. -Out of place jokes -No deepening in Steve Rogers -Steve and Sharon Carter romance, had not sense, literally -Bucky as the emotional conflict cause -Spiderman (his costume concept is great but not the material, nor the CGI, I wouldn't surprised if in Spiderman Home Coming we see him with a different costume) -The lack of providing a real motivation to the characters to want TO BE INVOLVED a WAR - ""WAR"" in the title is way too big but the comic essence remains -This movie should be: ""Avengers: CIVIL WAR"" and not ""Captain America: CIVIL WAR"" since there are times where the Captain is a hindrance in his own movie -Film is too long with no reason.

The movie is good but those critics about it's ""the best superhero movie"" or ""Superb!"" or ""Perfect!"" well, it's too much and an exaggeration. It's good, but a bit disappointed in certain aspects, though I really went to the cinema with a fan mind and frankly I'll always keep this 2016 in my memory as the year of polemical movies but I was left more than satisfied :)",8

30 April 2016,Mixed Emotions,"I have high expectations. I expected it to be better than BVS as all of the people are saying. But its not!, overall it feels like an ads of an upcoming Spiderman and Avengers movie.

I love the scene where Spiderman appears that's time people on theaters began to react/laugh up to airport scene. It's really the best scene (airport scene) in history.

But, there's a big but. Before and after that scene there's nothing. Is more of an okay. Although I love black panther so there's something I guess. Maybe I expected it too much and disappointed in the end. I should have watch it on DVD instead.

7/10 because it doesn't have a good twist and ending.

28 September 2016,Excellent movie,"Marvel has seriously outdone themselves once again. Civil War is a near-flawless cinematic experience that neatly packages one of the most pivotal story lines in comic book history. As for what Marvel has up its sleeve before 2018's release of Avengers: Infinity Wars, is anyone's guess. But I assure you it's in good hands. The same directors and writers behind Civil War are piecing together the next Avengers and if this movie is any indication, it's going to be fantastic, if not a satisfying conclusion to decades of story building.

At the root of that is Civil War's greatest strength – and the reason it makes all thought of the recent Batman v Superman debacle evaporate on contact. The Russos' film has an unshakeable faith in these decades-old characters: they're not wrangled into standing for anything other than who they are, with no gloss or reinterpretation or reach for epic significance required. This is the cinematic superhero showdown you've dreamt of since childhood, precisely because that's everything – and all – it wants to be.",10
15 December 2017,The perfect example of a good superheroes movie,"One of the best superheroes movies , in the same category with the Winter Soldier , excellent from action to funny scenes it has everything a blockbuster should have it was great to watch it.

1 May 2016,It is a good movie with quite some flaws at the first half.,"There's many flaws that added up during the first half of the movie, but the second half really made up for it. Adding more several new main characters in a sequel can be a hard thing, and there's quite a lot of plot-armor for the main characters and a few plot holes. However the second half wasn't flawless, but it was an incredible experience to watch that part. If i could rate the first half and second half individually i would rate the first 3/10 and second 8/10, but overall it was a nice experience that could arguably be 6/10. However I'm setting the score on 7. The final score might be what it is because i am slightly biased.

23 May 2016,You must see it to believe,"Why are people giving so many negative reviews? Its a goddamn amazing movie. Captain America: Civil War fulfills the war part that has been in play since 2008's Iron Man. Seeing Spider-Man in the MCU was worth it. Its the best portrayal of the character. Robert Downey Jr. gives one of his best performances as the Iron Man. Black Panther, Ant-man, Captain America to name a few gave an amazing performance too. The movie is about politics, friendship, retribution and teamwork. It is fun, fierce, thrilling and simply breath-taking. More importantly it teaches us one good lesson: ""United we stand, Divide we fall."" Words aren't enough to describe how great this movie is. It must be seen to be believed. Another great aspect of the film was the villain -- Baron Zemo. Wow. He stands as one of the best villains in MCU history besides Loki. Despite being a lengthy film clocking at about 2hr26mins, it doesn't give a chance to feel bored. Without giving away too much, the 'Airport scene' in the movie is one of the greatest-epic-amazing-mind-blowing fight scene in the history of superhero movie. But I still miss Quicksilver. Watching some scene at slow-motion Quicksilver kicking some butt would've been awesome. Nevertheless, Captain America: Civil War is truly an epic film. You must see it. 10/10 (Amazing!)",10
24 May 2016,It was nice . very nice better than BvS,"2016 Is a very promising year. this movie this great everything about it. the special effects, the heroes got enough screen time each respectively. ANTMAN was awesome as usual, spider man kicked ass( captain America ass) hawk eye did something new with his bow and well vision.....remains vision, just watch it Fm. it is amazing. it is true all the captain America movies keep getting better. seriously i need to write more lines in this review so... i love Black panther. black widow is still hot, Wanda Wanda Nigeria Nigeria. I'm sad there are no more iron man movies because Robert Downy is so funny. I'm starting to like war machine too.

9 January 2017,scarlett,"After Winter Soldier I was under the (apparently mistaken) belief that Marvel's Capt. America franchise was criticising neoliberal America. There was all that stuff about the ends not justifying the means and about how politicians use terror to convince the population they need to be oppressed for their own good. How wrong could I be! Now I see that it's actually the opposite. It pretends to be anti-establishment but really it's just about justifying a sense of self-entitlement. Like Donald Trump, Capt. America criticises the State for oppressing people whilst simultaneously adhering to exactly the sort of high-handed moral superiority that inevitably leads to that oppression.Btw, Scarlett is awesome,you can see this http://www.haberligunler.com/scarlett- johansson-2016-yilinda-en-cok-kazanan-oldu-7379-haber . He (I mean Capt. America) obviously skipped school on the day they taught the importance of checks-and-balances and why one of the central principles of US Democracy is that of the separation of powers.

5 May 2016,"Good movie, but the registration act was way played down.","I think this turned out to be a good movie. Though there is one big gripe that I have with it that I will return too.

There is a lot of talking in the movie but the set pieces and battle scenes make up for it. The introduction of Black Panther and Spider-Man is really nice and the recurring characters are fun to watch as always. The end part upped the stakes and I think the ending was nice.

My big gripe with the movie is the accord/registration act. In the movie it's only applied to the Avengers vs the comics where EVERY super powered person in the Marvel universe on Earth, has to register and give their real name to the state. I understand due to budget reasons that this isn't possible to show, but the stakes get so much toned down compared to the comics.

Overall, good movie and I'm looking forward to see Dr Strange.",8
12 May 2016,"funny in a serous way, good move.","Twist and turns that kept you interested. You will be wondering what's going to happen next. Classic Marvel action scenes which were serious and funny at the same time. One thumb up and one thumb down on character development. But really good movie make sure you go watch it. Like I said the action scenes were so good and so enjoyable. definitely family friendly so bring the whole family. There are many laughs while you watch this movie but not so much that it's like a comedy(which is a good thing). This is a long movie but in a good way, it doesn't really drag out any thing. I hope you enjoy this movie and the popcorn with white cheddar topping(its so darn good). which side are you on..........

8 May 2016,"The best Marvel movie in forever, a true Superhero film","Hands down, this is now my favorite Marvel movie. Marvel has always been my favorite type of comic, and when I saw this I was blown away. Great acting, which is always important, amazing plot, mind blowing action, and very funny. Great characters. I. I loved everything about this movie, it was absolutely flawless and worth the money to see. If you love superheros, comedy, action, this you'll love this. I recommend it 100% you wouldn't regret seeing this movie. This is an actual superhero movie and Marvel needs to do more like this, because if there were more Superhero movies like this I would do anything to watch it. It's absolutely amazing.

31 May 2016,The Greatest Superhero Movie and one of my favorites.,"Captain America: Civil War is the greatest superhero movie, it was Spectacular, Epic, and had the greatest superhero moments. Captain America: Civil War was Outstanding, it focuses on each hero and gives them enough screen time to make us want to love this movie. Captain America was now considered my favorite hero because he stood up to the government and fought for the rights of every hero. Black Panther was awesome in each scene and made me feel sorry for his fathers death. I thought the villain was a very manipulative and clever getting the avengers to fight each other and framed Bucky Barnes for the murder that made Black Panther join the fight. Captain America: Civil War had great humor, incredible acting, interesting plot, and wonderful action. The movie to me was considered the most ANTICIPATING movie and the GREATEST Superhero movie ever.

1 May 2016,Well done. If only selling was not more important than respecting the audience.,"The movie is great, it's at same level as an Avengers movie, really cool. I was enjoying it fully, until guess what... WORST SPIDER-MAN EVERRR! Andy Garfield, we miss you. This Spider-Man has no appeal as Peter Parker, the costume is ugly, and adds ZERO elements to the plot. They could have included any other Marvel's character, instead, like Wasp or Spider-Woman. But no, they had to trash a previous saga that was going great to insert Spider-Man to the Avengers (another bad move, by SONY). With all and all, the movie is neat and full of action. I want to see it again, it's worth it. Kudos for Black Panther, Vision, Scarlett Witch and Falcon.

20 December 2018,Too contrived,"Civil War is this. Throwaway villain convicts a convoluted, illogical plot of vengeance that turns the Avengers against each other that they still fall for, even going against their established behaviors to do so. The Avengers have epic fights and new heroes are introduced. The end.

Honestly, if you've read the summary then you can skip the movie. It's contrived and illogical. Watch clips of the fights on YouTube if you want. This film has little value elsewhere. The Avengers reunite the next movie.

16 July 2016,A Team Divided,"Captain America: Civil War is a comic based movie (for those who don't know) and is the third installment in the Captain America. Released in 2016, grossing over $406 million in the United States alone (placing it in the #2 spot for 2016. When I review movies, I like to break it up into different categories, discuss them, and then wrap it up in a conclusion.

Story: I don't like to spoil movies often (especially Marvel releases), so I'm just going to talk about the continuity of the plot. Being that this is a sequel, it could be a little to follow the storyline if you haven't seen the previous installments (or read the comics), but I feel like the story is relatively simple and most audiences can catch on. Being that Captain America (as well as over half of other Marvel characters) are ultimately owned by Disney, it's interesting to see a grittier and darker film. I personally liked the vibe that was given off of the film. This movie was more than a slug-it-out film like Thor or even Iron Man and offers significant material that puts you in a place where you think and relate to the characters and their struggles. There were very few plot holes in the plot, but one thing that did bother me is that some of the newer characters that were introduced had shallow backgrounds and (if you don't follow the Marvel Cinematic Universe or comics) could make you wonder why they are even there. 8/10 Characters: Most of the MCU characters from previous installments are back with the addition of some other characters like the Black Panther and Spider-Man. When there is multiple significant characters in one movie it is easy for characters to get sidelined, but ""Captain"" does a good job of this. I probably should have mentioned this is the story category, but while I'm on the topic of characters, I feel like the title didn't really fit the movie. It doesn't really feel like a Captain America film, it feels more like an Avengers 2.5. Anyways, the established characters show some growth and the new additions are very entertaining and add to the film in many different ways. I'm just going to say that I'm not even sure who the villain is in the movie, it feels to me that it is a matter of interpretation. 8.5/10 Action: Marvel Studios always does a good job when shooting action scenes and ""Civil War"" is no different. I really enjoyed how the characters' powers were incorporated into their fighting style and the film definitely offered some memorable moments that will not be forgotten. With a strong combination of choreographed and CGI fight scenes, the movie has a very strong visual appeal. 9/10 Special Effects: As I mentioned briefly in the previous category, the overall special effects in the film are pretty solid, but I really don't know what to say when I saw Spider-Man's costume on the screen. The whole thing looks like a glossed over, CGI mess and to me became very distracting and looked really out of place. Being that the rights for Spider-Man were acquired shortly before shooting for the film started, it's understandable ... not really. Hopefully Spidey's suit will look better in his upcoming solo film ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"". 8/10 Conclusion: I honestly believe that this is one of the better films in the MCU, and definitely the best of the Captain America installments. I give this movie an 8/10. If you haven't seen the previous Captain America movies I recommend you watch them (except for the first movie. It wasn't that good, but it is important for his back story) and then wrap it up with ""Civil War"". Highly recommended.",8

30 June 2016,Love the movie,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",
12 May 2016,best of the lot so far !!!,"First thing first Civil War can be dubbed as Avengers: 2.5 ! Though I would rate Civil War several notches above the Avengers due to its sheer brilliance.The casting is spot on, the movie seems slow at the start, but that is because Marvel let the audience to build characters in their mind and that is the best part unlike DC wherein things are hanging mid somewhere !

You can actually relate to the difference of opinions on part of Captain & Iron Man and they are ably justified. RDJ is shown a dialed down version of himself & rightly so as its a Captain America flick after all ! Chris Evans is rock solid as Captain America and the bulging biceps as shown in iconic chopper scene is sure to give some new biceps workout vows ;)

Elizabeth Olsen is almost there with Scarlet Johnson upping the hotness quotient & soothes the eyes. Ant Nan, Black Panther & Spider Man make interesting debut to the team but it is the Spider Man who steals the show irrespective of his hardly 15 Min screen time, in fact he should be a permanent member of the Avengers team in Infinity Wars 1 & 2 !

The showdown sequence at the Airport is just mind boggling and they have done that without vaporizing out whole cities & crashing down buildings unlike Avengers:2, that is when you realise that this movie does make a lot of sense.

P.S: Watch out for Stan Lee's ""stank"" cameo & sit through end credits for a concluding scene ;)",9

3 June 2016,One of the best movies of 2016,"This movie is one of a kind, this is probably the best superhero film i have ever seen. Many Superhero fans have been waiting a very long time for this movie, and it delivered what it promised, just from the name it will get you interested, the style of the movie is intriguing itself. This movie is about Captain America (Chris Evans) wanting to help his friend Bucky (Sebastian Stan), even if it means crossing the law. The way they introduced Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Crossbones(Frank Grillo) was amazing and fights between superheroes are not seen very often and i would always recommend watching this movie, but what makes this movie so great? let me tell you, this is my opinion why this movie is awesome. So the movie starts off with with a great introduction. The introduction is followed by an awesome fight with Crossbones, i wasn't expecting much from him, but overall they started it the best they could. Soon after that Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr) is introduced and wants to stop the Avengers from doing what ever they want and wants them to abide to the law, because the destruction and deaths of innocent lives. Captain America, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) don't agree and think what Iron Man is doing is wrong. They go against each other, with Vision (Paul Bettany), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Panther, Spider Man (Tom Holland) with Iron Man's statement that being able to do anything as a superhero is wrong and dangerous.

I found myself at the edge of my seat by the time this movie ended, like most other movies. This movie is worth watching! easily one of the best movies of 2016, I hope you found my review helpful. Remember this is just my opinion.",8
21 May 2016,An Superhero Masterpiece,"Captain America Civil War is the first crossover marvel if you do not count the avengers. The story is one of the best marvel themed story ever captain America and iron man make the story so good. The acting is amazing with Chris Evans very good acting and is not over the top. The fight scenes have other marvel hero such as Ant man, Spider man, and a lot more. The shots in the movie look real life thank too directing the film. Almost every thing in the film is amazing. Some of the best screenplay ever in marvel it is that good. The music score sounds pretty good but not the best marvel music ever. Overall this is one of the best marvel superhero movies ever.

29 May 2016,A great solid Film,"After the big success of Captain America the Winter Soldier, you you obviously expect Captain America Civil war to be at least of the same level ! It is more than that ! It surpassed it ! Great plot , solid scenario , unexpected outcomes , tensions between heroes , no way for easy ending. There even was some comedy with the introduction of Spiderman . It was needed seeing the serious tone of the movie !The only catch with that film for me , was the 3D treatment , it sucked ! If you watch it in 2D it's already good .I was literrally stuck to the screen the during the whole film ! Now i can't wait to have it on blu ray to shake the walls of my house ! Go watch it , have a great time

28 April 2016,Best Avengers Movie,"With the best introduction to the Spider Man character on the screen, this movie is well written and with great production.

Stark and Rogers's contender makes you believe in a civil war within the heroes, because the two are greatly portrayed, as never before in any movie on the MCU.

A lot of fun also, with all the avengers bonding very well in the two teams, along with a great Black Panther character.

This film proves how far from Marvel Studios is DC/Warner, in terms of fun, and the whole universe created.

Just waiting for more of these Black Panther and Spider Man.

And this Steve Rogers is how Clark Kent should be in the movies.",9
15 May 2016,"Lots of Action, Too many sub plots, Great but over-hyped","There are a lot of intense action scenes but they are not as detailed, unique, and intriguing as they are being praised for. To elaborate, the fight scenes seemed to be fairly average hand to hand combat that gave me the impression that I had seen all those sequence of moves done before on the big screen. In other words seen one seen them all. After a few days of processing my thoughts about the movie I came to the conclusion that many characters were not even necessary and could have been omitted all together along with their side story/sub plots. For example, the Vision, Ant-Man, Spider Man, and (dont kill me, hear me out) Black Panther all could have been left out of this movie and we would probably love it the same. Don't get me wrong they were all awesome in their own way yet they were also somewhat insignificant to the main plot that they could of all been introduced right before the main fight scene, like Spidey, to do their dirt really. The business side of this movie was evident that they just wanted more characters to push box office sales. Introducing black panther felt very ""thrown in there"" like. There was no mystery to it, just a ""hey, oh yeah Im now the King of Wakanda and Black Panther everyone."" I think his inaugural debut should have been an origin story seeing as though he is a lesser known hero in the MCU. Vision being in the movie made was a dud. He is far more powerful than he is made out and extremely under utilized when it comes to major threats against his allies, smh, and he misses his target like he isn't an advanced technological superhero. Did Iron Man really need to recruit a 16 year old to help out. Like where was MARK 50-100 right!? I could go on and on about unnecessary characters so back to the story. It was all over the place and you can tell that they picked and pulled from different decades of the original comics to make the story work for the movie, in which there isn't really a super villain....Zemo. It was like the Mandarin all over again in my opinion. That has to be the biggest upset in the story of all. Idk...I give it 2 star for almost staying true in effort and 4 for good action.",6
1 May 2016,"good film, not great","I went to a first showing at my local Imax, and as with all first showings the atmosphere was good as always. Thing is with all Marvel movies now is that there isn't very much you haven't seen before. Unlike batman vs Superman this movie introduces new characters in a easily accessible way to non fans. That being said there is very little else i can say that hasn't been done in every other Marvel film to date. Except in the last 2 minutes of the final battle i felt no character was in any danger at all. Its like WWE, you know everything will be OK in the end. Both leads are brilliant as always the supporting cast was brilliant and the new comers were very good. I cant seem to shake this feeling of I've seen it all before and the knowledge that Disney is hyping this into a masterpiece when its just a rehash of a rehash. To avoid spoilers its limiting me to what i can say all i can say is its standard Marvel, forgettable villain,lots of mid fight quips and no sense of danger at all. Considering the story its based off i expected more, like Age of Ultron its the story but no peril. Is it better than AoU for sure, but i don't agree with the 5 star reviews its nothing you haven't seen before but still enjoyable.",7
25 May 2017,Best Marvel Movie Ever for 2016,"Civil War is truly one of a kind. 5/5 Stars. 100% flawless in my books. Need to see more classics like these. It's full of action, adventure humor, superb story-line and has an awesome twist. The best part of this movie is seeing the majority of the Marvel Crime Fighting Heroes kicking ass and ""DUKING IT OUT"" against each other. Reminds me of Super Smash Brothers for Nintendo. SWEEEEEETT!!!!

25 May 2016,"Mind-bogglingly astonishing, fun and sad.","The Captain America movie franchise has come a long way. Ever since Winter Soldier, when you first notice a change in the delivery pattern. It was now Cap 2.0. The actions were how you would imagine a superhuman would fight. With Civil War, it maintained that same tone and vigor. It was a fun ride to get hyped together with the internet with those memes speculating on how the war would broke out between Cap and Iron Man and when you finally get to hear the real reason on screen, I was like ""Ohh, okay... I am feeling this"". You understand what those characters were defending, it was not just out of greed, pride or for their personal gain but from what they, as their own experience and sense of honour and justice feel and they hold on to that and thus the dispute. Black Panther was so good. While watching the movie with my brother, I keep telling him ""Oh man, can you believe this, that's Black Panther, that's him, they nailed it"". He was my absolutely favourite. Chadwick Boseman was phenomenally perfect in that role, marvelous casting there. And coming to Spiderman, I know a lot of people out there said this before and I will say it as well, 'BEST SPIDERMAN EVER!'. He was great. The humour was there, the spider-man persona was well captured and executed.

Well yeah, in the end. It's a Russo brother movie, it's great. It's amazing!",8
9 May 2016,War breaks out but is it at all civil (possible spoilers),"I will start this off by saying the last two comic book movies that have come out B v. S and Deadpool have disappointed me.Now with that being said lets move onto this one. I have always liked the Captain America movies I think they are the true crown jewel to the MCU (Marvel Comic or character Universe).

Chris Evans does a great job playing the patriotic yet humble Steve ""Captain America"" Rogers. While we get Robert Downey Jr. back as the egotist Tony Stark.I do not feel that Tony Stark added to much to this film it seems like his snide and ego just get bigger and bigger. He never learns anything about being the douche he is. But, some of the best things that happen in this film are the introduction of T'Challa a.k.a Black Panther I was very excited to see him on the screen this being a character that goes back to my youth.I thought he was treated respect and how wrote and treated the character.

I really do not want to say to much about this movie because I want you to discover it for yourself",9

And Robert Downey Jr. was funny and cool this movie feel sad for him. I give this movie A+ and I buy on blue-ray

12 May 2016,Fight,"This film was fun. Now, I know that doesn't sound amazing. And it's not. It's not amazing. There are flaws. Plenty of flaws. But you know what else there is? Fighting. A lot of fighting. Way too much maybe, I mean damn. You got... you got Spiderman, right? Spiderman's hanging off War Machine and... and then Ant-Man goes giant or whatever and... like... um... Black Panther, y'know? He stabs people and jumps from car to car... and the Winter Soldier, like, gets on a motorcycle while it's going... and Captain America holds a helicopter... and... and... yeah. God, this film was fun. Of course, the fun factor can only get you thus far. I mean, sure, it was well written (dialogue wise), well choreographed and it had Spiderman flying around Giant Man like-- sorry, sorry, got a bit excited there. Alright, so... what does this film do wrong? Well, it has a lot to juggle. You got way too many characters, way too many plot points and it gets weird. It does the best it can with the 56+ characters it has, introduces a new villain, and has a big manly testosterone man fight. And the intro sequence is very fun, too. But some of the characters feel off, considering the dark tone of the film, which, by the way, was WAAAAY better than Batman V. Superman (Aaaaand there's the obligatory jab at Batman V. Superman), characters like Ant-Man. Why in the hell does Ant-Man join Cap's team? Why does Iron-Man need Spidey for? He's got Vision in his team. Goddamn Vision, dude, the guy can fly, shoot lasers and go through walls. And maybe read minds, I'm not sure. And there's the villain, which comic readers will immediately recognize, but they seem underdeveloped to any casual moviegoer. Because they are. There really wasn't much time devoted to them with all the stuff going on. Hell, there wasn't even a big bad fight scene. Besides Loki (who wasn't that great in the first place) the Marvel movie villains haven't been that great. Most of them were guys in a business suit (Iron Man 1, 2, 3, Winter Soldier, Ant Man) and Ultron, who was pretty stupid as well. The big point of this film, the reason behind the ""Civil War"" (odd way of saying it, they kick each other in the face for fifteen minutes. Kinda like how the Age Of Ultron lasted like, what, a week? A couple of days?) is this discussion. Or at least, that's what they lead you to believe in the trailers. No, the reason why they fight is much different, the Hero Registration Act or whatever it's called kinda stays in the background. And there is a lot to discuss there. Stark says the Avengers need to be put in check. And they do. They can't just run around like they own the world. However, had the Avengers not been there the last three times, way more people would've died. It's an annoying discussion. The characters fighting feels rushed, too. Maybe if they sat down and talked it out they'd fix it in 20 minutes. Without broken bones. Especially in the final fight. Also, is the Winter Soldier really compelling enough to make two movies focusing on him? Overall, the good outweighed the bad. There was still bad in there, don't get me wrong, but I'm not grouchy enough to let that get in the way of Black Widow kicking people in the balls. Black Panther for life, by the way.",7
6 May 2016,Age of ultron had to happen for civil war..,"I was a bit disappointed by age of ultron..but I think it laid a good foundation for the Civil war.. The movie is one of the best movies I have seen.. The action was brilliant. The emotional scenes had depth and overall we can see each character getting developed. It had some really funny scenes as well which balanced out the pace well. There are some really cool stuffs which made me and close to 200 other audience members scream and we all stood up and clapped at the end.. Even though there were lot of superheroes it never felt a crowd. Each had there own stories and every single character had some interaction with captain America. brace yourselves Spider man is coming....

21 May 2016,Awesome Movie!! Best in the MCU till now..,"This is the best MCU movie till now along with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It is difficult to pull off this kind of movie as it has so many characters. But the Russo Brothers did it! The story is very good. It keeps the essence of the comic book story line but makes the necessary changes to it. In the comic book story it was easier to pick a side as Iron Man was almost shown as a villain. Here it is not the case. We see both sides of the argument in a very meaningful way. So even though I was #TeamCap I could see Iron Man's point of view and understand where he is coming from. It is true for every character. There are so many characters but every character gets their moment to shine in the movie. The movie is mostly serious in tone but there are many humorous moments as well and all of them are done brilliantly. Spider Man is finally in the MCU! And he is great. His scenes are amazing and are among the several high points of the movie. The other big character introduced is Black Panther and he is awesome in the movie. Black Panther has his own story in the film which connects brilliantly with the main story. He is definitely one of the highlights of the movie.The villain is pretty good and brilliantly portrayed by Daniel Bruhl.

Coming to the acting, Chris Evans as Captain America and Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man are amazing. The scenes between them are terrific. The other highlights are Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spiderman. Both of them nailed their roles. Scarlett Johanson is great as Black Widow. Paul Rudd as Ant Man is amazing and steals the show in his scenes even though he had little screen time. I could keep going about the acting so I will just say everyone else is also great in their roles. The action scenes are outstanding. Everybody is talking about the Airport scene which is off course amazing and maybe the best action scene in comic book movie history. But all the other action scenes and sequences are also superb.

Are there any negatives? Not much for me. The only negative I can point out is that the people who have not seen any other MCU movie before may get a little lost sometimes and may not like it as much as those who have seen the previous movies. The two movies which are particularly important are Captain America The Winter Soldier and Avengers Age of Ultron. I would suggest seeing these two movies before watching this movie.

I have seen all the previous movies(some of them multiple times) so I had a great time watching this as I was invested in all the characters and could feel the emotional tension. So overall this movie has a great mix of Action, Humor and Drama and is one of the best superhero movies of all time and easily the best of this year till now.",9

14 August 2016,WAYYYYY better than Deadpool. Best of the MCU.,"I'm more of a DC fan, but this movie had me excited and pumped for most of the way. I hated Avengers, Iron Man, Thor, (and their unnecessary sequels) Marvel has shined in Guardians of the Galaxy, and these Captain America movies.

Its gritty action, and good story was very well done. The acting for most of the characters was well done. But it still suffers from all of the characters being slated for more movies until 2033. So the stakes are lost. And they still unnecessarily shoehorn unfunny quips and jokes that take you out of the scene. Like the humor from Spider-man and Ant- Man alone worked amazingly. If they kept it to them, and whenever other characters had to react to them, it would've been a much more intense movie.

To keep this review short I'm going to say that this is the best of the MCU, the only MCU movie in my top 100 favorites. A great time. It ends kind of abruptly for me, and I left wanting more. So, terrible performances from Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Scarlett Johansson, Scarlet Witch, and Agent 13. The rest I thought were great character performances.

A good time at the movies. Overall rating: 8.4",8
10 May 2016,superb entertainment,"wow. superb entertainment. weak start but it got better and better. what cap will do for bucky. felt he would have fought hulk and thor if they were present and on team stark (wonder whose side they would have taken). that last fight was so emotional - and brutal, unlike the hugely entertaining airport fight. a believable villain with a twisted plan. great cameos by spidey, ant man and hawkeye. a cool black panther. a dark secret. weak and under-cooked romantic subplot though and vision and wanda were a little dull in comparison but necessary. it lived up to the hype and was way better than ultron. russos are the no. 1 directors in mcu with winter soldier and this. looking forward to infinity war. hope they don't falter like whedon.

17 May 2016,Same s*** different package,"It's an absolute disgrace that this movie and other ""blown out of proportion marvel movies"" are in top 250 movies on IMDb's list.

This movie is above ones like Inglourious Basterds, Unforgiven, Good Will Hunting...

Every marvel movie is the same. There are no good villains, just a lots of jumping, crashing, speed up fighting and that s it.

Comparing to this Batman trilogy is like... there is no word for that.

OK, it' s entertaining but nothing more.

Waste of time

26 May 2016,Best Marvel Movie to date,"I just wanna say that your money will be well worth it just because of that one scene where Team Captain America And Team Iron Man finally duke it out. What differentiates this movie from the rest of the other superhero genre is that each character is justified and explained on who they are and why they're here. Yes, the story does revolve around Captain America but each Avenger is given time to be fleshed out at just the right amount to still call this a Captain America movie and not Avengers 2.5. My only problem with this movie is the villain, the problem with almost all Marvel villains (except Loki), his reasons are justifiable but lack a certain depth of antagonism. Finally, one of the best Marvel films out there as of right now.

2 June 2016,Perhaps the best hero movie this year!,"Take this instead of X-man prequel, CapAm III is much better! Same level as Ironman I and Deadpool(I hope this dude got his series too). Plot is great. Twist is obvious but good one. The conflict and the tension are there. Nice group shot and the team fight is freaking awesome!!! Funny but not that shallow. CapAm should get a room with his bro right away and don't be sad Ironman, it take turns. I have no idea what Dr.Watson is doing there. Nice jail by the way. OK know I just can't wait for other Marvel movies!! Avenger III and Guardians II are still year to come. What can I do?? It just means that Marvel is killing DC. : D

18 May 2016,Superb movie which avenges earlier bad movie by Marvel,"So, its finally here although not anticipated as BvS but it was anticipated to be better.

The best part of the movie is direction by Russo Brothers, they have done a great job just like they did in Winter Soldier.It becomes really difficult in a multi starer movie to give every person there screen time and memorable moments, but Russo brothers have managed to do it for every character. The story is good, plot line is good , you understand why every character take there decision.And special thanks for Spiderman,finally he is close to his comic portrayal, talkative and funny. He is the Spiderman we need and deserve.Finally its time that Black Widow has its own stand alone movie.

Go for the movie you will not be disappointed, its so entertaining and good you can go for second time. Marvel apology accepted for Iron Man 3 and Age of Ultron.

1 May 2016,Good but could be better.,"First of all, i'll like to say that the movie in it self is a good movie, although it may lack of a more objective point of views.

I'll start with spiderman, his better than expected, and provided the movie with a little freshness, therefore plus to spiderman, but not not to the CGI-suit that is horribly done. Antman on the other hand isn't that good, he's boring just like the Antman- movie.

Now to the actual problem; Ironman vs Captain America. Both sides have equally good counter argument for whether or not to sine this Sokovia peace document. But it does not really show what it means to side with the Cap, to put it more directly, The Cap's actions for doing the right things doesn't cost enough casualties and the Ironman side doesn't sacrifice as much freedom as they where afraid of. to sum it up, this movie doesn't make it clear, that the problem is about the document, and not the kindergarten-hunt for Bucky. This movie, focuses too much on Ironman, and is leaving a feeling that you have to take his side.",7
26 May 2016,Fantastic!,"For all the people with sticks up their butts, this movie was excellent. You wouldn't know a good movie if it was right in front of you. Civil War is what every movie should be. It made over a billion dollars and is the 6th all time grossing movie. Clearly it was fantastic. If not, then why did it make so much money? It was fun, exciting, and had a fantastic plot. Watch it again and maybe you'll see how great it is. 10/10! I can't wait to see what's next in the marvel cinematic universe. Where will the heroes go from here? Thanos is coming and it's going to be crazy insane. Will Ant-Man be giant again? Will Bucky show up in Black Panther? Will Cap get a new shield? So many questions to ask and little answers for now. I hope you're excited!

13 May 2016,Good waiting to be Great.,"It's a good movie so far unless they create a sequel of this story line.

The excitement of this film is not consistent. Let say the first and middle part of it is very ecstatic but the last part I think is kind of emotional and left me hanging but that's the great part of commercial movies they left the viewers crave for more. Also the credit part after you watch it, you will definitely say ""I'll be waiting for more"".

Another positive remarks on this movie is, it has a great pick for casting especially for the newcomers; the new spidey, Tom Holland, will be a great Spider-man as what he showed in this movie. I'm a bit anxious on his stand-alone movie. And good line-up of heroes.

Overall a good movie but not that great.

20 December 2016,Just another Avenger Movie,"Pretty good movie, although achingly cheesy at times. The only thing that i will truly say is that every single avenger character was in this movie, it felt more like it was focused around the whole squad instead of simply him. Are all of marvels movies going to have avenger characters in them now??? I get having to include them here and there but this movie was so similar to any other avenger movie that captain America just got lost in the jumble. Also with everything happening in the avengers series i feel like the writers are feeling compelled to keep them together. The timelines are also starting to get confusing and mixed up (i.e. X- Men), don't get me wrong i love the avengers series but i kind of feel like them creating it was detrimental to every other movie series they are now coming out with. A prime example of this is the new spider man

22 May 2016,See It!,"Captain America: Civil War, is a great movie because it isn't just the one big topic of Captain America vs Iron Man that we are dealing with. For those of us who haven't seen Captain America: The Winter Solider, we get a look at the Winter Solider for the first time. The movie also shows us conflicts between supporting characters, and gets us hooked with the drama of the story.

The trailer doesn't show you only the important scenes of the movie. There is much more in the movie than that. It introduces new characters to us, such as the Black Panther, and designs story-line for characters we saw in The Avengers: Age of Ultron, such as Vision and Scarlet Witch.

Some of the most exciting things about the movie is that we get to see characters from other Marvel movies, such as Spider Man and Ant Man, team up with the Avengers. Over all, this movie will have you choose your side, and root for whoever's team you're on in the battle. With action scenes not failing to excite us, this movie is something too see.",9
3 June 2016,Captain America: Worldstarr,"I wanted to love this movie so much, when it ended I liked it, thats about it. I personally prefer story over action, and this movie is mostly just action scenes. Don't get me wrong! The action scenes were amazing! But that is about it... The story was so simple. ""I'm mad at you."" ""Well, I'm mad at you too, lets fight."" Whenever the characters were talking instead of fighting, it was just the same argument every time. The film had weak dialogue but made up for it in action. Black Widow seems to be more of badass in every movie. I found myself wishing Scarlett Witch would go away every time I saw her on screenI loved the new Spidey, but Black Panther stole the whole movie for me. I was clapping and cheering every time he showed up on screen. Baron Zemo was yet again another waste of a potentially great villain. Overall, I enjoyed the action but it did not live up to my hype and it is very far from a favorite in the Marvel series.

8 May 2016,Alltime best Marvel movie- Personally my favorite movie of all time.,"Civil War is a brilliantly crafted, action packed, full of story, fun- fest with deeper meaning. The movie didn't include as much humor as put into most Marvel movies, which I personally feel is right. The jokes weren't rushed and they were really funny. All the heroes got fair screen-time, not as so as Ant-Man, but later in the movie they made up for Ant-Man's missing screen-time for almost half the movie. Spider-Man was amazing, quippy, clever, and spectacular. There were some scenes where he doesn't look entirely real, and more on the CGI side, but I didn't mind it at all. There are many twists, and things you don't see coming, but it's very enjoyable. The last quarter-ish, it get's a little dark, and I loved it. I will definitely be watching it again, and buying it when it comes out on DVD/Digital/Blu-Ray.

26 May 2016,The Best Assembled Super Hero Movie Yet,"After the disappointment of Age of Ultron and Batman v Superman, Civil War stood up and taught us why a great script is the stepping stone that every big superhero movie should be based on. It showed how every character must be treated and why their development is important.

The characters were all well done. Spidey inclusion made the movie fun and more lighthearted, Black Panther was interesting and important to the story, and both had some cool action scenes. Captain America and almost everyone else were well presented, they had their time to shine and a coherent and understandable reason to choose a side in the story (except maybe for a rushed Vision). However, Iron man was the most complex one and Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of him was perfect, it was very pleasant to see in a character with so many changes of mind that all those changes were rationally and emotionally well motivated.

The villain was one of the best of the MCU, he had the most rational plan of all MCU villains (with also a cool twist plot), Bruhl was great and made the most ""normal"" villain the most harmful one.

It was a normal movie technically-wise (same aesthetics in every MCU movie) but had remarkable action scenes.

The mayor issue I encountered was the pacing in the beginning, it was quite rushed, and the movie seemed destabilized and messy until it found its way.

It's easily one of the best MCU movies and I'm glad to see the Russo brothers will be directing Avengers 3.",7

24 May 2016,Superb story and best climax fight between heroes,"Its a movie where you can see heroes as villains. Its always obvious that you go to the theater and saw a hero and a villain. And in the end villain either dies or captured. But this epic movie is not one of those boring movies. It mixes in the various complications of the real world, where superheroes should work according to governments. But captain knew these governments very well and this started all the action and drama. Action , I mean just action with a very little history or reasons behind doesn't gives much. You always asks yourself ,this much fight just for gold or some superpowers. But here ,there is a whole lot of reasons due to which heroes turned against heroes.

All in all, this is a great superhero movie in which you will not find anything stupid, but if you find it stupid , then you are negligent to drama which creates action. And you should go and watch transformers.

22 August 2016,*********,"This film is a masterpiece in super hero genre. Almost every character there was well constructed. The film is well paced, the action scenes were great, the story was simple yet well presented. Even when Spider Man was introduced it didn't ruin the film's pacing or made his insertion seem forced. Black Panther may be a bit of a disappointment in the beginning but as the character develops he gets much better and matures more than Tony Stark. The villain? He wasn't even necessary, and yet did what he had to do. Some of the characters question the whole new law thing and start thinking about their actions in recent events. It's not like the comics, but for me it seems that the director and the script writer did everything they could with the resources they had. I know that giving it a 10 may be a bit of an exaggeration for some people because there are better films than this one, but for me in the super hero genre this one is the best so far.

9 February 2017,For the Director and Producers,"The King T' Chaka is speaking Zulu to his son. If you want to make up a fake country and use any African dialect or a made up one sure, go ahead, but we love Marvel also and you owe it to African viewers to be authentic. If you hire a South African actor, good for you but he has to speak a Nigerian dialect or then change the name of the country he is representing. You have producers you pay for that reason! But the Hollywood idea of thinking only of American viewers who see ""other languages"" as gibberish is offensive to us who understand and pay money only to see have our cultures misrepresented. Hollywood has produced quite a few movies with African actors speaking different languages and pretending to be having a conversation. Yes, its acting! I know someone is going to say that!

14 May 2016,"Good action, but overrated","People were hyping the crap out of tho movie, so I figured I'd go see it today. Long story short, this was the first time I actually got bored at the theater. The 3D was good, the action sequences were pretty cool, and the camera-work includes some neat shots. Where Civil War falls short is an extremely boring first half. The payoff is good towards the second half with spiderman and more action, but the story gets derailed and all over the place. Not only is the story confusing and all over the place, the many slow parts of the movie just made things boring. I mean REALLY slow parts. The villain is a Russian guy apparently and not at all important to the movie, only appearing for about 10 minutes and not showing any real significance. Speaking of which, no characters showed any significance besides iron man, despite being called captain America. Had this just been Avengers 3, it might have made more sense. Captain America was there, but most of the focus was on iron man and every other character felt like cameos besides bucky and captain America. I had to give this a 6 though, because even though there are some seriously slow parts and plot holes abundant, plus an odd choice of casting (why is aunt may like 35 years old?), the film has good action and I really liked spiderman and black panthers appearances, as they really added some weight to the movie.",6
24 May 2016,"Avoid the 3D Version (IMAX/Real3D), otherwise pretty okay","The movie itself is okay, entertaining, although a bit slow at times.

I found the camera-work a bit annoying, as very often the director chose to film past a near object or person, creating a blurry out of focus item that covers up to a third of the screen. For the 3D IMAX Version that means a 3D blur in the foreground. The Shaky Camera Action and extremely fast cuts (1 second or less per perspective) during Action Scenes make it hard to focus on anything in the 3D Version, but i guess it works fine for 2D.

I am happy to see Daniel Bruehl (Goodbye Lenin, Joyeux Noel, Inglorious Basterds, Burnt) in this movie, he has come very far!

6 May 2016,"Dumpster fire for a plot, then spiderman comes in and saves it","Massively disappointed in civil war. Considering how amazing winter soldier was, this was at times a dumpster fire. Plot is a mess. Zemo as the villain is pathetic and the convoluted time table he creates to get what he wants is just ridiculous. Tom Holland though as Spider man was perfection. Truly saved the movie. And Paul Rudd as Ant Man. Nothing else I can say. It's a throw away summer movie and meh. Very very disappointed. I do not want to give anything away, but when the big reveal at the end happens, well you are just left saying ""really ? Are you kidding??"". My lord what can I say about the ridiculousness of Vision in a cardigan sweater and slacks. And even crowbarred in the potential love blossoming between Scarlet Witch and Vision. Maybe a smidge better than age of Ultron, but a world worse than Winter Soldier.

8 May 2016,The Greatest Trilogy,"To start off all the ones this movie got on this website are the DC fans. Okay now this movie is what Age of Ultron should have been it's like Marvel's apology note to the fans, and yes you will forgive them after this movie. he movie is just great the Acting is perfect from everyone, the story is better than Ultron but not as good as Winter Soldier, special effects were great not perfect, and the the effect of this movie on the MCU is massive. The Russo brothers understand what they have to do, the comic book is much different but this version fits better to the Movie universe. It shows the conflict and gives the characters reasoning for what they are doing and give them depth and development. It is either a fraction lower or equivalent to the greatness of The dark Knight.

12 May 2016,not as good as my expectation,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

12 August 2017,"Amazing action, boring story","During my viewing of the film, I couldn't help but nearly fall asleep in the theater during any scene that didn't feature action. The film is overrated, in my opinion. The only reason people praise it so much is for the characters that appeared in the film finally coming together....oh wait....on one screen. The actors are amazing as usual. When I left the theater, I was reminded of Batman v Superman. I compared both films in quality, and Batman v Superman won. I even rated BvS 9 out of 10 over this film's 7/10.

Once again, this film is overrated. Let's hope Infinity War is a Winter Soldier and not a Civil War.

Because we see from the side action and the plot is very complex, time consuming its history and the current fight scenes are very neat and orderly.

Maybe the audience will be amazed and impressed with the quality of the securities editor, create a real feel and no matter how many hero role, but being bored and all the more fascinating when put together and combined.

Not just the scene that I see in this film, but there are side The message simply goes to the heart, which is ""TRUE FRIEND IS BETTER THAN FRIENDS WHO HAVE HIGHER EGO, ""but we have not decided on a rope brotherhood.

13 May 2016,"good film, though pointless","Good movie with lots of well-shot action, well executed humour and an interesting dilemma. You do, however, not feel this movie had any consequences - and we kind of find ourselves in roughly the same spot as before. The Avengers, for instance, do take sides throughout the film, and yet it ends saying that ""oh we're not REALLY parted after all"". The film, instead, should have worked more as a point of no return- thing, so that we felt it mattered and that it had part to play. CA:CW is great movie that - regretfully - didn't really matter.

This movie sort of feels like the good version of BvS. This is how you make two (or two group of) protagonists clash together.

22 May 2016,Explaining what i think,"I Saw Civil War Last night and i loved it. I Think civil war mixes technology with action and that is just so cool. I Loved the way ant man shrank that was just so awesome. It is the best movie ever. It is so good it puts a shame to star wars.

I Don't want to tell spoilers because there would be no point in watching it. but i'll tell you who was with iron man and captain America: on iron man's team there was: iron man, vision, black panther,black widow, spider man,war machine. and on cap's team:Captain America,Winter soldier,ant man,falcon,scarlet witch and hawkeye. Also You know in the winter soldier movie brock rumlow? Well he appeared as crossbones Also played by Frank Grillo. I Also liked helmut zemo just because of his accent.

25 May 2016,Marvel still on Top,"I remember when the news that they were making a Captain America movie years ago, I just didn't see how it could be brought to live without being corny , but here we are 2016 and these movies just keep getting better , also the way they bring the characters and the stories that seem possible in today's world , even when things seem far fetched, anyone can enjoy this franchise , no matter if a kid or adult, or a 75 year old grandmother. This is why Marvel sits on the throne of The Comic-book Cinematic Universe , they bring the stories and the hero's to are world and this is something I with DC would try and adapt into theirs . Fantastic fun mixed with a solid thriller

15 September 2016,best superhero movie ever!,"Just saw the movie this morning with my roommate. I have heard great things about this movie and I thought that I was going to cry given how the Avengers are dividing over the issue of government oversight. I haven't picked a team and I don't think I will. I'm a mix, I guess.

Anyway, back to the movie. Wow. Woo-Ho! This movie is a wild ride of action, effects and story. I haven't read any of the comics, but I have been following most Marvel movies, and this one did not disappoint in the least. Even though the story is more mature and brooding, there is also plenty of humorous moments, especially in Tom Holland's Spiderman.

People, those fans were not kidding. This Spiderman flat out steals every scene that he's in with his humor, agility, nerdy persona and Tom Holland is the perfect choice to harbor Marvel's youngest superhero. He even looks a little like Toby Maguire. He was undoubtedly the best part of the movie, even though he didn't get much screen time. Totally looking forward to the new Spiderman movie due next year.

Another huge highlight is the jealousy between Bucky and Falcon. Maybe jealousy isn't the right word, but these two do not exactly get along. Their moments together, though brief in number, are awfully hilarious as well.

Wondering what's going to happen in the next movies to come. This one really helps set the field for what Infinity War will possibly bring in the future. Check out this movie. It's quite a ride",10
8 April 2017,"Script is OK, good acting","Overall, compared with other series of CA & Avengers, this film is better (as good as Winter Soldier) in term of script and action scenes seems to be more realistic, the story is about normal life events and situation, not too much fictitious. I love the friendship between CA and Bucky as well Tony's ""family love"". I like character Bucky Barnes. This is anw an innocent ppl, a poor controlled-mind killer. This seems to be a complex character, a forced killers who feels guilty and lonely. I like Sebastian Stan's acting also, he has emotional talking eyes. I think the movie showed us possible situations/strategies in real life and led us to the tolerance and forgiveness

A minor ""error"" is the presence of so many new characters, ant-man, spider kid, especially the spider kid.... very tiny/vague meaning

26 August 2017,Best Marvel Movie,"Captain America: Civil war was everything I hoped it would be and so much more. There was a surprising amount of depth and emotion to the movie with exploring Steve Rogers' conflict with the title of Captain America and his complex relationship with Bucky Barnes and Tony Stark. The performances were another thing that really impressed me. The action sequences were gripping and I was very happy with the way the Russos managed such a huge cast.

16 December 2017,A Good Movie but a Terrible Adaptation,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.

The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.

These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.

This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",8

4 June 2018,A real hero,"Captain America Civil war is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely. The Avengers used to be a strong team fighting for the same goal. But when the government decides to push for the Hero Registration Act, a law that limits a hero's action, the team falls apart. On one side Iron Man who agrees with this Act and signs it and on the other side Captain America who refuses to sign. Captain America feels that saving the world is daring enough and that they cannot rely on the government to protect the world. The two superheroes build two teams who will face each other. Iron Man joins his forces with Black Panther, Vision, Black Widow, War Machine, and Spider-Man and Captain America stays with Bucky Barnes, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, and Ant Man.

This 2016 movie is an amazing work from Marvel. We really feel everyone's convictions and we understand why they fight. Chris Evans' acting is impressive, we can feel his emotions through the screen with his facial expressions. The fight between the two teams is well staged and we can assist to powerful fightings. The intersting side of this movie is that you can see everyone's abilities and it's not only focused on one hero. Steve Rogers is the typical american soldier who is loyal and faithful. He defends his friends and what he believes in. I really liked this movie which changes from usual Marvel movies with every superhero in one team against the evil.

This movie brought a great change in MCU and I'm excited to see what comes next!",10
19 December 2018,Civil War takes you into territory not many comic book movies do,"Captain America: Civil War was more of an Avengers movie to be honest but still carried about it an air of independence to push it through. The major issue discussed and tackled in the film is one not many comic book lovers or viewers alike ask themselves,"" What happens at the end of the day when the battle is won? Does everyone have a happy ending ? Are the innocents who died in the way accounted for?"" This movie tries to tackle these issues in the most Marvelous of ways possible. High stakes, interesting plot details , big battles , spectacular action sequences and a final battle that is probably the best I have seen in a while. All while packing enough punch to dazzle both critics and fans as well as the movie - goer's wallet; for good measure.
