17 October 2005,Awesome,"The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.

Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.

I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people.""",10
9 September 2013,"Bring me the heads of Hitler, Himmler, Eichmann n Mengele.","Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List. Me n my kids cried during the pit scene.

2 March 2023,"Whoever saves one life, saves the world entirely. ‚≠ê","As you may know there is lots of World War II movies. Some of them shows you the worst parts of war, this one is doing something better.

Shows you the war is bad for everyone. Shows you een the little kindness is the greatest thing. Shows you ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entirely.""

I saw so many World War II movies, non of them gave me these feelings. Most of them are just too sided with USA. Some of them just made with fictional characters. And I don't know how but some of them says war is a good thing if you're shooting bad people.

Besides one of the greatest historical Screenplay, the Acting Performances just superb. I don't imagine any better casting for any character. They all chosen well. With Liam Neeson's Schindler, Ben Kingsley's Stern and the great villain Ralp Fiennes' Amon Goth.

Scores is the soul of the movie. John Williams mades you feel that.

Cinematography is too great, watching this movie with these colors makes the movie too much realistic. I don't know how is it doing that. I know some of the movies are trying that when flashback scenes are coming, but most of them are not being successful at.

Art Direction and Set Decoration is also too varied. They managed to do an enormous job. You feel the greatness in the movie with varied places and objects.",10

26 January 2023,One of the best movies ever made.,"Businessman Oskar Schindler saved the lives of many Jews, by employing them in his factories, this saving them from going to The Concentration Camps.

This was, and will forever be, one of the best films ever made, not just the ultimate story of The Holocaust, but truly as masterpiece, one of the best.

If you can sit through it without being moved to the point of tears, you're made of stronger stuff than I am, the atrocities committed on those innocent people will never be forgotten. The realisation here is chilling.

The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.

What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.

The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.

No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.

It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.

A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.

10/10.",10
11 December 2000,A SINGULAR ACHIEVEMENT,"I have only ever seen this film once, I only ever want to see this film once and I will only ever need to see this film once. It is etched on my mind. I, like many others, left in silence. I could not imagine inventing a critical analysis of this film, picking small points of detail or of style, or even scoring points off the Director. It stands alone as a monumental piece of cinema, a magnificent accomplishment.

23 March 2014,Spielberg's most important work,"Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.

This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end.",10

10 April 2022,Stunning; Spielberg's Greatest. Top üíØ All Time Best Films,"Leaves one speechless - Moving, somber, and horrifying. One of Humankind's worst moments - Something no one should ever forget.

This is filmmaking at its finest. Even with 7 Oscars, deserved more. On par with the greatest films ever made. Certainly cemented Steven as one of the greatest filmmakers to walk the planet. A personal labor by Steven, it is clearly something he felt compelled to do, and it shows in the intricate detail of every scene.

""Schindler's List"" is nearly flawless in every category. A must-see film for reasons beyond entertainment.

28 March 2006,It's About Our Humanity,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country.",10

4 June 2009,"Incredibly moving and visually disturbing, Spielburg's best by far!","Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox.

23 October 2017,Devastating,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.

The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.

Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.

Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget.",10
5 June 2012,Best Movie of all Time,"Perfect.

Perfect on every level from the acting to the script, to the cinematography, everything about this movie is 100% perfect.

I've watched this movie 3 times and there's nothing I would change. Even the insanely long running time of 3 hours and 15 minutes isn't a bad thing. Every scene feels important. I would highly recommend watching this movie. Although it is very violent and very heartbreaking so be warned!! But if you can handle strong violence and a difficult subject matter such as the Holocaust, then you must see it. It's my favorite movie, and I hope it will one day become yours too.

Rating: 10/10

20 November 2011,Eye opening,"This movie, Schindler's List, is hands-down without a doubt one of the greatest films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Regardless of how much praise I include in my review, I should still think it deserves more. Few movies are actually able to pull tears out of my stubborn eyes, and the two that come right to mind are this one, and It's a Wonderful Life. Schindler's List is a grim portrayal of events in the Holocaust, while at the same time actually bringing light to some of the humanity still there. I was embarrassed when I actually started clapping in that classroom where I first watched this movie. I'd recommend it to anybody and it remains in my top selection of movies. Outstanding.

31 March 1999,Emotional Release,"I don't know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of Schindler's List. At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change. I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial. I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure. After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film. It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.

This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself. I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing. I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.

Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things. Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a pile of personal photographs of family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses. That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.

I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock. I was kind of mad at Spielberg. I mean, doesn't he know when to back off. It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.

Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever.",

25 September 2022,So real i forgot i was watching a movie!,"At this point everyone knows this movie is a masterpiece! Spielberg crafted one of his greatest and most important works to date! The importance of this movie can not be denied!

Even after 80 years since WW2 and almost 30years since realease, this movie STILL feels relevant and blows you away! The use of Black and white creates a historic and authentic feel that might be the movies' greatest achievement! The movie would not be the same if it was in colours! It makes all the horrors that takes place feel real and not distant!

The movie is a difficult but nescesary watch! You will cry, feel sick and disturbed cause all these terrible things actually took place in a not so distant past!

3 May 2002,Amazing!,"This Movie was sensational. It was a piece of art along with being informational. It told people about the holocaust, and it also told people about the human spirit. It shows how people can just triumph over anything with just some help from one person The things that Spielberg did with the movie was incredible too. The black and white was genius, and how he had the little girl in red and the fire was phenuminal. I have never seen anything like it, Schindler's List is beyond all words.

24 September 2017,The worrying amount of 1/10s is why we still need this film and holocaust movies in general,"The first time I've seen it, Schindler's list didn't give me much of an impression. It was horrific, black and white, and I was 15. Now, after I got myself quite a cinematographic culture, feeling the urge to identify Spieblerg's masterpiece, I came back to this movie. I knew it was rated as one of the best films generally, ever, but when I took a look at the reviews, I became really worried. Most of the 1/10 ratings bring reasonless motivations for this film's criticism.

The main points of criticism that I saw are the following: 1) it manipulates facts; 2) presents a too distinct line between good jews and evil Nazis; 3) too emotional; 4) money grab; 5) ""Holocaust is bad, we already knew it"" (and this is an almost exact quote);

1) the claims for this point of criticism are that it portrays a positive figure of Oskar Schindler, exaggerates several aspects of the holocaust, and portrays essentially bad Nazis (we to this latter point in 2)); Let's get this straight: unlike some reviewers claim, Oskar Schindler didn't end up as an enriched Industrialist, as some reviewers wrongly claim. In other words, he didn't earn off the holocaust anything. On the contrary, he spent his entire fortune on bribes and corruption acts in order to aid his Jewish workers. He even had to escape to Argentina, as many Nazi officers did after WWII. As for the claims of overly dramatisation, that is certainly an aspect of the film. There are a few scenes which are not accurate (e.g. the shower scene - in real life, jews didn't fear the gas chamber as they where purposely misinformed). Generally, though, I didn't see that much of an overly dramatization. Most of the times, the film presented simply factual events. Jews were in fact killed and persecuted, there's nothing overly dramatized. Concentration camps where truly such bloody places as seen in the film. Instead, maybe it even downgraded violence quite a lot., still being incredibly bloody as a film.

2) Good jews vs. bad Nazis; I remember Hans Landa's monologue from the beginning of Inglorious Basterds, which centered on jews being rats in the sense that they're generally a population that could figure out a solution easily. Do not get me wrong here (obviously Landa stereotypes this immensely), but this is portrayed often, mainly in the first portion of the film. Jews going to the Synagogue to buy and sell instead of praying, some jews that join the police force and essentially collaborate with the Nazis, and some jews fight each other when hiding away during the ghetto persecution scene. I clearly would not say that all jews are good nor that all German soldiers are bad, but that shouldn't be a matter to be portrayed in a holocaust film. To see an avid jew, go watch ""A Christmas Carol"". As for ""bad Nazis"", I'd like to clear out again what is Nazional-Socialism. It was an extremist, right-wing movement that enhanced, in this case, Germany's national identity and superiority on the base of racial distinction, and urged violence on anyone that would not be member of the ""superior"" race. This movement, along with fascism, attracted a great deal of fanatics. I'd like to suggest the view of ""Novecento"", which similarly depicts the rise of fascism in Italy and its ruthless cruelty, carried on by it he insane and violent individuals which joined the party in the early twenties. I know that one movie depicted a Nazi soldier's moral division during WWII, called ""Onore e Lealt√†"", which has low reviews for the same reason that prevents this film from portraying ""good"" Nazis: it is kind of dangerous, and can easily turn in a glorification of Nazis. Nonetheless, most of the cruelty is carried through a notorious war criminal, Amon Goeth.

3) Spielberg is of Jewish origins. As a filmmaker, he's considered this story very personal. Moreover, he is notorious for being emotional in his serious films.

4) It is well known that Spielberg chose to renounce for his fee as he considered it ""blood money"". Of course studios have to do a profit of their movies, but film is still a form of art. Movie makers of Spielberg's caliber do films without a simple capitalistic view of making money, but with the purpose of making an art work. Schindler's list is not a fancy action blockbuster, if nothing else, its black and white colouring identifies it as an art film. Add the fact the Spielberg felt personal about this story, and you'll realise how empty this claim is.

5) This film was released in 1993; I personally don't know many outstanding holocaust films from before 1993 (certainly a lot from after 1993), or if there were, they certainly weren't as bold as this one. A black and white film about a crude subject that keeps the viewer's attention for 3 hours and 15 minutes. Think about it. I personally believe that, unlike other films (this includes my favourite holocaust film, Son of Saul), gives a such wide view on the holocaust. This film shows most of the aspects of the holocaust, some overrdramatised, but nonetheless represented. It is really stupid to see this movie as unnecessary.

Conclusively, I'd like to point out that 6 million jews died due to the Holocaust. The only bigger genocide I know of is that of the native Americans, 18 million only in northen America. Seeing so many 1/10 reviews that base their claims on this being basically Jewish propaganda is worrying, especially considering the rise of right-wing ideologies that happened in the latter years. Are we forgetting history? I hope not. And, in case that's the truth, it's films like Schindler's list that remind us of that.",9

7 August 2005,Possibly THE BEST example of a Best Picture winner,"I can't possibly describe with words how great ""Schindler's List"" is. You can't realize it unless you watch it. Spielberg not only makes you feel like you're in the middle of it, but you continue feeling that way for hours after watching the movie. Liam Neeson does a top-notch job as Oskar Schindler, a man caught between loyalty to his government and the desire to save over 1,000 people. Equally good is Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, whom Schindler saves from getting exterminated, and then helps Schindler save more people. And Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, a Nazi Kommandant with plans to rape a Jewish woman. Like I said, I can't possibly describe how great this movie is. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT TO UNDERSTAND IT. 11/10.

2 April 2002,Arguably Steven Spielberg's greatest film ever.,"Steven Spielberg's epic portrayal of the Nazi Holocaust is one of the most powerful films ever brought to the big screen. During production, Spielberg is said to have stood in the cold on location in Austria and cried, being partly Jewish, as he imagined the horrors that all of those people suffered during the second World War under the oppression of the Nazis. It is clear that at least some of this emotion transferred over into the film, and the end result is startlingly effective and moving. Sure, Spielberg has had several other films that have been amazing and memorable, not the least of which, obviously, are ones like Saving Private Ryan and Amistad (oh shut up, Amistad rocked¬Ö), but in my opinion, the shocking realism achieved in large part through the documentary style filmmaking gives Schindler's List the boost needed to surpass the also brutally realistic Saving Private Ryan.

The story involves a Nazi who exercised his humanity and attempted to free as many Jews as possible from being killed in the concentration camps. Steven Spielberg has been often criticized for being overly sappy or emotional in his films (this was, of course, long before Spielberg himself criticized Roberto Benigni's Life Is Beautiful for virtually the same thing), and this may have happened in Schindler's List as well, but in this case, if he was sappy it was for good reason and with great effect. At the end of the film, Liam Neeson's Oskar Schindler has saved a tremendous amount of people who would otherwise have died, but he doesn't seem to notice this as he emotionally laments all of the possessions that he still has that could have been used to save peoples' lives. This is especially effective because of the fact that he was a much more materialistic opportunist at the beginning of the film before he began to pay attention to his conscience.

As he did with Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg creates a film with Schindler's List that is absolutely unflinching. He does not shy away from the horrific things that happened to the victims in the concentration camps, and he does not sugar-coat his presentation of it at all. The time period is re-created and brought to the screen with stunning and disturbing realism, and if it weren't for the quality of the presentation, it could almost seem that we are watching stock footage of the concentration camps themselves rather than a scripted and edited film.

Spielberg's emphasis on the emotional element of his films comes into play most powerfully in the closing scene of the film, as a very long line of people ¬ñ the descendents of those that he saved during the war ¬ñ walk through a cemetery in the modern day and place flowers on his grave. Schindler was unsatisfied when the war ended because he felt that he could have, and should have, saved more people, but during this scene it becomes abundantly clear that he really made a difference, and that his accomplishments were important and long-lasting.

With Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg once again demonstrates his tremendous skills as a filmmaker. 1993 is a testament to Spielberg's filmmaking skills, because this was the year that he directed Schindler's List, the Best Picture of the year, as well as Jurassic Park, which was the most popular film of the year. These two films are a perfect example of the two main types of films that Spielberg is so adept at creating. There are the fun and exciting films, like Jurassic Park, E.T., Hook, the Indiana Jones films, and the more recent A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and then there are the films that are historically accurate and are made to deliver powerful messages to the world in reference to the events portrayed in the film, such as Amistad, Saving Private Ryan and, probably his most powerful yet, Schindler's List.",10

2 June 2016,"Its gonna be our next generation's classic. Deep, solid, and undoubtedly immutable !","Schindlers list is one of movie which depict the true skill of our legendary Spielberg. Shot in black and white, Spielberg want to present the classic vintage and dramatically dark of world war 2 history. I should say this is the best movie which Spielberg made from perspective of cinematography, casting, and art direction. Yes, this is a near perfect movie.

Storytelling of the movie itself constantly shuttling from deep to solid. The writing definitely gives Neeson to dig his character fastidiously. While the antagony delivers dogmatic and deleterious performance, the protagony also delivers benevolent and empathetic character. Well, i should say Spielberg seldomly made a real serious movie here, but when he did, it was terrific.

Inspirational, this movie keeps deliver a solid writing, tough performance, and precious cinematography. This is one of movie that could change people. This movie have such magnificent power to do that while have a self-perpetuating charisma to stand as classic.",10
23 March 2003,Powerful and moving if not exactly a fun night in!,"As Nazi Germany invades Poland, opportunist Oscar Schindler sees a chance to open a factory serving the military and using Jews for labour. However, as the full horror of the war on the Jewish people becomes ever more clear, Schindler's selfishness turns more into compassion for his fellowman.

Having spent 10 weeks watching `Taken' and remembering just how awful Spielberg can be when he is being mushily sentimental, I revisited this film as it was showing in the build up to the TV coverage of the 2003 Oscar ceremony. It is a powerful film simply because Spielberg manages to keep the mush out of it and just let the events speak for themselves. When people are shot on the street there is no John Williams music or slow-motion, they simply fall in a bloody heap and the film moves on. This makes it shockingly cold and that is the aim.

The story is difficult to summarise because a surprising amount of it is spent away from the story of Schindler and on the plight of the Jews generally. Again this theme within the narrative stops to wandering and allows it to be impacting. True there is an element of `look what happened, isn't this terrible?' about it, but not too much. In the final hour in particular it gets a little sentimental but not to the point of spoiling things.

Neeson's Schindler makes you wonder why he wasn't able to get any character into his recent role in Star Wars I. Here he keeps Schindler a complex man, driven by a mix of selfishness and compassion but Spielberg simplifies him a bit towards the end (but I may be being a bit picky). Fiennes' Goeth is also wonderfully drawn. A cold blooded killer no doubt but also not painted without his own complexities and Fiennes holds the focus whenever he is onscreen. The support cast are all excellent right down to extras ¬ñ if you think it is easy to scream and wail convincingly then you should compare this to Kate Capshaw in Indiana Jones! I never doubted that any of the actors were anything but the characters they played.

Spielberg rightly won his Oscars for this and his direction is excellent. Although I do dislike him immensely when he goes all `apple pie' on us, he is great at what he does and this is one of his best films since Jaws. A powerful, moving film that is moving for all the right reasons and not just because John Williams cranks in. Difficult to watch but worth the effort.",
24 September 1999,Difficult...but very necessary,"This is, after all, one of the more...for lack of a better word...*necessary* films to appear in recent years. Yes, humans can fall to such depths. Yes, such rampant disregard for all we hold sacred--for life, for simple virtues--is possible. Yes, such bestiality has been, is today, will be again. ...entertaining??? Perish the thought. Nothing, absolutely NOTHING about this movie is entertaining. If you want entertainment this evening, watch something else. A Cary Grant comedy, a Mel Brooks film...anything else.

But this is, when all is said and done, one of the most important films ever made...because it tells us something we need very much to know, or to remember: On your guard! There have always been, will always be more Amon Goethes!! There will always be more Auschwitzes! ...but will I have the courage to be another Oskar Schindler??

7 June 2016,Triumph,"Schindler's List is not only a pure masterpiece but, for me, it is one of the greatest films ever made in the world.

The film starts off to reveal a womanizing, Nazi business man who profited off of slave labor. The Nazi business man is of course Oskar Schindler. Oskar is just like most men. He has a love for good wine, beautiful women, and pursues happiness through the success of his business. But on his journey to a successful business, millions of Jews were being killed during a time which most label as one of the darkest periods of human history. As Oskar made money, innocent people were being murdered. That's when the self-centered, often money hungry Oskar steps in and gives up his goal of having a successful business to save the lives of over 1,000 Jews.

This film is about redemption and was beautifully photographed in black and white by Janusz Kaminski (cinematographer). At the helm is no one other than Steven Spielberg, who brilliantly called non-pretentious shots and brought back to life a time and period most want to forget, but shouldn't. This film is a must see by me. I give the film an ""A+"" (wishing I could give it a higher grade than that) and a 10 out of 10... Best movie",

I will tell you a story about how I discovered this landmark Masterpiece At School recently My teacher Simon Strange was teaching us all about the Holocaust and explaining what happened all those years ago and showed us a video and spoke in great detail about hatred and intolerance and crimes against humanity and he spoke to me and said I will never forget this conversation I know You love Steven Spielberg's Films very Much?

13 February 2000,One of the Best Films Ever Made. Spielberg's Best,"Steven Spielberg has his best masterpiece here with Schindler's list. It is also his most personal work to say the least. And what he brings to the screen is like nothing the world has ever seen before- a true to life depiction of the horror known as the holocaust.

The story brings us Oskar Schindler, a German munitions chief who brings thousands of Polish Jews from the death camps to his factory and saves them. The acting is spectacular with Liam Neeson as Schindler, the man who changes throughout the film, Ben Kigsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant (and conscience), and Ralph Fiennes in his best performance yet as the frightening German commander. Along with a frighteningly haunting score by John Williams and great Photography by Janusz Kaminski, Spielberg has created a film that will remain with us forever. Haunting, dramatic and true in the art form, this is one of the best masterpieces of cinema ever made.

15 June 2002,"The most moving, exceptional film ever made!!","I had no expectations going into this movie. I had heard different opinions about it and I was pleasantly blown away by it. It left me in tears which few movies ever truly do. I honestly believe this to be one of the top ten greatest films of all time...not necessarily because of it's watchability but because of it's content and the way it is filmed. Liam Neeson (Who I have never been fond of) plays Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party who is a brilliant business man, con artist, and German personality. He loves his ladies and his booze but is also quite humane right from the very beginning. When the Germans invade Poland and begin to send Jews into Ghetto's he opens a factory making cookware (pots and pans) using the jews as labor. However, it isn't cruel labor but rather he is giving them a purpose and treats them as equal workers giving them benefits and good working conditions...to him...he's just making his money. He is very humble about everything and does not see why the Jews are so happy with him. As the movie continues we see the honest progression of the war and the hatred towards the Jews. The rumours of the gas chamber begin to circulate, and we watch as Almon Goeth played chillingly by Ralph Fiennes (another actor I have never been overly fond of) murders Jews at will keeping the other Jews in check by fear. Goeth is a power hungry, Nazi who thrives on seeing people suffer by his hand. He's been given a high powered rank and milks it for all it's worth and enjoys it. He snipers Jews from his window...just for sport. He's empty and pure evil. When Schindler happens to oversee a Ghetto raid by the SS he is moved to tears as he watches his workers being brutalized. As he makes his millions he wields his own more subtle power with bribes, women, food, wine, reputation in order to progress his business and save his workers. He then takes a quite signifigant more direct role by actually buying off top ranking Nazi officials in order to ""buy"" Jewish workers...the workers and their families who worked for him in his cookware plant. He begins to make a list of 1100 Jewish people he wants bought and brought by train to his new Munitions plant where they are to make shell casings for bombs. A very intense scene takes place when the Jewish women he ""purchased"" are re-routed to the wrong place because of an error in paper work. They think that this is it for them and the gas chamber will be their destination but the error is fixed and the women arrive unharmed to Schindler's Plant. In the most moving scene in movie history...Schindler breaks down before escaping Allied forces at the end of the war and realizes how many had died outside his factory and how many he wished he could have saved. Liam Neeson performance in this entire movie but especially in that scene will haunt me forever. This film is never to be tossed on a back shelf...it is so much more than a classic...it's brilliance. I don't, however, necessarily take it as historical fact when it comes to Schindler. In reading on him I don't see him quite as the beloved character you feel in the movie. He seemed more selfish and perhaps less humble in real life...but nonetheless the man saved 1100 and then some Jews and that to me makes him a hero no matter what. This movie though is one no one can ever miss. It's a triumph!!! 10/10",

8 January 2005,My brief review of the film,"The most amazing thing about this film is that it was not made to be an epic or an acclaimed film. Spielberg made it as a personal film for himself and other Jews affected by the Holocaust. There is nothing flashy about the film except for Neeson's bravura performance. Spielberg's usual style is invisible, and the cinematography and editing, although excellent, are not shown off to make a spectacle of the film or give it an epic feel. Yet it is still a compulsive, involving, and utterly heart-wrenchingly moving filming of a part of history that should not be forgotten. The screenplay is one of the best ever written: it captures the stories of so many Holocaust survivors but without distracting from the main story at hand. The black and white photography and editing is perfect, and John Williams provides a perfectly subtle but nice music score. The acting is simply brilliant, with Liam Neeson towering as Oskar Schindler, and Ralph Fiennes bringing out the Nazi character Amon Goeth into full flesh. And Ben Kingsley and Embeth Davidtz give off excellent performances too. The film also has a lot to say about absolute power corrupting and spiraling out of control, and such a message of the film can be applied to any time and crisis, not just the Holocaust. This is not just one of the the ten best films ever produced, but it shall remain so for years to come, because its messages in terms of power and racism are applicable in any age.",10
6 January 2010,"Whoever Saves One Life, Saves the World Entire.","One of the most essential, powerfully moving & profoundly affecting films to grace the silver screen, Schindler's List is the crowning achievement of Steven Spielberg's remarkable film career that finds the master storyteller at the pinnacle of his artistry, is crafted with extreme care n dedication, and is rightfully acknowledged as one of the most honoured & significant films of all time.

There are many films out there that have dealt with the subject of Holocaust in the past but the level of precision, craftsmanship & commitment that Spielberg brings on the screen this time plus the emotional impact this film provides over the course of its runtime is second to none. And even after two decades, Schindler's List remains his most personal, most mature & most accomplished work to date.

7 January 2018,Heartbreaking and powerful,"Schindler's List has to be one of the greatest films ever made and it establishes Spielberg at the top of the ladder when it comes to directors.

The portrayal and setting of WWII is brutally accurate. Spielberg does not shudder from the harsh cruelties that existed at the time. From various vantage points we watch the horror unfold. A film does not need to build towards something as it starts with such a horrible setting, it was the reality at the time.

Oscars transformation from an opportunistic businessman to a heroic saviour is one of the best transformations seen in film.

As tough as it is to watch it is a beautifully woven masterpiece by Spielberg and one does not know how much time has passed as he/she has been fully immersed in this dark tale and reality.

12 December 2004,One of the great films of the 20th century.,"I'll start with an ""aside."" What is a ""film"" and what is a ""movie."" I take the logical stance most of the time, the crew ""films"" so that the director and editor can create a ""movie"". But I have a difficult time thinking of ""Schindler's List"" as a ""movie."" I didn't watch it to be entertained, no person with a clear vision of the history behind it would. So for me, ""Schindler's List"" is certainly a ""film"", one about a real stain on our human history, a stain placed there solely from religious beliefs. The persecution and attempted extermination of the Jews by the German Nazis.

But this ""film"", while its overall subject is the holocaust, is not really about the holocaust. While it revolves around the mistreatment of Jews by the Nazis, it is about the man, Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson. A German, a ""connected"" man in society, he went to Poland and bought a factory, employing cheap Jewish labor, hoping to get rich. He was no humanitarian. But perhaps his biggest weakness, his not being an astute businessman, was responsible for the conversion we see during the course of the three hours running time of the film. He has to rely on a Jew, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), to run his factory. And the rest, as they say, is history. He changes to the point that he risks his own life to save many, perhaps over 1000, Jews from extermination, no longer for profit but for true humanitarian motives.

Unique in this time of modern movie-making, this film is mostly in Black and white. For me this works very well, because first it is such a stark subject and second, there is not so much to distract the viewer from the story. Many consider this Spielberg's best directorial effort, probably because as a Jew it was very personal to him. As a viewer, many times I found it difficult to watch, because the scenes are so realistic. I will never forget the scenes of nude prisoners being marched across the prison grounds to their deaths. I give great credit for this film's place in history, but it is not one that I enjoy watching, it is such a reminder how some can be so cruel to those who should be treated as our brothers and sisters.",
25 May 2017,Schindler ‚Äì The Messiah.,"Oskar Schindler, when someone judges him at first time may think of him as a moody business man who most important aim is money. His moody nature takes his contacts made, with higher authorities and women. Now this man does the work of saving 1,100 lives.

From where I see, he has done a Godly act by saving lives. He sacrifices all of his earned wealth in rescuing Jews and still at end regrets the money he used as bribe for growth of his industry, could have saved more lives.

At last I want to just say his moody nature is nothing, in front of lives he saved.

20 May 2008,Spielberg's best.,"Steven Spielberg delivers his masterpiece here in telling the very unknown story of a German Nazi Party member who became the savior for over 1100 Jews during the height of the Holocaust. This is very dark material and Spielberg was wise enough to film it in black and white obviously to emphasize the bleakness of the situation. Here all the elements come together and mesh fluidly. The acting is superb with Liam Neeson perfectly capturing the multiple emotional cycles that Schindler went through. At first, he is happy and wealthy yet struggles with the relationship to his wife. As the story progresses, he becomes more saddened and shocked at the horrific events that are taking place on Jews in the local towns of Poland. He then decides to use the immense wealth he has gathered to try and save those that worked for him in Poland before they were moved to concentration camps towards the end of WWII. This is not a happy story at all, and yet there is something so beautiful about this picture. When I first saw it, I cried at multiple scenes. Now, after seeing it for the second time, I was more taken aback and could only watch in awe as a simple German businessman did something that only a handful of human beings would have the courage to do. He went face to face with multiple SS officers, including the demented head of the camp Amon Goeth played sinisterly by Ralph Fiennes, in order to save all he can. The last hour of the film showing Schindler collect all his money together so he can pay for the Jews to move them to safety can only amaze and stun you as we watch one man risk and sacrifice all he owns for the benefit of 110 strangers he knows nothing about. Here it is all about the quality of human life and how important one person can be to so many others. This truly is one of the greatest films ever made and it is in my mind the best of the last decade. Not to be missed by anyone, Schindler's List is more than a film; it is an experience of a n event that I pray will never occur again.",10
17 August 2017,The masterpiece,"Fantastic screening of the bloody history. Watching Schindler's List gives rise to know what means the 'TOP CLASS FILM', it's impossible to make better film in this subject matter. Steven Spielberg is a genius. Liam Neelson and Ralph Fiennes are showing us how talented and great actors are they. Well done to the cast and crew of this film.

25 April 2002,Excellent!,"""Schindler's List"" without a doubt has been one of the best movies I have ever seen. I am glad that it won a lot of Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson is an excellent in that film also. Neeson stars as a Nazi Czech/German businessman named Oskar Schindler who owns a factory and saved more than 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust. Concentration camp is a very bad place where people work on digging the dirt from sunrise to sunset. It is a sad film, but it is based on a true story and it is brilliant, too. ""Schindler's List"" is a movie that should be seen for any Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Steven Spielberg, or any historical drama film or movie fans. Excellent! Tragic Ending with Jews putting rocks on Oskar Schindler's gravestone in the cemetery.

20 September 2015,Amazing 3 Hour History Lesson,"Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.He has directed family films (""E.T.""), horror films (""Jaws""), science fiction movies (""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""), and even quite a few mature, adult dramas. ""Schindler's List"" is one of the mature, adult dramas.

It is a 3 hour long epic of a film, shot in beautiful black and white. The black and white photography works perfectly with the emotional John Williams score and tough subject matter. For some reason, the images of snowy areas were really beautiful to me, and I can't explain exactly why this minor element added so much to the film for me.

Spielberg explicitly shows the brutality of the Nazis, and how awful the Holocaust truly was. In this film, the shaky cam actually works to the film's advantage! It isn't over the top or distracting in any way, and makes the film feel like a kind of gritty documentary at times. It actually adds to the film, rather than ruining it!

This film is just a masterpiece on every single level. There is great acting, music, cinematography, and so on...

I know why the film is so universally loved. While still being brutal, ""Schindler's List"" is a very touching and powerful piece of cinema about a truly great man. I'd highly recommend the film to anybody who can handle the film's tough subject matter.",7
11 September 2009,""" I'm afraid your quite mistaken, that is not snow, but the ashes of Human Beings ""","Too often the history of the Second World War concentrates on the massive destruction between the countries involved. It is true nearly 25 million people were killed, but the most horrendous tally in human cost was suffered by a single race and they were European Jews. Anyone who Denys this is not only a fool, but a historical moron as well. There is so much irrefutable evidence to disprove them it's simply ludicrous to try. In this film "" Schinder's List "", director Steven Spielberg lays it out cinematically for all to see. The film has so many notable qualities, it's difficult to say which illuminated it the most. The story is based on the real life of humanitarian Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who began the war as a Nazi sympathizer and profiter, but soon realized his Nazi friends were murdering millions, on behalf of the most damnable doctrine ever created. Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) plays the courageous bookkeeper who not only kept Schindeler's files, but helped him to save the lives of thousands. The heavy, Amon Goeth is played despicably evil by Ralph Fiennes. It is very interesting that during the war, ten of thousands were proud to be Nazi soldiers and SS men, yet after the war, you couldn't find two who would own up to their murderous atrocities. Still the movie has garnered so much acclaim and honor, it has become a tribute to Spielberg and his effort to remember the Hollocaust and the saddest chapter in human history. With no effort at all this has become a Classic in every sense of the word. *****",10

15 May 2010,My favourite movie,"Oskar Schindler was a German Entrepreneur who came to Poland during the Nazi occupation to start a new business. He wanted to hire Jewish labor because they were cheaper than Polish. For a while, a good number of Jews went to work in Schinder's factories, making pots and pans for the German economy. Eventually they were rounded up by Nazi Comander Amon Goeth and put in the concentration camps. Those who were not fit to do back- breaking slave labor were put in the gas chamber. Oscar Schinder, who was in fact a Nazi supporter, slowly became empathetic after watching the cruelty to these harmless people. Using all the money he made from the business, he purchased 1,100 Jews from the Nazis, and put them back to work in his factory, under good conditions until the war was over. Not long after the war ended, Amon Goeth was executed for his crimes against humanity, and Schindler unfortunately never ran a successful business again, but today the descendants of the Jews he saved number, tens of thousands.

He has become a fairly controversial figure, but I personally think that Oskar Schindler was great hero of the 20th Century, and this is one of the greatest American films of all time; absolutely heartbreaking, cinematically epic, and flawlessly acted. Many thanks to both Schindler and Spielberg.",10
17 February 2016,Steven Spielberg's greatest cinematic achievement,"In the early 90s Steven Spielberg had built a reputation as being the master of kid-friendly family films like E.T., Jaws, The Indiana Jones trilogy, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Hook, the list just goes on and on. Sure today he has films like Munich and Saving Private Ryan under his belt so Spielberg making a non kid-friendly film isn't very strange to us, but back then it was unheard of. So considering his previous career, Schindler's List might be the biggest departure from style any director has made in the history of film making.

Even if you are among the more ""experienced"" film goers, meaning people who have seen several incredibly violent, disgusting, and down right disturbing films, Schindler's List will still make your stomach turn, and you'll want to look away at some of the more graphic moments in the film. Stephen Spielberg really does not hold back, and tries to give an uncompromising depiction of the holocaust, which in the earlier 90s was not something that was commonly done, sure you had films like Night and Fog, and Shoah, but your average, everyday Joe wasn't going to ever see those films. And there were films like Sophie's Choice, and Judgement at Nuremberg, but they really focused on the after math, and didn't really directly confront their audience the same way that Schindler's List so boldly did.

Schindler's List is a biopic about Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party, who is runs a factory, in German occupied Poland, that uses Jews as workers. Oskar Schindler is played ever so greatly by Liam Neeson in what is definitely his best role yet (in my opinion Tom Hanks robbed him of the best actor Oscar). One of the best things about Schindler's List is the character of Oskar Schindler, Oskar Schindler was obviously not a righteous hero throughout the entirety of the film. After all he was a member of the Nazi party, and some viewers may take issue with this, but the film would be so much more dull and lose its complexity and depth, if Schindler was a straight forward hero fighting the bad guys. The way Stephen Spielberg presents it is far more interesting, (after all Stephen Spielberg said he was drawn to the paradoxical nature of Oskar Schindler) and far more accurate to the real life Oskar Schindler, and accuracy is something that Schindler's List strives for. The film was based upon the real life testimonies and accounts of the people who survived the events.

Steven Spielberg at first did not want to direct Schindler's List, he didn't think he was ""mature"" enough to handle something as serious as a holocaust film. But eventually decided to do it himself when he saw the rising number of holocaust deniers. Which is probably why he also wanted the film to be as close to reality as possible, he wanted something that would challenge the audience, confront them with the true horrors of the holocaust.

Earlier I talked about how great Liam Neeson's performance was, but Ben Kingsley, (who plays a Jewish account, who works for Oskar Schindler) and Ralph Fiennes (who plays an S.S. Officer in charge of a work camp.) both do amazing jobs, Ralph Fiennes was even nominated for best supporting actor at the academy awards. The cinematography, done by Janusz Kaminski who would later do Saving Private Ryan and Minority Report, is also perfect, it is probably among the greatest looking contemporary black & white films out there. The film is also scored by the legendary John Williams, (which is all you really need to know) after John Williams first saw the film, he said it was to beautiful and he was not worthy to score it, the only people that were worthy were dead. Schindler's List won the academy award for both cinematography and soundtrack. Schindler's List was also the first time Steven Spielberg ever won an actual Oscar. (he had previously won the Irving G. Thalberg award but that is just a lifetime achievement award.)

Schindler's List was films on a relatively small budget of 22 million dollars, and Steven Spielberg did not accept any money for making the film, he said it would be like accepting blood money. But you would never be able to guess that Schindler's List was shot on a budget a 1/3 of the size of Jurassic Park. The sets are so massive and pay such close attention to detail, and the film was actually shot in the real life locations of where it takes place. The reason Schindler's List was shot on such a small budge was because the Steven Spielberg and the producers thought a holocaust film might bomb, and Steven Spielberg was not known for making R rated films. The film did not bomb it grossed over 320 million dollars world wide, which is over 1/2 a billion dollars in 2016 dollars.

I'm not going to pretend that Schindler's List is flawless, perhaps its biggest flaw is the fact that 90% of the film is in English, which really clashes with Spielberg's intent to keep the film as close to reality as possible, and really can take you out of some scenes. Though I could see this not bothering most viewers, because the actors do such a great job portraying the people their playing that it would be hard to imagine anyone else in their roles.

Steven Spielberg accomplished his goal of making a holocaust film that would not only be as close to the actual events as physically possible, but he also made it accessible to all audiences, (but for some of the more sheltered viewers, it would be a bit much.)

21 December 2015,portrait of evil,"maybe, not the best movie about Shoah. but the most useful. because it reminds the small details who are bricks of normality. and it does that in a wise manner. far to be one of fans of film, it seems be a real high good job. but it presents , in beautiful manner, a side of tragedy. a not large part of a phenomenon who shows its fruits but not its deep roots. a duty of Spielberg to his people, a remarkable photography and a touching story, it is a must see not for the story, artistic virtues, memorable scenes, splendid performances but for not ignore the evil. because it is not a film about Jews or a courageous man who saves innocent people , not about war but about the science to be yourself in dark periods. a film who must see. for reflection. for not ignore. the past. the vulnerability of society face to evil.

5 August 2008,One of the All-Time Quintessential American Films,"Steven Spielberg's versatility can no longer be a question once you have seen Schindler's List, one of the all-time quintessential American films. Where his most commercially successful films have been fantasies with enormous suspension of disbelief and elements of childlike wonder, Schindler's List is unremittingly real, not only in its story and subject matter but in its portrayal of a horrific point in history. One of the most unforgettable sequences I have ever seen in a movie is the SS clearing the Krakow ghetto, sending in hundreds of troops to empty the cramped rooms and shoot anyone who protests, does not cooperate, elderly or infirmed, or for no reason at all. The strange unpredictability of the sequence is masterful, such as the heartbreaking point during when the lone boy desperately tries to find a place to hide. Or when one SS officer plays a piano and carries on a nonchalant discussion while machine guns massacre hiding tenants. As Oskar Schindler, perhaps Liam Neeson's greatest role, watches the carnage from the hills overlooking the area, and is profoundly affected, during one of the most oft-revered employments of color technique in contemporary cinema.

Oskar Schindler's story is so purely human, as opposed to what could have been a clearcut good vs. evil storyline in a film depicting the Holocaust. Schindler is a crass businessman from Czechoslovakia who takes advantage of the abundantly cheap work force of Jews to manufacture for the German military. He is a coldly opportunistic member of the Nazi Party, smothering the army with bribes as well as SS officials in charge. Funded by the military, he procures a factory for army mess kits. Not being shrewd enough to suitably run such an enterprise, he develops a connection with Itzhak Stern, played by Ben Kingsley in his best performance next to Sexy Beast, a functionary in the local Jewish Council who has contacts with the now underground Jewish business community in the Ghetto. They loan him the money for the factory in return for a small share of products for black market trade. Schindler makes the Nazis happy and takes pleasure in his wealth and status while Stern actually does the handling of the organization. When Stern suggests Schindler hire Jews instead of Poles because they cost less, this means that the Jews themselves get nothing. Their wages go to the Reich. Schindler's Jews are allowed outside the ghetto though, and Stern fabricate documents to guarantee that as many people as possible are deemed essential by the Nazi bureaucracy, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps.

Schindler is not doing any of this to salvage the lives of these people. He's doing it because of the financial benefits. His realization of his advantage to save lives comes slowly as a sincere and valid human evolution and progression. It is an essential unlikely hero story, true, self-effacing without airs, and humbling. It is however current that drives the epic depiction of truly mortifying horrors. There are many scenes even aside from the Krakow ghetto scene that may perhaps create blood clots in your head. Truly the most unforgettable performance is given by Ralph Fiennes, playing SS official Gothe, a relentlessly evil character in the coldest, cruelest sense.",10
21 April 2003,Triumph of the Human Spirit: Spielberg's masterpiece,"SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993) **** Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Embeth Davidtz. Powerful interpretation of Thomas Keneally's novel about the true-life story of German factory enterepreneur Oskar Schindler (portrayed superbly by Neeson, warts and all, and nominated for Best Actor), who saved hundreds of Jews from the Nazis during WWII, by employing them in his war-profiteering enterprise. Excellent acting by the entire cast, specifically Fiennes (Best Supporting Actor nominee) as Amon Goeth, a remarkably complex portrayal of nuanced evil.

Deservingly bestowed with 7 Oscars (including Best Picture), this harrowing documentary-styled monument to the travesties of the Holocaust is Steven Spielberg's (Best Director) masterpiece and is a must see. Shot in starkly haunting black and white by Academy Award-winning cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. One of the greatest motion pictures ever made.

12 January 2007,Heart-wrenching,"World War II is raging. Sleazy socialite and entrepreneur Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson) arrive in Poland and create his own kitchen equipment fabric with an army contract. His competitive plan? Use Jews from the ghetto: they cost less than Poles or Germans. What begins as a profitable business venture will soon suck Schindler into a dark world of madness and genocide, as he discovers not only his true nature, but also, to his horror, the full implications of the nature of his government.

Spielberg had amused and thrilled crowds with a long line of blockbusters before this (few human beings with eyes don't know of E.T., Jaws or Indiana Jones), and had mostly disappointed when trying his hand at more serious material: Color Purple was fair, and Empire of the Sun felt oddly shallow. Being as they weren't really his stories to tell in any case, these films can be excused as mere experiments to prepare Spielberg for this tale which he had held close to his heart for a long time.

What amazes about the story is that, in typical Spielberg fashion, it wastes no time. Each scene has a point, a place, and is maximized, and given the film's length and the nature of its story, the result is positively harrowing. Schindler grows considerably throughout the ordeal: the first cynical and opportunistic businessman starts playing a dangerous psychological game with the commanding Nazi officers, namely Amon Goethe (Fiennes). Seldom has human evil found such a frighteningly real incarnation than Fiennes's horrific officer, whose unpredictable fits of depression or violence keep the viewer constantly unbalanced. Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish book-keeper then confidant gives the film a beautiful heart, and the overall acting is universally excellent. Spielberg never lets his actors down, but Steven Zaillian's screenplay truly is a miracle of character development.

Shot in staggering Black and White, Schindler's List feels like re-living History. it is brutal, intense and heart-wrenching. Spielberg has returned to oppression and war since (in Amistad and Saving Private Ryan) but has never topped this, nor ave most great films in existence.

For one of those rare times, a film is worthy of all the huge praise and hype surrounding it... and then some.",10
21 June 2017,"Humanity at it's best , Inhumanity at it's worse","No words can praise this movie and neither no words can describe the suffering of the people. I cannot even say about imagining it since there is no way other than the survivors who understand what was it like then. Just wan to say , watch this beautiful and incredibly powerful and moving movie. The colour choice was perfect. Just watch thsi , it is long but it is worth every second of your time.

16 November 2003,I can't even watch it,"Because I cry too much for the sadness of WWII. I saw this film through my high school history class. And I remember, I was the only one who sat down quietly watching and crying. And I looked around, and the other kids were either saying ""Pfft. Why is it in black and white?!"" or ""This is boring"". Or laughing at parts when the natzi soldiers would point their guns at the jews and they lifted their hands surrendering. What was so funny? I was in shock on my generation's view of this disaster.

Schinler's List is a classic movie. But I can't watch it. Otherwise, I'll go crazy thinking about what the jews, gypsies, and homosexuals went through.

4 October 2017,Tragedy in the Mainstream,"The P.H. Metric 91/100 Directing: 9/10

A masterclass in direction. Spielberg's connection to the source material pushed him to make something that defies any sort of dilettante criticisms. Every decision from the black and white to the stones hits hard and hits well. Leaving the viewer with a piece that is entertaining, yet horrifically beautiful as well as being the sort of thing any student of cinema should be studying.

Acting: 9/10

Liam Neeson's best role, before he revealed to the world that method acting is not something he subscribes to, which in turn means Liam Neeson plays Liam Neeson every time. The rest of the cast offers more nuanced performances that really provide the viewer with a subdued approach to such horrors, allowing the audience to feel disconnected from the tragedy, yet thrust into its dark world.

Cinematography: 10/10

Red, red, red. Visually perfect.

Editing 10/10

Editing makes a film, it cannot be said enough. Actors and the like get the credit, but editors along with the writers and directors are the heart, spine and brain of a film and this film only furthers to reinforce the fact that actors are far from needed to meld a film into something sublime.

Score: 10/10

Williams provides another stellar score, which raises the question would Spielberg's films be as successful with out them? That said, Williams builds tension that spills morosely over tragedy and celebratory fatigue.

Visual Effects: 8/10

The shower scene aside, the visual effects are done well and kept in the century they are meant to be in and keeps the viewer planted firmly in the time period.

Writing: 8/10

The writing is superb, however it does have one to many touches of the Hollywood penmanship to it, which does cause the film to drift into a territory that feels a little unnatural for the artistic intentions of the piece.

Production Design 9/10

Superb production design, save for a few touches in the concentration camps.

Costume Design 9/10

Authentic and eye catching, though does fall victim to the standard nerd mistakes.

Make-up/Hairstyle 9/10

Several hairstyles feel off for the period and the make-up department does benefit greatly from the black and white.",9

13 April 2008,"Beyond a film: A monument, a memorial, a masterpiece","""Schindler's List"" can best be described as something more than a movie. It is a cinematic exhibit and memorial dedicated to the heroism of Oskar Schindler and the 6 million plus Jews that died in the Holocaust. But don't cheat the film aspect either: this film is brilliantly made and intelligently put together. It is beautiful, smart, touching, haunting and inspiring.

The story is in essence about how Schindler was touched somehow to use his position as a factory director to keep Jews from being exterminated in Auschwitz. The film uses a brilliant non-verbal method to offer reasons why Schindler did what he did. In addition, the film also serves as a historical telling of the events that occurred to a portion of the millions who died or experienced the Holocaust.

Liam Neeson is very strong as Schindler. He doesn't seem all too warm and lovable at first, but eventually you take to him and see him become the hero he was. Ralph Fiennes gives a performance as the Nazi commander Amon Goeth that is simply chilling. Ben Kingsley as Schindler's assistant Yitzchak Stern also adds a great, simple, modest character.

From the technical aspect, John Williams' score is beautiful. The theme is both tragic and hopeful and it's incredible that Yitzchak Pearlman was included in it as the solo violinist. The black and white work (the team of Spielberg and Janusz Kaminski strike again) is beautiful and thoroughly conceived.

""Schindler's List"" is both educational and inspirational. Entertaining does not quite fit in the realm of an appropriate description. It is an experience.",10
22 April 2002,'THE' Best Masterpiece of all Time.,"Its an irony that though I am an avid watcher of good and excellent movies, I only happened to watch this MASTERPIECE in 2002 even though it was produced in 1993.And I am repenting for the nine years I wasted in between, before I watched this MASTERPIECE in an Oscar festival in a local theatre here in Mumbai.

This movie is one of my most favourite masterpieces(mind you,I am saying 'masterpieces' and not 'movies' because I have painfully selected my 'favourite' masterpieces from all the movies I HAVE watched, and then AGAIN filtered and selected my 'personal 40 most favourite MASTERPIECES of all time' from those favourites).

' SCHINDLER'S LIST ' is my choice along with Life Is Beautiful(1997); The Sixth Sense(1999); The Godfather 2(1974); Braveheart(1995); Se7en(1995); Crimson Tide(1995); Unbreakable(2000); Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon(2000); The Great Dictator(1940); Terminator 2:Judgement Day(1991); Dog Day Afternoon(1975); Kramer Vs.Kramer(1979); Saving Private Ryan(1998); Artificial Intelligence(2001); Raging Bull(1980); Philadelphia(1993) and many more ...!

Usually, I don't approve myself of providing ranks to my 'personal 40 Favourite Masterpieces of All Time' but this one is an EXCEPTION and I rank this movie as 'The Number One'.

My humble suggestion : 1. To all those who had the luck of watching this masterpiece before - DON'T WAIT. GO and BUY a CD or a DVD whatever you get your hands on and enjoy this movie for your lifetime. 2. To those who haven't yet watched IT - DON'T WAIT, GO and RENT IT / watch IT in a theatre on the very first chance you get. And now PLEASE don't complaint of not having enough money to buy or even rent it. SELL YOUR CHILDREN IF YOU NEED TO GET MONEY BUT DON'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT NINE YEARS TO WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE. Needless to say, I rate this masterpiece a 10 out of 10.",10
29 July 1998,Quite simply the greatest achievement in movie making this century.,"Well what can I say? It took Spielberg nearly 20 years before they would acknowledge his brilliance, so he just had to create probably the greatest and most important film that this earth has probably seen.

15 April 2008,Just about Flawless but Painful to watch!,"I have seen Schindler's List once and it is more than enough. This film can be too painful to watch at times. Even though my own family survived the war as Polish Catholics, they too still have scars to last more than a lifetime. My one problem with Steven Spielberg is that it's not graphic enough. The war was terrible and almost everybody in Poland was scarred as well. Schindler's List is a difficult film for adults to watch because it is graphic, brutal but all wars both graphic and brutal. Oskar Schindler wasn't so much hero or saint but he was a human being who did an incredible thing by saving thousands. There are others out there who did their part like Raoul Wallenberg. I have to say that if ,Holocaust survivor and Polish Jew, Roman Polanski directed this story to film, it might have been more brutal and graphic or maybe there would be more of a connection. I felt that Spielberg lacked that connection in this film.

29 January 2000,Unforgettable,"In a sentence, this film was excellence. Spielberg depicts the plight of the Jews in the WWII Holocaust era with a frightening amount of detail, and thus ensures that we don't easily forget what they were put through. I liked the way it was shot in B&W, as Spielberg knows that most people have only seen the war in B&W (on TV and the like), which a lot of people seem to fail to realise. Also, when he does add colour, it gives the audience a lasting impression.

The cast was wonderful, the three main leads being excellent in their performances (Neeson, Kingsley and Fiennes) and the supporting cast were just as good. Janusz Kaminski's camerawork was brilliant. John Williams score was incredibly moving, and deserved the Oscar. The music is easily related to Jewish styles of the period. On the whole, a brilliant film, unforgettable, and a lesson to all. It shows that even the most hardened people can change.

18 March 2015,Right at the Top of My List!,"In Schindler's List, we see images that we never thought we would ever see in a non-documentary film. It will kick you in the stomach and not stop until you can't take anymore. It will twist your finger and force you to open your eyes and take in things you would hope to never see in your whole life.

The movie follows the story of Oskar Schindler, an entrepreneur who exploits Krakow Jews, only to later become their friend and redeemer. He keeps thousands of them in his factory and out of the camps while challenging and manipulating the venomous S.S. officer Amon Goeth with the help of his Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern. During its 195 minutes runtime, Schindler undergoes a subtle transformation, from a self-indulgent exploiter of slave labor to savior with a mission and finally to a hero in hiding.

Shot entirely in black and white, Schindler's List is certainly the most intense and uncompromising depiction of the Nazi horror ever to appear in a fiction film. Steven Spielberg directs this poignant drama with an incredible amount of uplifting hope, once again underlining the undeniable splendor of his craft. The detached reticence with which Spielberg captures the Nazis' savagery only adds to that effect. He does not use one trite shot, one forced tear-jerking assemblage. Tears are evoked, but honorably! Initially, the absence of color (with the exception of one haunting, recurring figure) may seem to spare us the gore. But it has the opposite effect: When a guard shoots a kneeling man in the back of the head, the black blood that oozes out is even more unsettling.

Headlining the magnificent cast is the hitherto underrated Liam Neeson who inhabits Schindler with such authority that you cannot envisage any other actor do justice to this 'role of a lifetime'. Ralph Fiennes is simultaneously terrifying and fascinating as the S.S. Officer Amon Goeth. Watch him muse to his Jewish mistress ""I realize that you are not a person in the strictest sense of the word"" and you will be convinced how Fiennes was clearly robbed off his Oscar. The other key part is Schindler's Jewish accountant, played with self-effacing brilliance by Ben Kingsley, who lends the movie just the right amount of warmth.

Marked by a brilliant screenplay and an attitude toward the traumatic subject matter that is both passionately felt and impressively restrained, this is the film to win over Spielberg skeptics.",10
6 August 1998,A beautiful film about the holocaust horror,"Undoubtedly, this is a masterpiece, one of the most recent ones created in cinema history. Can a movie about the holocaust be beautiful? Of course it can, and here we have an example. We have more than three hours of poetry about the human nature, about love, about hate, about madness, about egoism, about altruism, all of them mixed to produce the human being as what it really is. It's a film that cleans our soul, makes us feel like humans, and makes us understand a little bit better the aim of the Human Race. John Williams gave the most beautiful sound-track he ever created to set the emotional background this film needed.

28 December 2007,Recognition for Spielberg long overdue,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",9
14 April 2000,A pure masterpiece,"Schindler's List is not only a pure masterpiece but, for me, it is one of the greatest films ever made in the world.

The film starts off to reveal a womanizing, Nazi business man who profited off of slave labor. The Nazi business man is of course Oskar Schindler. Oskar is just like most men. He has a love for good wine, beautiful women, and pursues happiness through the success of his business. But on his journey to a successful business, millions of Jews were being killed during a time which most label as one of the darkest periods of human history. As Oskar made money, innocent people were being murdered. That's when the self-centered, often money hungry Oskar steps in and gives up his goal of having a successful business to save the lives of over 1,000 Jews.

This film is about redemption and was beautifully photographed in black and white by Janusz Kaminski (cinematographer). At the helm is no one other than Steven Spielberg, who brilliantly called non-pretentious shots and brought back to life a time and period most want to forget, but shouldn't. This film is a must see by me. I give the film an ""A+"" (wishing I could give it a higher grade than that) and a 10 out of 10...",10
6 April 2014,Feels short at over three hours,"Schindler's List is a film that will no doubt forever grace the endless 'Best Movies' lists trumped up by various organisations and movie magazines. It's serious subject matter, black-and-white photography, rousing score and 'directed by Steven Spielberg' tag has cemented it's status as one of the best American movies of all time. But the more hardened movie-goer will more than likely pick holes in it, and tell you that this in fact not even Spielberg's greatest achievement. Which is why, 21 years after it's release, I decided to revisit Schindler's List, and although I would agree that Spielberg has made better (he did make Jaws (1975) after all), this is still a masterful work, a wonderfully mature step-up for the film-maker who had, up to 1993, leaned towards the visual spectacle of David Lean and Howard Hawks.

The Holocaust is now very much a roll-your-eyes focus for a film-maker, easily passed off as a desperate plea for awards and serious recognition, and the Oscar are routinely stacked with movies portraying this appalling historical event. But Spielberg's movie was the first one brave enough to show it for what it was - a sickening, bloody event that humiliated its victims and where the life of a Jew was worth less than the work the Nazi's could squeeze out of them before they were routinely disposed of. Documentaries such as Night and Fog (1955) and Shoah (1985) hit hard, much more so than in this movie, but Schindler's List feels like a documentary come to life, with Janusz Kaminski's cinematography giving the movie a sense of timelessness.

Liam Neeson is Oskar Schindler, a Czechoslovakian opportunist looking to use cheap Jewish labour during World War II to make him enough money to help him retire a very wealthy man. He employs Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kinsley) to hire his workers and run his factory for him, at first making kitchen utensils to be used in the war. After witnessing the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto under the direction of SS- Untersturmfuhrer Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), in which many Jews are massacred, Schindler is profoundly affected. He begins to lavish gifts and bribes upon Goeth in order to protect his workers from being murdered, but as the Germans begin to lose the war, Goeth receives the orders to move the Jews from his camp onto Auschwitz.

Made the same year as his CGI blockbuster Jurassic Park, Schindler's List showed an unseen maturity in Spielberg's work. He had made 'serious' films before, but they were always in the style of classic Hollywood; grand, sweeping epics that were generally homages to better directors. Here, Spielberg is invisible, his hand nowhere to be seen until one of the final scenes. This was film-making closer to Italian neo-realism, with hand-held cameras, bleak cinematography, and a glorious lack of sentimentality. Rather than make you weep into a tissue, he has you looking away from the screen in utter shock. Hundreds of naked Jews are humiliated as decisions are made on their ability to work and Goeth coldly shoots workers with a rifle from his balcony before breakfast. In one of its most famous scenes, a group of women are led into a shower room that may just be a gas chamber. It's one of the most terrifying sequences in recent memory.

Spielberg wisely chose relatively unknown actors to fill the roles. Neeson, now inexplicably an action star, brings a complexity to Schindler as he changes between smug womaniser and Nazi suck-up to a man capable of great kindness and selflessness, and the film isn't afraid to show the darker side of his character. Kingsley, who was known for his Oscar-winning role in Gandhi (1982), is Schindler's consciousness, a constant reminder of the atrocities that were being committed outside of Schindler's comfortable bubble. As Amon Goeth, one of cinema's most memorable villains, Ralph Fiennes steals the film. He is a hypocritical, loathsome psychopath, embodying the sense of self-righteousness of the Nazi power trip. He despises the Jews, and preaches about their extermination, yet falls in love with his servant Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz), only to beat her in his disgust.

Although there are better films out there that focus on World War II or the Holocaust, it is of no surprise that this is still one of Spielberg's most revered films. It is a brave, accomplished film that gives you a sense that this was the film the director was always meant to make. However, he seems unable to resist stamping his recognisable dose of sentimentality at the climax, as Schindler breaks down in front of his workers wishing he did that little bit more. It's an unnecessarily slushy scene, a piece of director self-indulgence in what is damn near a perfect film, that, if anything, lessens the brutal impact of what came before. But this is a staunch reminder of the atrocities that humanity is capable of, and, as all great movies do, feels incredibly short at over three hours.

20 September 1999,"A Tragic, Inspiring, Important Film","I almost dare not ""review"" or ""comment"" on this film. However, I will, because this is a film everyone should see. It is dramatic, emotional and noble, and handles the most difficult subject of the 20th century without giving a sermon.

Schindler's List is clearly Speilberg's best - the best he will ever do - and is one the great films of all time. It is an experience, not just a movie. Those who hate it or dislike it, I challenge you to watch it again and question your feelings. Did it disturb you? Did it frighten you? I think that it is near impossible to dislike this movie - only to be bothered by it.

The fact is that this film deals in truth. It graphically portrays a dark, dark chapter in human history, and provides deep insight into the role hatred played in WWII. This is a movie that will make you question the world we live in and make you feel sorry to be a part of the species that let this happen.

Note also, that there is no great sermon on why genocide is wrong or why the Nazis must be stopped. Schindler's heart is opened by what he sees and experiences - no-one needs to tell him that killing is wrong.

Pretty bleak, but pretty accurate. But under the thematic elements is a great film. Extraordinary acting, especially Ralph Fiennes as the psychotic Amon Goeth. Janusz Kaminky's cinematography is amongst the best ever seen.

Without spoiling, I can say that this is the singularly most horrifying movie I have ever seen. It disturbed me for days. I recommend this movie to everyone. It will entertain you, but also educate you, but mostly, it is an important film that will make you examine your own life. As dark as it is, this is a movie of hope and survival. **** out of ****.",
30 March 2011,Spielberg's successful attempt at a serious drama,"At the time of this film's release, while he was the undisputed commercial king of cinema, Steven Spielberg had never been considered a 'serious' film-maker. With the exception of The Colour Purple he was known as a director of big-budget B-pictures. Many people criticized his films for being too syrupy and child-like. With the notable exceptions of Duel and Jaws this wasn't necessarily an unfair assessment. While his vision was unerringly on the pulse of the mainstream, it rarely had any edge whatsoever. So with the release of Schindler's List, Spielberg was able to offer something pretty bleak and hard-hitting. He was also rewarded at the Academy Awards, which was another thing he craved desperately.

The book by Thomas Keneally from which the film was adapted is a masterful and deeply disturbing account of true events in Nazi occupied Poland. It takes a documentary approach to events, as it is all from real accounts. It was, therefore, the sort of novel that had to be treated with the utmost respect if it was to be translated to the screen with any success. It has to be said that Spielberg was largely very successful in this challenge, and his film remains a powerful telling of this most harrowing, if ultimately uplifting, of tales. He wisely decided to film it in stark black and white which lends an immediate bleakness to proceedings and recalls old footage from the Second World War. When he does decide to inject a bit of colour, as in the little girl in the red coat, it works in bringing out the appalling tragedy of this little girl's life even more ‚Äì it doesn't seem gimmicky. Another major plus for the film is in the performances. Liam Neeson has the right blend of charisma and humanity as Oskar Schindler but best of all is Ralph Fiennes as the camp commandant Amon Goeth; he played this character with extreme skill and brought to the screen a strangely complex presence. I certainly wouldn't go as far as to say Fiennes's Goeth was sympathetic ‚Äì he was vile ‚Äì but his underlying impulses and insecurities had interesting depth to say the least.

On the whole Spielberg handles things very well here. His trademark schmaltz is thankfully absent, and he does not hold back when he needs to ramp things up and show atrocities. Quite often Schindler's List is very unpleasant, and the director wisely doesn't sugar-coat things. The only place where he breaks is in Schindler's closing speech at the factory. This moment was melodramatic and totally unnecessary. The events depicted up to that point had been faithfully told from a historical point-of-view and they did not need that invented moment of emotional manipulation; what had gone before spoke for itself. This minor slip-up aside, Schindler's List did prove that Spielberg was capable to making serious films when he put his mind to it.",9
17 October 2007,Sears itself into the memory - both emotionally flooring and undeniably uplifting,"Films detailing the tragic events of the Holocaust more often than not tend to descend into ill-advised and horrifyingly clich√©d anti-war lectures, so the notion of Steven Spielberg, debatably the founding father of the blockbuster, helming a WW2 epic may not always have been an ideal prospect, for fear that the gritty realism of the period may have been lost beneath a shiny veneer of Hollywood gloss. Needless to say, such doubts are near instantly dispelled upon viewing Schindler's List, which, while refusing to shy away from the horrific realism of the period, manages to extract moments of genuine glimmering hope out of the darkness, managing to stand out as both one of the most emotionally draining yet exhilarating and uplifting films of its kind.

Dispelling all potential skepticism, Spielberg proves himself entirely the right man for the job, and Schindler's List is arguably one of his very strongest and most effective films to date. The film sears itself into the viewer's memory, with many haunting images proving inescapable, from the jarring sound of sporadic Nazi gunshots to the despairing moan of thousands of Jews crowded into a ghetto. Spielberg's effortless manipulation of the audience's emotions is laudable indeed, as is his masterful pacing between the atrocities of war and the small moments of comfort which prevent the film from descending into complete darkness. Complimented by a typically moving and beautiful musical score by John Williams, the film perfectly counterbalances despair with hope, creating a truly compelling and moving portrait of one of humanity's darker hours.

The historical accuracy of the film is similarly laudable - the immaculate period costumes and expansive set design are pitch perfect, and all beautifully rendered in pristine black and white cinematography, a refreshing diversion from the colour saturated contemporary film industry. And while the film's hefty three and a quarter hour running time may be a source of complaint, it serves only to further immerse the audience within the context and period, allowing the emotional drama to resonate all the more. It would seem Spielberg was not content to simply provide audiences with a film, and instead settles for an experience - an emotional epic with an uncanny ability to draw an audience in, capture their sympathies and churn them out with a tear in their eye yet a smile on their face in a nearly peerless fashion. And despite the film's undeniable occasional forays into melodrama and clich√© (Schindler's breakdown near the end, tearfully declaring that he could have saved more is a bit much...) it is difficult to turn one's nose up at so captivating and heartfelt a film as this.

Liam Neeson gives a career defining performance as the benevolent Oskar Schindler, and his gentle charisma and subtle intensity perfectly compliment the many facets (womaniser, enterpriser and saviour of thousands of innocent lives) of such a monumental role. Ben Kingsley is similarly impressive as Itzhak Stern, the Jewish manager of Schindler's factory. In a role which would normally entail typical Hollywood grandstanding, Kingsley instead embraces the realism of the character with subtly churning emotions, and his performance is all the more masterfully crafted as consequence. However, despite the stellar work of the main two stars, both pale in comparison with the magnetic Ralph Fiennes, effortlessly stealing the show as impassive yet impulsively murderous Nazi official Amon Goeth. Fiennes' chilling intensity is truly a spectacle to behold, and it is nearly worth seeing the film just for his performance - one of the most haunting, but ultimately human antagonistic faces ever associated with the Holocaust. Caroline Goodall gives a strong performance as Schindler's neglected wife, and Embeth Davidtz is genuinely moving as Helen Hirsch, a Jewish slave working who attracts the fancy of the monstrous Goeth.

Throughout the years, Schindler's List has been widely celebrated as one of the most powerful, draining yet uplifting films in recent memory, and upon viewing it, this status is difficult to contend. While the film may toe the line of melodrama at times, and the running time may be enough to dispel some potential viewers, the blistering emotional clout and historical poignancy make Spielberg's labour of love easily worth watching for anyone willing to undergo the admittably difficult and draining watch. Out of all the second world war films out there, Schindler's List stands out as debatably the most engrossing and ultimately uplifting of the lot, proving that in the midst of darkness and despair, genuine human emotion can still be celebrated.

17 January 2015,Excruciating masterpiece,"Greetings from Lithuania.

To call ""Schindler's List"" a great movie would be a huge underestimating. This is simply one of the best motion pictures of all time. I know it sounds banal but truth is simple - ""Schindler's List"" is a masterpiece. No matter what are your believes, not matter what is your life experience or anything else - this is a monumental movie experience. Probably no other movie in my life grabbed my so hard, delivered me to the place and made me experience events so purely as ""Schindler's List"" did.

This is a movie making at it's very best. Everything in this movie works on highest level for some simple reasons - to get the knowledge and to learn. Learn from our past, learn from our unforgivable mistakes and to witness a descent humanity in the most ruthless places of our times.

I won't going to start to admire this movie craftsmanship. It's brilliant. Everything here combines to a one excruciating masterpiece. One who will experience ""Schindler's List"" won't going to ever forget it. This is a timeless masterpiece. And one of the most sticking things that ever haunted me was that this picture was created in Hollywoood, by Steven Spielberg who at the time was mostly known for mainstream blockbuster experiences. How could they come up with such an idea and most important how could they created this kind of a movie, which doesn't represent popular teams and tones is still beyond me. I guess, true art find it's way, and for this motion picture Steven Spielberg will be remembered forever.

Overall, if you haven't experienced ""Schindler's List"" by now, do your self a favor and witness this masterpiece ASAP. I'm writing this review from a country which is neighboring country to Poland. I'm so grateful to a simple luck that i wasn't born and wasn't there when these unthinkable events have happened. And my honest sympathy for those whom it has ever affected.",10
30 June 2006,A very well done Halucaust movie.,"I didn't see this movie till recent. But I've been told it's violent and very well received back in 1993. I'm 17 so it was OK for me to see a movie like this.

Anyways Schindler's List takes place during WW2. And those who attended history class would know that Adolf Hitler had total control in most parts of Europe and banned all Jewish activity and removed all the Jewish from their homelands. It was the grimmer moment in the entire Jewish history.

A man named Oscar Schindler was a business man and a Nazi. Only he was different from other Nazis. He provides the Jews work at his company only if they have working experience. Schindler in secretly does not kill or torture any Jews. He finds the whole thing wrong in a way. But he doesn't adment it because he's might receive serious consciences if he were to say he likes Jews.

He makes sure his Jews aren't killed or sent to the more lethal concentration camps by making a list of hundreds of Jews that he bought with his own money. With that list he could be able to grant their freedom by the time the war is over.

This movie is very well made. Spielberg did a great job in recreating this time period. I can see why it was given an Oscar during the 1993 Accadmy Awards. It's also interesting that 3/4s of the movie is shot in Black and White.

It's strongly recommended for any Spielberg collection. Just know this movie isn't for everyone. It has swearing, violence, and some strong nudity. It's not for kids so I'd recommend it for ages 16 and up or at least someone mature enough to see a violent movie.

It might offend certain Jews or those who are offended by Nazis as well.",8
20 August 2003,powerful stuff,"Steven really went to bat for this one. An amazing film. Top of the lot performances in and out. Ralph Fiennes was brilliant. Wish the ending, though, wasn't as sentimental; because what made the picture such as classic for the majority was the fact that it treated the events with such indifference.

1 January 2012,"""Not the work ‚Äì the presentation""","One of the benefits of our modern day cinema (and by modern, I mean last forty-odd years) is that movies can be made with complete frankness. The more difficult segments of history can be recreated with some accuracy. Schindler's List deals with subject matter so sensitive, and tells one of the most important stories of the entire century, that the makers absolutely have to get it right, on every level. Thankfully, they did.

Screenwriter Steve Zaillian has taken on the difficult task of adapting a work of non-fiction. Much of the picture is simply a series of vignettes, most not strictly necessary to the plot, the sort of material that has been cut for reasons of space in a thousand lesser pictures. But they contribute to an overall tone ‚Äì each has its own meaning, and to cut one would make for a poorer film. Although it of course follows real events as closely as possible, great care is taken with the rate at which we are exposed to the magnitude of horror. The first two deaths we see ‚Äì the one-armed man and the civil engineer ‚Äì are painfully shocking. But by the time we get to the ransacking of the ghetto we are desensitised to the killing, immersed in this world where the ending of life is a casual act. Lines of dialogue which at first seem trivial gain resonance later on. When meeting with the black marketers Schindler tells them ""Nice things cost money"". Eventually he will be buying human lives.

In evaluations of Schindler's List, so often the importance of the man who portrayed the title role is forgotten. Liam Neeson's performance perhaps doesn't stand out too much because it is very low-key, and the character is almost passive for all his significance. But this makes Neeson's work all the more impressive. He puts all of Schindler's emotion, all his thought, into this restrained fa√ßade. Schindler was a man who essentially spent the whole war keeping up a pretence, albeit for altruistic purposes, that he was a good party member and practical businessman, and Neeson handles this contradiction flawlessly. When he allows the floodgates to open in his final scene, the effect is devastating.

Steven Spielberg famously offered this project to a number of directors before deciding to take on the job himself. It could have been disastrous ‚Äì his direction is appalling in The Color Purple, his first real drama ‚Äì but in the intervening years he had improved considerably. For Schindler's List he takes an incredibly indirect approach, his camera often separated from the action or just focusing briefly on hands and objects, as if the material is somehow distant and difficult to fully engage with. Despite this distancing effect, Spielberg proves himself a master at picking out the important detail in each shot. To give one example, when we first see Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, he is right at the back of a room with a dozen or so people in, but Spielberg has arranged everyone into diagonals so that our eyes are drawn straight to Kingsley. Spielberg's utter simplicity and lack of camera trickery are commendable. His careful pacing of scenes makes those all-important lines stand out, and emphasises the life in the people.

And this ‚Äì the life ‚Äì is essentially what Schindler's List is about. I didn't really intend to comment on the issues in the picture because I wanted to discuss it mainly as an example of perfection in filmmaking. But like any movie Schindler's List is not without its detractors, and sometimes people do miss the point. Spielberg has been accused of sugar-coating the holocaust, of taking this horrible event in history and making an uplifting story out of it. Of course, the Nazis did many more terrible things which the movie does not show, and it does end upon a note of hope. But the truth is, Schindler's List is not the story of the holocaust. It is the story of Oskar Schindler, a man who saved lives. The tragedies that occurred in Europe are the backdrop to this story, and the realities that Spielberg offers us a modest window onto are nonetheless graphic enough to give it meaning. This is not primarily a picture about the evil that went on, it is about the good that existed in spite of that evil. And if ever there was something worth making a motion picture about, it is this.",10
25 November 2012,Must Be 100 Out Of 100,"The best. I mean it. I am not a Jew, but a Russian-Polish, and am very Pro-Semite. Still, I waited to see this film for many years, as I felt I was not yet ready. But now, I have seen it and am so deeply impressed that I cannot express my utmost gratitude well. Spielberg is a genius here, as he always is. He made a strikingly great work, so deep and so tragic. Its black and white scheme made it even better and deeper. All who played there are truly tremendous. Neeson, Fiennes, Kingsley - just even them three made it so brilliant. This is a movie that must be seen and taught at schools as a great reminder of utter horrors of Holocaust. I am deeply moved to tears, especially by the final scene which is so good, so tender, so gentle and so Powerful. Need I say more? This is a masterpiece

18 June 2007,"Great and powerful movie, Liam Neeson at his best!","Steven Spielberg makes one of (if not the one) his greatest movies of all time. Liam Neeson gives a great performance as Schindler and the whole film is just powerful, amazing and sad but it doesn't matter because the movie is so good. Ralph Fiennes makes an even better performance as Goeth, a man who made everyone stare into the screen with anger and sadness and that is just what a movie is supposed to do-make you feel sad, happy, angry or effect you in some way. I read that someone thought it was overrated and bad, but I think it's a classic and it'll never go away. So if you want to see one of the greatest historical films ever made, then go see Schindler's List.

EDIT: I wrote this when I was 12 or 13, and I'm so sorry about my AWFUL English... Ah, well just have that in mind when you read this. =)

31 January 2016,An Excellent Film on Holocaust.......,"Actually I had watched this film 13-14 years ago. But that time I got pretty distracted and couldn't grasp much of the film. After watching it again, I must say it's a remarkable film which comes once in a while. Based on the true events of the holocaust, the film is like a well written book which can serve as a quality time to anyone striving for a brilliant work of art.

Well, many nice films have been made on Jews concentration camps like ""Life Is Beautiful,"" ""The Pianist,"" or the most recent ""The Boys on Striped Pyjamas."" Indeed all the movies were brilliant, but they saw holocaust through individual character. But ""Schindler's List"" gives a holistic account of the history for which the film stretches for over 3 hours and uses monochromatic colors to give the periodic feel. Despite the over-length, every scene of the film remains compulsively watchable till the end credits. Every scene presents a cinematic excellence in depicting the story of a greedy industrialist who saves over 1100 Jews from the concentration camps. His uplift of the spirit from greed to human compassion, seeing the atrocities of Nazis, is brilliantly realized.

The bloodshed in the film starts with a single execution which slowly shifts to mass killings during the liquidation of ghettos showing the brutality done to humankind, which just leaves you horrified. The grit and the depressing environment the film creates is pretty touching and many moments of the film raises the feelings of humanity for which the film becomes a well felt heart touching saga. For focusing the story. the film keeps a low profile with much unknown cast and avoids sentimentality and gloss till the very end. Overall, the film remains a landmark for the ages to come; and it deserves to be archived as one of the immortal film makings of all time.

Rating: 4 stars out of 4",10
15 April 2000,Great movie,"Many movies come out each year and we applaud them for their screen play, orginality and whatever else we can say about a movie. But only once in a long while does one come out and you say all those nice things, but one you will also never forget. This movie is more than just something for us to watch for 3 hours and 17 minutes, it is something for us to never forget, to teach us a lesson and to remember those who died needlessly along with those who tried to help those same people survive.

*Review: Schindler's List is probably one of the best movies that I have ever seen and ever made. What's really good about this movie is the acting. Liam Neeson proves that he can act and he should have won a Oscar for his performance as Oskar Schindler. Ralph Fiennes also gives a great performance and should have won a Oscar for his performance as Amon Goeth but since the academy doesn't give awards to actors that play as bad people is dumb. What I really liked about this movie is how the whole movie is shot in black and white it just makes the movie even better. While your watching this movie you feel really emotional inside. Everything about this movie is just perfect from the acting, cinematography, musical score, writing, and directing. This movie is intense, emotional, and apiece of art. In one word I can describe this movie ""MASTERPIECE"". This is probably one of Spielberg's best movies he has directed. Schindler's List is a movie that everyone should see once in their life.

12 February 2004,Superlative,"This is a superb true story starring a superb actor in a wonderful production. This film certainly deserves all the accolades it's received and probably then some. Liam Neeson is perfectly cast in this story of a German industrialist who risked everything to save at least a few Jews from the death camps. Outstanding in every way! This is a future classic film and one to buy and keep!

23 January 2013,Powerful Film!,"""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.""

'Schindler's list is about the true story of Czech born Oskar Schindler, a businessman who tried to make his fortune during the Second World War by exploiting cheap Jewish labour, but ended up penniless having saved over 1000 Polish Jews from almost certain death during the holocaust.'

Steven Spielberg's best film, by far! His camera work in the film is unique.40% of this film is used with a hand-held camera. There were no steadicams or crane shots used. His efforts were to make it look more like a documentary and his effects were great! The black and white effect used only adds to the depression. The editing of colour throughout is very powerful, examples include the candles burning, the girl in the red coat and the ending sequence.

The acting presented is amazing. Liam Neeson brings an Academy Award worthy performance to the screen. His transition from a greedy business man to humanitarian is marvellous. Ralph Fiennes is also great in the film. He plays Amon Goeth, an SS officer who is sadistic and psychopathic, frequently murdering his prisoners for fun. A performance not many can accomplish. Ben Kingsley is amazing portraying Itzhak Stern. He makes my favourite scene. As Stern figures out that Schindler is using his own money to rescue Jews, his face expression says it all. Very emotional.

The Score in this film is magic. In my opinion, it's the music that brings out the most of the emotion in the film. John Williams is brilliant!

Schindler's List will not only go down as the best holocaust film ever made but one of the best films in the history of cinema.",9
7 September 1999,Appreciate it - but do so for the right reasons,"Steven Spielberg was wrong about the subject matter of his own film. It's no more `about' the holocaust than it's `about' Eastern Europe. It's about Oscar Schindler. More to the point: it's about an amoral small-time capitalist with neither more nor less compassion than most other people, who finds himself as surprised as anyone when cruel and unusual circumstances mould him into a hero. It's about a man led to the path of morality as much by his belly as by his heart. It's a study in the banality of goodness. I don't know how many other people have used that phrase, but there's no better way of putting it.

It's the job of documentaries, not fiction, to teach us about the past. `Schindler's List' is not a lesson about the what happened to European Jews under Nazi rule - at any rate, it's not a particularly good lesson. It's fiction. I'm not, of course, saying that it's false - I gather most of it is true. Nor am I saying that it can't teach us a lesson of another kind. When Superman saves a thousand people we can always say, `That's all very well, but I can't leap tall buildings in a single bound; and anyway, Superman is supernaturally virtuous.' When someone as flawed as Oscar Schindler saves a thousand people it's not so easy to make excuses.

There's a good story here. Many people do some of their best work in telling it. I don't think that Neeson, Fiennes or Spielberg have ever performed better than they do here, and John Williams writes fine music in an understated style he hasn't used for a while. But it's really the story that makes the movie. Spielberg, in thinking that he's making a kind of documentary, sometimes lets the story down - every single use of colour is an intrusion, and anyone who's read the book will find that sections have been transferred flatly, with a palette knife, to the screen. Probably this film has been praised a little more than it deserves. Oh, well. Excess praise will be washed away with time.

One minor point: when the book was first published in Australia, it was called `Schindler's Ark'. `Schindler's List' is the (inferior) American title. Sadly, after the success of the film the book was called `Schindler's List' even here. Spielberg could have called his film `Schindler's Monocle' - or anything at all - and publishers would have dutifully re-named the book. It's a pity he didn't use his power to restore the original title.",10
23 March 2000,As good as you will ever see...,"To me, this one is Speilberg's best. He won the Oscar he shoulda had for ET in '82 or Raiders the year before. Intense, extremely moving, real, very well acted, stark, unsettling, shattering end.

I have seen this once. It was a true classic in every sense of the word. By all means, do see it-not for kids. They should make one like this every year, but of course that's impossible.

18 March 2004,"""Schindler's List"": Film as Testament","It won't be very long before the last survivors of the Holocaust as well as their rescuers are dead. Their children will, with varying degrees of passion and understanding, repeat stories long told or wonder about experiences barely hinted at. Then that generation too will be gone and the dense record will largely interest those committed to studying history, a minority.

Film can have much to say about the world that not so very long ago convulsed with the agony of a war that included among its terrors unprecedented state-directed genocide committed with, for its time, cruelly efficient technology. Steven Spielberg produced a masterpiece with 1993's ""Schindler's List"" and it will remain a painful, at times agonizing, recreation of a very special craziness.

Winner of many awards including the Oscar for Best Picture, the cast brings to life an enigmatic and, probably, not very likable man, German small-time industrialist Oskar Schindler. Schindler profited from the war and he was a skirt-chaser of extraordinarily ravenous tastes. What set him apart was his rescue of some 1100 Jews from the jaws of the Nazi extermination apparatus. Compared to the tally of the murdered this seems a small number but every life is precious and Schindler did what he could.

Why did he set about rescuing people destined for the gas chambers or death through individual murder or, simply, by overwork? No one really knows including the survivors themselves. One has been quoted as saying that everytime he asked Schindler about his motives during postwar encounters he got a different and incomplete answer.

Perhaps Schindler himself never knew. But results are more important than reasons.

There have been some notable films about Nazis, concentration camps and genocide. Some like ""Life is Beautiful"" reflect too much development of a star and seem almost obscenely clean, even with the killings. ""The Pianist"", a recent fine example, shows the suffering of a gifted and wounded man against a supporting backdrop of horror.

In ""Schindler's List,"" the hopelessness of the victims stretches from frame to frame and the first senseless killings seamlessly lead to a growing orgy of dehumanization. Liam Neeson is extraordinary as the German factory owner and Ralph Fiennes as the SS concentration camp commander is both repulsive and fascinating as a warped man whose violence ebbs and flows without any rational inciting events.

Some dismiss Fiennes' character as one-dimensional and unreal but, in fact, any study of SS types who commanded those camps reveal the same split personalities: people who could be fine family men before setting off to work to superintend mass murder, stopping on the way to commit the occasional individual atrocity.

The DVD release has been digitally enhanced and the sound is crisp. Spielberg declined to provide the usual extras found on most DVD releases, stating that his original film should speak for itself. But augmenting the movie is a documentary where some who survived because of Schindler recount their experiences. It must not be missed: some of these voices are already stilled-all will be soon.

A very unusual item in the DVD edition is an envelope soliciting contributions to keep the memory of the Holocaust alive and to teach its lessons to young people increasingly remote from the war. The solicitation is appropriate-I'm posting a check.

Tonight was my third viewing, the first at home on DVD. An amazing, disturbing, brilliant film that will continue through the decades to be invaluable.

16 April 2004,Schindler's List: 8/10,"Eventually, I would have had to have seen Schindler's List. Not only was it a staple in modern filmmaking, but I'm also Jewish and have been taught all about the Holocaust. I like Spielberg, and I can sit through long movies (although I did watch the movie in three pieces), so I plunked this newly released DVD into my player and was treated to an adventure, the likes of which I had never seen before.

Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a German during World War II. All he cares about is money, and runs a business while the height of the Nazi regime in Poland is taking place. He realizes that he can save money on hiring Jews instead of Poles to work in his factory (since the Jews would be taken from the concentration camps, they would not really require much, if any, pay). After some pleading from his wife and his desire to hold onto his accountant, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kinglsey), Schindler decides to make a list of Jews to save from certain death to work in his factory.

Quite obviously, this movie will have different effects on different people, much like the recent Passion of the Christ did. Those who had relatives who were captured by the Nazis, or knew someone, or were alive at the time, or anything of the like, would be much more affected by this film than others. I found myself horrified by many of the atrocities brutally shown, especially ones done by Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes). It's amazing, how you can be so affected by gruesomeness done to characters you know nothing about.

On a lesser side, I found many scenes to be unnecessary and uninteresting. They only added to the already obscenely long runtime. Also, the character of Goeth, when not brutalizing Jews, seemed to become perfectly normal and balanced. Goeth seemed duplicitous, and therefore somewhat unbelievable. Neeson was good, but Kingsley was excellent. One more thing that bothered me was the girl in the red dress. Filmed in almost all black-and-white, there's some sort of symbolism there, but there's no telling what it is.

Overall, Schindler's List is an important film, and a tough one to get through, but what you'll get out of it will differ from what others will.

My rating: 8/10

Rated R for war violence and language.",8
9 May 2017,A truly terrifying picture.,"Schindler's List is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Kingsley, Caroline Goodall, Jonathan Sagalle and Embeth Davidtz.

In German-occupied Poland during World War II, Oskar Schindler gradually becomes concerned for his Jewish workforce after witnessing their persecution by the Nazi Germans.

Steven Spielberg's horrifically harrowing Schindler's List isn't just a critically acclaimed, award-winning masterpiece. This is a documentary of real life events, a truly terrifying picture which chronicles The Holocaust, within the most destructive period of our time. A time that must never be repeated. Captured masterfully in black-and-white celluloid with hand-held cameras, Schindler's List follows Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a German industrialist who begins to feel concerned for his Jewish workforce, leading to an emotionally captivating story that evolves continuously as Steven Zaillian's beautiful screenplay culminates to one of Schindler's final heartbreaking lines: ""I could have got more out. I could have got more. I don't know. If I'd just I could have got more.""

Liam Neeson showcases a raw talent as Schindler, performing skilfully throughout. Every line is delivered with absolute care and feels entirely realistic. His interactions with Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) are some of the greater scenes in the film, most specifically the creation of the list. Kingsley has always proved himself an incredible supporting act. Ralph Fiennes also plays alongside Neeson as Amon Goeth, a ruthless and negligent SS captain who murders for sport. Eventually, Goeth is told that power is in fact to never kill, but pardon a man. It never truly connects with him, but continues his work with it in mind. This is one of Fiennes' greatest, most pre-eminent performances to date.

The decision to shoot the film in black-and-white only catapults the 'documentary tone' that Spielberg sets out to achieve, and in doing so creates an eerie experience for viewers. There's one scene in particular that uses colour for a little girl's red coat, as she stumbles through a disturbing site of bloody murder whilst Schindler keeps a close eye. This scene essentially serves as the brutal realisation for Schindler, and becomes one of the most iconic scenes in film history. A simply breathtaking use of colour within a black-and-white picture. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski expresses his enduring adroitness with excellent execution.

John Williams' haunting score captures the horrors of war as violinist Itzhak Perlman performs every single note with intricate skill. The main theme is pleasing to the ears but when paired with Spielberg's picture, it's painfully distressing, traumatic, even disturbing. 'Jewish Town' continues that same feeling, but explores Williams & Perlman's impeccable talent further. This is a fine example of the perfect film score.

Verdict; It may be a tough subject and a difficult experience to bear, but Schindler's List is a film to be seen by all.

26 January 2007,Image of a story teller's soul,"A very difficult film. Any definition is venturesome, any praise is strange or shallow. At final, it is not a movie or adaptation of an existence but a subtle form of catharsis. This movie is source of a special experience. And the causes are numerous:

1) It is an artistic masterpiece. Light, images, acting, script and silence, nuances of tragedy and delicate suggestions are pieces of a fascinating approach. So, it is result of a deep and powerful sentiment and Spielberg is the gorgeous sculptor of its.

2} The story is old and aching. The Shoah is not a Jewish or German problem or result of propaganda. The good and the evil are elements, in that crime, not of ethics or faith, education or fear, mercy or public image but seal of atrocious ambiguity. And this vagueness is fundamental part of our world. In fact,it is essence of its conscience. So, the irrational brutality of Goeth is only clich√©. The bad Nazi, cruel, sarcastic and bizarre is rotten puppet of a death period. After ""The Night of the Generals"" this character type is absurd.

3} Fundamental value of film is the subtle art of suggest a reality out of any description's form. Images are poor shadow of a crime without limit or reason. And this suggestion is represented by Neeson's acting; the metamorphose of an ordinary business man in a hero part of his mission.

4} The interpretation of Sir Ben Kingsley is touching. His character is heard of a miracle and the tension, fear, expectation and force of gestures, the short words and the look transforms Itzhak Stern in conscience of fight for some people for who to survive is fragile dream.

5} The option for monochrome image is essence of its perfect beauty. The mixture between ashes and human ash, between lead, tension and free cruelty of irrational monstrosity , plans of escape and lies gives form of a wold's fragile definition .

6} It is a great masterpiece for the sensitivity of looking. The film is a remember and a decent homage for a special hero and for his strange war. But not story is important. The only virtue, the real virtue is the image of story teller's spirit reflected in each syllable of tale.",
26 January 2012,"Schindler's List (1993) - This List is an Absolute Good, Mr. Spielberg!","Known to all audiences as one of the greatest movies ever made, ""Schindler's List"" is biographical drama of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand Polish-Jews during the Holocaust, and employing them in his factories. This could affect the lives of many Jews during this terrible event in history. With a 3-hour running time, a marvelous script, and a breathtaking directing duty from the legendary Steven Spielberg, ""Schindler's List"" is one of the greatest movies ever made on screen. Liam Neeson delivers his best performance as Oskar Schindler, and this guy really brings truth and charm to his character, and it lets you see that he has transformed into this iconic figure. Ralph Fiennes portrays a scene-stealing performance as SS-officer Amon Goth, with a cruel villainy to his character that is just awesome to watch on screen. Ben Kingsley, Embeth Davidtz, and Caroline Goodall round up the supporting cast, and they all create a powerful casting ensemble. Director Steven Spielberg succeeds once again, directing such a fine masterpiece, that led him to two Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture. This film may be lacking for the first couple of hours, but it does not change the fact that this movie is a sensational piece of work. Some moments make you furious, some moments make you cry, and this is the type of movie that you are going to feel bad about, but you'll still enjoy it. The art direction is sensational, the editing is superb, the cinematography is just masterful, and John Williams' score is completely breathtaking. But it's Spielberg himself that guides this movie. His directing has made a big impact on the face of cinema, and he improves once again, making one of the greatest films he has ever made. This movie is dramatic and heartbreaking, but this also a challenging and emotionally moving motion picture, and Spielberg never disappoints.

19 April 2000,Lest we forget...,"Steven Spielberg on the holocaust. Naturally the kids are cute even as they are diving into the excrement-filled waters of the latrine to hide from the Nazis... Schindler, played believably by big, handsome Liam Neeson (he was the guy Whoopi Goldberg was panting over at the Oscars last month) is a sweet womanizer who exploits Jewish labor in his factories and then feels guilty about it and ends up saving the lives of eleven hundred. Ben Kingsley plays his accountant with precision and his usual subdued intensity. We have again all the Nazi horror, in some ways worst than ever, and rightly so. Here we see a lot of the random shooting of people. The Nazis just use them for target practice or blow their brains out just to be doing something. The cattle cars are there and the gas ovens and the Nazi psychopaths and all the rest of it, although Spielberg adds some touches like Ralph Fiennes as the Nazi who kept a Jewish woman he was interested in but couldn't love or even rape, but could only beat. And among the guards who are herding the Jews along are a couple who smile at the kids, as though Spielberg is saying, 'here is this juxtaposition: the horror of the most degraded and inhuman acts known to humankind, but look even the monsters think the kids are cute.'

We humans ought to have our face rubbed in this at least once a decade. Still I think the concentration camp bits from Sophie's Choice (1982), to which Spielberg owes something, were better. But maybe that's faulty memory. And filming the whole thing in black and white and then turning it all to color with the shot of the actual Jews (now middle-aged) that Schindler saved from the Nazis was a bit stagy, although I have to say showing that one little Jewish girl's red dress (the only bit of color in the movie until the end) was a striking touch: we see her in the red dress when she hides and then when they dig up the bodies we see it again.

17 June 2002,Steven Spielberg finally pulled it all together in one film to please the adult public and the Academy Awards voters alike.,"Schindler's List did quite well at the box office, while it guaranteed the maker his first Oscar for directing. Jane Campion edged him out for several of the year-end awards given by critics groups, but the Academy put him at the top of their ""A"" list for this effort. 1993 was quite a year for Spielberg. JURASSIC PARK went goofy worldwide, eclipsing yet another Spielberg megabuck effort, E.T. Schindler's List may never quite reach the same box-office stratosphere, but Spielberg can certainly be most pleased and proud of this film. Shot in glorious black and white, it is the heart-wrenching story of a group of Jews condemned to the Krakow Ghetto who are saved by a most unlikely guardian angel, a German businessman named Oskar Schindler. Herr Schindler is, at first, only interested in these people as cheap labor that can further enhance his bank account, but somewhere along the way he gains a measure of humanity and is soon taking substantial risks for ""his"" Jews. The movie isn't precisely clear about why this drastic character change takes place, but that hardly matters. The inherent drama of the turbulent situation carries us along for the full three hours, and you'll be hard-pressed not to shed a few tears during the journey. Liam Neeson does a stalwart job of filling the Schindler shoes, not skimping on the little character details while looming larger than life. It has been noted that Neeson has the presence of an old-fashioned movie star and as Schindler, he shows that he knows what to do with it. The real-life Schindler was described as a cross between Curt Jurgens and George Sanders.

Also quietly impressive is that Gandhi guy, Ben Kingsley, as Itzhak, a very clever accountant who is the brains behind the Schindler empire. Newcomer Ralph Fiennes has also copped some Best Supporting Actor awards for his nasty Nazi, Amon Goeth, who heads up the Plaszow forced labor camp. When bored, Goeth picks off unsuspecting prisoners with his rifle from the terrace of his villa. Chilling. The rest of the large cast has been carefully chosen, the script is intelligent, the music is sweeping, and that cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is a knockout. The complaints about Schindler's List are mostly minor. At one point Spielberg feels compelled to use a special-effects trick. It looks like a cheap cut-and-paste job. Couldn't the man who made dinosaurs walk the earth so realistically pull off this relatively simple stunt? The protracted finale also got on my nerves. After the movie climaxes, the director lets it drag on with a heartfelt but misplaced tribute to the actual survivors. Mr. Spielberg, your manipulation is showing.",8

5 July 1999,I will never forget this film,"Human beings are the only species that kills for sport and hunts for pleasure. We may be the only species ( next to a cat ) that takes joy in killing and torturing another person or animal. Why God gave us the capacity to experience these heinous emotions and desires is beyond me. But for whatever reason, we do have them, and the Holocaust is one of the darkest periods in our existence as human beings. There certainly are other dark times but this one is the most talked about and famous. And before I saw this film, I knew the Holocaust was horrible, but when you can put visuals to the words, it gives you a whole new appreciation and understanding of what is one disgusting display of inhumanity towards a people. And from a man that gave us films like Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, many may have not expected to see a masterpiece like this. But no one should ever be surprised at what Spielberg can accompish.

Schindler's List gives you the horror right in your mind. It paints pictures in front of you and you cringe with every stroke of cinematic genius that is presented before you. I felt sad and disgusted to watch the horrors before me. It made me sick to see that humans could be so cruel. Do we not have any compassion towards the living? Apparently not. And this film shows that, along with Mississippi Burning, Platoon, Saving Private Ryan and even pictures like Boyz N The Hood, we are a sad creation and one that whoever is the supreme ruler of us has got to be angry at the way we turned out.

This is one of the most important films ever made and it also one of the most disturbing. I walked out of the theater and when we drove home there was four of us ) not one word was uttered for at least a half an hour. It was like it took us that long to process what we had just witnessed. When the converstion did start, it went deep into the night and early into the morning. It will provoke that kind of reaction from most everybody.

As important and as brilliant of a film as this is ( I rate it a ten out of ten ) I only saw it once at the theater and then only through the most persistant of begging, once more on video four years later. It disturbed me too much. The images were too real for me and it gave me nightmares for a few days later. What Spielberg has done here is not only make an important film, he has taken a subject that causes so many people pain and he has opened it up for the rest of us to understand. And for that, no Oscar can ever repay him for his contribution to society. I know I am a changed person because of this film. And to me, Saving Private Ryan could have almost been an unofficial sequel to Schindler's List. They both have opened my eyes to the horrors that mankind has caused.

Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan are proof that Speilberg is the king of Hollywood. I sincerely hope he makes an Indy 4, but I hope he continues to make films that make us think. Because he is damn good at those ones too.",10
12 August 2013,Œ§he list of the savior...,"""Schindler's List"" is one of the best directed films of Steven Spielberg. It is the true story of Oskar Schindler a businessman who becomes a savior of the Jews despite the barbaric Nazi reign.

All starts when Oskar Schindler builds his factory into a refuge for Jews taken advantage of the dealing that Jews had from Nazi. So he began his profitable business but while he continues it and sees and considers what Nazi do to Jews he changes his factory into a refuge for Jews.

I think the performance of Liam Neeson is his best performance of all times. This film it can likened with another movies such as ""Life is beautiful"" and ""The Pianist"" which are also very good movies.

3 September 2012,Oskars Brave Odyssey,"Although there are a lot of harrowing images in this excellent movie, I have a feeling no film has ever really shown the true graphic horrors of the death camps. I am sure that movie...will be made someday. There so many Jewish people being murdered in this fine motion picture, but,...in the end it is about a brave man being totally psychologically transformed. Months of seeing human beings being brutalized and getting to know them (his factory used the Jews as cheap labor) as individuals, made Nazi Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) change dramatically. This is not the usual Steven Spielberg fare. He directs this with a deft touch. The holocaust should NEVER be forgotten...and man should have learned from it.

10 July 2012,A hero amidst the horror,"Oskar Schindler did not set out to be a hero. He set out to make money. He was a war profiteer, making money off of the misfortune of Poland's Jews. They were cheap, easy labor. But somewhere along the way things changed. Schindler saw what was happening all around him. The extermination of a people was underway. And in these circumstances a hero was made. For Schindler it was no longer about making money. It was about saving Jews. His Jews. Amidst the darkness of the most unspeakable of horror there was a small light shining bright. Yes, the number of those who were saved pales in comparison to the number of those lost. But this story, and this film, shows us that there can be something good even where all seems so impossibly bad. Even in the worst of circumstances there is room for hope. There is room for a hero.

Setting the right tone for this film seems an impossible task. You have to celebrate those who were saved. But you must also honor those who were lost. Steven Spielberg walked this fine line wonderfully. He told his uplifting story of Oskar Schindler. But the bigger picture was never lost. The horror of what took place comes through very clearly. Spielberg does not just tell the story of those saved, he makes it vividly and brutally clear just what they were saved from. The pain, anguish, horror and terror is all very real. Seeing the greatest evil the world has known on display is enough to make you lose your faith in humanity. Seeing the bravery and heroism of Oskar Schindler restores that faith.

Spielberg was fortunate in that he had three terrific performers to work with. Liam Neeson played Schindler so beautifully. Here was a character who evolved so much over the course of the film and Neeson was pitch-perfect each step of the way. War-profiteering Nazi or heroic savior of Jews, whatever the moment called for Neeson nailed it every time while maintaining an air of mystery. Who was Oskar Schindler really, why did he do the things he did? He was an enigma who Neeson portrayed wonderfully. Ben Kingsley played Schindler's accountant Itzhak Stern. At first Schindler and Stern have very different motivations. But a bond is formed, a friendship blooms. And Stern plays his part in helping to save his people. A quiet, yet determined, presence whom Kingsley personifies so well. And then there is Ralph Fiennes portraying one of history's true madmen, the disgustingly evil Amon Goeth. Any story of a hero needs a villain and Goeth, as played chillingly by Fiennes, is as villainous as they come. Perhaps the scariest thing about him is that there are moments of humanity, kindness even. But in the blink of an eye the moment is gone and the homicidal monster is there before us. Kingsley is very good, Neeson is terrific but Fiennes absolutely takes your breath away. He makes this monster his own, an acting performance of the absolute highest quality.

The three stars certainly play a big part in the success of the film. But Spielberg makes such great use of so many performers. Some play characters who we get to know a little bit. Many are nameless, just part of the multitude being led to the slaughter. The hordes in the ghetto and in the camps convey the magnitude and the great sadness of what went on. Spielberg holds nothing back in portraying the manner in which these people were dehumanized. And the specter of death always looms. It's a film of over three hours in length which does not seem nearly that long. It grips you throughout, never lets up, never lets you go. And there are some moments which are nearly unbearable, the tension unlike anything you've ever seen. One scene in a shower may well have your heart beating through your chest. And you're just watching, people actually lived this. This was such a challenging story to tell and Spielberg tells it so well. The Holocaust is an odd place to look for a hero. But here a hero was found. And Oskar Schindler's story is one we can all remember when we are ready to give up hope for this world.",8
1 September 2017,"Stunning film, indeed. Without a doubt...","Schindler's genius is in bribing, scheming, conning. He knows nothing about running a factory and finds Itzhak Stern, a Jewish accountant, to handle that side of things. Stern moves through the streets of Krakow, hiring Jews for Schindler. Because the factory is a protected war industry, a job there may guarantee longer life. The relationship between Schindler and Stern is developed by Spielberg with enormous subtlety. At the beginning of the war, Schindler wants only to make money... and at the end he wants only to save ""his"" Jews. We know that Stern understands this. But there is no moment when Schindler and Stern bluntly state what is happening, perhaps because to say certain things aloud could result in death.

28 October 2001,incredible film,"Excellent film, and probably the best movie made in the 1990s. Schindler's List is a somewhat long film and definitely not something for small children to see, but it is an intense story that will still be relevant 100 years from now. Filmed in black and white (an effective idea by Spielberg), the Holocaust is show in unsanitized form, and you do not forget the images once you see them. Instead of just showing footage of the camp, Spielberg digs deeply into the minds and psyche of both the prisoners and the Nazis and we learn what their motivations and hopes are. By looking deeply at the Nazis, they come across as complex individuals and not just faceless monsters, something that had not been explored previously in other films about the Holocaust; they are still portrayed as incredibly evil as they were in history, but Spielberg does a good job of explaining their psychology to us, which adds to the understanding of the Holocaust. Not a pleasant film to watch at all, but a movie that must be seen.

31 March 2012,German's list is shamefully short (cinematheque),"This movie is about ordinary people showing the best of humanity or unfortunately the worse. As my favorite writer, PKD, said holocaust wasn't only Hitler and his pals but began foremost with those thousands of anonymous Germans, Polish, Ukrainians, French that operated the camps, the trains, opened the doors and close them, brought the lethal gas and so on. Everyone would contribute even small in the process was as guilty as their original planners. Shoah is about individual morals and value and it was up to every one to choose the path to be a killer or a righteous. The movie is brilliant for that because you see that thousands of anonymous killers and one brave soul who repents. Sure, it's greed that leads Oskar to those families but it's their suffering that makes him change. From that point of view, i don't think that the girl who wore red is an error as other people think because she symbolizes his borderline. From this moment, Oskar is touched and is on duty: Liam becomes really irresistible of empathy and courage. Next, some french media consider a bigger flaw that the women's convoy is only lead to shower and not death chambers. Well, that's the proof that they haven't understood Spielberg's sensibility: he doesn't direct a documentary but as always, a movie about hope, about this little flame that still burns in the darkest hours. So he didn't have to show those woman dying as well as he could mix a lot of atrocities that surely hasn't all happened in the real Schindler's story but happens really during the war: killing disabled, killing for fun, etc... In that way, Fiennes and Liam delivers unforgettable performances, the one as an unforgettable pit of darkness and the other as a force of life. That's why my eyes were full of tears at the end because to see this strong oak finally crumble was too much.

Pairing: ""Empire of the sun"": another war, another tragedy, another hope....",10

1 July 2013,Jewel Of Cinema. ‚ô¶ 93%,"Astounded by the facts, grueling scenes & short scripts between the sequences, I find myself in an awkward situation where instead of thinking about which movie to watch next, I am introspecting about the purpose of my life. Seriously, this film makes it a point that you get emotionally inspired.

Steven Spielberg, as always, takes up a sensitive topic and carves it to perfection. Not taking in account the long running time (which is actually pretty fair) & the imbalance of narration, the story of Oskar Schindler saving a bunch of innocent Jews from the clutches of callous German Kommandants strikes a visual chord mentally, emotionally. The heart-aching depiction of cruelty on Jews, rampant corruption during World War, slavery & the magnanimity of Schindler, his friendship, his aura is all well filmed. The music almost backs it up, with wonderful screenplay & cinematography.

Liam Neeson is terrific. I have always loved his performances; this one makes me respect him more & more. Ben Kingsley is very very good, especially with his demeanor. Supporting cast is amazing. In fact, the whole crew should get a standing ovation for the hard-work of digging up the facts. The final sequences made me cry.

BOTTOM LINE: A 9.3/10 for this must-watch, characteristic film. One of the most emotionally touching films.

Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO

15 December 2010,A master piece !!!,"Schindler's list was an astounding work of cinema which was depressing and emotional but at the same time was backed by powerful performances and intelligent direction. Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler who managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp. Oskar Schindler is a German Businessman who hires Jewish people in Germany to work in his factory during World War II. During the tenure, Schindler realizes that the Jews are brutally abused, tortured, misbehaved and murdered. As the ill-treatment on Jews, Schindler tries to help these people with his wealth, powerful friends. Later when Germany untimely surrenders , Schindler is forced to quit but he leaves behind wonderful memories of helping the Jews. The film was a masterpiece. The astounding piece of work could only be achieved by Steven Spielberg. The great director not only tells emotional story about the cruelty suffered by the Jews but also the showcases that money is not everything. The way a business tycoon helps his workers despite the ill-treatment they were suffering was eye-catching. Though the running time of the film was 3 hours but it will keep you engrossed . Direction was fantabulous. Cinematography was jaw-dropping. Same goes with the sets. Talking about performance, Liam Nesson essays the role of Schindler with T. The actor not looks good but comes up with a brave performance. In supporting , Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes acted their part with equal justice. So overall, I was completely moved by the film. It has all the ingredients to make a good¬Ö drama¬Ödialog¬Ögood background score.",9
24 August 1999,The best movie ever made.,"Although I didn't give Schindler's List a ""10"" rating for the IMDB, in fact I gave it a ""9"", I must say this:

Schindler's List is the best movie ever made.

The horror of the genocide is made clear, as well as the potential humanity of onlookers.

One powerful message--that people can make a difference. Good people can, and do, save lives everyday.

There's a tag-line for the film, it's from the Talmud, ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire."" If so, then Schindler just saved the world 1200 times. He saved it for you, for me; for all of us.

I have seen many films, fiction, documentary, and otherwise that deal with the horrors of the Holocaust. Nothing moved me as this has. I've seen Schindler's List many times. I love it. It never fails to move me.

We need more people like Schindler, we need more movies like Schindler's List.",9
1 July 2013,Difficult to not feel every moment yet more important to never forget,"Schindler's List is history: an annihilation of a people, an account of good in an ocean of evil, a cinematic event that isn't as brutally painful to watch as it is faithfully important to experience. I feel compelled to watch it annually and still can not appreciate what it takes from an actor, a director, a cinematographer to participate and place themselves in such dark and terrifying places. The acting is simply mesmerizing and Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth goes beyond the embodiment of a Nazi. You can actually see the development of evil as a duty. Difficult to not feel every moment yet more important to never forget this film that recounts The Holocaust on a scale unmatched.

22 July 2017,Great Drama,"Schindler's List is a great drama about the holocaust. It is both well written and directed. I haven't read the book or done much research. However it does tell a touching story of a man trying to save life in a very dark time in history. Steven Spielberg did an incredible job directing. There was so much detail in each scene. I liked the use of black and white it gave this sad tragic story a dark and gloomy tone. It also has a wonderful ending. It has a large wonderful cast with incredible performances by Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes. I was surprised by the amount of negative user reviews I seen. Schindler's List is a great drama about a tragic time in history. It isn't a movie you can watch over and over, but it is a movie that should be seen. It ties with Saving Private Ryan as Steven Spielberg's best work. It is also one of the best movies from 1990's. It is a great movie.

16 October 2012,Spielberg's Best,"This film is a very solid offering from a not so solid director, Spielberg, who made some solid films, such as E.T. and Raiders of the Lost Ark, but never managed to attain greatness, until this film. Easily the best film he ever made, Spielberg showed that he is also able to direct serious stuff besides escapist adventure films. I would put this film among my top 50 favorite films.

This film is technically flawless and shows how sophisticated Hollywood filmaking had become by the early 1990's. Though I would question the use of black and white in the film: color is good and the Pianist showed it can be used in a WW2 tragedy film. However, this film is not the best WW2 film ever made either, Grave of the Fireflies, by Isao Takahata, a film detailing the suffering of two children to survive in Japan in the final months of WW2, is easily superior to this one and if you think this film is sad, thy watching Takahata's masterpiece.

16 January 2001,The most important film of the last 50 years,"In the same week that ET opened in America, Steven Spielberg read Thomas Keneally's Schindler's Ark, the book based on the true story of one man who rescued more than 1,000 Jews from under the noses of the Nazis.

Intrigued by the subject, the film rights were snapped up and the result was the most talked about movie of the Nineties.

Schindler's List rarely fails to stir the emotions. As with all of the cast - especially Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes - Liam Neeson gives the performance of a lifetime as the suave businessman Oskar Schindler, spurred on by the brief that as many people as possible should see the movie - and not just from a commercial point of view, as Neeson recalled at the time of release.

`I remember Steven saying ¬ëDon't take this wrong, but I want everyone in the world to see this film,' and I knew exactly what he meant.'

It goes without saying that the Holocaust was such an horrific event that any director would have to feel mature enough to tell their story without letting sentiment get in the way.

So, 10 years after he first read the book, the master movie-maker was ready to tackle the most important film of his career.

He had a self-confessed reluctance to confront the Holocaust and his own Jewishness as a subject.

Following his more ¬ëhuman' dramas such as The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun, the project was still very much in his mind, but his own involvement would be purely on a production level.

After offering it to fellow film directors Martin Scorsese and Sydney Pollack, they both turned it down and Hollywood's favourite son was left to condense the novel into a three-hour black and white movie.

Having successfully fleshed out many of his childhood fantasies and with events in the Balkans at the time mirroring those of fifty years earlier, 1993 was exactly the right time to address the matter.

So keen was Spielberg to make the film, he left the Hawaiian set of Jurassic Park before the film's completion and flew to Poland to start filming.

Old friend George Lucas was left to edit the dinosaur blockbuster while Steven watched the footage on descrambled satellite transmissions.

Both films went on to achieve widespread acclaim, for different reasons. If JP was the sort of a movie an overexcited child would make, then SL was that of a seasoned film-maker at ease with his craft and intent on delivering something extremely adult.

Schindler's List received 12 Oscar nominations, including the elusive Best Director gong which Steven eventually picked up from an Academy that had ignored many of his movies on the grounds that he had been rewarded enough.

Tackling a drama in which six million people ended up dead was not for the novice film-maker - It was for the brave of heart and a director that could tell such a stark tale without alienating his audience from the outset.

Indeed, only Claude Lanzmann had delivered anything that came close with his epic film Shoah, a nine and a half hour documentary about the Holocaust which wowed the critics in 1985.

For his movie, Spielberg was blessed with a polished screenplay by Steve Zaillian, a young writer who went on to direct his own movies such as the John Travolta vehicle, A Civil Action, and who has just spruced up the dialogue for Silence of the Lambs sequel, Hannibal.

Needless to say, this not the sort of movie you curl up with on a Saturday night with a box of chocs and a six pack. It's a harrowing film which has lost none of its power either on the small screen or in the eight years since its release.",10
3 August 1998,A masterpiece,"Using mostly black and white, Spielberg takes us into the nightmare at the center of human life. We are brought down deep into hell itself before we are brought back up to an enlightenment. In spite of the horror, the film is powerfully uplifting. It is a study in the worst and best in human nature.

27 January 2002,Spielberg's best,"Steven Spielberg have made movie masterpieces left and right. His movie classics include ""E.T."", ""Jaws"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Close Encounter's of the Third Kind"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", and ""The Color Purple"". I love all of those films. However, ""Schindler's List"" is his #1 masterpiece. The movie that would finally win him the Best Director Oscar after losing and being snubbed by the Academy for years, ""Schindler's List"" takes place during the Holocaust and tells the story of Oscar Schindler, the real-life German war profiteer who saved the lives of more than 1,000 Polish Jews. This is one of the most powerful movies ever made, lasting over 3 hours long and shot in beautiful black-and-white. Winner of 7 Academy Awards (including Best Picture), ""Schindler's List"" features spectacular performances by Liam Neeson as Oscar Schindler, Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant, and Ralph Fiennes in one of the scariest movie performances of all time as an evil Nazi commandant. A harrowing, powerful film that will live on forever, ""Schindler's List"" is an outstanding movie that I'll never forget.

21 February 2015,One of the best movies of all time,"This is pretty much Steven Spielberg's cinematic coming of age. It hits every element perfectly and it's a masterpiece. The movie is not afraid to be highly brutal and it does an amazing job showing us the ugliness of the concentration camps. All movies of this genre should not be afraid to have this element of brutality and Schindler's List does it perfectly. It does a great job making us care for Schindler and I can tell that Spielberg really cared for him and his actions. It's a very powerful film and the fact that this was based on a true story only strengthens the emotional power. The fact that it was shot in black and white undoubtedly gives it more power and emotion. Saying this movie was expertly shot would be an understatement. I've never seen a film shot better then this. This is a one of a kind film and we may never see it duplicated. It hits all the elements perfectly and succeeds in every way. This is one of the best movies of all time and it must be watched.

4 November 2014,A Now-Classic Tale of Salvation In Poland,"In Poland during World War II, Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) gradually becomes concerned for his Jewish workforce after witnessing their persecution by the Nazis.

Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself. Indeed, the biggest criticism the film gets is that it came from Spielberg, well known for his sentimentality. Had another director made the same film, it would probably be considered flawless.

One can wonder about the casting of Liam Neeson as a Moravian German, when he clearly is not. But with such a strong acting ability, this can be overlooked. The casting of Ben Kingsley was brilliant, even if he is not Jewish, and it is a shame this role is not the one he is best known for. Somehow Ralph Fiennes got a supporting actor nomination, but not Kingsley? The choice to film in black and white makes sense, as Spielberg wanted a ""documentary"" feel. Does the infusion of red take away from this? Some might say so.

This film racked up a slew of awards, including several Oscars, and this is well-deserved. Despite its critics, this will no doubt go on to be considered one of the greatest films of all time, and easily the best to address the Holocaust.",8
24 January 2006,"I often want to vomit, cry, or scream","""Schindler's List"" (1993): I see this Monument repeatedly. It's brilliant and powerful, from start to finish. YOU should see it first, in it's entirety, if you're contemplating your children being exposed. Spielberg made his own ""parental warning"" introduction, when it aired ¬ñ unedited - on t.v. (a gutsy and triumphant moment for television). I would WANT my children to see it, as long as we had some preparation first, and PLENTY of discussion time after wards. Of course, this is an emotional and horrific story, scene after scene, full of dark insights at every turn, but it is the spiritual growth of Oskar Schindler ¬ñ NOT an admirable man when we first meet him ¬ñ that becomes one of the inspiring forces. Liam Neesom was great in this role, which helped make ""Schindler's List"" one of my Top Five for supreme Character Studies. You will also see a typically subdued Ben Kingsley, and a brilliant, frighteningly evil-yet-torn, Ralph Fiennes. The music is not overwhelming, but present and effective. The camera work and lighting for this black & white work of Art are flawless. The use of a few tiny moments of color (aside from the start and finish), aren't really necessary, and a little overly poetic, but aren't bothersome. During the film, I often want to vomit, or cry, or scream. I'm glad I feel these things. Steven Spielberg never has to prove anything to anyone ever again...even if he makes another ""E.T."" or ""War of the Worlds"".",
18 September 2013,Shattering Film Masterpiece.,"Steven Spielberg won a well-deserved Academy Award(as did the film itself) for directing this emotionally shattering, dramatically devastating film about opportunistic businessman Oskar Schindler(Liam Neeson in a superb performance) who goes into business with the Nazis, and Amon Goeth(Ralph Fiennes, unforgettable performance) the death camp commandant who supplies him with imprisoned Jews for his factories. Ben Kingsly plays Itzhak Stern, his secretary who helps Schindler have a moral awakening to the evils of the Nazis, and who later spends his fortune aiding them, eventually shielding them from extermination, saving over 1100 lives.

Masterpiece is among the finest films ever made, so deeply moving and wrenchingly does it portray the death camps and what the Jewish people had to endure(aided by the exquisite John Williams score), and Amon Goeth personified evil as he indifferently shot the prisoners, or abused his maid.

The ending to the film when Schindler breaks down, and the Jews are liberated is powerful enough for several films, but the Coda at the end is so surprising, yet so fitting, that it remains the most emotionally moving ending ever. A stunning achievement for all concerned, especially Mr. Spielberg.",10
27 October 1999,The lost world,"The critic Terrence Rafferty put it best: SCHINDLER'S LIST has a primal emotional power that hasn't been felt since silent film.

Those who prefer the post-structuralist beard-scratching of Claude Lanzmann's unbearable SHOAH to this movie are denying the potency of great populist art. Like Dickens and Griffith, Spielberg uses melodramatic techniques to make ideas palpable to a mass audience. In America at least, public perception of the Holocaust will be forever changed. You can carp that the audience's experience is synthetic, Disneyish, but is a fictional re-experiencing of these events worse than an abstract and remote noodling over them? Is it worse to represent the Holocaust in fiction than to leave it as a concept--and, as history bears out, a deniable one?

As a work of filmmaking, it ranks with the greatest. In LIST, Spielberg arrives at a point--shoulder to shoulder with Scorsese --as the most dexterous and gifted of filmmakers working today. Scene after scene displays an offhand, unplanned-feeling mastery of the medium that staggers the imagination in its power. The cumulative effect--as in the best of Spielberg's earlier work--is of a long and sustained, almost unbearable cry of loss. Intellectuals have come to so despise Steven Spielberg, the mogul of Century City, that they have become blind to Spielberg the craftsman and artist. (Spielberg's smarm while receiving his first Academy Award didn't help this perception.) SCHINDLER'S LIST is the only film I've seen in my adult life where the screen disappeared; I was no longer aware of the construction of the movie and entered into it as spontaneously as a child. Surely Spielberg will never again find material that engages him so profoundly. But this film, far dwarfing its aspiring successor SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, places Spielberg at the first rank of film artists.",
17 September 2013,"A Timeless Classic,","Schindler's List is a brilliant movie with a really well developed storyline that takes its time telling a very long story but never fails to be interesting.The films cast is pitch perfect,its without a doubt one of Liam Neeson's most impressive performances,but I think the best performance has to go to Ralph Fiennes,his performance as Amon Goeth was unbelievably inspired and he put a lot of heart in to it.Obviously a lot of credit for making this film so beautiful is Steven Spielberg,easily one of the best directors of all time,he clearly has a huge interest in World War 2 and puts so much heart and effort into every film he makes.If your a fan of war and biography films and just a moviegoer in general,Schindler's List should not be missed.

23 July 2011,A realistic account on atrocity!,"It is said ""power corrupts; but absolute power corrupts absolutely"". This movie just gives a glimpse of the possible effects if the power is vested with some insane person with a mindless hatred towards a group of people just because of their birth.

I had not judged Hitler to the fullest before seeing this movie even though many were condemning him to be the cruelest dictator the world has ever seen. After seeing it, I am convinced of the fact that he was really so. The fact that 6 million Jews were massacred during the world war-2 just because they were Jews is a shame on the entire humanity.

The movie gives an account of the polish Jews during the Second World War and how the protagonist, Oscar Schindler saves 1200 Jews from being gassed. The cinematography is simply brilliant. It gives a sense of timelessness to the movie. Also, not to forget some wonderful performances. All factors make the movie very realistic. No wonder it is one of the best movies in many lists and deservedly won the academy award for the year 1993. Steven Spielberg will be remembered as an iconic director even if all of his other movies are discounted.

In the days where negationism of the Nazis' atrocities is getting stronger and the killings are being justified, this movie is a harsh reminiscence of the black era of Europe.",9
17 September 2012,One of Spielberg's best,"Circa 1993, Steven Spielberg was arguably the biggest name in Hollywood. The world had just seen ""Jurassic Park"" become the third of his films to take over top spot in the list of the highest grossing films of all time. Then, for an encore, he delivered ""Schindler's List""; the film that finally brought him Oscar recognition.

The story is based on a factual novel by Thomas Keneally about a German businessman who moves to Poland during WWII in the hopes of making his fortune as a war profiteer. He thrives with the aid of Jewish slave labour but as the war progresses he becomes increasingly concerned about the safety of his work force. Eventually, he resolves to sacrifice his wealth in an attempt to shield his workers from certain death at the hands of the Nazis.

The screenplay by Steven Zaillian is a strong one and it ended up resulting in an Oscar win. The tone can be grim at times as the film unflinchingly portrays the nightmare of German occupation. With a runtime of more than three hours, the film is somewhat gruelling early on but you eventually get so wrapped up in the story that the time passes quickly. Zaillian should also be commended for not portraying Schindler as a man without fault; rather, he is an unlikely hero.

The cast also rises to the occasion. It's no surprise that the always dependable Liam Neeson landed an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Schindler but it is surprising that this is his only nomination to date. Meanwhile, Ralph Fiennes, in his breakout role, basically stole the show as Nazi commandant Amon Goeth. Also deserving of high praise was Ben Kingsley, whose low-key performance spoke volumes.

Visually, the film is exceptional. The black and white cinematography of Janusz Kaminski is stunning and Spielberg's direction is impeccable. Both individuals were justly rewarded with Oscars for their work. Meanwhile, the sets & costumes were also top notch and helped to lend the film a feel of authenticity. Also worth mentioning is John Williams' Oscar-winning score.

In the end, while ""Schindler's List"" shows exquisite care in every area it is ultimately the film's emotional impact that elevates it above the pack. It'd be a stoic individual indeed who isn't moved by this film in one way or another.",9
4 June 2011,A strong standout worthy of its placement on the top one hundred films ever made,"For a movie as monumental as Schindler's List, I believe a review should be conducted in a different style. Normally, my reviews consist of multiple paragraphs, summarizing the plot and my thoughts on the film. This time I want to give five reasons why Schindler's List was easily one of the most powerful and breathtaking motion pictures I've ever seen. It goes above and beyond anyone's expectation, and cements itself on the list of greatest films of all time. Here's why.

1. Acting. No one could write about Schindler's List and not talk about Liam Neeson's Oscar worthy performance as Oskar Schindler, the business man from Czechoslovakia. He plays it with power and full force, grade A acting. Still shocked his leading performance didn't win him the Oscar in 1994.

2. Storyline. Instead of focusing on one of the survivors, or a fictional story for that matter, Spielberg chooses to focus on Oskar Schindler, a rather unsung chapter and character of The Holocaust. Oskar Schindler worked for the Nazis, and is famous for using his great wealth to buy hundreds of Jews to make them work in his factory. It wasn't much, but it prevented death, and they would make bowls for the Nazis. Even though the film goes into a subject, some may not know, the storyline is definitely one of the strongest points.

3. The end sequence. I don't want to ruin the final scenes in the film, but let's just say, it's one of the most effective and well done scenes in film history.

4. The film's desire to ""show it all."" When Holocaust movies are made, so try to water the film down by not showing the terrible treatment of innocent Jews. This one doesn't. Despite the event being gruesome, tasteless, and ignorant, no movie should subject itself to water down the scenes. Unless it's PG-13, and I doubt many Holocaust movies are. Schindler's List isn't all about the gas chambers and things most of us already know. We witness two of the worst things possible; (1) innocent people taken out to the yard and being shot in the head with absolutely no feeling on the guard's part and (2) we see the heart-wrenching scenes of peoples belonging getting tossed off balconies like garbage. That part I almost couldn't bear to watch.

5. The complete carelessness for human life. Face it, the Jews and many other races were dehumanized come time of The Holocaust. Life didn't matter to anybody. You could tell a Nazi officer that you just killed sixty thousand Jews in one day and they wouldn't flinch, yell, smile, or object. They would say ""Good work."" They wouldn't take into consideration you just killed sixty thousand mothers, father, brothers, sisters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, and worst of all, children of both sexes. One scene in the film, right before a woman is shot in the head, the camera zooms in on her to show her frightened reactions, her pale face, and her clearly nervous behavior. Spielberg most likely did that to remind viewers that the victims in this movie were people and they were innocent people with their own feelings in life. Dehumanization lived in The Holocaust.

Schindler's List currently ranks number nine on the American Film Institute's (AFI) list of one hundred greatest American films ever made. I am a firm believer that if this wasn't in Spielberg's hands, it wouldn't touch that list. Thankfully, we get one down to Earth and very vibrant Holocaust movies that manages to accomplish what it should. Just an all around amazing film.

10 February 2009,Spielberg's Entrance to Adulthood,"""Schindler's List"" was THE movie of 1993, and nothing came close to touching it in acclaim. It felt like the movie Steven Spielberg had been waiting years to make, and despite his previous efforts at making movies for grown ups (""The Color Purple""), this is the first movie that suggested he was maturing as a film maker.

So does it hold up after all these years? Mostly. But is it a typical Spielberg movie? Most definitely. The first 3/4 of the film are compulsively watchable and entertaining, if you can consider brutal and graphic scenes of concentration camp violence entertaining. Spielberg uses a near-documentary style that fits the material perfectly, and using black and white with only occasional splashes of color feels like an inspired decision. But boy is that last quarter of the film schmaltzy, and has Spielberg's gooey fingerprints all over it. I don't know that something as horrific as the Holocaust needs a lot of emotional embellishment, but Spielberg just can't help himself.

However, I forgive Spielberg in this particular case. This was obviously a story that meant a great deal to him, and I'm not sure it's fair to expect him to remain emotionally distant from it. He tells his story with a great deal of passion, and for the most part he tells it very well.

3 March 2010,If I could save one more life,"Schindler's list is the one of few flicks you would never forget.If you see this movie then truly you will feel empty in the end.It will leave you heavy hearted.Ready to cry & to feel the horrors Jews faced during holocaust.Spielberg is class.He makes your emotions to linger thanks to memorable performance by Liam Neeson as Oscar Schindler.Ben Kingsley(Itzhak Stern) deserved an Oscar for this & also Ralph Finees(Goeth).His performance as Goeth would stand out for the most nefarious performance you would see in a long time.Truly the cinematography is vivid & the black-white version takes you back to the 1940's again in the evil of holocaust.This movie can't be emulated.Itzhak Stern said that ""Whoever saves one life saves the world entire."".So if you haven't seen this yet then buy a DVD and see for yourself,relive those moments where the true Oscar Schindler saved many.True hats off to the real Schindler.I just want to go back in time where Oscar would say ""If I could save one more life"".True emotional experience.

7 July 2011,Outstanding,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",10
8 September 2015,An intense and heart-breaking film!,"This movie is difficult to watch as it, in detail, expresses the sheer horror and grisliness of the Holocaust. From the forced relocation of the Jews toward the ghettos to the terrors of Auschwitz, the persecution of the Jews is a centerpiece of this film and it will resonate in your mind long after this movie is over.

This movie also centers around the life of Oskar Schindler, played brilliantly by Liam Neeson, as a money-hungry German businessman who employs Jews to work in his factory, but ultimately grows concerned for the well-being of the Jews as he witnesses their merciless persecution by the Nazis. His mission in turning his factory into a salvation for the Jews throughout WWII becomes a driving force for the plot and builds up the suspense and tension, making you eager to find out what the aftermath is by the film's end.

Ben Kingsley gave a great performance of Itzhak Stern, the Jew who ends up being Schindler's trusted assistant and right-hand man, and Ralph Fiennes gave a haunting portrayal of the evil and sadistic Amon Goeth - an ultimate villain you would love to hate. And, all the supporting actors and extras who portrayed the Jews gave a heartfelt performance; even as actors, you really sympathize with them as they gave such a realistic and heart wrenching portrayal.

Janusz Kaminski did a good job on the cinematography, capturing the aura and tension of World War II; John Williams gave a stirring music score with a beautiful violin solo by Izak Perlman; and Steven Spielberg did a nice job directing a well-paced film.

It's true that some people criticizes the accuracy and historical facts of the film and the overly intensiveness of the plot elements, but, it is no doubt an impactful film about the Holocaust and the courageous deeds of a man who sought to save many.

3 August 1999,A fantastic film that I had to see twice,"I don't have to tell you that ""Schindler's List"" is an extraordinary and important film. Unanimous praise and celebration of a multi-award winning cinematic masterpiece should make it abundantly clear what a powerful film it is. To say nothing of Steven Spielberg's remarkable achievement of delivering in the same year the greatest box office hit to date with ""Jurassic Park"" and then the Academy's best picture and director Oscars. But everyone knows about that already.

I saw this film at a second run cinema in my neighbourhood, which basically sold out each show of ""Schindler's List"" for the week it was running. When my wife and I entered the theater, there seemed to be only one pair of seats available in the whole place. Only after we sat down did we notice the guy in front of us was proudly brandishing a tall cowboy hat. We figured out quite quickly why our seats were available and thought we ought to explore our options. I very politely leaned forward and asked him if he was going to wear the hat during the show. With a friendly smile, the kind man in his mid-thirties assured us he'd remove it when the picture began. True to his word, he took off the hat when the lights went out.

Rarely have I ever seen a theater audience so transfixed on the images before them. Complete devotion of attention from every patron. Except one. When the ""dude"" in front of us grew tired of the film, some twenty minutes into it, he attempted making out with his girlfriend who briefly complied but ultimately succeeded in pushing him away. A number of future attempts were met with decreasing levels of success. Clearly the subject matter on screen was far from romantic.

Weeks later, art imitated life on an episode of ""Seinfeld"" when Jerry's friends and family are outraged at his similar behavior which was a result of having no privacy while his parents stayed with him.

Back to our friend ""Howdy Doody"", who has failed in his amorous advances during a film about one of the most chilling, harrowing subjects in the history of mankind. When his attention span gave out, and I imagine some five year olds could put him to shame, he rested his head on the back of the seat and stared at the ceiling. He would periodically sigh loudly, a declaration of his utter boredom. Not surprisingly, he drifted away and soon began to snore.

I did nothing of course, and resigned myself to the fact that I'd have to watch the film again. This unfortunate sort of thing is the downside of seeing films in the theater, which I am by and large a huge supporter of in general. You never know what ""Buckaroo"" you might be sitting behind, but my advice to you is simple. If you ever spot a cowboy hat, relocate.",10
13 March 2013,"Spielberg shows his incredible range, as one of the true greats comes to Blu-ray.","Schindler's List is the kind of once-in-a-generation film that comes along and earns truly universal acclaim. The tale of Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party who saves well over one thousand Jews during the Holocaust through his cunning and selflessness, is a timeless exhibition of exactly why the very medium of filmmaking was invented. Approaching its 20th anniversary, Universal Sony has converted the original film into high-definition, allowing a new generation to experience its soaring story and visceral intensity.

Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a man who considers himself a businessman first and a Nazi second. In the throes of WWII, he sees opportunity in hiring Jewish POWs to work in his enamel factory. With the help of trustworthy accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), he develops a godly reputation among the Jews despite originally being apathetic to their struggles. Naturally, his actions raise the curiosity of some high-ranking German officers, including the sadistic Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes).

The legacy of Schindler's List stands tall two decades after its theatrical release. The film took home seven Oscars at the 1994 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay, while Neeson and Fiennes were bested in the Acting categories by Tom Hanks (Philadelphia) and Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive) respectively. Today, Schindler and Goeth are considered arguably the finest moments of either man's distinguished career.

The Blu-ray conversion is virtually faultless at every turn. It is one thing to infuse a visual sense of wonder to a screen already populated by giant sharks, prehistoric beasts or cuddly other-worlders; it is quite another to invoke that same awe to a sombre tale filmed in monochrome, but that is precisely what has been achieved with this restoration. The update beautifully renders some of the most harrowing shots ever put to celluloid, including the massacre set to Bach and the first glimpse of Auschwitz; its steaming, monstrous pillars resembling a most ironic monolith of human evolution. The famous Girl in Red- for many, the emotive highlight of the film- is given new and ironic life through touched-up footage keeping her dress from fading into its surroundings, as was the case with the original negative.

For such a powerful piece of cinema, the mastery of Spielberg's direction is his ability to peel back as opposed to going for the jugular too early or too often. The film expertly traverses a near-impossible pitfall of melodrama. As he did with more contemporary histo-drama Lincoln, Spielberg's ability to blend the emotionally challenging and the humanistic is unmatched, in what remains not only his most personal project, but perhaps the most personal film of any A-list director ever.

The end result is still a depressing and, at times, highly disturbing piece of art, but one that concurrently remains an absorbing character study of the highest order. Schindler is not a wholeheartedly compassionate man; for him, it's all about the Benjamins- or in this case, the Reichsmarks- and he is offended- nay, enraged- that his workers would have the audacity to call his factory a 'haven', until his perspective on the war is forever changed. Likewise, Goeth, the man who kills Jews from his balcony with the same indifference as a man reading the morning paper, is the same one that secretly lusts after his Jewish maid.

Kingsley's Stern, then, just may be the most emotionally integral character, acting as the catalyst for Schindler's eventual change of heart while playing the role of the unshakeable moral compass and most accessible window for the audience into the lives of those persecuted.

It is this story of flawed good versus flawed evil that humanises these once mythical creatures. Appropriately, it isn't until the final half-hour that the immensity of their actions are realised in one of the most memorable, heartfelt endings of all time, in which Spielberg breaks every rule of conventional narrative filmmaking at once in order to pay his final respects.

The Blu-ray comes complete with a series of special features, including Voices from the List, a documentary featuring testimonies from some of the 'Schindler Jews' who survived the Holocaust, as well as a story on Spielberg's USC Shoah Foundation.

The intentions of Universal are salient here, as their features keep in line with the director's original intent to minimise publicity or self-servitude, to the point where he even refused payment for his work, citing 'blood money' as the deterrent. However, trivia buffs interested in some of the more allegorical tidbits of production (including the alleviation of on-set depression through Spielberg's screenings of Seinfeld and Robin Williams sketches, and the time a survivor trembled with terror at her first sight of Fiennes because he reminded her too much of the real Goeth) may be satiated by a 16-page companion booklet, featuring behind- the-scenes information on the incredible stories around an incredible composition.

3 August 2009,Horrific And Yet So Inspiring At The Same Time,"This movie must be the best piece of work dealing with the Holocaust that I have ever seen. The only criticism I can find myself making of it is that it was a little bit confusing in the first hour or so, but even that was probably appropriate as the movie portrays a time of chaos anyway. The first thing that one notices is the decision to film the movie in black and white. That was a brilliant decision. Somehow, it gives the story greater power. The brutality of the Holocaust is obvious, the sadistic nature of the SS is portrayed brilliantly, both in depictions of actual events and by Ralph Fiennes in his portrayal of SS officer Amon Goeth, the confusion and uncertainty and desperation of the Jews is palpable. Everything is raw with power. I would have liked some greater explanation of the impact of the little girl who provides the only splashes of colour in the movie (she's dressed in red) on Schindler. She's hardly the only child he sees suffer. Why her in particular?

Ben Kingsley's portrayal of Itzhak Stern, the Jewish accountant recruited by Schindler to run his business is appropriately low-key. Here was a man who saw an opportunity to help his fellow Jews through Schindler's company and who quietly took advantage of it. Which brings me to Liam Neeson's portrayal of Schindler. He did a great job - completely believable as he portrays Schindler's evolution from a businessman who just wanted to make money and who brought Jews into his factory for no reason except that they were the cheapest labour available to a man determined to protect his Jewish workers from the insanity and horror of Auschwitz. The closing scene, as he breaks down crying out that he feels he should have saved more people, is one of the most powerful and moving scenes I have ever seen in a movie, especially as Stern quietly comforts him and says ""no - you did so much"" and the other Jews he saved rush up to embrace and comfort him. It was also moving to see the Schindler Jews honouring his grave at the end of the movie.

Schindler provides the inspiration here. Yes, it's inspiring that he saved 1200 Jews, but the inspiration goes beyond that. As the story makes clear, Schindler was largely a failure at everything he did in life, both before and after the war. And yet, this man - who was (I hate to use the word, but it's pretty much true) a loser - managed to rise to what must have seemed an insurmountable challenge and accomplished something great of historic proportions. If a man like Schindler could do this, surely others can do it too - not with respect to the Holocaust anymore (thank God!) but with some of the other issues in the world today. This is truly a brilliant piece of work. 9/10",9

8 September 2015,A lesson of humanity.,"This film tells the story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a Polish industrialist who collaborated with the German war effort, after the invasion of his country, by keeping working in his plant many Jewish prisoners. Aware that keep them working was to save their lives, Schindler hires as much as he can, going against his own interests and even raising suspicions among the Nazis. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film also has the participation of Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes. Based on a true story, the film screenplay is from Steven Zaillian.

There are some movies that are so good and symbolic that ultimately overcome the art of cinema itself and become part of the heritage and memory of Humanity. This is one of those movies. There isn't any negative note to do: the cast exceeded expectations, the script is excellent, the costumes and scenarios are historically accurate. The cinematography deserves special positive note, with interesting camera angles and a very clever use of black and white. In recognition of this merit, the film won seven Oscars (best film, best director, best adapted screenplay, best cinematography, best art direction, best editing and best original soundtrack) and was nominated for another five statuettes (Best Actor, Best supporting actor, best costume, best sound and best characterization).

The story told in this film is the living testimony of a sad page in world history, but that doesn't end in the past. The Holocaust ended decades ago but there's still genocide and ethnic cleansing in other parts of the World. If this film brings a message of compassion and humanity, this isn't only for some people, but transcends the issue of Jews or Germans to reach all those in this World are persecuted for their faith, ethnic or other perverse motivations.",10
12 December 2007,An Unforgettable Experience...,"This is a film that will be remembered forever. There's not many films that can boast that, but this film definitely can. It is truly one of the greatest films ever made.

Oskar Schindler started off the same as most of the men of his Nazi party: He loved women, good wine, and making money. He started a factory in the middle of the war and made money using Jewish slaves as workers. He sold parts to Nazi armies, eventually becoming one of the nation's wealthiest men. As he began to be invited into the inner circle of the Nazi's, though, he began to see the horrors of what was really going on; He began to see the horror of himself. And he began to try to save the Jews.

Shot in stark black and white with rare glimpses of color, Schindler's List is a true masterpiece. Steven Spielberg completely recreates what is one of the darkest times in human history with startling reality and shows a new generation exactly how terrible it was. At the same time an uplifting story, a horror film, and a dramatic saga, Schindler's List will forever change you. It is a not a lighthearted film to be enjoyed on a Sunday afternoon- it may disturb you. But it is a must-see for everyone so that we can better understand what really happened in that terrible war. Superb film-making is all around in this film. A must see! 10/10 stars!

2 July 2008,Steven Spielberg's greatest Masterpiece!,"Well, first of all, this is not my usual type of film. I don't like watching such realistic films, since they really depress me. But since this is a universally acclaimed Oscar-winner, I decided to see it.

This is a very realistic film. It deplicits the horror that Polish Jews went through, and I have never seen a film with such power. The film, I was glad, did not start off suddenly with the Jews, and throughout the film, we are able to look into characters' emotions and minds. A lot of character are seen in this film, and they are given development, so we can actually care about them. There were a lot of actors involved in this film, and the main actors, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley, all do great jobs. They each make their characters unique. They each give their whole into it.

The film has a lot to deal with. It really is a 'grand' film. The productions and the cost of all the actors and stunts must have been hard. In those scenes, scenes that we are able to see how disturbing Jews lived, those scenes are amazing. There are a lot of powerful ones, and we can surely distinguish them. The cinematography is simply amazing. Some of the best I have ever seen, the use of the camera, and the pacing etc. This is a very technical achievement as well. It really did look like we were witnessing real persons being tortured.

Overall, this is simply a masterpiece. Yes, I thought it was a bit long. I actually felt a little restless in parts, and sort of dull, but I still recognized the achievement, and although I couldn't really follow in all the dialogue, I still appreciated it. That is what a masterpiece is. A work or art, a work of realism to give the audience. Everyone should see this film. You cannot help but feel a little distraught for all these people. The ending scene, with the actors walking with their real-life character portrayals, was simply emotional. It really gets to you. It is simply Steven Spielberg's greatest work he ever made.",

10 November 2010,Powerful!,"Schindler's List is one of the best films if better made. I think it made my top ten list of all time movies. By the ending, I was all choked up. It's almost impossible for me to be choked up in a movie. What made this film even more powerful than the content is that it was filmed in black and white. It had a powerful effect on me and most other viewers.

This movie is about the transformation of a war profiteer and how he goes from a self-centered businessman to a rescuer of Jews during the second world war.

The acting is unbelievable. I thought Liam Neeson was okay in the first ten minutes then he really brought his acting skills to another level after that. Ralph Fiennes was great. It was very easy to hate his character.

Steven Spielberg is a marvelous director. All of his movies I seen were great ones and this may be his best. John Williams provided a mesmerizing score that will haunt my mind for a long time.

Overall, this is a emotional movie. This makes me hate Hitler and his SS pigs even more for what they did to these poor people. I rate this film 10/10.",10
30 December 2012,Brilliant,"This is simply one of the best films ever made. It is heartbreaking, depressing and uplifting in equal measure.

The story itself is simple but beautifully realised and the acting is incredible. Liam Neeson, Ralf Fiennes and Ben Kingsley are all magnificent but there is not a duff performance throughout this film.

This is a long film but it never gets boring and there are memorable scenes throughout. I am not a big fan of Steven Spielberg but it is difficult to see how this film could have been bettered by any director.

This film stands as a brutal reminder of the horrors of war but also the incredible bravery and compassion of a few men.

In addition I didn't think that the combination of black and white film and three plus hours of film would be good, but this title proved to be a soul searching work of art. I bought this film after seeing it, that's how good it was.

25 January 2005,how one man made a difference,"The story of Oskar Schindler, adapted from Thomas Keneallay's book 'Schindler's Ark', was brought to the screen by Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson gives a strong and powerful performance in the lead role, bringing a dignity and gravitas to the man who saved the people on his list from certain death at the hands of the Nazis.

The film is in black and white, with the exception of the red dress of a small girl we follow in the Jewish ghetto, and a real-life coda at the end where the people saved by Schindler pay their respects to him. Was Schindler a great man, a humanitarian, or motivated by gain and greed? The film seems firmly in the first camp and in its other characters portrays certain stereotypes - the sensitive Jew played by Ben Kingsley, the sadistic SS man played by Ralph Fiennes.

It doesn't flinch from showing the worst of the Holocaust, and rightly so. But - as the story unfolds and the small amount of people on the list are saved - there is hope within the unspeakable terrors of anti-Semitic propaganda. Along with 'The Color Purple', this is Spielberg's strongest work.",7
23 April 2013,"Hard to watch, impossible to forget","This is one of the most challenging films to review. Not because it's complex or difficult to follow, but because it is quite simply one of the most intense films I have ever seen and the level of emotion is...quite unlike most movies of today.

Widely considered Steven Spielberg's crowning achievement, Schindler's List is a powerful, utterly devastating and raw glimpse at the horrors of the Holocaust. It's also a profound character epic, transforming a man who prides himself on leisure and his bountiful fortune into one who sacrifices it all to save the lives of many.

The first element of note is the phenomenal cast. Liam Neeson leads as Oskar Schindler, and is tremendous. A real, raw, and emotional performance. Ben Kingsley plays Itzhak Stern, a troubled Jewish accountant who helps Schindler in his character transformation. His performance is also incredibly genuine, ever representing some of the best casting in film. Rounding out the fantastic cast is Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, a sadistic psychopath with nothing but hate for the Jewish people. It's an awesome cast that carries emotional weight and intensity, but written with that signature Spielbergian style.

Right off the bat, you can also see the Schindler's List is in black and white. This visual style is striking and refreshing and adjusting to it is remarkably easy. The way the film is shot is more intimate and personal as compared to other Spielberg outings, and the black and white really augments the experience. The sets are recreated with such incredible attention to detail; Everything from the Ghetto at Krakow to the terribly disturbing Auschwitz, Spielberg simply doesn't take you to these places but puts you in them, creating a sense of tangible immersion in these places. John Williams also composed the score for Shindler's List, and is among one of his most original works to date. Straying away from the big and boisterous action packed scores he usually composes, the score for Schindler's List is a more subtle and emotional score, and I was taken away by the beautiful music (the theme is especially memorable).

Being a Holocaust film, Schindler's List has no shortage of intense grit and violence. It's worthy of note because of the brutality of it all, recreating some of the darkest moments of human history with nothing held back. I cried more than a few times during Schindler's List because of these scenes; it's so emotionally poignant and it gets the point across with almost blistering intensity, and if not for the transformation of Schindler the entire film would fall apart. But because of the striking visuals, intimate and strong performances, and that Spielbrgian branded style, Schindler's List shines as a near-perfect balance between intense violence and story.

I will say that Schindler's initial transformation seems rather sudden, but when between the rock and the hard place that Oskar Shindler was in I can see his change of heart. Other than this seemingly dramatic change of character, This film is a masterpiece.

It's all just so incredibly disturbing, powerful, emotional, intense, and violent that Schindler's List becomes ingrained into your mind. And that's a good thing. While all films that win Best Picture are credible in their own right, I can safely say that Schindler's List rises above most for one simple reason: Schindler's List is an important film. In a time when people are denying the Holocaust even happened (for some foolish reason), Schindler's List is a graphic and raw recreation of an event in history that should never be forgotten. Brilliantly casted, well conceived, directed, shot and tremendously powerful Schindler's List is a masterpiece film that, now in 2013, has stood the test of time and will undoubtedly remain a classic for ages to come.

Blu-Ray Review: Picture quality is surprisingly good, with only one or two moments with obvious visual flaw. The audio is as good as it can be. It isn't laser sharp, but isn't distracting either. In terms of a remaster it's awesome. The packaging is in a nice collectable box, and a 3 disc set (2 DVD's - parts 1&2) and 1 Blu-Ray. Digital Copy included is both iTunes (gladly it's HD) and UV.",
9 July 2007,Unflinching Spielberg.,"This film, along with Amistad and perhaps a few others, show that Steven Spielberg is not just a cutesy, non-brutal, gentle director as some of his films make him out to be. This film is not clich√© or heartwarming. The truth is that if you are going to make a film about something as horrifying and terrible as The Holocaust, you have to be brutal. And Spielberg was necessarily brutal. What's depicted in this film is extremely upsetting, and I wish not go into detail fear I upset myself and furthermore upset you. It's not gory or bloody like a war film, (although there are some scenes that boarder on gory), but rather, as you may have guessed, emotionally brutal. I am not a Jewish individual, but I can honestly say, just as a human being, this film upsets me. Schindler's List is extremely well made, with excellent performances, and shot in black and white which I felt set the bitter, old tone.

This is not for the faint of heart, but certainly a very essential, moving film.

One a final note, a praise Spielberg for two things. One would be for making this film for absolutely no money, and also for not turning it into a ""German hate"" movie.",10
14 January 2001,A Powerful Stunning Horrifying Movie,"How people can call this movie 'horrible' or rate it with 1 star is really beyond me. If ever a movie has captured the cruelty and inhumanity of the holocaust this is it. Horrifying scenes such as a woman being shot to death for construction mistakes that weren't her fault, a man taken out to be killed but the gun won't fire and has to hear the officer try to see what the problem is so that he can shoot. And so many many more scenes that will stay in your mind for a long long time.

I didn't cry in this movie. I haven't cried in a movie since I was a kid. But this movie had a huge impact on me that when I went to sleep the night I saw this movie the images kept rolling in my mind (quite like the impact the botched execution scene in The Green Mile had on me).

I saw a review before me (a few pages back) which said that Israeli people are probably the most aware about the Holocaust. But I don't believe that's true. At least not to the younger generation. One of the huge mistake people make (including many many Israelis) is that the Holocaust was only against Jews. I personally find it a disgrace that the Holocaust Memorial Day in Israel and the famed Holocaust Museum in Israel ""Yad Va Shem"" refer only to the figure 6,000,000. When over 11,000,000 people fell victim to the crimes of the Nazis. But hey I'm rambling here. I think this movie definitely captures the torture that the Holocaust victims had to go through.

The movie is in black and white, with only one girl in a red dress who is shown trying to save her life from the Nazis by hiding under a bed. We later see this same girl's body taken to be burned- showing us that she obviously didn't survive. That got to me most. I don't think much of Steven Spielberg as a person. In fact I don't even think that much of him as a director but he did a magnificent job on this movie. I'm, sure that it will become one of the most well remembered movies of all time. People know the figures, the numbers, the years but to see it for yourself just makes you feel so happy that you were not a Jew/Gypsy/Black/Homosexual/Deformed/Handicaped/Left-Handed/Communist, etc. at that time. I think everyone should see this movie.

Although I think it is the most powerful movie ever made, and deserves the number one spot on the IMDb top 250 (over The Godfather, and The Shawshank Redemption) it's not a movie I would see multiple times. Perhaps once a year when it's shown on Holocaust Memorial Day, and even that can be to much. It's the type of movie that it's enough to see once and sticks in your mind. 10/10.",10

7 December 2005,Spielberg's most powerful movie,"Prior to making Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg was known for Close Ecounters, E.T. and the Indiana Jones films - not exactly the kind of resum√© studios would trust when searching for the ideal guy to direct a Holocaust drama. Then again, Scorsese passed on the project because he felt only a Jewish filmmaker could get it right (plus, he was still recovering from the controversy surrounding The Last Temptation of Christ), Billy Wilder said he was too old (but he did contribute to a first draft of the screenplay) and Roman Polanski stated he just wasn't ready to face his childhood nightmares yet (he did nine years later with The Pianist). Spielberg received a lot of criticism before the film was released, purely because of his back catalogue. Of course, it is now a fact he proved everyone wrong with what can be considered the best, most affecting of his serious movies.

Based on Thomas Keneally's bestseller (deftly adapted by Steven Zaillian), the film tells one of the most amazing true stories of our time, one that stands out as a testament to courage and selflessness in a time as brutal and inhuman as World War II. The story is that of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a German industrialist who first came across the ""Jewish situation"" in Hitler's Germany when he decided to employ Jews in his factory in order to save money. He wasn't an outspoken anti-Semite, nor did he oppose the Nazi regime - to him, it was all about business. Case in point: when he first meets his new assistant (Ben Kingsley) and the latter says he's a Jew, Schindler's matter-of-fact answer is: ""And I'm a German."".

The famous list doesn't enter the game until much later, when the cynical businessman witnesses the horrors perpetrated by the SS, particularly the stunningly cruel Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), and decides to use all his power and influence to save as many innocent lives as possible. His actions, which could have cost him his life had he been discovered, will go down in history as one of the most extraordinary events of all time.

If told the wrong way, Schindler's story would have ruined Spielberg's career. Luckily, the director made the wisest choice possible, opting for a documentary-like approach to the material: the film is shot in grainy black-and-white, as if it were a newsreel from that period, and the realism is most evident in the concentration camp scenes - Spielberg doesn't linger on the violence or sanitize it, he just shows it exactly as it was. The one element in color in the whole picture (a girl's red dress, reminiscent of Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now) isn't a concession to the somewhat cheesy sentimentality that is occasionally present in Spielberg's filmography, but a tool to highlight the tragedy of it all. The sobriety of the direction is reflected in every other aspect of the picture, most notably John Williams' Oscar-winning score and the three main performances: Kingsley's talent was never in doubt after Gandhi, and Neeson and Fiennes will probably never do better than here (although both have managed to get pretty close, thankfully).

This painfully real film is a precious means to remember the past and think thoroughly about one of the worst things that ever happened to people, an atrocity mankind hopefully won't repeat, not even in a thousand years. It's a look on the past that serves as a warning for the future, and as such, its power will never diminish.",10
22 January 2017,Righteous among the nations,"The Holocaust has been one of the most awful and tragic event of the History of humanity. It will always remain a stain in our legacy, a true proof of how despicable and monstrous we, the human race, can be.

That's the main reason why the Schindler's List should be praised. It goes far beyond the cast, the awards, the revenue it produced. This movie has been made so we cannot forget and repeat the same atrocities. While more and more survivors of this tragedy are passing away, taking with them their testimonies and there are still people who dare ignoring that those events truly happened, The Schindler's list and its message will always remain for everyone to see.

So I won't review the movie like a simple piece of art. Sure Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes or Ben Kingsley are awesome in that movie and they sure each should have received a so well deserved award for their performance but that's not the most important. The only fact that they are part of this movie should make them proud. If through it, they could help prevent that such horrible tragedies like the Holocaust happen again and save millions of lives in the process, it's definitely worthier than any Oscar or Golden Globe on your shelves! So thank you Steven, Liam, Ralph, Ben and everyone who made this movie a reality. Let your message be spread and shared from generations to generations. So we could never forget and say never again!",10
14 August 2001,Spielbergs greatest movie!!!,"This is the best made movie of the second world war so far in the meaning that it captures the viewers so well and draw os into the plot.

We truly get to see how tragic it was.Of course no one can truly explaine how tragic and gruesome it was,but Spielberg does a dam go job. This is a very powerful movie that you will remember for many years to come.

The whole movie is told in black/white and the characters are so extremely well played.Especially Oscar Chindler which is played by Liam Neeson.(He was born for that role.)

The movie last for over 3 hours,but you don't even notice the time because the story is so touching.

I think everybody should at least see this movie once in their lifetime. Maybe if everyone could see the movie,it could be a better world.

One of the best movies I have seen.",
8 July 2006,"Don't avoid this film: despite the horrific setting, the good guys win!","This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"".

1 December 1999,"Shocking, magnificent work of art","This is the best war film about the Holocaust I have ever seen. It depicts the horrors of the Holocaust and war, the tragedy of Jewish nation, and I know, this film could be directed by a Jew, who keeps these horrible times and crimes against humanity in his heart. The tagline says ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire"". And this film shows us that no human life can be replaced by another one, and that there is nothing more valuable than HUMAN LIFE. I have not seen a film of such a power in my life. Superbly directed by Steven Spielberg, magnificently photographed in black-and-white by Janusz Kaminski (one of the best directors of photography in modern Hollywood, so to say), perfect performances by Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley, and, especially, John Williams' beautiful, brilliant score, brings the whole horror and tragedy, cruelty of Nazism, Holocaust and War. This is Spielberg's Triumph. Congratulations!

25 March 1999,Schindler's List,"An intense and moving motion picture that shocks, astounds and amazes in all of its 3 hours and 17 minutes. Liam Neeson is superb as Schindler, a womanizing bastard who profiteered off the sweat and tears of countless numbers of Jews at the start of the 1940's. As time went on, he saw the demise of the Jewish to Nazi rule and took a stand to save as many as he could. He ended up saving 1,100 Jews and he is considered, to this day, a savior. Neeson's transformation throughout the course of the film from Nazi supporter to Savior of the People is a poignant journey of soul searching. When you watch the piece, you may wonder, ""Is he changing because he's out of money? Does money truly matter at this point anymore? I think many would agree that Schindler had an awakening and that saving the people and himself was his destiny. He found peace with himself and with God.

Steven Speilberg gives us a story that he has never imagined he could bring to us. He brings real life horror. A horror many people cannot confront as a survivor, let alone as an actor. Every actor should be commended for their courage in telling this important story. I am not Jewish, so all I can feel is sadness and sorrow for the tragedies that took place, but I cannot the anguish the countless families have felt for decades over the loss of parents, grandparents and children alike.

With an intense screenplay from Stephen Zallian and cinematography and art direction that is the finest in years. Ralph Fiennes is outstanding as the Nazi soldier who treats Jews as cattle. The scene where he awakes, picks up a rifle and commences firing on a Jewish woman standing alone is true horror.

Through the course of this film, I turned my head away countless times, not knowing what made people do what they do. Was their hope? Hope. That seems to be the key word in describing this movie. Hope is what Oskar Schindler gave 1,100 Jews. He gave them hope. He gave them life!",10
29 July 1998,The Greatest Film Ever,"The words ""The Greatest Film Ever"" hardly describes Steven Spielberg's masterpiece about the Holocaust during World War II. This by far is Spielberg's crowning achievement. Schindler's List is, also, the most beautifully photographed film ever. It's black-and-white cinematography adds to the film's unreal authenticity. Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley add three of the greatest film performances ever. This is a film that everyone should watch.

2 August 2011,Spielberg's timeless masterpiece,"Schindler's List was the first film by Steven Spielberg since Jaws I can genuinely call a masterpiece. Schindler's List is the highlight of the 90's, a touching look into humanism and a frightening look into the Holocaust. Filmed in Black and white (a very good decision from Spielberg) and as grand as Hollywood's most classic works, Schindler's List claims itself at the top of 90's filmmaking. All three leads are magnificent, especially Fiennes in his most well acted role yet. The depiction of the concentration camps is raw and gritty, not glazed over and stylized. A triumph for Steven Spielberg and the cast and crew. It is certainly the most impressive Spielberg film and perhaps the best film of the 1990's.

27 August 2012,A great movie that displays the best and worse of humanity,"1993 was a great year for Steven Spielberg. Just after the release Jurassic Park, he followed with Schindler's List.

I'm not a huge sucker for biographical movies, preferring sci-fi and fictional in general but once in a while there are a few instance where biographical films catch my attention. It's been around for a while and I've heard great things about the movie, not to mention the awards and making it to movie lists. It was only until I found a copy of the film in a video store that I considered to finally watch it.

As with biographical films, I was prepared for a slow-paced movie that might bore me. With a 3-hour running time, I felt it was going to exhaust me by the end of the movie. It was not the case, however.

I've read of how bad the concentration camps are but how they are depicted in this film was far worse to how I imagined them. There's a sense of despair throughout the movie but Schindler's display of selflessness and humanity showed me the power of kindness in the midst of evil.

Acting was great all throughout. I was fascinated with the black- and-white approach but I do understand that it was a way of making the violence a bit tolerable.

Having seen it I can really say this is classic that deserves the praise it got. This movie showed me, on both extremes, the tendency of good and evil men. A powerful movie that should not be missed.",10
17 October 2014,This Really Is Spielberg's Best. Really Is One of Cinema's Best.,"Steven Spielberg is arguably the best film director ever. He may have done some bad movies, but his resume is chalkful of some of the most timeless things to every lay your eyes on. Enter Schindler's List: the true story of a crude nazi-party member (played here by Liam Neeson) that saved the lives of over a thousand Jews during the Holocaust. Spielberg outdoes himself using every trick up his sleeve and more, to the max. The movie is black and white to get an old feeling and the filming in general is dynamic and hauntingly real. So it is a feast for your eyes. The acting is uncanny with everything being character driven, which are the best movies to see. As a brutal Holocaust film, it is difficult to watch. As a movie about a bold hero, it is a major triumph. Many different emotions are felt at very high degrees, happy and sad. Very few movies made this well that can carry you through over 3 hours can make you truly sad and truly happy by the end as a major accomplishment. None of these few movies are Spielberg's. Yeah ET and Indiana Jones were masterpieces, but a funny-looking alien and an invincible archaeologist can't be taken as seriously and, simply, aren't quite as good. With the general movie-making being superior, its seriousness sets it apart from Spielberg's other classics. Because this is Spielberg's best, it is evident that this would be one of cinema's best in general. Top 20, heck, top 10! If somebody calls Schindler's List the best movie ever, I would not disagree.

26 March 2012,500th Review: Simply the greatest historical movie ever made,"Schindler's List is almost too painful to watch - a remarkably subdued but traumatically powerful account of the greatest evil ever perpetrated by mankind. I can't watch it without weeping, not just crying, but every time, I just weep.

Spielberg sets aside all sense of melodrama and instead gives us not only remarkable characterization in Oskar Schindler, Amon Goeth, and Itzak Stern, but also brings an enormous sense of humanity and dignity to an almost impossible subject.

I cannot begin to say what it was like to see this for the first time in the cinema the week it was released - it was simply the greatest film I had seen - it truly captures something about human dignity and hope as well as evil and complacency that go beyond words.

I could write about the magnificent production, and filming, grading, editing and care - but above and beyond this there is just the power of the true story - that one man did make a difference is almost impossible to comprehend given the odds and given the circumstances.

Cinema at its very very best can capture both the reality and the hyper-reality in a way that no other art form can - Schindler's List does - and it remains a living testament and the most powerful reminder that we all can and must choose good over evil.

Schindler's List remains for me one of the greatest, if not the greatest, film I have seen and I always knew it would be my 500th review. Thank you Steven Spielberg, and I hope it will serve always as a reminder why courage and good really matter.",10
23 March 2000,A perfect film,"To sum up Spielberg's masterwork in one word is a nearly impossible task, but I have come to the conclusion that Schindler's List is perfect. Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler is truly great in recreating the role of a modern day Moses. Making this film all the more compelling is John Williams' perfectly composed original musical score. This film deserves all the awards bestowed upon it, especially best picture by the National Board of Review and the Academy and the Academy Award for best director Steven Spielberg. It deserves all these awards and more. Schindler's List is a film that everyone should see and appreciate to its fullest extent. Spielberg will remain an immortal filmmaker through the work he put into this film.

27 September 2009,Powerful message conveyed with brutal honesty,"One of the finest productions ever put on film; also one of the most difficult films to watch that you will ever experience.

It pulls no punches; therefore, it conveys just what a horrifying evil World War II's Nazi Germany really was. The reality of just what hatred and bigotry can influence one person to do to another is shown as ugly as it really is, and it's truly painful to see. The atrocities of this perverse dictatorship could easily be dismissed as a fluke of a violent era, but this film's underlying theme warns it could happen again.

Spielberg outdid himself in this brilliant work. The hopelessness that must have been experienced by the victims of this vile time are captured so well on every level. The acting is superb: the psychotic Nazi colonel was a standout. Liam Neeson is memorable as the guilt ridden German businessman Schindler who endeavors to rescue political prisoners right out from under the Nazis' noses. The many Jewish people targeted and viciously abused in concentration camps are ably portrayed by the cast with strong conviction.

Explicit scenes of ruthless killing and other abhorrent violence are not withheld, and this film is a rare case where such brutal honesty is appropriate and effective. There were scenes where I had to look away; I could almost feel the kick, the punch, the spit, the bullet. It was painful empathy for the terror of those in peril, and witnessing the many disgusting indignities they endured.

It's a guarantee this is not a pleasant watch; some of the imagery may horrify you, especially with the realization that these things depicted actually took place. You will see the lowest and most detestable behavior by people imaginable, and it will stick with you. However, it is a necessary precautionary message. This was Spielberg's finest hour.",9
16 July 1999,A Haunting & Brilliant Masterpiece of the Most Horrifying Period In the 20th Century!,"""Schindler's List"" is one of the best movies of all time according to the people who write the reviews for this site, which isn't a big surprise. I happen to be one of those people who voted 10, but some didn't enjoy it and I know a few people who wouldn't watch this movie, which is understandable due to what this film is about.

This is a truly brilliant film, and I think it's the best film ever directed by Steven Speilberg. It's powerful, it explains a lot, it has a solid cast. Liam Neeson gives a brilliant and Oscar-worthy performance (it's disappointing that he lost) as Mr. Schindler himself. What I thought was interesting was how every bit of detail was explained and how the movie is black and white rather than color (which is a terrific idea if you ask me). There are a lot of interesting things about this movie, and that's number one reason why I loved ""Schindler's List"". This movie never fails to amaze me!

There is not one part in this film that I dislike. I can't say anything bad about ""Schindler's List"". If you see this movie, you might just be as impressed by it as much as I was! :o)",10
20 December 2004,beautifully filmed and has an impact on you that hardly any other film will,"Schindler's list is a film that really handles the horrors of the holocaust, gives you a deep look at it, and almost makes you feel as though you're there with the characters. It is depressing as you see what people had to go through in the concentration camps.

Two other excellent elements of the film are the fact that it has the best on screen hero ever, and one of the best on screen villains ever. The best on screen hero is Oscar Schindler because of how he sacrifices profitable business to save innocent people from the wrath of Hitler. One of the best on screen villain ever is Ralph Fiennes character. Ralph Fiennes character is one of the Nazis who has no heart and kills for sport. The key to having a good villain is having them be as heartless and horrible as possible. That's definitely what this character succeeds at.

This film is excellent and will have an impact on you unlike any other. If you haven't seen it, see it now.",10
11 March 2004,"Even eleven years later, still an impacting movie","When I first saw Schindlers list in the theater when it first came out, I was left stunned and emotionally drained. Now with the release of the film on DVD I am still in awe of the precision and accuracy that it portrays of the atrocities committed by the Nazi's during the second world war. Stephen Spielbergs decision to make the movie entirely in black and white was pure genius and shows why he he is as successful of a director as he is. This film is such a departure from other films that Spielberg has made and is a testament to his sincere embracing of the storyline and content of the story. While this film is long by most standards, nearly twice as long as most contemporary films, it does not drag and keeps the audience rapt attention. It is the type of film which comes along once in a great while which truly captures the imagination of the audience. The subject matter makes this film one which one truly cannot express as an enjoyable film, but on a higher level it is insightful and inspires one to really see how one person can truly change the world, at least their part of the world. Oskar Schindler was a scheming war profiteer who had no interest in any part of world politics, the winds of war were blowing in his direction and he took full advantage of it. As the war progressed and he became a witness to the horrific acts committed by the Nazi's against the Jews he became to see the Jews in a different light to what the political propaganda was saying and he developed a conscience which ultimately led him to expend vast sums of money in bribes and political favors to protect his workers in his factory, initially under the guise of needing to keep trained workers in his factory to maintain production, but eventually because he could see how his workers people were being made to suffer and were being brutally murdered simply because of a misguided political doctrine. Acting in this movie is superb, Lliam Neeson was nominated for best actor for his portrayal of Oskar Schindler and ultimately lost the award to Tom Hanks portrayal of a dying HIV positive lawyer in Philadelphia, this was truly one of those times when the Academy had a very difficult decision to make as both actors justifiably deserved the award. Ralph Fiennes was nominated as best supporting actor for his role as the homicidal concentration camp Kommindant Amon Goeth, he ultimately lost the award to Tommy Lee Jones for his work in the Fugitive. Surprisingly one actor who did not receive a nomination, but should have would be Ben Kingsley who deservedly could easily have won the award for his portrayal of Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern who cooperated and assisted Oskar Schindler in running his Enamelware factory and ultimately used his intelligence to manipulate the system to encompass as many unskilled laborers as possible into Schindlers factory, persons who otherwise would have gone to the death camps as they were primarily musicians, writers and teachers, all who were considered high priority execution material by the Nazi regime. This is a truly remarkable, emotional and moving film that will easily stand the test of time and remain a classic for years to come, it would be highly recommended and should be mandatory viewing material for all high school aged students who wish to graduate, as this film is not just a depiction of the events of World War II, but is also a reflection of the inner monster that lives within all mankind, hatred, and how there also lives within us a capacity to do great good for our fellow man.",
4 June 2012,Masterpiece,"Schindler's List ‚Äì CATCH IT (A+) Schindler's List is a 1993 film about Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. (Wiki) Three hours long black & white movie is remarkable in itself. As the whole time you feel like you're in that time zone and not watching a movie but a history in told in the most brutal natural formal way. I was completely surprised when read on end credits that it's direct by Steven Spielberg. The director who mostly directs big fantasy movies from years. Liam Neeson portrayal of Oskar Schindler as the cunning but sweet hearted man is magnificent. This proves why this man is so well respected and maybe now he has moved to Action (decent) genre we all know what exactly he is capable of. Ralph Fiennes as egoistic Nazi is as despicable as despicable his actions were. In other words he was Incredible. Ben Kingsley is a legend. Overall, even though its 2012, when I finally saw this great Oscar winning movie it's totally worth your three hours.

20 September 2016,"Intense and powerful, great filmmaking","It's easy to see why this film has such a glowing reputation and is referred to by many as a classic. It is, undeniably, an extremely moving and powerful portrayal of the holocaust. The story is an incredible one and it is told beautifully in this film.

'Schindler's List' is an intense watch from start to finish and is inevitably packed with emotion. There are some brilliant individual scenes - the slow motion shot of the girl in the red coat comes to mind as particularly powerful and a great piece of filmmaking, though there are many others.

It isn't my personal favourite holocaust movie - The Pianist still holds that accolade, but 'Schindler's List' is still an excellent film and one of the top must-watch war films.

12 September 2013,There is not a rating high enough........,"I cried throughout this entire film the first time I watched it. It was so moving and powerful. The ash from burning bodies raining down from the sky, and the little children hiding in the cesspit, and the men and women running around naked during the medial inspection in the courtyard. I just sat there and cried. And after the movie was finished I ran out and bought it on DVD but have not been able to watch it again. I just can't bring myself to watch it. I have had it for 6 years now still in the wrapper.

This is how much the movie moved me. I am still in my 20's and like many have only read about the holocaust and it's hard to imagine what the Jews might have gone through, well this movie will paint a very clear picture for anyone who watches it. Spielberg is a genius on so many levels and he has been for some time now. I hope he continues to educate us with his many works of art.

15 February 2002,A lesson in human nature and history.,"We need more films like this, there can never be too many. The history of mankind is filled with gruesome crimes that too many have forgotten but hopefully we will not forget the Holocaust. In the next ten years we will lose most of the people that have a personal memory of the horrible ordeal that was WWII. At the same time we have a growing number of historical revisionists trying to rewrite history. (The revisionists are a part of ""historical school"" trying to deny the existence of the holocaust.)

As a film this is not a perfect one. In truth it is maybe a 7/10 but what makes it important is that it makes an important moral/ethical/historical discussion easily accessible. Even the most uninterested student of history can take in the importance of remembering just how horribly cruel we humans can be. But it also shows that we can all make a stand for what we think is right and not only for what is right for us. The core of the entire story just shows that in times of cruelty, humanity can still prevail.

This is the final proof that Spielberg is a man with a big heart, not only a boy who loves fantasy.",8

17 March 2002,History in Vivid Hues,"After the release of 'Saving Private Ryan', Spielberg, in one of his interviews said that the purpose of a ""war"" film was to disenchant people from war, to show it so horrifyingly that no one would ever want a repetition of what happened in WWI and WWII. Spielberg's purpose in 'Schindler's List' which he made five years before 'SPR' is much the same. With calculated detail he drives home the horrors of war constantly. A third World War may not have the Nazis but there will always be someone who will be equally brainwashed and equally cruel as the Nazis were to the Jews. I've seen war films before(the series 'Escape from Sobibor' which I think was the most vivid), but Spielberg manages to show war in 'Schindler's List' with such a menacing tenacity that you actually have to look away from the screen in some of the scenes. The story of Oskar Schindler starts in a very film noir style(especially the sequence of him in the bar), giving us the impression of him as a typical smooth-talking manipulative lady's man. But this is a very initial primary impression of a man who might be manipulative and a womanizer but whose humanity totally overshadows any of his vices. Liam Neeson is truly classic and magnificent in his portrayal of Schindler. His facial expressions(when he's on horseback, staring as a whole town is driven to ruins because of the Nazi atrocities), his whole demeanor, his voice, make Schindler one of the best characters ever portrayed by an actor. Liam Neeson deserved an Academy Award that year as much as Tom Hanks for 'Philadelphia' did. Sometimes it's a good idea to have a tie for the Oscar and give the Award to both! Because one actor's performance is just as good and commendable as the other's, especially when you have an actor like Neeson playing so complex a character as Oskar Schindler... Ralph Fiennes(who is so spectacular in 'The English Patient'), also gives a charged performance as Amon Goeth. His feelings for Helen, the Jewish girl who works for him are portrayed sensitively.

This movie leaves you with images, you remember the camera tracking behind Neeson and into the bar, you remember him looking at the destruction of a whole town watching from a hilltop, the Nazi soldier playing Piano as people are getting killed, the doctors and nurses mercy-killing their patients so that they'd be dead before being shot by the Nazis, the little boy who saves the life of his fellow prisoners by his clever repartee to Goeth, the beautiful scene between Helen and Schindler in the wine basement, the boy running and hiding in a sewery, the girl in red escaping and hiding under her bed...images that linger long after they are seen. Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is awe-inspiring! He treats us to a visual poetry in black and white, the way he did two years later in color in 'How to Make An American Quilt'. Spielberg's decision to use black and white is laudable, it suits the subject perfectly. Even where he has used color - showing the little girl's red dress, the yellow tones of the candle burning when the rabbi is chanting in Yiddish - the effect is poignant and symbolic.

To say that 'Schindler's List' is a memorable film would be to understate its majesty. It is an altogether breathtaking cinematic experience!",10
8 September 1999,By far Spielberg's best movie.,"""Schindler's list"" ranks in two categories of films: The best movies in cinema history as well as in that category of movies whose subject is what people want to see transfered to the screen. What I mean by that is this: The story of ""Schindler's list"" is how a Nazi works against the rest of the Nazis by making sure that all the Jewish people he can find will not be killed in concentration camps but work in his factory instead. In other words, it's an anti-war and anti-Nazi movie. And it's great.

Liam Neeson is excellent as Oskar Schindler, the one Nazi who doesn't want to see the Jewish people persecuted during WWII. Ben Kingsley is very good as well as Iztak Stern, the Jewish man who Schindler employs to run the factory. However, Ralph Fiennes performance is absolutely masterful. His role is a crazy Nazi officer in charge of a concentration camp and he does a great job at it. In fact, I believe he should have won best supporting-actor in ""Schindler's list"".

Moving, touching, and incredibly realistic, this based on a true story movie is a true gem and honor for cinema history and it's quite understandable that it is found among practically every movie-buff's top ten list. It also has the great advantage of having been directed by another one of the masters, Steven Spielberg. You've got to see it.",10
5 March 2014,What can I add?,"I wanted to write something meaningful about this film what it was not said before. I really do not have anything to add. Everything was said already. I should of given it 10/10, but I only gave that to one film and that is Nicija Zemlja. I know, may be it should of been reverse but it will have to stay that way.

I am so angry with my parents. That they brought me to this world. I am even more angry that I fathered Theodore and Ian. I so much agree with Branko Lustig, God does not exist. Why do we repeat same mistake over and over again? Create children in such numbers that they will become adults and then die either by violent death or in bed? I am so angry, that each night before I go to bed I yell Heil Hitler and Sieg Heil and Deutchelland uber alles. My neighbours think I am crazy, but I am not. I am just so so angry! Inevitability of dieing is always there. From the moment I learned about this world I knew we will all perish sooner or later.

So many books were written and films made about Holocaust and WWII that there is not much to add. That word Endoslung is the word. The final solution! After we clear Germany of that pestilence, we will live in peace and have plenty. We will rise our Ariyan children and be happy, we will not work much, Eastern Europeans will work for us in our Lebensraum and peace will prevail on Earth. But it is interesting, those Ariyan children would grow up and die, where is religion in all of that? Nazis did not have the time to think about that.

Croatia is closest to what we have to that so called perfection. But you know what, I would rather not live in that perfection, if that is how perfection looks. If those shits refuse to come to Branko Lustig*s screenings and they are afraid of the truth which he is now spreading like mantra: God does not exist! then I do not want to be part of that perfection.

Next time you put your penis into vagina and start doing that fantastic thing, I want you to think of Hitler or even better Himmler, I want that cold face to spoil your sex every time! There is no hope! We will all die, and our children will and their children will too. There is no God! Fairy tale!

Heil Hitler!

Sieg Heil!

Good night and good bye!

For ever!",9

It's not just an epic historical drama. It is a statement for so much more. Anti-war, selflessness, love, sacrifice, family, friendship. Almost everything is in it.

The cast and acting is beyond any possible criticism. The direction superb and the music a masterpiece.

Some scholars of the holocaust disagree about its authenticity, but if the intention was to make a statement against war and touch a wider audience.

Overall don't miss it. And prepare for a unique emotional ride.

26 July 2013,MY REVIEW: Top Most on the List Of Fav Movies,"There are good movies, fantastic movies, mind blowing movies and then there is Schindler's List. It tells you the story of the time of holocaust during World War II and how one businessman Oscar Schindler (played by terrific Liam Nesson) becomes concerned about his Jewish work force after witnessing the massacre. It's black and white except the one last scene because there was no point of using colors till that point. It shows we the people can be nice and can be evil without giving a thought to the reason. It is as graphic as it can be while showcasing the horrors of war. You need to be really stone hearted if not moved by this emotional, horrific portrayal of war times. Ralph Fiennes as ruthless German and Ben Kingsley as Jewish business manager of Schindler's factory give knock out performances. But the movie belongs to legendary director Steven Spielberg's unmatched skills of directing the whole story with such uniqueness and conviction that is hard to believe. Schindler's List surely tops my list of top movies.

30 June 2000,Best one of the kind,"Words cannot describe the feeling I have towards this movie. Having family member ancestry of both sides of the war I thought it was important to watch this movie to get my information straghtened out. This is the first movie ever to bring me to tears. Beautifully carved out to a document type feeling. Note of trivia: Steven Spieldberg went home crying everyday crying during production. I don't blame him.

10 March 2009,I couldn't watch it again,"This is one of those films I am glad I watched, but doubt very much if I could ever watch it again. Not because it is a bad film, quite the opposite is true, it is a very well made film with top notch acting, directing, everything. But it's content is so disturbing and some of hte violence so graphic that I couldn't sit through it again. There type of films show the true horror of war rather than the romatasized or comic book approach that leads successive generations of young men to think that war is a glamorous career, when in fact wars are full of evil and horror as this film so aptly depicts. And at last Steven Spielburg got an Oscar, something he should have had many times before since he has produced some of the best films ever in my opinion.

8 May 2008,Historical Masterpiece!!,"There are some movies that are so good,realistic and sad that it is hard for me to re-watch them. This is one.

I haven't watched this since and probably won't ever. Its just to difficult to watch the torture and sufferings of a people as superbly displayed in this movie.

Its about a German officer who saves Jews from the holocaust and will probably make you cry. Its hard to fathom how a people can be so cruel to another people.

If you haven't seen this movie you should. The acting is superb!

And the historical reference is important to know.

27 December 2009,Negative comments?,"Excluding the alleged twist of historical facts, I'm really surprised at the number of people that hated this film. The acting is phenomenal and Spielberg may be rightly accused of being manipulative, but any film that can move 80% of an audience (I attended an opening night showing) to tears is incredible. There's a technical kudo: review the tracking shot Spielberg used when the Nazis invade the city (Schindler's on horseback on a date)... an astonishing achievement (superior to famous 1962's The Longest Day tracking scene...). I also love some of our foreign friends' opinions vis-a-vis our treatment of Indians, the Ludlow Massacre, etc. (inarguably horrible chapters in U.S. history). But that's akin to saying a British film stinks thanks to the Crusades. This is an outstanding film and certain scenes still resonate in my head (the child in the latrine, Schindler's end-of-film breakdown... or how I never could seem to pronounce Ralph, Rafe... Raphe... Finney... Finez... oh, forget it). This rates a 10++++ (and I hated 1941 and had a difficult time with Empire of the Sun...)

The acting, cinematography, story, screenplay , directing, and just well everything is amazing in this portrayal of the Holocaust. The film was very powerful and some scenes just shocked you, that's how great this movie really is. Very emotional also and that girl with the red stuff on walking through the streets was very touching and emotional. The whole film is kind of based on that. This one of the best films ever made and one of Steven Spielberg's best, this movie really is that amazing.

Hedeen's outlook: 10/10!! **** A+

8 January 2008,Lives up to the hype,"Finally watched it. And, even with everything it's been hyped up to be, I was still impressed. I thought it worked best when it was just focusing of Schindler, and showing his growing reaction to the horrors around him, rather than outright showing the atrocities, but you can't really fault Spielberg for showing bits like the Ghetto liquidation scene, or the shower scene, because they're so powerful without really being manipulative at all. The only bit that really falls into emotional manipulation is the final scene with the rocks, which really took me out of the movie and was obviously a personal, not artistic, choice by Spielberg.

I was also very surprised at how technically superb and inventive the film was. I expected the powerful impact, but I didn't expect some rather creative shots like the piano playing during the liquidation, or the distant shadow at the top of the long staircase. It's really a beautifully shot film, which is refreshing, because Spielberg could have easily gone for a gritty, raw feel and probably still got the same effect, but the near-noir like set-up made the on-screen horrors even more unbearable, due to their glamourized feel.

The acting is almost uniformly excellent, from Neeson's gradual growth over the film, to Fiennes' unredeemably evil yet almost sympathetic villain, to Kingsley's quiet nobility, and Embeth Davidtz's rather underrated turn as Amon Goeth's housemaid. It's really a shame that the film won no acting Oscars, as it truly deserved some, especially Fiennes for his tormented performance. The story is not the typical ""exposition-build up-climax-denouement"" but I liked that, as you really didn't know where the story was heading next, and it gave the whole thing a sense of danger and desperation, much like what the characters would feel.

This was probably the most well-known and well-received film that I hadn't seen, and now that I have, I have to say I'm not disappointed, though I don't know how many more times I'll be watching it. It really takes a lot out of you. Furthermore, despite how much I loved it, it's probably not even in my top five Spielberg films, which is really a testament to how many superb films he's made.",9

25 April 2017,A Most IMPORTANT Film,"A fellow reviewer started his review of ""Schindler's List"" almost on the defensive, with an assumption that others might be critical of his determination of this film as one of the greatest, that he would place it ""up there"" (my words) with ""The Godfather"" and ""Citizen Kane.""

I'm going to contend that ""Schindler's"" is not only among the greatest, it goes down in historical terms as perhaps one of the most important films ever made. This truth-based story is most compelling, holding this viewer's interest intact throughout for 195 minutes. Liam Neeson does a most incredible job as the hero/anti- hero, Oskar Schindler. A super cast also includes Ralph Fiennes, a perfectly played antagonist, and Ben Kingsley, in the first role following his Oscar-winning performance as Gandhi. It took this viewer quite some time before realizing that the character of Itzhak Stern was indeed played by the masterful Kingsley.

The cinematography is key to the story telling, filmed in a crisp black and white to recapture the era and help accentuate the mood. Credit is due Steven Spielberg, as he eventually adds in a few small elements of color which give us hope.

The atrocities committed by Nazi Germany against the Jewish race is a history that cannot ever be overlooked and/or forgotten. To that end, ""Schindler's List"" is a very important film that can help generations to come to develop greater empathy for their fellow man. I can't begin to emphasize how important this film should be to any serious film viewer.",10

9 February 2012,"""If you save one life, in time you save the world.""","This amazing story is, in my humble opinion, the epitome of Spielberg's work. To bring a story like this to the screen is nothing short of magnificent. It would be difficult to single out a particular actor for their contributions, since the film is so cohesive and unified. You are immediately drawn into the action, you are watching the events unfold as if you were there. Liam Neeson's performance as Schindler is dynamic and compelling. At first he appears the opportunist and war profiteer, but his growth through the film lets you feel his compassion. Ben Kingsley's quiet and steady demeanor throughout the film compliments Neeson's. Ralph Fiennes is the quintessential Nazi camp commandant, unhappy to be where he is, ruthless in his orders, and totally without compassion. He is a soulless man who cannot feel love or hate, simply disdain for the Jews, as if they were cattle. There are so many scenes in this film that speak to your soul, but perhaps the most important line in the film occurs near the end. ""If you save one life, in time you save the world."" The violence and cruelty of the film make it unsuitable for those under 14, and between 14 and 17, I would use sound judgment. A definite collectors item, and if they haven't shown this to your teens in high school, they ought to. This is a reminder of the inhumanity man can reach if he has nothing to stop him.",10
19 September 2014,A masterpiece that is profoundly humane and indeed tragic yet hopeful.,"A masterpiece that is profoundly humane and indeed tragic yet hopeful.

'Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.'

I finally made it, I cannot ever see the whole picture at once for it's brutality that was displayed, but yesterday night I did it gone through the film at length and just took a water break and the 3 hour long saga made me cry even an hour after it was ever. I am emotional and certainly have deep feelings, I cam to restore them again with very film. It made an impact and it re emphasised the value of the life a human, I know what a loss means, I have gone through that, I just can't bear any untimely losses anymore. Here, they are organising a crime of execution of poor souls.

I wrote the film is in English, though 40% of it is German and Polish.

It's about Oskar Schindler, a Nazi man man who saved more than 1100 Jews from the holocaust of the German Army. 6 million Jews were killed them can you imagine how much it is, 6000000. That is, a whole race was being eliminated and this man stood up against all odds, and saved 1100 of those. Now, this did happen and Oskar Schindler is one of the few heroes who must be revered for what he done to Jew community specifically and to humanity at large.

I can say that I am now happy to be reviewing a masterpiece that shows a world of a different kind, a world that I never knew of, but it happened to exist in the world ward 2 under Hitler's regime. A world where they call you names, just to kill you, where people are not afraid to be dead either. This was what Taliban had did to those in Afghanistan.

Now cinematically it's flawless, it's 3 hours but no editing is needed, any cut would demean the value of a life of a Jew, it's best the way it is, cinematography, sound, music, set design and art direction are sublime. Now, what' great is you have nearly thirty thousand people working on a film and they themselves make a world that is real in every sense. The actors everyone of them is just so real. We watch history and many epic films but this one is something else. It is by far the greatest documentary made on war.

I cannot say anything about the genius of Spielberg, I am no worth even to utter a word of single word of praise. About the film, I can say this much, you might not like to watch it many times, but if you did it once, it's highly unlikely to forget anything about this film.

By the way, I loved Itzhak Stern played by Ben Kingsley, he is more a hero here than anyone else.

It's not about applauding the team for such a masterpiece, it's about thanking them for what they have done to humanity by depicting history the way it was. They brought us a story that teaches us value of a life, what more can you ask. I am speechless and even a 5/5 rating seems so less, to this masterpiece.

Ah, it's aching me even now as I write this in the joy of pain. Salutauions to the heroes who have saved lives and our only little tribute we can give them is by knowing their story, so please watch this film.

Those, who have seen this, they may better know where it comes. For those who have not, here is a scene from the ending of the film.",10
3 September 1999,extraordinary motion picture,"I thought I would watch the movie again before I reviewed it, which is easy since I have it on tape.

It's the true story of Oskar Schindler a business man who saved over 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust. It won 7 Academy Awards inaddition to a number of other awards including the Director's Guild. The Cinematography for this movie was brilliantly done, it was truly haunting. This film had some of the best performances I have seen. Ralph Fiennes did an excellent acting job when took on the character Amon Goeth. Amon a man who likes his Jewish maid a little too much, he seems to be quite disturbed and also is quite brutal. Liam Neeson acting so also excellent he really played the role. Oskar Schindler is a member of the Nazi party who is a womanizer and a war profiteer. He character changes very much because he knows what the Germans are trying to due the Jews. The scene where the Germans remove the Jews from the Ghetto is disturbing and well directed. The unearthing of the bodies scene is haunting and disturbing. The ending of this movie brings a tear to my eye everytime. An extraordinary film with a compelling story and stunning score. 10/10 for this masterpiece. Number 9 on the AFI's 100 greatest movies.",10
26 March 2006,****Superlative Holocaust Film A Treasure.,"There are no words adequate enough in the English language to describe this fabulous film.

John Williams's musical score is just awesome and with Yitzchak Perlman on the fiddle, what could be better? You are just drawn to the theme of this highly emotionally unforgettable masterpiece.

Liam Neeson has never been better as Oskar Schindler, whose ""factory"" saved a thousand Jewish lives during the Holocaust.

We see Neeson go through the film as a callous businessman to one of great feeling when he sees what is happening to the Jews of Poland.

This was the first black and white film to capture the best picture Oscar since 1960's ""The Apartment.""

Neeson gets tremendous support from Ben Kingsley as his bookkeeper and an amazingly brilliant performance by Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, the Nazi mad-dog official. Fiennes portrayal is absolutely frightening as he steals each scene he is in in this remarkable film.

The ending will tear at your heart as those saved place stones on Jewish graves.

A positively memorable Holocaust film with memorable detail depicted. The liquidation of the ghetto scenes are a haunting memory to what happened in Nazi occupied Europe.

Who can forget the little girl's colored coat as she too becomes a victim of the Nazi genocide? What effect this scene had!",10
25 April 2001,Shattering impact...one of the great films of all time!,"Words are not enough to describe the overall impact of this powerful film about a profiteer (Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler) during World War II who uses the Jews as cheap labor in his factory until he decides to save over 1,000 of them from death in the gas chamber. Nor are there enough adjectives to describe the performances--especially Liam Neeson as the enigmatic Schindler, a complex man who ironically becomes a saviour of Jewish souls. Although lengthy, it never once loses tension or interest and the decision to use black and white photography was a wise one, considering that all the war footage in the '40s was seen only in monochrome. Ralph Fiennes gives a masterful performance as the chief Nazi villain and should have won a Best Actor Oscar for his work. The John Williams score has a haunting quality--his main theme is a fascinating example of his uncanny ability to connect with the material he was scoring. As powerful a film as ever emerged about World War II, this film will undoubtedly increase in reputation as the years pass, fully deserving of all the praise it reaps. So real that some of it is difficult to sit through--but no serious minded filmgoer should miss it.

Powerful movie. Shows well the extremes of man's inhumanity to other men (the Nazi concentration camps and the systematic extermination of the Jews) and how there is also good in the world, fighting this evil. Quite graphic in showing what the Jews went through. This makes the saving of many of them from this fate even the more emotional.

Superb performance by Liam Neeson in the lead role. An equally compelling performance comes from Ralph Fiennes as the sadistic SS concentration camp commander. No cartoon villain, Fiennes inhabits the role and makes him a worthy adversary for Schindler and an evil that must be vanquished.

10 February 2016,The best movie of all times,"Schindler List is a movie about everything, begins with most basic values in the human natures until a complex analysis of war society, and find a journey to the human heart, in good and bad forms. Schindler list is a movie 10 in all questions, history, photography, OST and in send a message.

First we need know the movie is about a couple relationship between the Nazi government, German business man and the Jewish people. Schindler is entrepreneur, capitalist and a good negotiator, he has good relationships with military, and military enjoy your source of guns and material to support the war. A well established relation, Schindler keep low cost using prisoner as cheap labor to his factors, a smart but not decent idea.

Although his well wealthy business, Schindler decide he can change the world. This is the main point of the movie, and how he star to achieve a bigger goal instead the quarterly balance sheet profits. Schindler decide all system is not correctly, and he understand a change is need.

The lesson in this film is the status quo isn't a law, it can be changed by the humans. When oppression is the law, kill is normal, when human are properties have a act to change all it is the right decision. Schindler is what all we need in the moderns day, a break point in the society, a hero doing the obvious, a man whit heart and ambition to change the world.",10
22 March 2006,Powerful and moving depiction of one unlikely hero's Holocaust,"Stephen Spielberg's amazing Schindler's List is an incredibly moving, graphic depiction of Holocaust horrors, as they relate to one unlikely humanitarian hero. The Czech born German businessman, Oskar Schindler, starts up a factory in Poland, intending to make his fortune by taking advantage of cheap Jewish labor. As he becomes increasingly aware of the concentration camp horrors, his motivations change from profit to helping his fellow man, and he is able to save 1100 Jews from the atrocities and gas chambers of Auschwitz.

Liam Neeson is brilliant in the role of the cool and very human Oscar Schindler, an ordinary businessman not lacking in human frailties himself. The only other actor that I specifically recall from the movie is Ben Kingsley (who earlier played Gandhi), always wonderful in any role.

Just a trivial detail, but I found very touching the Jewish custom of placing stones on the graves of loved ones. It is used with dramatic effect in this movie.

This is a superbly crafted film, the use at times of black and white photography giving a starkly moving, documentary mood. The movie serves as a dramatic tribute to one ordinary and obviously flawed man who, through good will, smarts, and audacity, was able to save so many lives. It is also a troubling personal depiction of the Holocaust, brought to horrific life to many viewers because of Spielberg's efforts. However, it is NOT of course, by any means, an entertaining film. I have not seen it since its original release and find it too disturbing to deliberately set forth to watch a second time.

Although some reviewers have criticized the insensitivity and false portrait, I'd also recommend the Italian film, Life is Beautiful, for a different and unusual view of concentration camps, a story filled with love, humor, and optimism. Also, although I believe there was in years past a TV movie of some sort (starring Richard Chamberlain?), I'd like to see a major film done on another Holocaust hero, Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved countless Hungarian Jews. I put Wallenberg in a similar heroic category along with Oskar Schindler.

Schindler's List is a must see movie, both disturbing history and extraordinary heroism brought dramatically to life on the screen.",9
6 May 2005,A story that captures many aspects of the Holocaust. Fanatastic Movie.,"Steven Spielberg made a lot of money out of his successful film, and yes, he also finally received an Oscar (Although I think some of his earlier work should receive one too). There are many interesting stories about the holocaust and WWII, and I wonder what attracted Spielberg to Schindler's story so much. Well, if you saw the film you can see that what Spielberg and Schindler have in common is money and ambition. Spielberg in my point of view is a great producer/business man. He knows how to make money (even for the Holocaust). I believe that is why Spielberg's so attracted to Schindler's character. Don't get me wrong, Spielberg has also values as well, and it is said that most of what the film has earned Spielberg donated to the Holocaust foundation. Spielberg is a franchise but I get the feeling that he cares. So in parallel to Schindler's character that evolves through the film, Spielberg uses the money he earns to make some good.

Schindler is presented as a business man, who is interested in making money - actually a war profiteer. But something changes in his plan, Schindler learns slowly that the Nazi ideology is stupid and evil, and he goes on a process through the film of purging himself out of this ideology. He starts to care for ""his Jewish workers"", and by the end of the film he even cries, not for the loss of money, but for the life he could have saved.

There are many scenes in this film, created in detail, through the help of survivor's testimonies. Some of them are extremely violent or contain nudity. Those scenes, which are shot brilliantly, are required for realism and I really like them, as I believe that such appalling violence is reserved only in film and not in our life.

I find Schindler's List as a visual experience one should not miss, as it helps you grasp the horror and violence of the Nazis. Since Hollywood controls the world market of cinema, this movie is a breakthrough, bringing the story of the holocaust to the whole world.",10
22 February 2013,It needs to be seen,"I feel really goofy trying to write anything about this film. It's all been said on this site and most of it is true.

The first thing to underline is that Ralph F. should have won best supporting actor in a supporting role. I was so stunned that he did not. He is so good that for months I didn't know he wasn't German. And his character is truly vile. Read up on the real Amon Goeth and you will see what an evil man he portrayed. He probably didn't care, but good golly.

Secondly, having dated an observant Jew for a long time, I can attest to the Talmud quotation. My boyfriend believed and lived that precept.

No, this film is not earth-shaking, but once you see it, please remember that some of the people who made the film with Spielberg were, themselves, survivors. If you remember that Oscar ceremony, you might remember that one man got up to accept the award and gave the numbers that he had tattooed on his arm. It really happened!",10
25 January 2000,"This movie is simply perfect, nothing else","After watching this movie I feel deeply compelled to recommend it to everyone. It's simply perfect and nothing else. I feel extremely grateful to Steven Spielberg for creating such a wonderful movie, a true masterpiece. Schindler's List deserves to be on top of all the 1999 movies. It's a tribute to the victims of the Holocaust and it's also a tribute to the generosity of the human heart. Don't wait any longer. Rent it now.

16 April 1999,one of my top 5 favorites ever!,"Schindler's List is without a doubt the greatest movie ever made in the 90's and for me is among the top 5 greatest movies ever. I believed every second of this masterpiece. Great performances by Liam Neason, Ben Kingsly and Ralph Fiennes work, but the truly great things about this movie are the effective Jewish performances and and the incredible art-direction this movie has. Schindler's list is not a film for young kids, but everybody over the age of 14 should see this great movie.

1 May 2014,Raw reality of 2nd world war in Europe,"Showing the monstrosities of war as performed and underwent by normal people in special situations. No specific stereotype good and bad guys. No romantic feeling left regarding war after seeing this masterpiece of human tragedy. Instead of films like, The Piano where the world consists of clearly good or German (stereotype dumb, cruel), Schindler's List shows people who are trapped in war and loose their way. Whether because they are being persecuted, part of the German army or civilians who try to survive. Schindler's List doesn't judge and doesn't need to. A fairly straight account is given from the live and thoughts of the main characters. Emotional stress is sometimes evoked by shots in black- and-white: no overacting needed. Just sit down with your kids and get a real picture of human tragedy at the 2nd world war as took place in Eastern Europe.

4 June 1999,Splendid; the only 90's film on my Top Ten,"One thing we forgot about Steven Spielberg, that no one really seems to notice. He is the most skillful handler of gallows humor outside of Tarantino and the Coen brothers.

Gallows humor: the pain of real life, happening to someone else. Please understand, I'm not speaking of the truly horrifying scenes of massacre in this film and ""Saving Private Ryan"". I'm talking about specific instances only. Consider the scene in the ""...Ryan"" film where a soldier is struck in the helmet with one bullet, is amazed that he has lived, and is shot through the head after another soldier comments, ""lucky bastard."" It has the rhythm of comedy, and we might laugh if we weren't scared stiff. It shocks us and keeps us off-balance, which is precisely why both movies work so very well for all of their considerable running times. They also give Spielberg license to be sentimental later on--he's EARNED his right to be sentimental in those movies.

The thirty-minute opening to ""...Ryan"" and many scenes in ""Schindler's List"" grip people in a very unique way, and often they can't completely describe it. That's because they CAN'T completely sum up how they feel. Here's what it is. Spielberg never lets us settle down with one defense mechanism for these sequences, because when we do we let our guard down somewhere else. I can say with impunity and without exaggeration that Spielberg is the finest manipulator of movie audiences since Alfred Hitchcock.

""Schindler's List"" could've been just another comprehensive look at the Holocaust. I'm not saying that that would not have been needed, but I'm very impressed that he didn't settle for ""just another."" He's made a remarkable film memorializing the most heinous criminal act in modern times, and he made it DIFFERENT from every other movie we've ever seen. Yes, there are influences we can catalog, and we can argue that no filmmaker has really done anything special with the cinematic art since D.W. Griffith, but that's not my point. Spielberg has sewn in moments of grief, fear, depressing thrills, breathtaking spectacles, grotesquely brutal acts, and perfect little snippets of comedy. The Wagner-backed helicopter raid in ""Apocalypse Now"" did that for about twenty minutes. Spielberg has given us three gorgeous, haunting hours.",
6 May 2002,it may be only 6th on the imdb list but i've got a new #1,"perhaps it's a clue about the sad state of our world, the inevitability of the holocausts of the past and the holocausts yet to come, that a full half of the films rated higher on the imdb top 250 than this monumental movie celebrate violence and war. blood and death are now and have always been the high art of our greedy raging world. we can pray for the future, but peace can only come true if people are willing to see the world through the vision of justice, respect for humanity and willing to sacrifice so others may live. That is why i suggest the visions of Keneally, spielberg and oskar schindler. this movie is so magnificent from here on out all my grades will go down in perspective. 12 oscar noms, 7 wins (including picture and director), a host of other accolades, all amply deserved. there is just so much to admire: the mix of large scale storytelling with countless smaller story arcs (kudos to Steven Zaillian's oscar winning adapation of keneally's wondrous novel), hundreds of amazing and daring cinematic touches (set design, cinematography, and editing all also picked up statues) dozens upon dozens of bravura performances, monolithic sets with literal casts of thousands, impressive historical accuracy, the list is near endless, a series of beauties rising into ultimate truth: a film with a soul. perhaps the powerful beauty of this film is that spielberg does not put a hollywood polish on the fact that oskar schindler was a comprised man yet capable of tremendous goodness. in some ways this can be seen as spielberg's first mature film and it's entirely appropriate that this was the first time he collected an oscar after 5 noms. the journalist in me wants to document all the details in this well earned victory, but the humanist in me just wants to thanks everyone involved for the fact it exists. whatever else may be wrong with our planet we can still find hope in the fact that men like schindler are remembered and revered and honored in such an celebrated and immensely popular film. if my words can make you see a film or work for peace, let this one be the one, let now be the time.",10
21 December 2004,Extremely rewarding film,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs

The true story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) a German businessman during World War 2 who saved the lives of around 1100 Jews by creating a use for them as labourers in his factories before moving them to his hometown as a safe refuge from Auswhictz in the closing days of World War 2.

I'm not sure quite what Spielberg was trying to accomplish by filming this project in black and white,but if he was trying to add a darker,more authentic tone than the film already had,he has failed.There was colour back in those dark times of the Holocaust,and it would have had a more real edge had it been included (with the exception of a little girl running through a crowd in one scene in a red jacket looking like she'd popped right out of a Butlins advert!)What he's succeeded more in doing is paying homage to those b/w war movies from the late 50s/early 60s,and perhaps added a nice touch of film noir for good measure.

As a kid (when I originally saw this film) a film running at nearly three and a quarter hours would have seemed like an eternity,but I must say watching it again today the length did seem to run by comparatively quickly.The film does seem to suffer from a lack of narrative flow,although the actual story remains no less engaging.

It is certainly a harrowing account of surely one of the most evil events in human history.We see Jews being treated with less dignity and respect than dogs,and the Nazis certainly put less value on their lives than them.

Neeson delivers a commanding central performance as the wartime businessman propelled by his own needs and desires,but offered salvation through his care and concern for the plight of the Jewish people.There's good support,too,from Ralph Fiennes (who would go on to accomplish even bigger and greater things-not including The Avengers!) as the heartless,sadistic Nazi soldier and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's wearisome accountant.

Overall,this film doesn't manage to be quite as shocking as it was trying to be by being filmed in black and white (which not everything in life is,anyway!).Senior Spielbergo would go on direct another powerful war film some years later by the name of Saving Private Ryan,which had an unforgettably powerful opening sequence involving the Normandy landings which was filmed in colour and managed to stick in the memory much more prolificly.However,it is gut-wrenching stuff nonetheless and certainly not a film that deserves to be forgotten in a hurry.*****",10
29 January 2001,"Shocking, to say the least","In 1993 I saw this movie in the theater the day it opened here in Holland, and it made such an impact on me that I was afraid to watch it ever since. Now, seven years later, I watched it again, alone, on a saturday night, and again it was one of the most harrowing movie experiences of my life, even on the small screen.

This one is up there among other movies about the Holocaust, such as Night and Fog (Resnais, 1956) and Shoah (1985). I think that when you watch these three movies you can catch a glimpse of what these have gone through during WW2, although this of course can never be established through film, this horror.

All during this movie you are bombarded in a Spielberg-fashion speed with images that are so gruesome that they bring you on the verge of tears. It was only till the last scene of the real Schindler Jews and the actors laying stones on Schindler's grave that I broke. The music, the imagery, the sensitivity with which Spielberg handled this subject was so convincing and staggering that it truly made me cry. I don't think Spielberg will ever make a more personal movie than this.

During the screening I attended seven years ago some people found the imagery too much to handle, and walked out of the theater. It was just too much.

I think 1,000 words are not nearly enough to express what I felt and still feel about this movie, so I will just say:

If you haven't seen this movie yet, see it. If you've already seen it, vote for it and go see it again.

4 March 1999,A great piece of moviemaking,"I definitely had very high expectations before I watched this film. After all, I was one of the few people that I knew that hadn't seen Schindler's List. Recently, high expectations have been my downfall coming into a film because I expect too much and that is clearly the case here.

Sure, this film is very highly regarded and may even go down as the best film of the 90's, however, it didn't blow me away as I expected or show me an aspect of filmmaking that I have never seen before. Spielberg does an incredible job as usual using his keen sense of angles and dimensions that make every scene speak volumes. The cinematography by Janucz Kaminsky captures a lot of the feeling of the second world war, yet it didn't blow me away.

I found it interesting that in this film the characters seem to take a secondary role to the setting, history and true story of the Holocaust. Liam Neeson played Schindler well, but did not affect me like other characters in great films. Even Ralph Fienns character was played well but also failed to register as a memorable one.

Don't get me wrong, I really liked this film and the message it sends. I don't think this is the best film of the 90's, however, realize that it is still one of the best.

9/10 stars.",9
19 June 2009,The masterpiece of 1993....Schindler's List,"Any filmmaker who chooses to deal with the Holocaust faces several serious problems. The first is deciding which story to tell. Conventional heroics are impossible;a realistic look at the horror is too appalling. In Thomas Keneally's fact-based novel,Steven Spielburg found the right balance of redemption and sorrow.

Oskar Schindler(Liam Neeson) is an ambitious businessman who realizes that there is money to be made in war. In a masterful opening montage,Spielburg mixed the forced transfer of Polish Jews to cities after the Nazi occupation with Schindler making his own moves. As families register with bureaucrats who sit at folding tables and make their tidy lists,Schindler matches suits and ties,selects the right cufflinks,and pockets a hefty bankroll. The Jews are forced into their ghetto;Schindler goes to a nightclub where he wines and dines high-ranked Nazis. The two worlds come together when Schindler meets Itzhak Stern(Ben Kingsley)and offers him a deal. Since Jews cannot own businesses,they should work together. Stern's contacts can provide financial banking. Stern himself can provide the expertise to run a business. Schindler will bring ""panache."" ""That's what I'm good at,"" he says. ""Not to work...the presentation.""

It may not be a fair deal,but once Schindler signs contracts to provide the Wehrnmacht with cooking utensils,he is able to open an enamelware factory that provides several hundred Jews with jobs. Those jobs,the documentation that goes with them,give the men and women a measure of safety as the Nazis' plans for the ""final solution"" grind inexorably forward to the March 13,1943 liquidation of the Krakow ghetto. That is one of the most harrowing series of scenes ever put on film,and it is matched by the concentration camp sequences that follow. In those scenes of mass chaos and slaughter,Spielburg uses a single spot of color to highlight one little girl. In the black-and-white world,her coat is red. It's almost the same shade as the jacket worn by the young protagonist of Spielburg's Empire of the Sun(1987),in a similar situation when he's alone in a mob and trying to find his way home.

In those same scenes,Amon Goeth(Ralph Finnes)is introduced. Goeth is a flabby sociopath who comes to embody the evils of Nazi racism. He is in charge of the camp where the workers are housed and so must be brided and pampered if Schindler is to stay in business. Goeth's excessive cruelty is also part of the reason that Schindler is transformed from war profiteer to crusader. The exact moment of that change is not shown,and it should not be shown. Though popular films are built around such epiphanies,that scene would be out of place in this careful film. Instead,its an accretion of layered awareness that makes Schindler what he becomes. Though Goeth is a selfish,undisciplined man who drinks too much and sleeps with too many women,he is moved by the mounting barbarism,cruelty,and savagery that surrounds him. Neeson's performance is built on a combination of self-confidence,indecision,and doubt.

Though some have criticize Steven Zaillian's script on the grounds that it makes Schindler more altruistic than he really was,it does stick closely to historical fact in the numbers of people that Schindler saved from the Holocaust. In the same way,the real Goeth was even more monstrous than he is in the film. But the full scope of his atrocities had been shown,the film would have been unbalanced. As it is,Spielburg pushes the limit,showing as much of the horror as the screen will bear. That horror is alleviated,slightly by Janusz Kaminski's stunning black-and-white cinematography. It gives the violence an abstract,dreamlike quality that no form of color could have matched. He won an Academy Award for his work,and the American Society of Cinematopgraphers placed the film at number five on its best-shot(1950-1997)list. John Williams's somber,almost unoticed score adds the melancholy tone. ""Schindler's List"",also was the overall winner at the Academy Awards. Winning seven Oscars including Best Picture of 1993,as well as Best Director and for Steven Spielburg.

Any viewer might be able to find shortcomings somewhere in the collaborative effort,but to what point? Schindler's List demonstrates the potential of Hollywood film-making that is so rarely achieved. When the full financial resources of the industry and best creative people are put in service of an important story,the results can be staggering.",
11 September 2003,The most important movie of all time **** (out of ****),"The holocaust is one of the most horrific pieces of history we have. Because it occurred so recently, and was on such a massive scale, it is important we understand it. Schindler's List is Spielberg's finest hour, the greatest film ever made on the holocaust and the most important movie ever made. Ever single person should be REQUIRED to see this movie. It shows the depths that humanity can sink to, the horrors of our race, yet Schindler's List is about survival, about compassion, about the saving of souls, the saving of lives. It is a remarkable film, and a key piece to world history. The performances are perfect, the direction is superb, and the story is one of the greatest imaginable.

8 September 2008,The cruelest film ever made. This is the closest we will ever come to witnessing pure evil in film.,"This, to me, is the cruelest film ever made. Sure, there have been many films that have depicted cruelty in it's most realistic and most non discriminating. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL showed us a very true depiction of the holocaust. CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST showed us how far people will go to be known and to be famous. IRREVERSIBLE showed us a nine and a half minute rape scene that is nearly impossible to watch and to sit through without being forever haunted by it. SALO' OR THE 120 DAYS OF SODOM showed us pure innocence being destroyed and defiled by political right-wingers. HAPPINESS showed us how deeply depraved and how inhuman and mentally deformed some seemingly ""normal"" people are. VISITOR Q depicted a family whose members indulge in the most disgusting, horrific, and depraved and don't even seem to know that what they are all doing is wrong. MONSTER was a film in which a prostitute killed her customers, not because she got a thrill out of it, but because society left her no choice. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE depicted a damaged and deranged human mind and then showed us what happens when the body that mind belongs to is no longer able to perform what the mind wants it to. PINK FLAMINGOS shows us two groups of people who act in every bad and evil activity known to mankind, knowing that it's bad and not caring. However, SCHINDLER'S LIST in my opinion, goes even further than all of those films. SCHINDLER'S LIST is a film that all of humanity should be required to watch and sit through. I refuse to watch it again. SCHINDLER'S LIST was a film that affected me so strongly and so deeply that just thinking about it frightens me. I've tried to sit through it a second time and got about halfway through, but I just couldn't handle it and I refused to finish it. SCHINDLER'S LIST is the closest we will ever come to knowing what it was like to be a part of the holocaust. It is among one of the darkest films I've ever seen in my life. The film itself is about Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi party, who owns a company and puts Jews to work in it. However, on the opposite side of the structure we meet a man named Amon Goeth. Goeth is a man who cares so little about the value of human life that he target practices with Jewish people in the Ghetto. To say that the violence in this film is unflinching isn't doing the violence enough justice. We don't watch the violent scenes as much as we full on witness it in at it's angriest and goriest. People are shot in this film. We don't see people firing a gun and then have the camera cut to people falling to the ground. We see people helplessly held at gun to the head and then shot like dogs. We see the blood shoot out very violently and graphically. We see it coat the faces of the victims and the executioners. We see many more horrific things. We see bodies blown apart, tossed aside, and broken apart. We see rotting corpses cooked and we see the remains rain from the sky. We see children get butchered and slaughtered as if their young lives were worthless and expendable. We see it all and we feel helpless. The people who do it don't see anything wrong with doing it and even make games and goofy gestures out of it. Many people will have a difficult time sitting through this film, but it remarkably watchable. As cruel and as brutal and dark and gory as it is, it is a flawless film. The film's ending makes it all worth sitting through. It remains to be one of the most moving and emotional ending in motion picture history. The final thirty minutes are so heart wrenching, honest, beautiful, and strong that it is worth enduring two hours and forty minutes of non-stop cruelty. The ending remains to be the of the great endings in motion picture history. We may not recover from the film, but what we gain from the ending alone makes it all worth defiling your mind.

PROS:

-Absolutely perfect performances from the entire cast and all speaking parts.

-Unflinching and honest depiction of the Nazi Holocaust of the 1940s.

-beautiful black & white cinematography.

-A true knockout of an ending!

CONS:

-none",
5 May 2004,Haunting and visceral realism,"I had not seen Schindler's List in it's entirety for a few years. The last time that I viewed it I was a lot younger and couldn't really digest it's complexities to the full.

Of course I was able to appreciate the excellence of it's aethestics and formalities, but it was the great depth to the characters that confused me: when you are younger you view the world in as black and white a vision as this film itself, as everyone knows.

I was mesmerised by the performances of Liam ""I'm Retired"" Neeson and Ralph Fienes.

Even Neeson's occasionally shaky accent can't hinder the fact that in his character he has realised the ambiguity and hinted capitalist, turned ever so slowly into a humanist by what should have been apparent to him all along - namely the unmotivated slaughter of his workforce. His motivations change ever so convincingly from money to conscience and by the end of the picture the most moving moment belongs to him and not to the survivors of the terror.

Fienes is such a complex character it's untrue. Spielberg has shot the pair throughout the film as equals-and-not-quite oposites. They are frequently intercut going through the same actions and mostly in the same space on screen) shot with an equally spaced two-shot. This brotherhood means that Fienes is hard(er) to detest than you might think. At times he appears to take on board Schindler's advice and passificity. He doesn't really hate the Jewish people eiether - he's a massacist, a lover of violence and a generally nasty bloke who just needs an excuse to abuse and kill. At one point we see him distressed at a gun misfiring again and again - it is not the gun not working, but the fact that his resolve to kill is failing after the first click of the trigger that is distressing him, i feel. At heart he is a vulnerable coward.

The various acts of violence are perfectly integrated into the flow of the picture and therefore as unexpected and unmotivated as their real-life counterparts, unlike Polanski's 'Pianist' in which they were insulting setpieces.

Spielberg's film has a much greater feel of authenticity than Polanski's and is much more powerful. It is full of touches in which you can relate to and understand, moments the summarise the best (and worst) in human nature, whereas the Pianist will feel like just one big cliche of the holocaust, after viewing 'SL'.

This really is a powerful film, its just a pity that nobody seems to have learned from what it is based on.

28 August 2011,thought provoking,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",
4 February 1999,"Poignant, powerful, bone-chilling, mesmerising.","This is a film which challenges the human nature. How is the human race capable of such babaricy? Such genocide and mindless, unnecessary slaughter, just because of religion. It makes you sick. Schindler's List is a film which tackles the issues of war, religion and the human spirit with emotion.

It revolves around Oskar Schindler, a factory kingpin who, amidst the chaos and slaughter of the war, decides to help the defenceless, enslaved Polish Jews. He makes a list, comprising of 1100 Jewish people, whom he shall liberate and set free. Hence, Schinder's List.

Spielberg's direction is first class, and he tells the story with emotion, yet the film is totally in-your-face. One scene which captures the poignancy is where the red dress of a little girl is shown in colour, even though the film is shot in black and white. It sticks out and captures the essence of innocence. A master stroke.

I loved the movie because it was so heartfelt and so deliberately graphic, it just stirs so many emotions and shakes the finger at ourselves. It is a brilliant movie.

5 June 2007,A movie you must watch before you die,"This is a brilliant film that presents the holocaust and its evil horrors in an epic way that reaches into the viewers hearts and perhaps allows the viewer to empathise with the Jewish Victims.

I myself am a Jew and seeing as my ancestors were in the holocaust, i am more emotionally attached to the movie then some other people. This is a film you need to see before you die and you will never truly understand the holocaust until you see this film The acting is near enough perfect, the direction is perfect.

The poetic image of the girl in the red dress is heart wrenchingly emotional and it presents how much every single one of the Jews suffered in the holocaust.

The only problem i have with the movie is that it took a small while to get started and the text at the end is hard to read.

In Conclusion, this is a film everyone on the earth should see. Its one of the greatest films of all time. Enjoy!",10
8 September 2001,A great film..,"What else can be said about this masterpiece by Steven Speilberg about Oskar Schindler who did anything he could - including bribery - to employ jewish workers in his munition plants which resulted in saving over one thousand jews from the nazi slaughter. In a way it is troubling to say this movie is great and is a favorite because of the terrific horror of the subject but Speilberg makes it a poignant memorial for those who lived through the holocaust and a reminder to those who were too young to have remembered that these atrocities did happen and such hatred should never present itself again. 10 of 10

1 December 2007,"""The list is life.""","""Schindler's List"" is Steven Spielberg's acclaimed film that explores the life of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved almost 1,200 Jews during the Holocaust through his actions. Spielberg appropriately decided to make the film in black and white, which gives the film a documentary-like quality. It also allowed him to make effective use of occasional glimpses of color. John Williams again proves his ability to come up with an appropriate soundtrack for any type of film. Spielberg also shows in a time of overwrought special effects that effects can be used subtlety to great effect, such as the zoomed out shot of a building on which windows light up to indicate Nazi gunfire and killings.

Liam Neeson is perfect as Oskar Schindler. Schindler is initially a war profiteer who is eventually moved to use his fortune and influence to shield Jews from the Holocaust. Interestingly the character was given an enigmatic quality and generally isn't explicit about his perceptions for a lot of the film. To the film's credit, it doesn't suppress the womanizing aspect of Schindler's character. Ben Kingsley is also excellent in a subtle performance as Schindler's invaluable accountant and assistant, Itzhak Stern. Ralph Fiennes also gives a great and frightening performance as the unstable and insecure megalomaniac Amon Goeth.

This film is long and sad, but absorbing at the same time such that it is never tedious during its length of over three hours. The film gains intensity from the graphic depictions of Nazi violence and the lingering sense that Jews can be killed at any time. It also shows us how the courage of one individual can have an important impact. Schindler laments not having saved more people, but the film effectively makes it clear that almost 1,200 people is an important number.",10
7 March 2017,The Importance Of One Man,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me.

11 May 2004,Wonderful,"This film is a beauty in itself. All this happend during the second world-war. The poor Jews were killed and brutally murdered in the most places of Europe by the Nazi-people. This film is located round a German man by the name Oscar Schindler who tried for 110% to save as many jews as possible. You follow his vision about this, and lot's of disgusting things happens on his way to the Jewish freedom. Schindler's list is a film that everybody Should see, even though you like or dislike films like this one. ALL of these sequences is based on TRUE story, and has got some reflections in the Middle-east situation today. That the jews always has been a hunted people.

You really Should see this film. Shalom, Goodbye, Hej D√•, Aurevoir, Auf Wiedersehn.

13 March 2007,The least enjoyable film I've had the satisfaction in viewing,"I dare not rate this film but only give some thoughts. If I was watching it to be entertained, it would receive a negative number. If I was watching it strictly with a critical eye as to judge if it is a well made film, I might have to give it an 11. Be it contrivance or not, this is the most powerful and disturbing film I have ever experienced.

The violent and disturbing scenes depicted in this film are based in fact. They are recent history for that matter. That makes it very hard to endure. And worse, the inhumanity of genocide continues to this very day. I have little doubt that the scenes depicted in this film are tame compared to the realities of what occurred at Krakow and elsewhere.

The film brought me there convincingly, and the pain was there. It was hard to watch, and disturbing as I ponder that at any moment a political tide might derail my own life.

There are characters that kill for sport. But these are not characters. These are characterizations of real evil people that recently existed, recreated in the film based on the recollections of those who have witnessed the atrocities. Then there is Schindler, who is not characterized as sweet, but as a unique person who will not trade inhumanity for money. It is quite an intriguing story.

On one hand, I say this movie should be seen by every human being on the planet. On the other hand, I have found that this movie has brought within me a feeling of depression that is long lasting. For sure, we must not forget the Holocaust. With a revived knowledge of this history from viewing this film my eyes will be more open.

I could have spent my time more enjoyably. But this well-made film has a reason to exist. You won't care unless you watch it. Yet, you will pay the price whether or not you are indifferent to the messages in this film. You will never forget it.

I propose that is the point of it.",
13 January 2011,The best Holocaust film along with the Pianist,"This and The Pianist are the best War/Holocaust films, that I have seen and both deserve their recognition, both show how mistreated the Jews were but also show how not all the Gremans were bad people, some were good, and some helped the Jews to survive and prosper as a race.

A clear must see for anyone, and a clear 8.5/10 from me, not a 9 because it's not really my favourite genre.

Brilliance of acting by Liam Neeson and Ralph Feinnes, as well as Ben Kingsley and all of the other major cast and extras. A brilliant Spielberg film with direction, dialogue and shots as well as having a very moving story line.

25 October 2010,"Fascinating tale about the hope of life and the promise of safety linked to one man and several thousand others, unfolding amongst an ocean of carnage.","Schindler's List begins with the striking of a match and the consequent lighting of a candle in a small room; an action which illuminates the rest of the locale and sheds light on those in the form of people and items around it. Steven Spielberg's film is a piece which goes on to shed degrees of light on a man, whose titular list and what it incurs, is the harrowing but brutally honest subject for this three hour true-to-life experience. Shot in black and white amongst deathly downcast greys which combine brilliantly with chillingly cold white in the form of snow and general skyline, Schindler's List unfolds amidst a bleak time of murder and pillage but will go on to focus on a ray of hope or salvation in the form of Nazi businessman Oskar Schindler; specifically, his work on the Eastern Front during World War 2 that saw him save and aid a vast number of Jewish people destined for slaughter.

Liam Neeson plays the man, a factory owner of Czech origin living in the year 1939 about embark on a period of six or so years which will change his life and many of those he comes to interact with, forever. When we first encounter Oskar, he neatly lays his shirts out across a bed during preparation for an evening out; his room neat and very formal, large sums of spare money sitting idly in a nearby draw for whatever reason suggesting a rich or high lifestyle. The measure of the man in his charismatic abilities is are established when Schindler arrives at an function in the evening full of German Nazi officials; light entertainment in the form of cabaret as well as food and drink which is already flowing. When he first enters, very few people seem to know of him, but by the end of the evening he appears to have wedged himself in amongst everybody as the centre of attention and entertainment. At a function in which all of the other Nazi officials seem greyed out by the, Schindler comes to have a white ray of light fly over his face suggesting there's a little more to this man than just mere self-indulgence and death.

Schindler's goals are entirely infused with tendencies that veer towards Capitalism, his dealing with the Nazi party officials see him enter a business proposition that'll have him enter with nothing but come away with a great deal of something. The situation as to whether we are on the side of Oskar in the initial stages is additionally challenged when it transpires if The War were to end, Schindler's enterprise might falter so the longer that most of the activity happening in and around everybody at this time continues, it's going to be pretty good for business. Inbetween all of this, The Second World War reaches somewhat of an infamous crescendo in and around the locality of Central Europe; The Holocaust causing widespread Jewish demotion into set Ghettos, later followed by evacuations leading onto murder for them but a severe clashing of morality for Schindler whom comes to realise employing these proverbial lambs to the slaughter would go a long way in saving them.

The film is a high end piece of drama, balancing a character's gradual struggle with being able to offer salvation really well with its meshing of the war genre. Spielberg's gradual dragging of his lead away from a self-obsessed businessman always looking out for ways to make money out of the system into this mournful, regretful man makes for wonderful viewing. By the time he is weeping, towards the end, at what has happened or more importantly what hasn't happened in the saving of more Jewish people, we feel the need to weep with him - thus successfully aligning the audience with this figure whom was once how he was in his indulgent, Nazi function attending self. The comparison is somewhat bookended very simply in how it is both Schindler as a stand alone man and how the Nazis as a collective group go about the employment of the Jews and the manner in which they treat them in a physical sense. Where Schindler will come to offer hope and salvation in the shape of factory employment, regardless of ability or handicap, an early scene will see German soldiers ruthlessly eliminate an elderly man because of his inability to successfully carry out what it is they ask of him through their charging him with a task, namely, the shovelling away of snow so as to clear a public road.

Schindler comes to stand in direct opposition to a fearsome Nazi Captain of the S.S. named Amon G√∂th (Fiennes), G√∂th additionally being based on a true to-life individual. Like Schindler, G√∂th is running a business or operation in which management and organisation are key; but while both members of the Nazi party and sharing similar basic ingredients as to their respective action plans, the men couldn't be any further apart in character. G√∂th arrives on the scene, a Krak√≥w suburb called P≈Çasz√≥w, to help in the construction of a new concentration camp; the house on the hill he's charged with living in a dominant position in which he is able to overlook all of his work ‚Äì construction orientated or otherwise. Just as Schindler goes out of his way to 'select' an aide or assistant in the form of Ben Kingsley's Itzhak Stern, G√∂th himself goes through a similar process of 'selecting' a assistant he renders a maid-come-slave in the form of a young Jewish woman. The measure of Fiennes' performance as G√∂th is highlighted in his ability to have the motivational ""tonight is history"" monologue prior to a ghetto liquidation come across as just as chilling as the act of liquidation itself. The film is an exhausting watch; an enthralling character study set amidst dark and desperate times as a man's shifting viewpoints play out.",7

16 July 2007,"""Whoever saves one life saves the world entire."" - Talmud","The medium of film can be used to present both fact and fiction, with realistic portrayals of historical events littered in the multiplex among the fantasy adventures. Steven Spielberg is renowned for his special effects-laden blockbusters, but even more so for his World War II epics that are meant more to inform and remember rather than to entertain. His most accomplished film is Schindler's List, based on the true story of a man who saved over a thousand Jews from extermination. Those renting the DVD just to have a fun time would be best to look elsewhere. Those who are looking to view a perfect take on a very depressing time in European history will find it in Schindler's List. This is not Oscar bait, like so many people claim it to be. This is a upsetting and heart-wrenching motion picture that is sure to bring some people to tears. With an excellent cast, a beautiful score and harrowing camera-work, Schindler's List succeeds on so many levels.

Set in Poland during World War II, the film centers on Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a member of the Nazi Party who wishes to open a pots and pans factory in Krakow. Due to Jewish workers being much cheaper than Poles, he hires an accountant called Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help roll up Jews to work in the factory. Soon, more and more of them are hired and while Schindler originally saved the Jews for profit, now he wants to save them from being gassed in the concentration camps. Meanwhile, Schindler meets Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), a Nazi soldier who takes pleasure in shooting Jews. However, he also has a relationship with Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz), a Jewish woman who is sometimes abused, but also sometimes loved by Goeth. These two stories are also connected with those of the prisoners in the Ghettos and concentration camps, who are hired and saved by Schindler.

The images of Schindler's List are very depressing and upsetting, but it could not have worked any other way. Spielberg portrays Nazi-occupied Poland accurately and thus, it's quite possibly one of the saddest films ever made. It's not an easy film to watch, but it should certainly be mandatory viewing. Schindler's List is not just a movie, it's a call for an end to prejudice. The Holocaust was one of the most horrific events of the twentieth century and it is perfectly filmed by director of photography Janusz Kaminski. The majority of the film is in black-and-white, a very intelligent decision on Spielberg's part, which actually makes the film look more realistic than if it was entirely in colour. Many scenes, including one involving a jammed gun, make us stop and think that maybe we shouldn't take things for granted. Steven Zaillian's screenplay is tight and manages to portray these real-life people very well with excellent dialogue. In addition, John Williams' score adds even more heartbreak to this tremendous film.

Yet, it is the actors who truly sell the film. Liam Neeson shows plenty of range as a man, who starts off as greedy and only looking for profit and then slowly changes into a hero. Schindler is a man who wants to make money, but also wants to save lives and Neeson perfectly shows a man who can't have his cake and eat it, too. Ben Kingsley gives very subtle work as Stern, a man who is in two worlds: that of the ghettos and concentration camps and then working alongside a man who can save his fellow Jews. While Schindler is giving him instructions, we see that Stern is secretly pulling the strings as much as he can. Finally, Ralph Fiennes truly shows that he is one of Britain's finest young actors with his role as the ruthless Goeth. We see in his eyes a man who is not ""just following orders"" like some Nazis were at the time, but really somebody who does believe a lot in Der F√ºhrer's evil ideas. Fiennes portrays his love for Hirsch very well, showing him at a crossroads. On the one hand, he hates Jews and believes them to be scum, but on the other, he has a deep admiration for Helen. Yet, he feels he must show his meaner side to the follow soldiers. Fiennes not only shows an evil man, but a man truly in love as well.

Steven Spielberg is the master behind this brilliant production and everything about it is composed so well. He proved with this film that he has the ability to direct serious, dramatic films and this is the film that most people will view him upon. It is the story of triumph and how if you try, you can help save the world and lead to the end of racism and violence. After all, as the Talmud says, ""Whoever saves one life saves the world entire."" This quote can be applied to people of all religions, not just those who Oskar Schindler saved years ago. That is what Schindler's List is most of all about: the fight against bigotry and injustice.",10
23 November 2015,"A touching film, displaying the Horrors of the Holocaust","Schindlers List, starring Liam Neeson, and directed by Steven Spielebergs, tell the real tale of a Nazi Leader, Oskar Schindler, and how he saved 1,2000 Jews from torture and Punishment. The Film is one of the finest films made, and dells deep into a shameful past.

The Film, which is Black and White(which really adds authenticity to the film), displays how horrible the Holocaust was. The film also demonstrates that one man can make a difference, and in this case, that man is Oskar Schindler. The one scene that will never leave the minds of the audience, is the girl in the red coat. In one of the only colored parts of the Black and White Film, the scene has a real impact, and shows the Horror that really happened.

Schindler's List is a touching film and, combined with chilling reality and beautiful cinematography, the Film ends up being the greatest Holocaust Film of all time.",8
22 January 2022,Historical timeless masterpiece,"When I was in high school our history teacher showed us this movie. Later, as a young adult, I rewatched it while rediscovering the filmography of Steven Spielberg. More time passed, I became a history teacher myself and showed it to my students.

If I have kids, I will show them this masterpiece someday.

It is more than just entertainment based upon historical events. It is a lesson. And a big one for ourselves and later generations.

5 July 2000,"A Masterpiece, the second time around.","Believe it or not...I rented this movie back in 93 or 94 when it was first released, and didnt understand much of it and didnt even watch all of it. I turned it off out of boredom and confusion. At that time I knew nothing about WWII, nor did I really care.

Lately, I have been reading alot about WWII,Hitler,Himmler, and have been reading survivor stories from concentration camp survivors, particularly Auschwitz. I have also read many stories on the other concentration camps, and have come across many more stories of camp and ghetto survivors, and have read them all with sadness, but with interest. I have even had the pleasure of corresponding with an Auschwitz survivor and Schindlers List seems VERY realistic as to what actually happened in the camps and ghettos.

The movie is very easy to understand if you have basic knowledge of WWII and the holocaust. Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler, a NAZI businessman who wants to hire some camp jews as cheap slave labor to work for him (as many many companies did back then). These people that work for him are treated with a little respect and given decent working conditions. Soon many other Jews are depserate to work for him, as they realise that could mean they will not die in the camps. Oskar starts to get extremely irritated when he learns that the evil camp SS Amon Goeth (played by Ralph Fiennes) is killing many of his workers without good cause and wants the killings to stop. He then finds out that many of his workers will be sent to Auschwitz, where death is almost certain, unless something is done. He then uses his power and money to bribe many high ranking Nazi officials to bringing his workers to another country via train to have them work in a plant, where they will be saved from execution. Although he loses just about everything in the process, saving the lives of more than 1000 Jews proved worth it in the end, afterall, ""You save one life...you save the world entire."" I was surprised they even threw in a small role of the ""Angel of Death"", the evil Dr. Josef Mengele, who basically was responsible for the death of many many Jews, via the gas chamber, and his horrible, cruel,useless experiments. He was the one at Auschwitz who walked around determining who was fit to work, and who should die. If you were an older person, sick, weak,or had a small child, you were most likely sent to the gas chamber.

This is an outstanding movie and I'm very glad I rented it. I highly recommend it to everyone. Kudos to Steven Speilberg for this masterpiece.",9
15 December 2008,A triumph...,"Filmmaker Steven Spielberg's 1993 World War II/Holocaust drama ""Schindler's List"" is a cinematic triumph. Unquestionably Spielberg's most ""satisfying"" film about WWII (and of his career, perhaps), ""Schindler's List"" is one of his many directorial highlights because of its message of hope, survival, and humanity during a time in human history that lacked any of those three. This is what Spielberg's vision of World War II was really about: regaining a sense of hope, survival, and humanity in grave times.

It's been a while since I saw it last. I saw this film about six years ago my sophomore in high school; we had to watch it as part of my world history class. Boy, am I glad I chose to show up those two days we watched this movie because I surely would have missed out on an incredible film experience. This is my favorite film about the Holocaust during World War II; ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) was pure fun about World War II, and ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) showed the personal cost of World War II.

Spielberg is himself a Jew, and his personal feelings about WWII and the plight of the Jews during that time are no secret to anyone who watches his movies about that period in time; has anyone got the feeling he was secretly smirking to himself when Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) was making mincemeat out of those b******s, the Nazis, in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark?"" I do. ""Schindler's List"" is Spielberg's masterstroke of cinematic film-making. If ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" showed a Jewish kid vicariously living out his fantasies of slaying Nazis, then ""Schindler's List"" showed us that that kid has finally grown up.

Adapted from Thomas Keneally's book, this heartfelt - and oft-times horrifying - tale is about a German war profiteer named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who gives safe haven to over 1,000 Jews (including his loyal accountant, Itzhak Stern, played by a superb Ben Kingsley) in his factory after becoming sensitive to the horrors inflicted upon them by the Nazis, especially by the psychopathic, high-ranking Nazi commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes). By no means a saint, his transformation from womanizing war profiteer who thought nothing of socializing with the Nazis to humanitarian savior is nothing short of a brilliant performance by Neeson, who gives this at-first loathsome character a heart and a human portrayal who risked bankruptcy and certain death to ""Save one Life, and save the World Entire.""

What's most striking about this production is its authenticity. Spielberg filmed ""Schindler's List"" at the real Nazi concentration at Auschwitz - just to give it that extra-real feeling of authenticity. To make the film fit the time, he chose to film it in black & white, much rather than the easier color print. However, when color does appear in one particular key scene, you get why Spielberg chose to put it there. There's also something so real and believable about the concentration camp scenes that make the imagery during those sequences unforgettable. Who can forget the startling sequences where the Nazis are making the Jewish prisoners strip in freezing-cold weather, and then herd them into darkened rooms where ominous-looking sprinklers loom overhead?

""Schindler's List"" is one of the key films about World War II, the Holocaust, and of the 20th century; maybe it's the definitive film about those three. Its historical significance will allow it to never become dated, and will make it one of the best films in the history of cinema. Steven Spielberg probably has, indeed, made the most satisfying film of his career.

10/10",10
12 March 2004,Swindler's List among the best movies,"Schindler's List (I affectionately call it ""Swindler's List"" sometimes) has great acting in a great semi-fact-based story. Liam Neeson's acting was ""Oskar"" nominated, but Ralph Fiennes was super as Goeth, and Kingsley was excellent as well.

Some great cinematography too - the candle smoke cutting to the train smoke, for one (somewhat like TE Lawrence blowing out the match then cut to desert sunrise, or ""2001"" bone to spaceship cut) and any of dozens of other haunting images.

Schindlers's List has some excellent dialog. Some examples are when Schindler talks to Goethe about ""power"", or Stern talking about the list being ""absolute good"", or Schindler crying because he could have saved more people by giving away his Nazi pin or other personal items.

Sentimental? Maybe. Many Spielberg movies are too sappy for me, but this was not. Gloss over low-lights of Schindler himself? Probably. Doesn't really matter, though.

11 February 2002,No more than a useful public service announcement...,"Schindler's list is not a bad film per se - Liam Neeson is very good as Schindler and if you edit out some of the more overblown scenes - the story is still riveting. Yet it could have been so much more if the story just told simply and if the central theme were fully understood and developed.

Before the war Schindler and his friend, Goeth were boozy, flirtatious German businessmen. Both would have likely been uninspired failures had there been no war. In a kinder world, Goeth's and Schindler's moral differences might have manifested themselves in the size of the tip that they would leave the barmaid. In war, the consequences of moral choices are greatly magnified, resulting in Schindler becoming a most unlikely heroic figure, and Goeth becoming a loathed prison commandant. In the film, Spielberg elevates Schindler to sainthood status and portrays Goeth as a sadistic psychopath. By sanitizing Schindler's many faults (boozing, gambling, womanizing...) and by demonizing Goeth, Spielberg severs our connection with them and, ironically, blunts the conflict between them. Adolf Eichmann was far more chilling than Charles Manson. Unlike Manson, whom we could dismiss as psychotic, Eichmann was the faceless functionary that we have all experienced, whose defense of ""following orders"" is one that we have all heard, a defense that was used by many during the war, and one that we might see ourselves using under similar circumstances had we not Schindler's courage. By making Schindler a saint, Spielberg diminishes both his accomplishment and his inspiration to us - saints have no problems making the right decision - the rest of us do. Rather than a gaping chasm, there is but a fine moral line between Schindler and Goeth - one that we tread every day, which fortunately for us, rarely does more than determines a barmaid's salary.

Spielberg does not develop this simple theme, preferring to impress us with a grandiose view of a great moral tale. Instead, he comes off as the underskilled sous-chef drowning a wonderful filet mignon in an overly rich sauce. The quality of the ingredients still shine through despite the clumsy handling but does not approach its great potential. In the end, the best thing about the film is that it reminds Americans of a monstrous event in history. It is unfortunate that this reminder is necessary and that it reduces such a timeless parable to a useful public service announcement.",1

16 August 1998,Not just a movie,"Some people consider this a war film. I consider it a classic. When I saw this film for the first time I really felt bad about what happened to people during the war. I was happy that this film was shot in black and white because some of the gore I probably couldn't stand in color. Spielberg has definitely surpassed his Jurassic Park stage and moved on to better work like this or Amistad. I cant wait to see his new movie Saving Pvt. Ryan because it is also about WWII. If you watch this whatever your age it will effect like no other film can.

2 May 2004,Spielberg's best,"well I have only just seen this film recently due to the new DVD. I was in a way reluctant to watch it as so many people have said how sad it is and the fact that it is in black and white doesnt really appeal to me. But once I sat myself down and switched it on I was very suddenly intrigued by the amount of detail and hard work put into this film. Liam Neeson and Ben Kinglsey are the 2 main stars of this film and carry it very well whereas Ralph Feinnes delivers a shocking and scary performance. it pleased me to see his come-upance at the end.

I have to say that I have never cried during a film, never in my life. But towards the end of this film there was a lump in my throat and its true to say that i wasnt choaking on pop-corn. If a film is based on a point in history and is being made by a very talented director and has the certificate of a 15 or an 18 then it has no boundaries and this film is one of them. This is how this film carries itself into my top 10 list. It shows how horrifically the Jews were treated and how it turned into 2 mens struggle to save as many as they possibly could. The end where all the victims of the Nazi's ways placed a stone on Oscar Schindler's grave is extrememly touching and is a perfect end to an excellent film. Too bad Speilberg doesnt make films like this these days...now we're given A.I and Minority Report...such a shame",10
4 March 2004,Steven Spielberg's best dramatic film is finally on DVD!,"I distinctly remember seeing Schindler's List in a darkened theater during my last year attending the University of Southern California, back in late 1993. The buzz about this film was astounding. Fresh from directing the summer 1993 box office smash, Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg was about to completely abandon the famous popcorn movie for which he was so well known to take on one of the darkest chapters of the 20th century, the holocaust. Many critics doubted that Spielberg was up to the task of directing such a dark moment in human history.

This film is by far Spielberg's best dramatic film, this and Saving Private Ryan proves beyond any doubt that Spielberg is more than capable of directing a powerful dramatic film as well as other great directors like Martin Scorese and Francis Ford Coppola. His use of black and white only illustrates how great and mature a storyteller he has become in recent years.

The 11 years since it's release has deminished it's impact on society, but let no one forget the haunting images of this masterpiece.

The DVD looks completely amazing with terrific digital clarity, and great sound. Unforunately, as with Spielberg's other films on DVD, this one has no director's commentary whatsoever.

This is defintely the best film of the 1990's and winner of seven Academy Awards, including best picture. Oscar worth performances from Liam Neeson, Ben Kingley, and of course, the memorable Ralph Fiennes!

This haunting film also proves without a doubt that Spielberg is one of the best directors to ever work in Hollywood!",10
24 March 2010,What a movie!,"""Schindler's List"" is the kind of movie that, because of its historical accuracy, could be used as a documentary. But it also gives us a deep story, and a performance by Liam Neeson, that is among the best of all time.

The movie tells the story of Oskar Schindler (Neeson), a vain, glorious and greedy German businessman who becomes unlikely humanitarian amid the barbaric Nazi reign when he feels compelled to turn his factory into a refuge for Jews. Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler who managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp.

Steven Spielberg has a technical talent like no one else has. His frames are so elegant and objective, that you know what is going on, and where (in the last battle of ""Saving Private Ryan"" you can notice this qualities better), which makes us feel that we are living the movie. The massacres and killing scenes are distressing, because it looks like it's happening to you. And the idea of making this movie black and white gives a tone of reality, that looks like the movie was shot during WWII.

The plot, beyond giving us a history lesson, shows the amazing story of Orkar Schindler, whose personality and turns are probably the best thing in the movie, and powered by Liam Neeson's incredible and contained performance, that is just one of the best. And other great characters, Ben Kingsley as Stern, as the smart, but quiet Jew, Fiennes as Goeth, the obsessed with power German (Although I thought it was exaggerated sometimes, like when he wakes up, and shoot Jews with a rifle, just for fun). And the construction of the characters is very well made, which makes the ending even more powerful, being one of the most moving scenes in the history of cinema.

Verdict: Probably Spieberg's best work, with a moving and accurate story, and a mesmerizing performance by Liam Neeson, this movie is simply, one of the best.",9
10 June 2005,Is definitely up there with one of the most powerful films of all time!,"Some films i feel you can watch and just think there is something wrong and you don't really feel anything from it. There is nothing that shocks you whether it be the story or the acting. Schindlers list is one of those films like a lot of other Spielberg greats (Saving Private Ryan,Jaws)really grips you.This is probably the most powerful epic of any historical event ever made. Everything about it is perfection for a good movie. From the incredible performances by Liam Neeson as Oskar who i felt had deserved an academy award more than any actor alive for his performance and also for Ralph Feinnes as a terrifying Nazi and Ben Kingsleyalso gives another memorable performance as Jewish factory worker Izthak Stern right to the dazzling cinematography (the film was shot in an amazing black and white style to give it a more historical and realistic look). I think my favourite scene of the film has to be at the beginning when you see the all the Jews being evacuated and terrorised by German soldiers and then suddenly a little girl appears in a red dress which is the only coloured part of the film. That to me is shot that will go down in movie history.Many people believe that Spielberg is the kind of guy who is always going to be remembered for masterpieces like E.T,Jaws and the Indy trilogy. In my opinion this is the film where we knew that Spielberg was right next to Martin Scorsese and Spike Lee was one of todays greatest living directors.",
3 November 2017,Watch and decide for yourself...,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",8
12 December 2011,"Worth a nine, but I'm giving it ten","This was originally a nine-out-of-ten film for me, but I'm giving it a TEN just to counteract the incredibly negative opinions of those people giving it 1 or 2.

The film has some flaws and feels very engineered in places, such as the campy scene at the beginning when Schindler strolls up stairwells unhindered like a God, entering into an office full of neatly organised desks and orderly queues when in reality everyone is in utter panic, which is a little unrealistic and cheesy. And the bit where fat, naked old ladies are running around the concentration camps, cutting to scenes of extremely skinny men being examined, then cutting back to those fatty ladies running around. Poor selection of extras.

However, none of these criticisms can take away the pure mesmerizing watchability of this film. I've seen it three of four times and will certainly watch it several more times before I die. Even if you don't like the film, it's still so well filmed, researched, acted and directed that it deserves at least 5 or 6, even if you hate the sometimes corny Spielberg take on it.

A TEN out of ten for entertainment from me.",10
18 November 1998,A Masterpiece,"Schindler's List is truly one of the most thought provoking films of the decade. Before seeing this film, I knew nothing about the horrors of the Holocaust, and to be honest, I wish that were still the case.

I cannot believe the sheer brutality of the Germans for committing such horrific acts on the Jews. Just because a person has a different religion or race to our own, does that give us any right to crucify them or make them feel less human?

With regards to the film, expert performances, especially from Neeson, Kingsley and Feinnes, combined with the superb cinematography of Janusz Kaminski and direction of Spielberg make Schindler's List an enduring, although disturbing, masterpiece.

1 February 2005,"""Greatest"" is not enough","What I am about to say may seem absurd, yet it is the truth from my heart. There are movies that everyone should see, yet one viewing would suffice. There are films that have such powerful messages, with images that are beyond words. They are burned into your consciousness forever.

""Schindler's List"" is such a film. It remains Steven Spielberg's finest achievement. In fact, it is the greatest accomplishment in cinema. Eleven years after seeing the film, portions still linger in my mind's eye.

Obviously, a film like this can never be matched. Spielberg never tried to. He let it speak for itself.

These days, with the advent of DVDs and high-definition screens, I have never felt totally compelled to buy ""Schindler's List"" on disc. Perhaps I should, and maybe I will. It's not that I do not want to see the movie again, and it is certainly not that I think it is a bad film.

The truth is that it so conveys its message so powerfully, it succeeds at what it is trying to do in ways that words cannot describe.

Out of four stars, I rate this one *****. That's right, even four stars are not adequate.

George",10
27 July 2000,A true masterpiece,"This film is almost too poignant to put into words. Liam Neeson creates a Schindler who is simultaneously a deeply flawed and compassionate man - in other words, a real, fully rounded human being, one of the best portrayals in motion picture history. Also sublime are Ben Kingsley as Stern, Schindler's bookkeeper and confidante, and Ralph Fiennes, whose Amon Goeth reminds us just how dark and twisted the human soul can become. No film has ever done better at capturing the depth of suffering that was the Holocaust. A work of genius - easily the finest film of the 1990s, and one of the greatest ever.

27 August 2012,Devastating,"Holocaust stories aren't watched for entertainment. They are more for documentation, more for knowledge. So it is no wonder this film clocks in at over 3 hours long, because like most holocaust stories, Schindler's List was made to be evidence to those not born in the time of that tragic and horrific event, not for a jaunty, fun watch. Here, Spielberg weaves in the tragedies of the holocaust with an engaging story, balancing both perfectly, delivering enough plot to make you wonder what will happen next, and enough tragedy to make you appreciate what you have now. While there is much that is done to perfection in SL, it is the visuals that are the most memorable. Kaminski's spot on cinematography and the choice to shoot this in black and white brings frame after frame of picture perfect visuals, reminiscent of classics such as Casablanca. In addition to that, the performances are memorable for almost every performer. Neeson has the perfect persona for B&W and delivers a Oscar caliber performance, along with Kingsley and Fiennes. And lastly, and certainly not least, the production value here is amazing. They really brought this time alive with hundreds if not thousands of extras and sets. It is a tragedy that the Holocaust ever happened, but it is a godsend that Spielberg made this film. It is one everyone should see.",10
16 November 1998,And Kingsley superb,"Spielberg's masterpiece. Even the framing device which some did not like worked well for me. The girl in the red dress may have been an obvious film device but it worked extremely well. It wasn't a controversial film in any sense, but it is nearly perfect.

I think Ben Kingsley quiet performance is some of the most subtle and brilliant acting I have ever seen. Neeson and Fiennes have been lauded many times and so should Kingsley.

22 April 1999,Ray Fiennes Should Have Won An Oscar for His Performance,"After every time I watch Schindler's List, I always ask myself how did Ralph Fiennes not win a best supporting actor Oscar for his work in this movie? His performance in this movie was superb.

Everything about this film is right on the money (okay, okay, Liam Neeson's thing at the end, ""...this pin could have saved 3 people... this limousine 10 people..."" was a little over the top [maybe]). The first time I saw Schindler's was in 1993 in Manhattan, I was moved to tears. Afterwards a woman (who I had never met before) sitting next to me who looked to be in her 60s reached over the armrest, embraced me and then kissed me on the cheek. She then said, ""thank you,"" and left. Was she or a member of her family a holocaust survivor? I'll never know but it was great to see a movie have such an effect on its audience. I highly recommend this movie and also to those who have seen it already I recommend a visit to the national Holocaust museum in Washington DC. If you thought Schindler's List was amazing, a trip to the museum really emphasizes the scale and magnitude of this act of evil.",10
25 September 2001,touching and relevant,"Schindlers list is the master at his best. its a pity that his next war movie saving private ryan was not a patch on this one. this movie, unlike SPR has the human element in it.

The movies is an outstanding truelife story of one man's realisation of the horrors of war. i wish the world leaders of today, who are eager to pull the trigger to avenge the injustice done to them, will take time off and watch this long but touching movie. spielberg uses excellent cinematic techniques to showcase the horrors of war. though the movie is quite often disturbing, that is the intention.

the use of black and white throughout the movie is even more striking, especially in contrast with the only colour used in two scenes. Schindlers list is a powerful war movie and is rather long, but it is well worth a patient watch, there will be no dry eyes at the end of this classic movie.

probably spielberg's best and one of the alltime greatest movies

a perfect 10.",8
28 October 2005,"A Superb, Haunting, Uplifting, Great Film","Steven Spielberg's career was somewhat unfilled before 1993. Sure there were some fine films and some enjoyable films but there wasn't the truly great film that such a great filmmaker deserved. In 1993, that drought was ended by Schindler's List.

When Poland is subdued by the invading Nazi armies, Oskar Schindler attempts to form a business, employing only Jews and freeing them from the Ghetto. However, the Holocaust and the Final Solution begin to take hold; more and more of his workers are taken to concentration camps but Schindler continues to try and get Jews into his factories. However, as the year begins to draw to a close, Schindler begins to draw up a list of Jews who he wants to buy and take to his own factory.

What a film! It is fantastic. It is supremely well made, exquisitely written with a touching score and brilliantly shot. It is a tour-de-force with three fantastic central performances from Liam Neeson as the benevolent and great Schindler, Ben Kingsley as the mistreated Jew, Itzhak Stern and Ralph Fiennes as the homicidal and psychotic Goeth. It is simply sublime from all.

John Williams' score is possibly his best ever (which is high praise indeed). The photography is superb from Janusz Kaminski and they all help to make a film that has two strong bases. The first is Steven Zaillian's fantastic script, brilliant created and moulded. The second is Spielberg's direction, which is genial, brilliant and sublime. He deals with the case of the Holocaust in a suitably stark way but he also provides an uplifting film that shows humanity's better side in one man at the very least. He also uses his skill to the maximum. In particular, his use of colour is awesome, especially his focusing on a girl in a red coat during the liquidation of the ghetto and her re-appearance later in the film Put simply, this is a film that is veritably great.

Without a doubt, the film is one of the greatest ever and should be seen by all.",10

19 June 2010,"Best portrayal of death camps ever! A lot of credit to the producer Branko Lustig for it, who was an Auschwitz survivor!","All the people say about it is true! Schindler's List is simply remarkable! No other movie has never shown the horrific thing's that the people in death camps, including not only Jew's but everyone, were witnesses and part of every single day! Very well done! And i give a big credit for it to a producer, BRANKO LUSTIG, who was an AUSCHWITZ surviver when he was a little kid. I'm sure, as Spielberg sais, that he had a big influence on this movie.

-------------------------

The directing is amazingly beautiful and this is one of the best directed movies ever. I like how it was shot in black and white. It gave a lot of dept to certain scenes and the whole movie. I especially liked the certain part's such as the one when we see a little girl in red coat in the distance and everything except her coat is in black and white. That was a beautiful scene. It really seals in your memory! As does the other part when we see the little girl in the red coat. I also liked the part at which a couple of Jews are praying around the candle and everything except for the fire of the candle is in black and white! Such a great scene! You can really sympathize with them!

--------------------------

Writing is just great! The best part about it is characterization! I like the way Schindler was shown. How he was nothing but an idiot in the beginning and didn't care about anything or anyone except for his own pocket which he later on completely emptied in order to save the lives of his workers which were brutally killed every single day. I especially loved the character of AMON GOETH! What a great portrayal of a sick and evil man that's even kinda charming at times. I really loved his character. Simply perfect! It belong's to the movie history. As does the entire movie! And Ralph Fiennes was excellent! Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley were also great. Though, Ralph steals the show here!!!

---------------------------

Another thing i must mention is music! John Williams composed something beautiful! I'm usually a big fan of Rock'n'Roll but i just can't stop listening to this song or a score, whatever it is! It's really beautiful and i'm sure it will be remembered and listened in two hundred year's from now because it's just outstanding!!! The violin sound's like it's crying! Beautiful!!!!

----------------------------

A perfect movie that deserves to be remembered and that, i'm sure, will be remembered just as the event's it show's and all the people that been through 'em! WATCH IT UNDER ANY COST!!!! SIMPLY GREAT!!!!",10

29 January 2001,It's just the best movie ever!,"When I saw Schindler's List for the first time, it was such a shock to me. Of course I've read about the holocaust and I saw WW 2 movies about it, but nothing could prepare me for this masterpiece. It's so gripping and emotional.

All the actors are at their best. They do not act, they are the characters. Ralph Fiennes is most terrifying as Amon Goeth.

The photography is as beatiful as documentary- like. After three hours, when the end credits start to roll, I realized I was watching a movie and not a documentary. And of course, Spielbergs direction makes it all just a perfect history lesson.

It's a must see for everybody!

The acting is perfect, mesmerizing in some cases, especially by Ralph Fiennes; the score is beautiful and unforgettable; the direction is masterful, and the use of crisp black and white color underlies the film's realism and dark history.

The legacy of Oskar Schindler was new to me when I first saw this, and thanks to Spielberg, the story of one man's change of heart will be remembered forever. SCHINDLER'S LIST, to this day, is a prime example of inspired and mesmerizing cinema.

4 August 1999,A shame that AFI named it #9 on the Top 100!,"""Schindler's List"" is easily one of the greatest films ever made. The technical wizardry and stark reality of this picture alone blow the great classics (Graduate, Casablanca, On The Waterfront) out of the water. Undeniably affecting historical drama has never been more fully realized and displayed in its nakedness like it is here. Steven Spielberg richly deserves life-long accolades for creating this film. His choice of b&w cinematography is brilliant. Every tear, gunshot, death, laugh and cry are all fully realized. Spielberg's epic is a far cry from normal Hollywood movie making and that unto itself is an amazing accomplishment for the misguided 90s filmmakers.

Easily, the greatest creative element for this film is Ralph Fiennes. Without his central protagonistic presence, ""Schindler's List"" would certainly be a flawed examination of the Holocaust. Instead, Fiennes' character displays uncontrollable impulsive fits of rage and unpredictability which epitomizes the Nazi aura. Fiennes' performance is the best in recent years, and his finely drawn and provocative character richly deserves to be recognized as one of the greatest ever drawn up!

True to life affecting drama has never been better and it seems incomprehensible to expect a motion picture of this magnitude and quality to appear again in our lifetimes.",10

13 August 2005,A Masterpiece!,"In 1942, a German Nazi named Oskar Schindler developed a business, in Krakow, Germany. It was managed by a Jewish man, Itzchak Stern, and populated hundreds of working Jews. One day, the workers and the living Jews in the ghetto were overruled by invading Nazis, led by Amon Goeth. They were evacuated and taken to a concentration camp near the ghetto. Devastated by the loss of workers, Schindler demanded to Goeth that his workers be released immediately. But not so; Goeth told Schindler that the Jews were to remain in the camp. Determined, and self-willed, Schindler opened a business near the camp, and made a list of Jews that could work there. The list was only meant for a couple hundreds, but eventually became a list with one thousand and eleven Jew names on it. The Jews were shipped out, and worked until the end of the war. Afterwards, at midnight the day World War II was strictly declared over, Stern and some friends made a letter of evidence that Schindler was innocent, and a ring out of a Jew's tooth, with the words ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire"" inscribed on the side. It was at exact moment that Schindler learned that not only did his factory become successful, it saved the lives of Jewish victims.

This is a beautiful yet horrifying crafted movie about the terrible Holocaust. It is a very well-done picture, with fantastic cinematography-all done in black and white-, flawless acting, and a powerful score. Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler, showing the kindness yet fierceness of the man who was considered a 'savior.' Ben Kingsley is wonderful as the Jewish assistant, Itzchak Stern. But the most recognizable performance of the cast is Ralph Fiennes, who is incredible as the root of all evil, Amon Goeth.

The story is incredible all in itself, and it contains such mind-blowing images, text, and sounds. Spielberg used his directing skills very well, showing audiences the real horrors and incredible sadness through these elements. Such complex things are heart-wrenching to imagine, but not even this film can display the Holocaust. This film shows only but a pinprick of the evils of this senseless massacre.

Notable scenes are the liquidation of the Ghetto, the children escape, and, most of all, the heartbreaking close-to-the-end scene. The final scene is emotional, because you see the 'Schindler Jews', along with the actors that played them, place rocks on the grave of Schindler. And the last person, whom is only but a shadow to us, places a red rose in the middle.

I cannot tell you the incredible and durable sadness I felt as I watched this film, but it made me realize that even ordinary people can save lives. I recommend that everyone should see this; it really is more than a regular film. It is a masterpiece.",10

Soon enough he has all the money in the world and is happy as can be. Or so it appears, as the film progress you see the demeanor and attitude of Schindler change dramatically when he watches the Jewish people get slaughtered like animals by the Nazi's, after that he sets his heart on the sole task if getting them out of the camps and into his country. Schindler's List is the proved example of human kindness and compassion, It's a movie that will make your heart break and make the spirit soar at his heroic feet. Schindler's List is one of the greatest films ever made and will continue to shock and amaze people for all time. I very highly recommend this movie!

'Schindler's List', which is about this the man named above, is one of the greatest biopics to hit Cinema, ever! A film that becomes reality, after a while, you become Schindler, it's a film where you win and lose.

I am not going to say why to have to watch 'Schindler's List', if your a unabashed Cinema-Fan, then watching this film is a rule. You cannot miss this one, you just can't. Spielberg's execution to the subject, as always, is awe-inspiring. There is, There Was and There Will Only Be One Steven Spielberg, - period. Acting wise, Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes pitch in Incredible Performances. They all deliver performances that will remain until Cinema Remains!

1,000 Thumbs Up for this Landmark! Rccmended to all!

2 October 2017,it has stayed in my brain,"This film i have seen it about 4 times. It is one of those films that stays in your head. one of those films that sometimes you wonder if it is real of if it is just a film. if you decide to watch this be ready for some very graphic scenes and in your face realistic human terror. The film is well made, well acted, touching, moving and scary one in all. I like to say that this is one of Spilbergs best films.

9 September 2007,Not just something you easily forget when time pass...,"...and I mean what I said. Some movies just don't stick to you. As soon as your head touches the soft couch, you forget all about that great, magnificent movie you just saw. But this is something else. It's the kind of movie that stays with you no matter where what. The kind of drama and horror you can't shake off easily. How honest the story is accompanied by visual black and white footage add to some of the rare elements normally found in everyday's film. You could still review it all right in your mind. This re-telling of some of the very majestic last moments of World War 2 is well done. But once again, what do you expect from Spielberg? We all know he is good. But this is something else. It is WAY BEYOND.

Awesome WW2 movie I've ever seen since The Longest Day and The Pianist. 20 out of 10 is what this film deserve.

14 August 2012,"Gritty, moving","Perhaps no other film in history depicts the Holocaust as unforgettably and disturbingly as does Schindler's List, the title that won seven Academy Awards in 1993, including Best Picture. Powerful and immense, Schindler's List uses top-notch acting, directing, music and cinematography to reconstruct the Krakow ghetto, Plaszow concentration camp, Schindler's enamelware factory and Auschwitz. What stays with you about this black-and-white film is the imagery--children hiding in a sewer, human beings packed into train cars, Goeth shooting random men and women from the balcony of his home. The scenes in Schindler's List are chillingly realistic because Spielberg does not cut corners in portraying the actuality of the violence. There is no sugarcoating of the Holocaust and how many lives it destroyed. The camera angles capture the emotional aspect of situations, often using close-ups to portray character reactions. At times, a hand-held camera was skillfully employed to convey chaos. John Williams' stunning musical score contributes to the intensity and confusion of the film. My favorite aspect of this film is the acting of Neeson, Kingsley and Fiennes. These actors carry the film with subtle dialogue and nonverbal cues. With brilliant acting, directing, music and cinematography, Schindler's List is truly a cinematic masterpiece.

4 January 2005,Superb,"Last night, after reading many fabulous reviews, I was lucky enough to view Schindlers list, a supposed ""masterpiece"" directed by the famous, the fabulous, Steven Spielberg, creating masterpieces such as E.T. and Jurassic park. So I went into this 3 hour epic with high hopes.

It starts off rather depressingly, but picks up. Directed beautifully in black and white, to give it a more old fashioned sense, it clearly shows the films class. Schindler's slimy personality is soon introduced (we see he has affairs with more that one women) and cannot promise his estranged wife she is the only one he will truly ever feel for. Then, we are introduced to Ralph Fiennes (Goeth) a rather brutal member of the Nazi party. So both of the characters ""politically incorrect"" frames are introduced.

The film is simply too long for me to comment on every happening, but it becomes blatantly apparent that this film didn't win 7 academy awards for nothing. Both hopeful and poignant (showing some rather graphic violent scenes as well) this truly is a masterpiece that should be viewed by all.

Final summary: ***** out of ***** (5 out of 5)",10
6 December 2016,If I could give a serious 10 for this movie,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",9
27 September 2001,One of the best films ever to grace the silver screen,"This movie is fantastic and very richly deserved every single award that it won. It does a splendid job at showing the horrors of the holocaust and reminding us that such an atrocity must never be allowed to happen again. The story was awesome and the acting fantastic. Everyone in this film was perfect for the role that they played. This is very easily one that I am thrilled to have in my movie collection. In my opinion, it's one of the best films ever made and one of the best that will ever be made.

17 December 2016,The hero of a single generation,"1354/5000 The guy who revolutionized the movie scene, Steven Spielberg proves that he does not just blockbuster, told in an extremely melodic way, it is impossible not to empathize with the characters, the film is extremely sensitive and insensitive as well, showing all the cruelty that human nature Can provide by elevating life to the condition of nothing, talks about the power that corrupts and elevates the human being to a higher degree, this is all a great analogy of Nazism, which in the end, is nothing more than an advertisement, and our protagonist Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) has realized this and decides to act. It is impossible to talk about Schindler's List without mentioning his photograph that puts us straight into the 1940s, and this was a very good choice for Spielberg, we have some colorful scenes that are absurdly significant, like the scene of the girl in red who Symbolizes hope, and then ... With a soundtrack and convincing performances and an impeccable script, its 3 hours are not even tiresome, on the contrary, you want to see more, live longer, get more excited. And as if that were not enough, Spielberg mixes elements of cinema with real life, leaving the film extremely more tactile. Schindler's list has a spectacular construction and a magnificent finish, and it is not the act that cleared the Oscar.",10
29 December 2020,"A bit harrowing and disturbing, but still one of the greatest movies ever made and probably Steven Spielberg's best movie","To date, SCHINDLER'S LIST has 1,906 reviews and it's considered by almost everyone one of the greatest movies ever made. So why did I review it? Well, I have seen this movie at least 3-4 and despite is a bit depressing, I love it very much and I wanted to share my thoughts about it.

SCHINDLER'S LIST is a masterpiece and only an idiot wouldn't watch it (or hate it)! In nearly three hours Steven Spielberg managed to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment towards Jews, and the Holocaust itself was a very long and epic event. The cinematography was excellent, the soundtrack is one of those movie scores that will remain stuck in your memories for months after you watch it and the direction was focused. The three leads give probably their best performances in their entire careers; Liam Neeson was excellent as Oskar Schindler, and he should have won the Academy Award for best Actor that year. Ben Kingsley was great as always and Ralph Fiennes was very chilling and scary as the villain Amon Goeth.

So, do I recommend it? Yes, it's sad and depressing in some parts, but is also perfectly written and acted, and it truly deserves all the praises that received through all these years. A movie that has to be seen at least once despite its depressing nature.",10
2 March 2004,Can we criticize this movie now?,"I mean, has enough time passed? Or has the release of *Schindler's List* on DVD fueled a new hushed awe towards the picture?

Spielberg's critic-proof Holocaust film has several problems, the biggest of which is the way it turns a horrible real-life tragedy into a three-hanky melodrama. I continue to maintain that the Holocaust is generally unfilmable, in terms of what we might call a standard movie. Generally unfilmable, but not inevitably unfilmable. Off the top of my head, I can recommend two recent films on this subject: Francesco Rosi's *The Truce*, and Costa-Gavras' *Amen"". Both films approach this material with far more nuance than Spielberg's film, which, I repeat, is weepy melodrama. (And as such, treads a fine line between reverence and tastelessness.) For that matter, Polanski's *The Pianist* gives us a more unique approach than what we get here, which is a movie that features a hero whom your average American multiplex popcorn-tub-muncher can easily identify with: a gregarious capitalist named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who, despite all the war-profiteering (read: ""initiative""), turns out to have a heart of gold. Or marshmallow mush. Please don't bother pointing out that this is a ""true story"": those who've read the actual book by Thomas Kenneally on which the movie is based will be rather shocked by the movie's willingness to sacrifice verisimilitude for ""dramatic license"". The biggest example of this is the ""villain"" of the piece, SS-Kommandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes in a career-making performance). The screenplay ladles all sorts of Freudian syrup over this character, meaning: he's crazy as a loon. So much for the ""banality of evil"": instead, we get, via Fiennes' Method-y performance, a study in mere neurosis instead of a rigorous examination of the murderous pathology that's inherent in humanity. Spielberg can't resist having Herr Goeth develop a crush on one of his Jewish housemaids, and we get the requisite ""Hath not a Jew eyes"" speech, delivered with what is supposed to be irony by Fiennes. Then he beats the crap out of her. Change the plot particulars, and you've got your standard ""Lifetime Channel"" movie about an abusive husband.

Don't get me wrong, the film is not a total waste of time: even melodrama has cumulative virtues, and many of the scenes in *Schindler's List* are quite affecting, particularly the very last sequence in which the surviving ""Schindler Jews"" appear (in color), accompanied by the actors who portrayed them. They pay tribute to Schindler by laying stones on his grave. Moving stuff. Ben Kingsley, who portrays the worry-wart Itzhak Stern, must also receive special mention. And Spielberg's technical mastery is never open to question: this is one beautifully mounted film, impeccably photographed. The set-design, which is called upon to perform the daunting task of replicating Nazi labor camps and so forth, is beyond reproach. Proving that he's still the same guy who directed *Jaws*, Spielberg is able to send chills up our spines when a train full of Jewish women & girls is accidentally routed to Auschwitz: it's a night-scene, replete with a light-tower that approximates a beacon from Hell.

But, all-in-all, the movie remains an elementary approach to the Holocaust genre. It's tailor-made for desultory viewings by 12th-graders: ""Hey mom, we learned about the Holocaust in class today."" Nothing wrong with that, but aren't the kids better served by a FACTUAL documentary about this subject, rather than an Oscar-baited exercise in self-importance? You decide.",3
27 January 2008,Schindler's List is Steven Spielberg's masterpiece and the best film of the 1990s!,"Schindler's List, the Oscar winner for Best Picture of 1993 is definitely one of the great films ever made, it cemented Steven Spielberg's status as the greatest filmmaker of our generation, and it cemented the evil legacy that is the holocaust.

Oskar Schindler, played masterfully by Liam Neeson is the center point of this masterpiece, all surrounded by some of the best professionals in the business, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, etc.

For years, I avoided writing a review to this film, because it is too painful and too powerful to write something about a film that has haunts you for many years.

The holocaust was one of the most evil experiences in human history. For a director like Steven Spielberg to take such a horrible human tragedy and to make something poignant about it, demonstrates his abilities as the greatest director of our time.

Spielberg takes the story of a greedy, selfish German businessman, and uses it as a force to demonstrate that human tragedy can turn anyone into a force for good, no matter what the consequences.

Nominated for 12 Academy Awards, and winner of 7 including Best Picture, and Spielberg's first Best Director Oscar, Schinder's List can take it's place aside some of the greatest film achievements of all time.",10
5 January 1999,One of the greatest films ever made.,"This movie is one of the most emotional and gripping movies I've ever seen. It accurately describes the tragedy of the holocaust. It shows how disgustingly evil people can be, what people will do to save lives, how people keep going even through the darkest times, and it shows how one person can change the lives of millions of people. A wonderfully true-story that is handled very professionally.

16 January 2022,What's a person worth to you?,"Oskar Schindler was not a good man. He was a member of the Nazi Party. He was a vain, greedy, alcoholic womanizer who looked to profit off of the war. However,, he also managed to save 1100 Jews from being murdered by the Nazi's.

Schindler hired Jews to work in his factory making enamelware pots and pans. Then, when all the Jews were to be sent to Auschwitz, Schindler spent the fortune he'd amassed from the war to buy 1100 of the Jews to work in a new factory making shells and casings for the war. Schindler spent his entire fortune paying for the Jews and paying off SS personnel until the war was finally over.

This movie tells the story of how all these things happened during WWII. These Oscar noms and wins were beyond well deserved. Spielberg has made so many amazing films but I dare say this movie is his masterpiece. Such a beyond horrible part of history told so VERY well. Neesom, Fiennes, Kingsley, and every other actor/actress (who's names I am not as familiar with) were so incredible in this picture. Words cannot do it justice. Masterpiece pretty much sums it up!",10
27 June 2001,Never cried until now,"This movie is the most touching story I've ever seen. Usually, the tear-quenchers of today never provoke any stronger emotions within me, but Schindler's List, which I've seen about ten times by now, has me crying every single time, and we're talking AFTER the film ends. The fact that a person like Oskar Schindler existed is simply fantastic. 1200 people lived through the WW2, purely because of this one man, who could have opted to live like a king for the rest of his life, but chose to throw all his riches away to save the lives of people, he hardly knew.

It's a HARD movie, that will repel you and make you sick to your stomach. But it's a must see! Please don't miss it!

And Steven Spielberg ... thank you! You're the man. Oh well, Kubrick will always be the man, but you come close!

19 August 1999,"Flawless, moving. A masterpiece.","Let's set the record straight, once and for all. I do not like ""Schindler's List."" I do not enjoy watching it. If I'd have my choice, I'd never see it again, ever. But of course, I don't have any choice in the matter, because it's simply too disturbing to never see again. I don't believe there is any finer monument to the horrors of the Holocaust than Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List."" People may tell us of the horrors, of the concentration camps, of the deaths, but this film puts us there, among the survivors.

This is, of course, Spielberg's crowning achievement. As far as I am concerned, there is no other film ever made anywhere that has the power and emotion of ""Schindler's List,"" least of all the technical expertise that is so evident here. For instance, Janusz Kaminski's frenetic camera work whips us through the ghettos in such a way that we can not help but be terrified, and yet is calm enough to let us catch a breath, cry a tear. This is also, in my opinion, John Williams' finest score. It is so sparse, so beautiful. For any classical music fans, I can only compare this score to Henryk Gorecki's Third Symphony, ""A Symphony of Sorrowful Songs."" But I'm getting off the topic.

The acting is flawless, with performances from the likes of Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. And, of course Steven Zaillian's moving script that puts us everywhere, from the heart of the horror to the outskirts of it.

Let me go back to what I said at the beginning of this review. I do not like ""Schindler's List."" I love it. And yet, I don't love it quite it the way that I love any other film. What I can do is recommend it without reservation to anybody who has never seen it. There is no better film than this. Period.

Of special note, Spielberg apparently donated a copy of this film to every American high school. I can not thank him enough for that, because it was in class that I first saw ""Schindler's List."" I just pray that others have been as affected by it as I have.

**** out of ****.",10
13 March 2008,The Greatest film of all time?????,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

17 September 1999,"A serious, solemn success.","Some movies move you. They make you laugh, they make you cry and these are good movies. I don't know if tiredness is an emotion but by the end of this movie I was emotionally drained. I was exhausted.

There are more Jews that owe their lives to Oskar Schindler than Jews that live in Poland today, This is an extraordinary message we recieve at the end of this movie. Extraordinary because of it's honesty. This man saved more people than a country saved and this man was no angel, no prophet. He was an average run-of-the-mill German.

This story could have been one of immense sentimentality but it's not due to the performance of Liam Neeson and the direction of Spielberg. It is easy to tell while watching this that this is the movie Spielberg always wanted to make. His complete and most important work. Spielberg can never reach this standard again. Very few directors will ever reach this standard.

Everything about this movie is perfect. Neeson plays Schindler with just enough power. We know this man is special but Neeson doesn't play him like a legend. Fiennes is evil but humane. Kingsley gives a very touching performance as the only Jew Schindler actually gets to know.

But this is Spielberg's film. His heart is in every shot. He knows how important a film about the holocaust is to the Jewish people and he doesn't let them down. A Jew himself, he associates with them and delivers one of the greatest movies ever made.",10
3 August 1998,An excellent movie from USA about the most terrible time in Germany.,"I think that this movie was a fingertip to the bad environment that happen here in Germany since 1989, when the wall broke down between east and west Germany.

I wish more people would understand the meaning of this film.

27 June 2000,Quite Possibly the Best and Most Important Film of the 1990s,"Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" is a top-notch film in every sense. The production values are extremely high, the cinematography (shot almost completely in black and white) is a sight to behold, the original score is amazing, the screenplay is complicated and unrelenting, and the performances are some of the best ever from any film ever produced. However, it is Spielberg's direction that makes ""Schindler's List"" the instant classic that it is. The film deals with a businessman (Liam Neeson in an Oscar-nominated role) who looks to profit from World War II by producing war goods for the Nazi Army and employing ghetto Jews as cheap labor. Ben Kingsley plays a Jewish accountant who acts as Schindler's right-hand man who makes sure that he gets as many Jews as he can to save them from imminent deaths at Nazi war camps. When Schindler witnesses what is really going on he has a change of heart and starts to save the Jews of Poland by buying them from a sadistic Nazi commander (Ralph Fiennes in an Oscar-nominated role). Needless to say, Schindler develops the ""list"" with Kingsley and over 1,000 Jews were saved from certain deaths at the hands of the Nazi army. ""Schindler's List"" is one of those utterly brilliant films that are rarely made today, or at any time for that matter. This is also one of the most important films ever made. When this film was initially released in 1993 some doubted the Holocaust had ever actually happened. Many professors from prominent universities were convincing young people that the Holocaust was a fictional tool of propaganda used by the Allied Powers to create support for their cause. Of course this is ridiculous, but many people were believing this trite. That is the primary reason why this film is such an amazing success. Spielberg had an urge to do this project way back in the early-1980s, but did not feel he was quite ready for the harsh material (he was probably right in waiting). He offered the project to Martin Scorsese (who also did not feel comfortable with the material) and even Stanley Kubrick (he was not interested). Billy Wilder, well in his 80s at the time, also showed considerable interest. However, Spielberg bought his time and went forward when he finally felt the time was right. The timing was perfect and this film is perfect. Easily one of the top 10 films of all time. 5 stars out of 5.",
2 May 2009,I could have got more out. I could have got more. I don't know. If I'd just... I could have got more.,"Winner of seven Oscars. it should have won all of the ones it was nominated for. It won a total of 63 awards. has any film won more? The film stands far above the rest and will do so for all time.

It was the detritus that was being picked over after the trains left for the camps that really struck me. The pile of photos were especially hard to take. The memories recorded for lifetimes to be consumed by fire.

It was after Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) arrived, that Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) slowly realized he had something more to do than make money. At least the British film critics and the BAFTA recognized Fiennes performance. It is too bad that Neeson didn't fare as well.

Ben Kingsley was also fantastic as Schindler's accountant.

A stain on history that will never be forgotten. Impossible to watch with bringing a tear to your eye.",10
20 September 2002,One of the greats.,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",
19 August 2006,"Its beauty is hypnotizing, its power, awesome","Oskar Schindler was not a good person in the strictest sense of the word. A member of the Nazi Party, he drank like a fish, gambled, conducted dealings on the black market and cheated on his wife innumerable times. Yet he found salvation by doing something so great even he could not comprehend its greatness: he changed himself for the greater good, saving the lives of more than 1100 Jews employed in his munitions factory from the hatred of the Nazi regime.

1993 was arguably the greatest year of Steven Spielberg's life. First he made the rip-roaring Jurassic Park, a still technologically astounding movie that revolutionized special effects and paid for his kids' educations for the next thirty years. But later, he presented us with Schindler's List, a film as remarkable as Schindler's achievement that beat nearly all other '90s historical dramas into submission and finally bagged him the Best Director and Best Picture Oscars for which he had long been unfairly passed over. And if he still hadn't won it would have probably spawned conspiracy theories.

Spielberg has said that the filming of Schindler's List ""was the most satisfying experience of my professional career,"" claiming it is the best film he has ever made. Even if I do say so myself, he's absolutely right. Working from Steven Zaillian's masterfully constructed adaptation of Thomas Keneally's novel Schindler's Ark, he elicits an outstanding performance from Liam Neeson as Schindler (who justifiably lost at the Oscars to Tom Hanks in Philadelphia), and Ralph Fiennes pulls off what is easily one of the scariest performances in cinema history as Amon Goeth, the SS commandant and director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau labor camp whose favourite pastime was using Jews for target practice.

However, this is unquestionably Spielberg's greatest directing job. Utilizing grainy black-and-white cinematography, Spielberg cleverly uses lots of wide panning shots and hand-held cameras to evoke just the right amount of shock and sympathy for Holocaust victims in each scene. Also, he seems to have realized that in order to completely nail a film of such depth and importance as this, you shouldn't even attempt to glamourize the Holocaust or answer the questions it has left in modern society. All you have to do is assess what happened and get the facts right.

In the production notes in the Schindler's List DVD, Spielberg writes: ""No one can do anything to fix the past - that's already happened. But a picture like this can impact us, delivering a mandate about what must never happen again."" Now I know the chances of you reading this are devastatingly low, but if you are, Mr. Spielberg, you need not worry because as a result of this powerhouse masterpiece you have single-handedly re-awakened awareness of the Holocaust, ensuring that it (hopefully) will never be repeated or forgotten. You are a god among giants, sir.",10

23 March 2006,Masterpiece - Must See,"Given the number of comments here, it is probably superfluous to add my opinion. Nevertheless, I will - to express my three points. First, this film is a masterpiece both in its content and in its style. Notwithstanding ""Sophie's Choice"" and other attempts to recount the Holocaust, the story of Schindler needed to be told. I am pleased that Spielberg told it and not, for example, Polanski or Scorcese. Spielberg (in some ways a Schindler himself, a guy with panache) relied on image, and feeling. (The most powerful scenes need no sound. Dialogue is often in Polish, German or Yiddish.) Spielberg tells Schindler's story without a Polanski edge, nor a Scorcese wantonness.

Second, the choice of the pre-war Hungarian song ""Gloomy Sunday"" lent authenticity as I watched, and has given me a reminder since. I can't hear other versions of this song now without thinking of this story.

Third, watch for the girl's red dress because that's when Schindler realizes a truth, and somehow changes. At the end, watch for the woman spontaneously touch Schindler's grave with her hand. In all this terribleness, something good survived.",10
5 January 2018,Heart-wrenching movie with Great Message,"I am shocked to see such a low ratings for this great achievement. Really, how can someone rate 1, 2 etc for this . The Best True story with excellent direction, Cinematography (1 rating extra for filming it in Black and White). It makes us to feel that we are not watching movie, We are just a part of that place where story revolves.

I personally recommend this movie to everyone who will understand the meaning of Film and for the true movie lovers. My Top 5 movie of all time.

Also Acting was superb, I liked Ralph Fiennes acting so much. He looks almost similar to Amon Goeth itself . He should have won an Oscar for this Worthy performance.

13 April 2004,Shade of Hope,"Oskar Schindler represented a snippet of hope and optimism for an otherwise beleaguered people. The fact that one man could be responsible for saving well over 1000 people is astonishing in itself. The story Schindler's List tells magnifies our astonishment. How a man who seems so self-absorbed and moneygrubbing could end up sacrificing his fortune and risking his own life to save others, is what the film principally deals with. This interesting subject, shown in the midst of the Holocaust, and combined with other interesting subplots, makes for a stirring movie experience.

One detail quite noticeable and frequently discussed is the occasional use of color in this black and white picture. The most obvious of these being a small girl in red coat. We see the girl and follow her path for a short time in the film. This is symbolic on many different levels. I see her mostly as a glimmer of hope in a tenebrous world for the Jews. Later, her red coat looms on top of a pile of dead bodies. Here, we see her singled out among the dead to remind us that while 6 million died, each individual's death mattered.

The cast is wonderful. Liam Neeson plays Schindler subtly but with the right emotion at the right time. Ralph Fiennes plays a pertinacious German officer with zest and complexity. The rest of the cast, especially Ben Kingsley as an intelligent Jewish accountant who starts out helping Schindler but finds a way to help his people, too, all play their roles accordingly. Certainly, anyone who enjoys film should add this to their collection.",9
14 September 2002,"FINALLY, a bio-pic which is good...","...wait, not good but GREAT!

Steven Spielberg did an incredible job on this movie because this is really a great movie which is both sad and happy. Spielberg did a great job balancing both. Now not only is Oskar Schindler an interesting man but Spielberg compares the character/man to an evil Nazi who is also a greedy business man like Schindler. Still what's great about this movie is that Spielberg gets to the interesting stuff--unlike other bio-pics. To top it up the movie has great performances and a beautiful score by John Williams.

23 July 2011,"My review of ""SCHINDLER'S LIST"" ...","This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",10
18 October 1999,Amazing.,"If you read my comment history, you'll see that it's not often I comment on ""serious"" (i.e. non-comedic) films. But I do. I saw this movie as a Year 12 high school text - and was amazed. This is an absolutely incredible film, touching and shockingly realistic. (The massacre scenes come to mind). All in all, I'd say, this is a movie that MUST be watched.

13 June 2011,Left Me in Tears,"Very little films can do it. That is to leave me in tears, sharing the pain of the characters on screen. I've seen plenty of 'sad movies' and 'tearjerkers' over the years that I have left me emotion hollow. (Beaches and Terms of Endearment come to mind.) Schindler's List is different. It matters. The realism portrayed is frightening. You're not watching a film about the horrors of the Holocaust, you're witnessing the horrors of the Holocaust. Decent people, people just trying to make a living like you and me, put into such a devastating position for no fault of there own. And a man, a Nazi of all people, who has a virtue his peers seem to be lacking: compassion. But, unlike many weaker efforts to exploit human tragedy, the protagonist (Oskar Schindler)is initially set on cashing in on the force labor by the Jews he brings to his factory. Over the story, his character develops more and more feelings for his Jewish subjects. He reaches the point where they aren't Jewish workers, but fellow human beings.

In that, Schindler's List is a very human story. A film that every single human being on the face of the planet should sit through, not for entertainment, but to get a first person perspective to the horrors man is capable of committing on each other. Schindler's List is a beautiful film. A miracle film. A film so emotional, down to the very last scene, no matter who you are, you will be pouring tears by the buckets.",10
31 August 2004,deserved oscars,"Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes star in Spielberg's award-winning Holocaust drama

Author Thomas Keneally won a Booker Prize for 'Schindler's Ark', but it took Spielberg to tell the story of shady Nazi industrialist Schindler who saved hundreds of Jews from the death camps to a worldwide audience.

It was very much a personal project for Spielberg. After the success of Jurassic Park he was able to make any film he wanted, and has said that he didn't expect many people would want to see a Jewish story. However, in Neeson's flawed hero Oskar Schindler, Kingsley's quietly desperate Jewish administrator Itzhak Stern and Fiennes's bloatedly evil concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth, Spielberg had a dramatic engine that pulls an audience along through the heartbreaking story of the enslavement and massacre of Poland's Jews.

It won buckets of Oscars, but its best tribute is the shocked, tearful silence of audiences everywhere. An outstanding, harrowing piece of cinema.



Verdict A heart-rending and redemptive Holocaust story, this Oscar-grabbing epic added to Spielberg's directorial credibility, showing he could handle controversial, sophisticated stories with real sensitivity.",
12 October 2004,You must see it at least once,"It gets a rare 10/10 from me although it is not on my Top 10 List, mostly because it isn't a movie that anyone really enjoys watching as much as one that needs to be watched. In any case I sure can't be in a laid back mindset ready to watch an action flick and substitute Schindler's List at the last second; I gotta be ready for it.

I've watched it 3-4 times, the first time in a theater with my sister who was dying of cancer and wanted to see it. I remember one of her sons theorized that the Holocaust never happened and it was a way to justify the destruction of the Nazi regime, or some other BS, that I've heard variations of before. They just don't have any grounding in history. Even the Nazis who were hung for it didn't deny it; they were just following orders.

Its quite a movie with all the talent both on and off the screen doing some of their best work ever. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes really should've won Oscars, but it won so many others I suppose they wanted to spread them around a little.

The fairly recently released DVD package is a bit of a throwback with an odd case and a single double-sided DVD. If there's some special reason for it I don't know what it is. It has a DTS soundtrack but the B&W video was quite harsh on my screen with very bright interior lighting sometimes bombing details to smithereens. I had to adjust my screen to watch it. I don't recall that on the old laserdisc or anywhere else. It gets quite a bit lower 7/10 rating.",10
5 January 2000,A moving story about a heroic deed,"Schindler's List is a vivid character portrait of a flawed man who made heroic choices under the toughest of circumstances. Steven Spielberg has found a wonderful story, and has told it with pain, passion, and wisdom that is rare in today's cinema. In this three hour tale, Spielberg has at once shown us the horror of war, and has given us a story of courage and heroism to overcome it. Strong performances by Liam Neelson as Oscar Schindler, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Feinnes enhanced the strength of this painful and touching story. Even a schmaltzy ending cannot take away the beauty and power of this heroic tale, beautifully told.

22 April 2001,One Scene Not To be Missed,"There's a small scene is in this motion picture that, in a way,

actually speaks volumes about the film's subject matter. It occurs

during the aftermath of the Krakow Ghetto destruction, at night,

when the Nazis are digging out the people hiding in the buildings,

hoping to avoid death. One soldier sits down at an upright piano

and starts playing, surrounded by the sounds of gun fire and

people screaming and crying. Two more soldiers stop in the

doorway and banter lightly about whose music he's playing, Bach

or Mozart. I think Speilberg here is trying to emphasize the fact that, even a

supposedly ""civilized"" and ""educated"" group of people like the

Germans could be coerced and driven to cold-blooded murder. In

this case, a young German man who no doubt had classical piano

lessons as a child becomes part of a brutal killing machine. It's

small but chilling scene in a very powerful movie.",
8 March 2004,"The Passion of the Jews ... DEVASTATING! Excellent movie, but devastating.","First of all, I hope that no one takes my title out of context and thinks that I like watching movies that show the suffering of ANYONE, unless, of course, the suffering is on an obvious villian or villians, thank you.

I also need to mention that I have seen this film at least three times before I even HEARD about what Mel Gibson was working on.

Anyway, after seeing ""Passion of the Christ"", I thought that was THE most devastating (but excellently done) film ever made about Anything or Anyone that took place in History. Then I remembered watching ""Saving Private Ryan"" (another Spielberg movie, excellently done) and it's being so intense that I literally had to remind myself a few times that I was in my living room watching a video; the intensity of the scenes and the sound made me almost FEEL bullets whizzing by my head.

Then I remembered THIS movie.

It is one of the hardest movies to sit through. And it's hard to sit through almost the ENTIRE TIME.

Even though everyone and their brother has at least HEARD about the Holocaust, this is a movie about two things. A)Yes, of course, The Holocaust, and B) a person who was a womanizing, sweat-shop owner type (who was, at first, only nice for the sake of production) member of the Nazi Party who eventually SAVED so many people from annihilation.

It is one thing to see the story of some ""Plain old guy"" save a life or two,... but to see someone who was FRIENDS WITH THE ANNIHILATORS manage to save over a thousand Jewish people and still be more or less friends with the Nazis during that time ...

All I can say is WOW!!!

Before any violence even takes place, a dark cloud forms just by watching the Jewish people being marched toward the ghetto and there's that girl screaming out ""Bye, Jews!"" over and over again along with other people being nasty.

A) It's like watching a whole bunch of Jesuses being marched down the road to their eventual crucifixions while the crowd throws insults and objects at them. B)You don't know whether you want to jump into the film and strangle her for her hatred (or her parents for teaching it to her, perhaps), or cry because of her innocence of not knowing better because the parents TAUGHT her that level of hatred because of buying into what was Politically Correct at the time and place.

I know it was just a fictitious character, but such things as hatred toward specific types of people being taught by the parents DO happen in REAL LIFE.

I won't tell what actually happens with the women at Auschwitz (or was it Dachau?), but that was another one of the most chair-gripping ""Oh no ... Oh GOD NO!"" moments in the picture.

And, of course, there are all the ""Liquidation"" scenes and the especially significant scenes with ""The Little Girl in Red"", which requires a cast-iron stomach to watch at that point in the film. By the way, don't you, Dear Reader, just love that euphemism ""Liquidation""? ACCH!

Not to mention, all the people who get picked off simply because ... well, they were ALLOWED to be. Double-ACCH!

I read earlier of a comment about how there should have been more focus on Hitler, as it was a movie regarding the Holocaust. But this movie wasn't about Hitler's List of People He Wanted Dead; it was about Oskar Schindler's List of People He Could Afford to Keep ALIVE!

Even after all the carnage is over, it still makes anyone who is a human being get a huge lump in their throat when Oskar is breaking down because of however many more he could have saved with his own possessions.

As I said in my title and opening of this commentary, this is one of the best movies ever made about something that took place in history, but it's also one of the HARDEST movies to watch.

I really gotta give Spielberg credit not just for making this picture, not just for releasing it with as much as it has intact (after editing and getting past the authority boards and such), but ESPECIALLY for having the ""juice"" to get American television stations to show it without a single frame edited or altered. Even the private parts you DIDN'T want to see when the prisoners are given physical exams and they're so skinny that their spines are almost glued to their belly-buttons.

Take a bow, Stephen.

Aaannnnd ... cut!

That's a wrap.",
27 July 2009,One of the greatest film epics,Last January a friend and I travelled to Kracow in Poland for a long weekend and while we were there we visited a town 50 kilometres from Kracow called Oswiecim or what the Nazis called Auschwitz. Had we visited that place 65 years ago I suspect what we would have seen then was graphically illustrated in this film. I do not know whether the film is historically accurate but the horror and degradation did take place and a man named Schindler tried to get a number of people out of that area before they became statistics too. The film in my opinion probably describes the times for those in NAZI occupied mainland Europe perfectly. In order to get anything that you wanted or needed you had to deal directly with people who had the power to have anybody killed on a whim not just because they could but also because they probably liked it. Oskar Schindler was an extremely good actor he must have been to have done what he did. Yes he paid a lot of money for these peoples lives but he had to go along with whatever happened no matter how bad to achieve what he did. The 1200 people he saved would probably not have survived but for his actions. This film may as well be a CCTV tape of those times and is therefore not fiction and anybody watching the film for the first time needs to keep that in mind.,10
6 October 2005,Faultless movie,"I am not really one for lists of the ""top ten"" anything. Is Wizard of Oz a better film than Citizen Kane? How can you compare two such different movies? But it does seem to me that ""Schindler's List"" is in a class of its own. More recent films like ""The Pianist"" have tackled the same subject well, but nothing can quite compare with Steven Spielberg's triumphant presentation of Thomas Kenealy's great book.

Perhaps the test of greatness is to answer some questions:

¬ï Does the story matter? ¬ï Is it real (true) or believable? ¬ï Does it touch all the emotions? ¬ï Are there lessons to be learnt? ¬ï Are the performances strong? ¬ï Are the settings realistic and credible? ¬ï Are the characters true to life? (Heroes we can learn from; Villains we can comprehend) ¬ï Does the film have the capacity to change the way we look at the world?

To me ""Schindler's List"" scores more highly than any other film on all of these criteria. It is a truly great movie.",10
22 February 2006,Never again will there be a film like this. Possibly the best movie of the 90's.,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

17 December 1999,There is no love story,"There is no love story good enough to be able to be compared to this movie. The love showing up on this movie, is much bigger than any story! The love for keeping people alive! This is one of the best movies ever done. We all have to thank Steven Spielberg to be so great and being able to this all of this movies! SO THANK YOU. He did just as great in Saving Private Ryan! The images in this movie, makes it closer to the time that was done. Makes it more real, more believable. The photography is just ART! the acting is great. the screen play is material to read at Junior's classes (not the Scarlet letter, or however is called that book!). Is movie that should be watched at History class, because shows IN A PERFECT WAY how it was, and if it doesn't then better not know what really happen at that war! We just have to sit down and clap to this movie, that I would call THE BIGGEST MASTERPIECE ever done for a screen. Thanks Steven for giving the humanity the oportunity to have this movie!!!!

26 August 2006,Among the greatest flicks ever...,"I hardly miss any Steven Spielberg Movie.But Schindler list was released in 1993 and that time i din even understood any English muvys.

Story: The true story of Czech born Oskar Schindler, a businessman who tried to make his fortune during the Second World War by exploiting cheap Jewish labour, but ended up penniless having saved over 1000 Polish Jews from almost certain death during the holocaust.

Winner of 7 Oscar awards Schindler's List is story of Nazi barbarism.It shows how mean the human beings can be sometimes.Its the most powerful story ever told about barbarism and brutality.Even the words barbarism and brutality are too less to describe what happened to the jews.Its not only related what happened to the jews but its a slap on face of humanity.How can we call ourselves human beings The duration of movie is over 3 hours still it never losses its hold.

To call Liam Neeson had given outstanding performance would be understatement.From a greedy businessman to a humanitarian he is extraordinary.His broke up at the end of the movie is so touching i lost my words to define them.Incredible.I am surprised how he lost the Oscar Ralph Fiennes have given his career best performance.Playing the role of frightening Nazi commandant he just rocks.

And Schindler's List only proves how great a filmmaker is Steven Spielberg.From making movies like (JAWS) to close encounters of the third world to ET to Jurassic park and recently released Munich and many endless works he is 'God of all Directors'.The way he have shown the brutality and what had happened in past only a great ones like him can do that.

Many of you have seen this movie but i posted review cause i wanted all to know what is called sensible cinema.

With Spielberg's one of the best directed movies and spellbounding performance by Liam Neeson Schindler's List is a must watch for everyone.Especially for them who want to see sensible and meaningfull cinema.

.....A True Classic",10
6 October 2021,I could not speak,"What is there left to say about this masterpiece? I will never forget this film and I will never watch it again. True story: I was a teacher, now a substitute teacher. I was subbing for a high school genocide class which consisted of three periods a day. Unfortunately for myself I had to sit through the massacre of the ghetto three times in a row. You could hear a pin drop when it was time to end the period. After the third time of sitting through the same scene it was break time. I went into the restroom and vomited it was so upsetting. Of course this is nothing compared to the reality of the victims of genocide, but Spielberg spared nothing in his goal of realism. And to this day I can scarcely look at Ralph Fiennes without my skin crawling, he was such a good actor. Beautiful looking and talented man, his portrayal literally made me sick to my stomach.

5 April 2018,Schindler's List is easily one of the greatest films in history!,"For years, the Oscar eluded master filmmaking Steven Spielberg, from timeless classics to box office blockbusters, he was revered for making big budget entertainment, but was dismissed by other film directors and film critics for making so many family friendly films.

That all changed in 1993, when he directed what was at that time the biggest grossing film in history, Jurassic Park and followed by 1993's Best Picture and Best Director, Schindler's List.

Schindler's List isn't just a film it's an experience cf the Holocaust so stunning and so upsetting that it completely changed Spielberg as a director. It won virtually every Best Picture award on the planet, from the BAFTA, to the Golden Globe to the Academy Award for Best Picture and rightfully so.

This and Saving Private Ryan prove that Steven Spielberg, NOT James Cameron is the true king of filmmaking now and forever. To deny that is to deny the absolute truth of the matter.",10
17 June 2002,Spielberg's Best Film...,"It is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Amazing photography, cinematography, acting, directing, writing etc. etc. It's also a very poetic film, I've seen it 4 times (first time being back in 1995) and it gets better with every viewing. The visual images are thoughtful and provocative. One of the most powerful, intelligent, and triumphant stories I've seen on film in a very long time. The acting from Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley are three of the unforgettable performances of all time. A great story about the Haulocost.

11 December 2003,On the Verge of Sanity,"Spielberg's craftsmanship in direction had to wait the ultimate praise until 1993, when he produced the extraordinary epic ""Schindler's List"". It was the film that brought him the first Oscar, the first Golden Globe, the first David Lean (BAFTA), and most of the directing awards existent at that time. And yet, the king of blockbusters produced a work that was greater than him, a work that rose above humanity. Even John Paul II considered it as the best film of all time in what was to be known as The Pope's Oscars.

""Schindler's List"" is the adaptation of Thomas Keneally's novel about Oskar Schindler, 'a German bon vivant, speculator, charmer, and sign of contradiction', who during World War II saved the life of more than 1000 Polish Jews. It was the only important thing in the life of a small industrialist who gained popularity under the Nazis, and who disappeared into oblivion just as the war ended. 'He was fortunate', would remark his wife later on, that 'between 1939 and 1945 he had met people who had summoned forth his deeper talents'.

We are exposed to crude cruelty and absolute goodness, both touching each other and dismissive of any contradiction. The Black and White negative gives the great charm of ""Schindler's List"". We are transposed to the forties so elegantly, and so passionately, that we become one with the setting. We feel the coldness of the concentration camps, the smell of burning bodies, the breath of hiding children in the communal toilets. Everything is captured as if by our own eye, when we suddenly get to notice a yellowish flame of a candle, the little girl dressed in a red coat hiding from the SS. A masterful cinematography under the eye of Janusz Kaminski.

It is not a film you watch for the end, but one you absorb and regurgitate. The time passes as passionately as the events of the film, so boredom is the last thing on one's mind. And how can you be bored with such an impressive cast, most giving the performances of a lifetime? Liam Neeson is the perfect Herr Direktor Schindler, full of charisma, capable of cruelty, unbothered of changing women like underwear, and still a man that would not produce a gun that can shoot in his factory, that would lie, and risk his life for as many souls he could save. And then there is a young Ralph Fiennes playing the sadistic SS Commander Amon Goeth. We have a total transformation towards brutality, inhibited lust, sado-masochistic alcoholism, the complete loss of power and humanity ¬ñ all characteristics of the best supporting performance the screen has ever witnessed, probably second only to DeNiro's portrayal of Vito Corleone in The Godfather: Part II. Ben Kingsley is the tender, honourable, devoted Itzhak Stern, Oskar's right hand throughout the entire war. Caroline Goodall and Embeth Davidz give two memorable performances as Schindler's wife, and Goeth's Jewish maid.

""Schindler's List"" is one of those films that lack the ability to be summarised in a few words. It is an experience in itself. It teaches, though not dogmatically, that Heaven is relative, that beauty is salvation, that the love for life matters more than the integrity of our own souls.

Excellent picture of the most horrid period of the last century. Perfect for an evening of meditation. A perfect classic.",
20 May 2006,Brilliant,"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. What more can I say? . It takes total control of your emotions: Sorrow, sadness, hate, hope and even sometimes joy in the few happy scenes. The actors and actress'complete this masterwork of a movie with absolute amazing performances. It follows the historical facts very careful and makes you believe that it happened almost as in the movie. A movie that makes you cry every time you see it, if not on the outside, at least on the inside. It touches your soul, even if you do not think it is the best movie in the world. Well the 6th place speaks for itself, this is without doubt one of the best movies ever! I like it so much because it captures the true effects of the war and the killing of all the million Jews. It shows how a single man helped hundreds to live through and keep fighting. Steven Spielberg uses all means to make it one of the greatest movies in the world.

21 August 2001,left me speechless....,"After having finally seen 'Schindlers List', I can say that it is an absolutely fantastic and emotional experience. When I was finished watching the film I was left completely speechless. I couldn't actually find the words to describe it. I'll give it a try now.

On technical aspects of the movie, everything was solid. It was a very beautiful film to look at. Shot in black and white, there was very little color, except at the very end of the movie. Also, a little color is inserted into the film highlighting the often mentioned girl in the red dress. It is a beautiful scene, but I am a little unclear as what the symbolism of it actually was. Even being unclear about it, one theory I saw was that it highlighted her as an individual, and in doing so it creates and individual story, showing that every person there was an individual in and of themselves. I'm not sure if that is true, but it makes sense. I often found myself wondering about her fate, so my theory is that Spielberg gave us a person to wonder about, if they had lived or died. Then we may feel like all the Jewish families who were not positive of the fate of there loved ones until much later on.

There are way too many powerful, and at times sad and disturbing scenes to talk about right now. Of these scenes, there is the all to disturbing liquidation of the ghetto. The forced labour camp scenes as well were very disturbing. They were mostly disturbing because of the head of the camps, Amon Goeth, a very ruthless and awful human being that just seems to shoot people for fun. Just because. And its disturbing to watch the disregard with which he does it.

Amon Goeth was played disturbingly by Ralph Fiennes, who should have won an Oscar, but thats neither here nor there. He was some absolutley disturbing scenes that are just brilliantly played out. I can point out a few, for instance a scene when he is talking with his Jewish servant(I will not tell you about what)and he does the whole conversation himself. Watching him just change his tone, psychologically, in a matter of seconds is amazing. Another I remember, is one when he is going to shoot a Jew in the back of the head, and his gun won't work. Its just a terrifying scene in many ways, but Fiennes plays it in such a way that you can tell he has no morals or cares for Jews, but a blood lust. Other than that though, his stare, his evil stare showed nothing but hatred, and I don't know how Fiennes did it, but it is a horribly evil stare. His eyes said everything. This was the highlight performance in the movie.

However, Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley put together two great performances as well. What is amazing between these two is watching their relationship change throughout the movie, until Neeson(as Schindler) is repentent and changed, and really sad he didn't do more, as he felt he could have. Really, one of the most heart wrenching scenes in the film is when Schindler feels he could have done more and that he just didn't do enough. In the film he goes from an opportunist to a true hero, an unselfish one. The gift he gets from the Jews, and his embrace of Itzhak Stern(Kingsley)are truly wonderful and, apparently real moments. Its hard not to be touched.

Not surprisingly however, the direction was absolutely brilliant. Spielberg made a movie that was close to his heart and this was a labour of love, and it will stand as his masterpiece. You can always tell you are watching the hand of a master, and I knew that when I started this film, Spielberg was going to give me something special, and he did.

The only mild flaw, most people seem to think, is the small portion of the film at the end that is in color. It seems a little out of place, and that Spielberg added it on maybe for himself. And I think he should be allowed to do so after the three hours before hand that were extremely emotional. I didn't hate the very end like some people though, because to me it was a way to show us that this disaster, the Holocaust, happened only very recently, only fifty years ago(at the time this movie was released). The fact is that some people who lived through this tragedy are still alive, and Spielberg, I feel, uses the end of the film to bridge that generation gap and remind us how recently this all happened.

So finally, all I can say is wow. Not many movies has left me speechless. This was one of the most emotional films I may have ever seen, remembering that I ended up crying a bit in three different places. Usually I might cry once, but not three times. It is subject matter that isn't taken lightly, and shouldn't. Everything in its three hours are necessary and brilliant. Everyone should see this movie once, if for nothing else than an education. Just a brilliant film. 10 out of 10.",10
19 June 2002,a strong testament to the Holocaust and Herr Schindler,"Schindler's List both conveys the horrors of the Holocaust and depicts the life of unlikely hero Oskar Schindler, a German businessman (and member of the Nazi Party), who begins to sympathize with the Jews when he realizes the true scope of their suffering and ultimately saves 1100 of them from Auschwitz. Liam Neeson plays Schindler excellently, and Ralph Fiennes is just as good as the vile Nazi Goeth. With a movie that so graphically (occasionally almost to an unwatchable extent) portrays the Holocaust and the unspeakable crimes of the Nazis, it was nice that it had the character of Herr Schindler to show that not all Germans were in support of this and that some Germans went against the Nazis and saved lives, a fact that is rarely mentioned in Holocaust films or anywhere else. I'm not sure if ""enjoyed"" is the right word, but I'm certainly glad I saw this important piece of cinema.

15 March 2004,Transformed by the white light,"What makes this film truly remarkable is the personal transformation which Oskar Schindler under goes just past the mid-point of the movie in a series of incredibly subtle scenes. Early on, Schindler is driven only by selfish desire for money, women and influence. Others may benefit from his actions, but it is purely a by-product. Never does he help someone to his own detriment. He narrowly rescues Itzhak Stern from a train to a death camp and then scolds him, saying ""If I had been five minutes later, then where would I be?"". But by the end of the movie, Schindler willingly loses all his personal wealth and repeatedly risks his life in order to save others. The inflection point takes place at a meeting between Schindler and Stern at the Plaszow work camp. It's night and Oskar leaves a Nazi party to see his accountant. At the end of a brief conversation Stern says "" Don't let things fall apart. I worked too hard for this"". He is pleading with Schindler to take personal responsibility. As Stern walks away a search beacon shines over his shoulder and fills the screen with a blinding white light. The camera cuts to Oskar. He is engulfed by the light. He smiles of deep satisfaction. This sets off an amazing sequence of scenes: - Schindler comes to the aid of a metal presser. - He gives protection in his factory to a traumatised boy, despite the fact that he has no skills. He gives up his own silver lighter and cigarette case to make these two events happen. - He comforts Amon Goeth's abused maid. They sit beneath a cone of white light. At a point where he could easily take advantage of her, instead he helps her renew her will to survive. - In a discussion with Goeth after a party, he explains that true power comes not from control or the ability to kill, but the ability to forgive. This could be further interpreted as ""Success in life comes not from pursuing personal gain, but from rising above it"". Goeth is amused and intrigued by this but in the subsequent tragic ""bath tub stain"" scene, we see that he is pathetically incapable of internalizing anything that was said. - In perhaps the most powerful scene of the film, a women comes to Schindler and begs that he take her skilless, aged parents into his factory to save their lives. He appears from on high at the top of a long stair case. She tells him "" No one ever dies here. It is a haven. They say that you are good"". One can easily substitute the word ""heaven"" for ""haven"" and ""God"" for ""good"". In rage, Schindler throws her out. But then he goes to see Stern. He tells Stern that there is good in all people but that war brings out the worst in them. He uses this to rationalize and forgive the behavior of Goeth. We fully expect that he will now use this to rationalize his own selfish behavior. Instead he takes the watch from his own wrist and gives it to Stern to use to buy the lives of the two elderly parents. The irony is that war has borough out good in Schindler that might never have emerged otherwise. From here on out Schindler performs a continuous series of selfless acts. Moreover,despite the huge personal risks he takes, we feel good about the choices he makes and therefor we are transformed a little bit, along with him.",10
22 November 2006,A story of true heart Speilbergs epic..,"This movie depicts the Jews fight to stay alive and showed what they really went through. It shows the story of one man who could change heart with the views of what happened during those years and why it happened. That will always be a question why. Steven Spielberg hits the movie rite on the spot and makes you feel as if your there. He brings it a ll back to life. Everyone gave off amazing performances. This is Spielberg's arguably greatest achievement other then Saving Private Ryan. At the end it makes you feel a little good inside to know what Oskar Schindler did for the Jews. This movie deserves all the Oscars it one and more I think this is one of the most amazing story's ever told on screen by one of the greatest directors ever to hit the big screen. I give it a 15 out of 10.

2 June 2004,An eye opener (Spoilers),"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",8
20 June 2013,Incredible,"This is one of the most moving movies ever made in my humble opinion. I'm sure this will be remembered as one of the best movies of all time.

First off, the acting. Liam Neeson is a great actor overall and shows his excellence in this movie, playing Oskar Schindler. For me, the best actor in this movie is Ralph Fiennes. His role as Amon Goeth is simply amazing. I once read one of the survivors of the Holocaust visited the set and started shaking when she met Ralph Fiennes because he portrayed such a resemblance of Amon Goeth. I can completely understand that. The way he acts in this movie, the way his character thinks are very well thought of. Ralph Fiennes is truly terrifying in this movie, which is a remarkable feat and an Honor to witness.

Secondly, I applaud the choice of Stephen Spielberg to film this movie in black and white. It makes the entire war seem sinister, dark and intriguing. The tiny aspect of the movie in color, the young girl in the red coat is beautiful. Just that small thing made my mouth drop, it works really well.

In the end,Stephen Spielberg made a lot of excellent, top-notch movies. In my eyes, this one is his best. I don't think he will ever beat the degree this movie is in. If he does I will be flabbergasted. This movie blew me away.

Without any doubt in my heart, 10/10.",10
7 March 2008,Great Film,"I thought that the film was excellent, I thought it was a brilliantly realisation, fiercely controlled and restraint treatment of a true story, the film had a great atmosphere of a kind of documentary, harsh and compassionate and avoid sentimentality until the end. And felt as though Spielberg escaped the great and family films like E.T and Idiana Jones and was successful. Spielberg also does an uncommonly thing and keeps our attention for 185 mines. What I also liked was the rich black and white cinematography. The music helped move a lot of the scenes. I also liked the acting by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. I also feel that the film and the script are well constructed. I also liked the lighting when Schinder is at the party strobing across his eyes hiding the rest of his face. I liked the scene when all of Schindler's female workers were dropped of at the concentration camp, the scene when they were put in the showers, this scene was good but suspenseful with shot reverse shot from the screaming women to the shower heads as they thought that they had been put in the gas chamber. I felt that Spielberg kind of personified the gas chambers as though they were the real killers and the executioner and the Nazi's were just the jury. I also felt that another scene that was key was when Ralph Fiennes was going to kill that man behind the factory for not making enough door hinges and the gun jamming, as later on in the film Liam Neeson discusses with Ben Kingsley about the machinery have found to been faulty and he also made a point that he wants the weapons not to work, also with the scene later on we find out that the man is a Rabbi and so this could be that god was trying to save him, one of the officers said that it was impossible that all of the guns were jamming at the same time which made me think was the rabbi just plain lucky or was he being protected.",9

29 September 2013,The film that should be watched,"During World War 2nd, Nazi was persecuting Hebrew. In such a situation, there was a man. Though he was German, he sheltered a lot of Hebrew by employing them as workers of his factory. He is Oskar Schindler. This film shows the story about him and what we must not forget forever.

I have watched this film three times. When I did for the first time, I was an elementary school student. So then I couldn't understand anything about the film. But now I can and think it is worth watching so much, because it teaches us a lot of things that we should know. What Nazi did, of course, is very cruel and must not be repeated. We has to remember not only this but also people who did something merciful to help someone on the edge of death. They stand for justice, I think.

The film has a lot of terrible scenes, so it is hard to see them. But they represent what happened in the real. Therefore I tried not to miss the portraits and remember them.

Oskar Schindler is one of the people I really respect. If you don't know him, please watch this film.",
21 April 2001,A 10 is to little to rate it!!!,"Just simply one of the all time great movies! Liam Neeson performance,what can you say,but awesome. The scene at the end when he breaks down say he could have save more Jews alone earned him the Oscar. Ben Kingsley was also brillant. Ralph Fiennes as hateful as on screen villian,brillant! I1m not Jewish but I`m driven to tears every time I watch it.

11 November 2013,Breath-taking,"A masterpiece.

I don't give 10 because I'm not sure I understood all the story...

But I'm sure that this movie deserves it.

Despite the fact that it's in black & white (which is a bit harder to locate the scene), it is a great movie.

Not the best movie ever, but it's a really beautiful story.

Written very dramatically.

It has all the ingredients to figure in the Top 10 better movies of all mankind.

Liam Neesson is a great actor and Spielberg... Well, it's the best.",9
14 September 1999,One of the most important films in out time,"Schindler's List in my opinion one of the best films ever made - furthermore, it's a monument for all of those who did have to courage to do something good, however small.

Oskar Schindler was no stereotypical hero, on the contrary, he had many faults which were wonderfully portrayed in the film.

Strangely, the film - however serious it was - was entertaining, too, which is rather remarkable:

There seems to be a general belief in most of ""serious"" critics (and filmmakers) that a good, serious film with a difficult theme has to be unsuccessful - take a look at some film which critics did like, and you'll find a lot of commercial, unsuccessful, boring films, for example Fassbender's films.

If you take a closer look at the criticism uttered by some of ""serious"" critics, you'll note that they stick to the credo above - a ""good"" movie must not be a successful movie.

I've watched the movie 1994 and I'm not sure if I'm going to watch it again - it is till the present day the most moving, stirring movie I've seen - and the first (and only) only in which I've actually cried.

So, I've you're going to watch Schindler's List (which I strongly recommend), do yourself a favor: don't plan anything entertaining till the next day - I wasn't able to do so after watching it.

10 Points out of 10.

28 March 2017,A brief review of a long masterpiece,"This movie is a masterpiece, without discussion, but I know that many would say that I am overrating this movie. I would say no. Spielberg made this movie like it was a gift for somebody to remember a bad thing that happened in history, and not a good one whatsoever. His fingerprint is put in many well-known movies, but in this one, he left something more than this. He imprinted in our brains a great lesson of history, maybe one the most remarkable and... shocking. He taught us the bloody human behavior of people and its abhorrence for others like them, who have other religion but are the same inside. It is the best black and white movie I have seen so far and I truly recommend it for those who want to learn a piece of unforgettable history.

12 May 2004,A Film That Will Make Anyone Cry,"I cannot explain this film entirely. The only way to describe this film in one paragraph is, this film WILL make you cry. This film shows truely what the holocaust was hell, torment, and horror. This film does truely show how hellish this period of time was and after you see this materpiece you just simply cannot go back and see it a second time it just stays scarred in your mind forever. This film cannot be described as a film but instead as an art. This art has probally some of the most gruesome scenes that I will not talk about because of the horrors. Finally this masterpiece I think will always be remembered for years to come even if every copy of this film is, lost everyone will remember this masterpiece. If you have not seen this film then I say not suggest that you should seen this art.

25 March 2013,He Who Saves One Life Saves The World Entire,"I notice Schindler's List is a patchwork of stories retold through the eyes of Holocaust Survivors. This felt entirely appropriate and gives the film a unique perspective. Many outstanding WWII dramas have been made, but so few will equal this detailed, historically revealing one about those so directly affected.

Anecdotal encounters with German soldiers are re-enacted here: The young man who clears suitcases from a ghetto street, only surviving due to approaching Nazi Soldiers finding this amusing. A factory worker who survives only due to Commandant Goeth's pistol failing. The young boy stepping forward and pointing to an inmate the Commandant has just shot, informing him this was the chicken thief.

Only a Jewish film director should have made this film, and I wonder if it was a painful experience for Spielberg at some points? He deals sensitively with a plethora of barbaric scenes including German soldiers stripping inmates, or pushing them in frustration onto the mangled bodies of less fortune kin.

Spielberg does not veil the horror here. We see how heads explode when a 9mm Luger is discharged at point blank range. Not a fan of violence, I found myself forgiving the director here, because the destruction by Nazi Soldiers against unarmed civilians is evidential. The Nazis also tried hard to cover-up the extent of their War Crimes.

The screenplay tends towards the sentimental, but right at it's heart is a fascinating dichotomy of personality. The unprejudiced approach of Schindler in contrast to Commandant Amon Goethe's hate-driven, psychopathic one. Unfortunately, psychopaths thrived in Nazi Germany and it's evident Goeth (pronounced ""Gort"" in German) was responsible for thousands of deaths.

Personally, I believe Nazis hated the Jews because of the desperate poverty many Germans experienced after World War One. The building of the Extermination Camps (Auschwitz being one of them) was a twisted, yet banally logical step in the process of Nazis ensuring everything was taken from their chosen scapegoats... A defenseless, civilian population.

The Holocaust will remain one of humanity's deepest tragedies. We need to understand why it happened and Schindler's List helps us all do this. Those sacrificed for the sake of economic expediency was a hateful, unnecessary war crime.

I sobbed uncontrollably for the last 15 minutes of this film...

Favorite Film Moment:

Has to be when Schindler questions the use of a one-armed machinist. The superb Ben Kingsley as sober plant manager, Stern simply raises his hands saying: ""Very useful... Success!"" As Schindler drives away. Black comedy at its finest.

Favorite Performance:

Embeth Davidtz as victimized housemaid ""Helene Hirsch"" (who had to deal daily with the violent and unpredictable Goeth) is outstanding in her scenes. I cannot believe she did not receive an Oscar in this role. She deserved one - Despite being part of an impressive, solid cast.

Most Haunting Scene:

The now famous Girl In Red Coat Scene is one of the best pieces of film direction I have ever seen. That little girl wandering amid the bullets, confusion and murder is cinematic symbolism at its finest. The soundtrack changes to children singing during this part of the film. Spielberg shows us the affects of evil on the innocent with remarkable skill here. No corny dialogue, no over-acting. Just undiluted representation of the consequences of hatred.",10
26 May 2017,An amazingly powerful film,"This is an amazing film in every detail. The acting is emotional powerful and extremely convincing. I believe the choice to keep the film in black and white was a great decision, as it means you are focused on the story-telling and acting rather than colours (also when on rare occasions colour does appear, it really makes those moments stand out at the time, and memorable later). The black and white almost removes the 'life' from the film, which I found to be important in the storytelling. The music by John Williams is absolutely stunning, and Itzhak Perlman's violin solo of the main theme is so moving (especially when considering the meaning behind this story and his partly Jewish roots). I am always pleased when filmmakers attempt important and moving topics that the films come out well, and Spielberg did an exceptional job on this film in all regards (from the casting, to the cinematography, to the music). I will never not cry or be moved by this film.

10 June 2006,Stories and when I was in school,"For over (about)10 or 12 years of schooling before, during and after junior and High School including now, I have had so much understanding about of what happened in the 1930's and 1940's during the WW's, I came about that this film told me more than anything EVEN the behinds the Scenes. I do understood everything of what happened about Hitler's BS reasons and of the sacrifices from the Jews in that era of all of the killing for no reason for killing Jews. Nowadays we all know that Jews and other religions, we are all equal from our rights. But of talking about that movie, that gave away everything (because Spielberg was living through those years as well). He was very smart and wise for filming that movie.

1 July 2007,Courageous film from Spielberg,"Holocaust drama from director Steven Spielberg, with an intense, sweeping scope, a brave focus, and also some iconic movie-star gloss, with Liam Neeson lit up and photographed √† la Humphrey Bogart in ""Casablanca"". Despite this formulaic style, Neeson is very good playing Oskar Schindler, a decadent member of the Nazi party who nevertheless was a reluctant savior to some 1,100 Jews during WWII when he employed them in his factory, saving them from certain death in Hitler's concentration camps. Spielberg won a Best Director Oscar for the film, and he gets terrific supporting performances from Ben Kingsley, Embeth Davidtz, and most especially Ralph Fiennes as a despicable Nazi commandant. Some of the human terror depicted is frighteningly real, and even though the last act smacks of Hollywood grand-standing, the movie has unlimited power. Winner of seven Oscars in all, including Best Picture. *** from ****

21 August 2003,The horrors of History Retold,"In today's society, I feel that prejudice still exists in some form or another. I saw this film and was fascinated by the script Mr. Speilberg played out. What was interesting was the change of heart played out by Mr. Neeson. Here we see Schindler, who had a hatred for so long,suddenly gain conscience and then turn 180 degrees to be compassionate and caring. Mr. Kingsley had a great part as the assistant and friend.

If one asks for an educational film to teach about History, this movie is a great one.

18 September 2014,"I was speechless, not just by the story, but the whole movie itself","This movie is what I expect when I watch a best picture winner in academy awards.

""Schindler's List"" has managed to touch the sky. Legendary directing from Steven Spielberg, extra ordinary acting from Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes & every single one of the artists. Everything about this movie is so perfect. Film editing, cinematography, costume design, musical score, screenplay, everything deserve 10 stars out of 10.

The story is very touching. ""Schindler's List"" is set around German industrialist Oskar Schindler, who used Jew prisoners in Nazi prison camp in Poland as labors. If you don't know the story like me, ""Schindler's List"" will blow your mind. During the last half an hour of the film I was like, ""why don't the start the credit!""

27 June 2017,Near Perfection,"How did Steven Spielberg make this and Jurassic park at the same time. Spielberg has had some misses in his collection of films, but this is one of his best. However this film would not be the same if it did not have the outstanding cast it has. Liam Neeson in my opinion is incredibly underrated mainly because of films like the taken trilogy and the phantom menace, but his performance in this is so believable as Schindler. Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes also are amazing in this and very convincing.

This film is powerful in it's message and certain scenes could be hard for most people to watch, but this really happened to so many people in the second world war it's almost unbelievable as it's so extreme. I think this film definitely deserved all the Oscars it received as it is one of the most emotional and powerful films to ever be made.

It is very naturalistic and logical to make everything as objective and realistic as possible.

6 June 2014,The Dark Atmosphere,"This is the best movie about war I've ever seen! I think the best thing about it is the dark atmosphere, which is created by the deliberate use of no colours (except the ending when it fits). So this movie nearly feels like the original recordings, except with a higher quality and of course less brutal (especially when you think about the LEAN Jews in this time).

It's a very tragedy movie, which produces one important question: How much is a human worth? When you don't like this movie you seem to be impatient, unemotional or nearly a neo-Nazi...

Schindler's List is a classic, which has many very positive reviews, so I think I have nothing else to add.

18 March 2003,Spielberg's Masterpiece,"While trying to remember them off the top of my head, every other Spielberg film I've seen (with the possible exception of Saving Private Ryan) has been an over-sentimental crowd-pleaser. If you think about it, Schindler's List could well be accused of the same - it's all perfectly designed to tug at the heartstrings (especially the modern-day section at the end) and I've certainly never met anyone with a bad word to say about the film. The difference, the thing that makes Schindler's List different from all those others, is that no amount of schmaltz could diminish the power of Oskar Schindler's story.

Schindler's List is not a lyrical, wistful treatise on the horrors of war. For the most part it is a bone-crushingly upfront recounting of the personal and collective horrors faced by the Jews during the Second World War. Some of the more violent scenes are reminiscent of the opening from that other Spielberg classic, Saving Private Ryan. The difference is that while many of those in Saving Private Ryan became soldiers and put themselves in the line of fire by choice, the people in Schindler's List are innocent of any crime and absent of any choice. The indiscriminate killings and attitudes of most of the Germans, and particularly Amon Goeth (played excellently by Ralph Fiennes), chills to the bone, as does the well known appearance of the little girl in the red coat who provides one of the few splashes of colour in an otherwise aptly dark and dour film.

Oskar Schindler himself makes a transformation, from cold-hearted factory-owner using the Jews to make money into a man so disgusted by the crimes of his fellows that he puts his own life at risk to save others, that is so obvious and predictable that it should feel contrived. But it doesn't. And I have no doubt that there are other glaring faults throughout, but it would take a crass mind to even notice them, let alone write them down. The power and scale of this film (the amount of extras used is unbelievable, like one of Eisenstein's films) are the things that win out, and will continue to win out for generations to come. If Spielberg is remembered for just one film, it will surely be Schindler's List.",9
27 February 2008,Just 2 comments,"Just a few comments: Anyone saying here that Spielberg knows only Big Budget spectacular filming, obviously isn't aware of his Empire of the Sun or Color Purple. Both of these works go hand in hand with Schindler's list.

Anyone saying last scene (the ring) is fiction - I don't care - the scene is an emotional tsunami. The Schindler Jews stated in their interviews they don't care who he was or how he led his life - to them, he is an angel. I think the same. The man is a rare angel.

Also, the cinematography and the 40's heavy feel was never seen or surpassed before (or after), not even with Spielberg's Ryan.

15 July 2011,A pure utter masterpiece!,"Before I watched this movie I had heard a lot of great things about this movie, that it's Spielberg's best and one of the greatest movies ever made. And I have to say when I finally watched it, this was the only movie I knew immediately after that it was a pure masterpiece of film making. I knew this was a movie about the Holocaust, but I didn't know who Oscar Schindler was, so I had to do some research and saw he saved over a thousand Jews from Auschwitz. The movie started out a little slow, but It focused on different characters to build up depth and development. About an hour in I was so captivated by the realism and accuracy I couldn't look away even though it is very graphic and violent. The scenes in the prison camp were spot on, and each actor in this movie gave a flawless performance. Liam Neeson was perfect in the role as Schindler, and Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes were great as well. I'll end by saying this movie will open your eyes to the horrors of what happened in the Holocaust, but it will also give you a sense of hope.

8 October 2013,"Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire..","Based on a true story, Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List stars Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, a German businessman in Poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory.

Steven Spielberg directs this moving drama with an incredible amount of uplifting hope, which counteracts the realistically depicted violence revealed on screen. Spielberg maturely presents the film through an honest and sometimes disturbing lens, but it's completely necessary in telling the story with complete authenticity. The horror on display in this film exceeds anything I've ever seen, because of the painful reality. It sickens me as a person to know that this sort of thing actually happened and watching Schindler's List is not only an experience, but a history lesson that we should never forget.

Schindler boasts incredible, convincing performances all across the board. Liam Neeson gives a brave performance as Schindler. Like fellow Oscar nominee Ralph Fiennes, who plays evil Nazi concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth, Neeson is not afraid to play his character as written: in Neeson's case, an arrogant war profiteer who does not realize--until the very end--the enormity of his actions; in Fiennes's case, a human embodiment of pure evil and hate. Lesser actors would try to romanticize their characters to make them more pleasant to the audience. Fiennes and Neeson wisely chose not to take that route, and make an even more favorable impression than they would have had they tried to soften their roles. Ben Kingsley (as Schindler's accountant, Itzhak Stern), Embeth Davidtz (as Goeth's Jewish maid, Helen Hirsch), and Caroline Goodall (as Schindler's wife, Emilie) all turn in the type of performance that is easily taken for granted. They are so convincing that it is easy for the audience to forget that they are actors playing roles, especially since they are in the background. While watching Schindler's, the audience does not see actors acting in a made-up world; it believes it sees real people living in the real world.",10
11 May 1999,"A beautiful masterpiece on the horror, villains, and heroes of the Holocaust","Schindler's List is one of the reasons I am such a huge film buff. The film depicts the lives of Oscar Schindler and his wife, Ishtak Stern, Amon Goerth, and the survivors of the Holocaust. The movie, to my knowledge, is historically accurate. It touched me in a way that few movies have ever done. My favorite scenes are when Olek has to hide with Danka and the other children in the toilet, when the survivors place the rocks on Oscar's grave, and when Oscar cries ""I could've saved one more. Liam Neeson,Raiff Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley make their best performances, and all deserved Academy Awards. Schindler's List is a must-see for any movie fan.

19 May 2001,It's the best,"Since I was about eight years old, we got taught the history of the second world war in school and the holocaust was handeled with special care. Nevertheless, only after I saw Schindler's list, the fact that this really happened got through to me and I started realising the whole thing. It really impressed me (but I have to admit I had trouble staying awake at first because they started the broadcasting at about 11.15 PM and as we all know it lasts for over three hours) and I went trough a lot of trouble trying to get the video. But enough about that. It's my favourite (next to interview with the vampire) and Liam Neeson gained himself a place on my favourite actors list (including Al Pachino and Kevin Spacey). Too bad he didn't win the oscar; he's a great actor (sometimes he just makes the wrong movies). I thoink the black and white adds an extra dimension to the film; allthough I never would have recognised the read-coated girl whitout the sudden coulour-adding. Alltogheter, it's for as far as I've seen, the best Historical movie sofar.

3 July 2012,Very possibly the most important movie of all time,"I watch this movie on DVD once a year so that I can keep a grounded position towards life. Things go wrong, business deals fail, relationships break down but nothing most of us have to contend with come remotely close to what happened in the Holocaust.

This is a grim, bleak movie, no doubt why it was shot in B/W. But throughout it, until its dramatic postlogue, we see that hope can always exist. Good can overcome evil. Evil things can only happen if good people do nothing. And that surely was the story of Nazi Germany.

Everything about this movie is exceptional. We witness Schindlers journey of discovery from a smug, arrogant, greedy, amoral being to the ultimate saviour of 6,000 people, at great risk to himself. We see his people grow to love and respect him and perhaps even recognise that not all Germans are Nazi's.

While this film may be Liam Neeson's finest moment, the performance of the seriously conflicted Ralph Fiennes, as Amon Goeth,is the highlight for me. Has anyone better portrayed pure evil like this before? Yet like the portrayal of Hitler in Downfall we see something boyish and sensitive about him. We loath him but understand that he is not all completely bad.

I could go on about this movie; its superb acting, technical execution, screenplay etc but it has all been said before. Simply the best.",10
23 January 2023,only Spielberg could pull this off,"It would be easy enough to make a gruelling horror-fest film about the Holocaust; but it's not that surprising that nobody has actually done it (not in Hollywood anyway). Who would want to watch that? Here, although the cynical might scoff at the moments of Spielberg sentimentality (eg the girl in the red coat), and although it was a false step to have everyone put on Mittel-European accents, the director has managed to produce something in which, whilst it doesn't shirk the horror, the dominant and lasting impression is hope. It's a monument to the strength and compassion of humanity, Jewish and non-Jewish alike. And perhaps it's no coincidence that it is absolutely his most beautiful film, eliciting visual artistry of a level we might not otherwise have known he possessed. It brought the very best out of him.

(Obviously an old and very well-known film; I'm really only reviewing it to break my 'double Nelson' (222) of reviews.)

9 February 2006,"Powerful, Fantastically scripted, grabs life from the claws of death, stunning.","I have never seen Schindler's list in the comfort of my own home, i have recently finished watching it in school as a holocaust memorial. After seeing this film highly rated on IMDb i eagerly anticipated the watching of it, i was not let down. This is without a doubt the greatest of Spielberg's achievements in film making. It is beautifully brought to the forefront of the screen with care, devotion and stunning acting to portray the harsh reality that was taking place in under Nazi rule in the 1940's. Liam Neeson's performance stands alone as one of the greatest solo performances on screen for a long time. Neeson portrays the amazing man of Oskar Schindler with such regard for the qualities needed he becomes infallible in his role. It would be unjust to say that powerful scenes are lacking and are seldom shown, i feel some scenes create such emotion you feel for the characters involved.To briefly state why i felt this film deserved 9 not 10 is that i felt it just missed something, nothing significant but just something that could of brought this film towards perfection. It really strikes you that the scenes being portrayed throughout the film were real- life events, in some cases worse. I feel Schindlers list moral is in a small way similar to The shawshank redemption, the true film masterpiece, which gives a message of hope. I feel in Schindlers list this message is true to that of many Jews but also of how a man can change, how one person can change and do the most remarkable things. To finish of this review to give all credit to this film, to tell no lies this was the first time and probably only time i saw a class completely and utterly captivated by a film, which i feel in itself is evidence that this film is truly stunning.",9
10 February 2004,I cried,"No not the subject, we all know the story. This film to me and I stress ""To Me"" is perfect. I cannot watch it without crying. Crying with envy of the ability of the man. The sheer filmaking skill of this movie leavs me breathless. I could ramble on for hours and often do about this film. One day I hope I live long enough and I am lucky enough to meet SS in person. Just to thank him for the pleasure this movie has given me.

25 January 2002,Magnificent and Sublime,"Not only is this masterpiece the greatest film ever made, it can be considered one of mankind's greatest artistic achievements, to be compared with the best of Mozart, Shakespeare and Michelangelo. Using the subtle but startling shadings only black and whitecinema can produce Steven Speilberg has created a protean achievement both thought-provoking and shattering in content and scope. Ralph Fiennes portrayal of the concentration camp commandant shows the horrifying side of a human both sad and twisted. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give performances equally compelling. John Williams musical score is flawless, evoking an emotional response without overcoming this disturbing story about a German industrialist who slowly learns about the Holocaust and tries to save the few Jews he can from certain death. This miraculous piece of cinema should be required viewing for anyone interested in the human condition and the depths and heights to which we all can reach.

21 April 2017,The magic trick of Schindler's list,"It was the perfect story, the perfect backdrop to show the un-showable, to reveal the horror of horrors and Spielberg knew it. This man Schindler, this vain, greedy, con man, his transformation from a nobody trying to scheme the system, into one of the great heroes of modern times, is the magic trick that delivers the movie. How did it happen, how did this man of all people, throw a fortune away, and risk life and limb in the very heart of evil, that is the question. So many did nothing, so many did evil in the name of duty, so few heroes, but there were heroes, heroes of the type that saved humanity by showing even under the worst possible circumstances, mankind has the capacity to rise to the occasion. Evil is in abundance, and Schindler is outnumbered, but many heroes emerged in the holocaust, not just Schindler, many hid Jews, many spirited Jews to safety but few were as outnumbered and at the very heart of the holocaust as Schindler. How do you protect, and keep 1,100 people from being murdered, and do it all out in the open, only the best conman could have done it, its almost as if Schindler trained his whole life, all his cons, all his act and charisma finely tuned, just so he could pull off the greatest scheme of them all, tricking the Nazi's out of 1,100 Jewish souls.

While Schindler and Goth battle it out miles above the Jews like New Gods, one with the complete power of life and death over the Jews, the other working as hard as he can to save them. It is Itzhak Stern ( Ben Kingsley who is superb) who is the soul of the movie, the classy and dignified Stern is a Jewish man who overnight has lost his rights to be called human, the Nazis have stripped him of everything but that humanity, which he somehow manages to cling to.

It is through Stern that we see the transformation in Schindler, as first Stern will not even take a drink with Schindler by the end Stern looks at Schindler with an almost spiritual reverence reserved for the greatest of people. the reverence held for very very special people.

We see the slow transformation of Schindler, jump started by a fateful horse ride in the Polish countryside, it is here that Schindler first see's the little girl in the red coat, a beautiful angelic child relegated to extinction by Hitler and his monsters, this is the beginning for Schindler, the push, the horror is revealed to him. the second time he see's the girl in the red coat, she is among the dead in a wheel barrel full of corpses being wheeled to a fire to be incinerated. Her life snuffed out like a candle. This is the moment when Schindler knows he must act, that all the money in the world is worthless to a man who cannot sleep at night., or escape the guilt of not acting when so much depended on people acting.

From that moment on Schindler is relentless in protecting his Jews, the Schindler Jews, he overcomes every obstacle the Nazi's place in front of him, he bargains with the very devil himself, and wins. But not till the last day of the war, and even then can he rest. The Nazi's were relentless in their thirst for Jewish blood and Schindler had to be just as relentless.

A masterpiece and a historical look at Mankind's darkest hour, which will live for a thousand years as testament , the thousand years the Nazis thought their Reich, which ended in flame, destruction and the embarrassment and blight on the character of mankind. Thankfully there were men like Schindler to show the other side of what mankind was capable of, and can aspire to be.",10
20 December 2001,Moving,"This movie really made you feel for the people who were involved in this terrible ordeal. I wouldn't consider it to be one of favorite movies of all time, but mainly this is because it isn't my favorite type of movie. As a documentary I think it is superb and I highly recommend that others see it so that they too can see some of the atrocities that this world has seen and so we can make sure that this never happens again.

18 July 2008,A gritty and moving picture,"Schindler's List should be a punishment: a chastisement for not reading your textbooks properly about the Holocaust: a horrible genocide in which more than 6 million Jews were killed: an immense population. It gives us a very visual outlook of the inhumanity which was faced in the concentration camps. Taken like a documentary with black and white photography, Schindler's List is scary because it is real. There is also this chilling background music composition mixing Jewish hymns (very, very solemn) and another sad score by John Williams. I watched this in my history class in case you were wondering. So, should you watch this movie? I am not recommending it to high school students who've already read ""Night"" or learned in depth about the process of Hitler's ""Final Solution"" unless they find it interesting. In fact, I think ""Life is Beautiful"" is a more uplifting movie to watch in order to heal our sorrow after reading about Auschwitz and all those treacherous Jewish ghettos. Oh yeah, the actors in Schindler's List were brilliant: very convincing. The setting was brilliant. The ending was in my opinion the best part of the movie, so if you start watching it, don't stop during the middle because of the atrocities.",8
4 March 2000,ONE OF MY FAVOURITE MOVIES.,"Schindler,s List is the only Steven Spielberg film that I've ever really taken seriously. Tht three title roles are all played to perfection and the black and white only adds to its documentary style.

It captures the horrors of the holocaust from both points of view. Using both graphic violence and the dialogue between the Jewish victims to portray the insanity and horror.

Ralph Fiennes performance has to be the best of them all because he shows that you don't have to be a monster to do deeds of unspeakable evil.

Ahead of Goodfellas, Forrest Gump and Fargo as the finest film of this decade.

4 September 2004,The List is Life,"Adapted from the best-selling book by Thomas Keneally and based on a true story, filmed in Poland with an emphasis on absolute authenticity, Spielberg's masterpiece ranks among the greatest films ever made about the Holocaust during World War II. It's a film about heroism with an unlikely hero at its center--Catholic war profiteer Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), who risked his life and went bankrupt to save more than 1,000 Jews from certain death in concentration camps.

By employing Jews in his crockery factory manufacturing goods for the German army, Schindler ensures their survival against terrifying odds. At the same time, he must remain solvent with the help of a Jewish accountant (Ben Kingsley) and negotiate business with a vicious, obstinate Nazi commandant (Ralph Fiennes) who enjoys shooting Jews as target practice from the balcony of his villa overlooking a prison camp. Schindler's List gains much of its power not by trying to explain Schindler's motivations, but by dramatizing the delicate diplomacy and determination with which he carried out his generous deeds.

As a drinker and womanizer who thought nothing of associating with Nazis, Schindler was hardly a model of decency; the film is largely about his transformation in response to the horror around him. Spielberg doesn't flinch from that horror, and the result is a film that combines remarkable humanity with abhorrent inhumanity--a film that functions as a powerful history lesson and a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the context of a living nightmare.

Schindler's List is filmed in black and white, with one notable exception: a little blond girl running around in a red coat. This is where Schindler's transformation begins, and when the true horror of war, will sink deep and hit you hard as a moment you will never forget. The whole film has stuck with me for about 6 years now, and that one particualr scene(s) that involve the child, i'll never forget. Schindler's List is to me, a life altering experience, and is much more than a movie.

****/****",10
26 April 2000,Compelling true horror.,"Schindler's List grips from it's first moments and holds audiences far beyond the final credits. Spielberg documents Otto Schindler's success in saving many Jews from the horror of Nazi death camps. More importantly the film chronicles, in horrific detail, the nightmare that Polish Jews went through.

Thankfully avoiding sentimentality or romanticism Spielberg takes us into the gettos and camps, dispassionately observing moments of heartbreaking tragedy, we watch horrified as a young Jewish woman, an architect, is shot for being right, or as the camp commander 'plays' with the Jewish prisoners by shooting them from his balcony.

Shot in stark black and white (except for the final ten minutes) the film convies beautifully the worst and the best of humanity. One exceptional touch is worth mentioning; as Schindler watches, in black & white, the Jews being hearded from the getto, he spots a little girl in a red coat, the camera follows her until she is swallowed into the teeming crowds. Later we see the red coat on a lorry of disgarded clothing, but no little girl.

Spielberg has never been better and no Hollywood film has captured so accurately the human tragedy of the Hollocaust.",10
14 May 2020,The Most Human Movie Ever Made.,"This is simply Steven Spielberg's greatest movie. I dare you to challenge this. Sure, ET is great, and so is Jurassic Park, and so forth. But of all the movies Spielberg has directed, how can any of them top the power and importance of Schindler's List?

Schindler's List is the true story of Oskar Schindler, portrayed wonderfully by Liam Neeson. He is a German who saves the lives of over 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust. Schindler does this out of greed, making them low wage workers in his factory for his benefit, but then he does it out of compassion for his fellow man.

That's the theme of the movie that echoes throughout long after the credits roll, and from where the film's power stems. The Nazis considered Jews to be ""vermin"" and not humans worthy of love, care, or compassion. Oskar Schindler over time sees that they ARE in fact worthy, and uses this basic human value to change the world.

Steven Spielberg waited over a decade to make this movie. He wanted to it after making E.T., but he felt that he wasn't ready to tackle the Holocaust yet. (Note that Spielberg himself is Jewish.) The time he took is well worth it, since he crafted it so well.

The movie won 7 Oscars, including Steven's sole Best Picture win and his first of 2 Best Director wins(the other being for Saving Private Ryan). All 7 are well earned for this fantastic movie.

Spielberg also chose to shoot this in black and white, based on documentaries he saw with actual Holocaust footage. This was done to make the movie seem even more real, and this goal succeeds.

This was also done so a girl with a pink coat can stand out. While she never speaks, she inspires Schindler to have compassion for the Jews, she's a sight that speaks to him louder than words. In addition, the black and white cinematography is glorious to look at.

Since this movie is centered around the greatest tragedy in all of human history, the film gains an R Rating for it's realistic violence. Prepare for Jews to be shot, burned, or gassed for what they believe in. It's hard to watch, but it's the most effective quality. There were people who took pleasure in killing millions of their own kind, and Spielberg exposes this horror to perfection.

I first saw this in 10th grade in History class, so I was 16. I would say 15 or 16 would be the best age to see this, and 13-14 if there is parental supervision since younger teens may have questions about the Holocaust, and for emotional support. I say this because while everyone should see Schindler's List, it is not for the young, and historical prior knowledge is necessary.

Aside from the flaw of crimes against humanity, my only critique of Schindler's List is that the German accents of Non-German actors are so thick that I needed subtitles to follow the dialogue. Apart from this, Schindler's List is nothing short of a masterpiece.

Despite it's grim subject matter, Schindler's List must be seen, even if just once. Seeing it for the 4th time in my life put it in my top 10. Thank you, Oskar Schindler for your heroic act, and thank you Steven Spielberg for telling us his incredible story.

This is a powerful film that will leave a great impact on you. It should never be forgotten. If all but a few movies are wiped away from human memory, let Schindler's List be one that remains.

Note: This ties with Shoah in my top 10. This is a 9.5 hour documentary with real survivors and witnesses to the Holocaust. It's $100 from the Criterion Collection. This is another movie that I consider to be a must see, despite its cost and run-time.",10
4 January 2000,A film for all to see....and learn.,""" I....pardon you.""

These words spoken by Amon Goethe (Ralph Fiennes) during the film can be aptly used to signify the themes of this film: power and forgiveness.

I am part of the post war generation who has been lucky enough not to experience any major war. And after watching this film, I have deep respect and feelings for those who suffered during these times, be it the Holocaust or the Nam war. This film was just waiting to be made and I'm glad it was the right man who dared to take up the challenge. Any other person would not have done it justice.

The film focuses on how a German named Oskar Schindler saved the lives of thousands of Jews by employing them to work in his factory during WWII. However, I feel the film's primary aim is not to show us Schindler's kindness but the horrors of war. There are some of the most true and graphic scenes here ever captured on celluloid. People being shot for no particular reason, hiding in fear, stripped and gased, abused......so much so that viewers watching it for the 1st time will be deeply affected. We have never got to see this ""flip side"" of the war in many Hollywood productions which only focuses on action and their unrealistic ""gung-ho"" heroes. ( Another excellent film would be ""Saving Pte Ryan"" by Spielberg again ) War and its horrors are finally and faithfully recreated for the audience.

Like the film Raging Bull, its shot beautifully in black and white to reflect the era and tone of the film. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are excellent, esp the latter for his frightening protrayal of Amon Goethe. The scene where they discuss about power is a classic and the subsequent one where Amon 'pardons' a young jew remains as one of my many favs!",
5 May 2004,Pure Horror,"This is a horror film. Not a visual horror film but a mental and spiritual horror film. It drags out every kind of fear that can be expressed. It shows how not just one but two men can have an effect on a vast number of people. Hitler murdered 6 million Jews. Schindler saved 1,100 in the most trying of circumstances. As mentioned in one of the previous comments, it will not be long before the survivors of the holocaust will be gone and there will only be the memorials and films to remind us of the sickening atrocities that were carried out. This film serves as a learning guide to what can happen and an emotional journey beyond what most films can take you on. It should be shown to every child to let them know that the holocaust did happen. This is not a figment of someones imagination that was written and published. Within 6 years, 6 million were dead in those camps. What is more concerning is that there are countries still at war with families being torn apart. Have we learned nothing! I would tell anyone to watch this film. All the actors deserve recognition for the thoughtful but brutal approach they took towards this film. Another from Steven Spielberg that will not be forgotten

21 November 2000,A great film.,"This film is , without doubt of be wrong , the only ""serious"" film made by Spielberg (not for people without brain).It is one of the most human films ever made ,it is hard like the life is (exactly the opposite of all the other Spielberg's films),and show a great true :the mankind is bad by nature ....I'm sure that any other country would have done what Germans did,why?,because every human have the evil inside him...that's the great true about mankind...But there are good persons in all the places of the world, persons like Oscar Schindler ,who loose all his money saving innocent people of the worst possible die: in a extermination camp (the real name of camps like Auchswitz or Dachau ;not ""concentration camps""). The reason why I enjoy so much this film ,it is because make me believe a great true: not all the mankind is bad.

14 December 2000,Masterpiece,"The brutality of Nazi Germany could never really be captured fully in a movie. But, Spielberg does his best to be as brutal as possible, in a tale about such a great act of kindness and compassion, in a time and place where those words meant nothing.

The shocking events that took place are difficult to watch at times, but every person on earth should see this movie at least once in their life.

11 January 2005,worth seeing,"This film gets sucked up as fuel for propaganda by those in the west who continue to nurture the Holocaust industry for all it's worth. This film stays true to the filmmaker's desires, which is to present a quasi-historical, quasi-fictional account of the German incarceration of Jewish prisoners in WWII.

The film does a good job of depicting the dehumanizing treatment and mental torture, as well as the robbery of prisoners' personal effects.

The acting is very good and the pace is lively. For a long film, it's easy to watch.

It's good that there are films like this, but it's a pity that Hollywood hasn't made a similar film about the Palestinians who are holed up in the refugee camps, with Israeli occupation tanks and such surrounding them. It would make an interesting epilogue. Perhaps one day.",8
1 December 2004,Why is it brilliant?,"It's been asked, how could anyone not make a deeply moving movie about this subject? There may be a basis for that question, but what Spielberg did was also make a piece of amazing piece of film-making. Despite his phenomnal successes, it seems as if he was hiding his hand at what depths he could demonstrate. After years of awing and amazing us, he now had the skills and power to deliver a most potent work.

To be honest, I haven't seen it since it's initial release. Yet, what I do remember is that Spielberg was able to make a three hour film on the Shoah and make it move a brisk pace without letting up on its impact. That's why it is brilliant.

23 October 2005,a high praise of the spirit of capitalism,"I had avoided to see the movie for a decade. The Holocaust is so absolute an act of cruelty that it does not give good food for originality. I underestimated Herr Schindler, just as I naively underestimated Herr Spielberg. No other movie has so boldly approached a fundamental ethical controversy of this size. Was Herr Schindler a prudent man or a remorseless exploiter? Did he help or use his workers? Didn't he decide to save them only when realizing he would be hunted down by the Soviets? Schindler is depicted as the most human of humans - his conversation with Amon Goeth over the real meaning of power and control can easily be included in college syllabi. And yet being so human, he is neither good nor bad: there are forces beyond him - his greed and his love of life, that allow him neither to refrain from war-time profiteering nor to subscribe to the absurd legal degradation of the Jews into lesser beings (are they less kiss-able just because they carry the Yellow Star, would ask Schindler?).

But still, Schindler plays only the supporting role in his own story. The central figure is Itzhak Stern - the bookkeeper who turned himself into a voluntary slave to the arrogant Schindler in order to be able to protect his kin. The scene in which Stern was brought out of the train taking him to the concentration camp, and apologized to his boss for his absent-mindedness - he got arrested because he had left his work permit - is of true biblical proportions. What is the message contained in Stern? That salvation does not come by itself. Schindler's Jews did not beg for mercy, they negotiated with him on their own terms, they made themselves useful to him, they invested in their own physical preservation. So the movie is not about Schindler being a hero or not, it is here to prove that good has a price and we cannot expect salvation for free - a moral philosophy inherent to Capitalism and incomprehensible for both the feudal or the social welfare states in which benefaction from above, be it from the feudal lord or from the all-powerful bureaucratic state is conceived as the necessary condition for man's survival.",10
25 October 1998,everyone should see this film,"This is a hugely powerful, emotional film which everyone must and should see. Spielburg tackles the delicate subject matter with respect and yet brutal honesty which leaves little to our imagination. The impact of this film when you first see it stays with you long after it has ended. Neeson, Fiennes and Kingsly all give career defining performances. It's hard to imagine this film was made by the same guy who made ET. A masterpiece.

19 December 2011,A breathtakingly poignant masterpiece by Spielberg,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",
2 February 2008,"Must-see War Drama. Informative, emotional and inspirational.","I watched Schindler's List a week ago in U.S history class, and at first I thought ""Oh great!. I'm watching a movie on the Holocaust in black and white. How can this actually make me learn any more about the Holocaust than I have in a textbook?"" My teacher put the tape on, and the first hour was a boredom fest, but as the characters such as Stern and Schindler develop their personalities, the movie becomes inspiring and hooked. I then removed the ""boredom fest"" aspect of my thinking, and transformed it into ""necessary story development/build-up"" At first we think Schindler is heartless, but having a personality and morales, he experiences the death of Jews firsthand. Of course, seeing such mindless mass executions will boggle anyone's mind. Schindler, who happens to be rich off of the Jews in WW2, helps them. The first hour of the movie is devoted to making the last 2 hours as commiserable for the audience as possible- making us feel connected to Schindler's emotions. ""What if we were in his shoes?"" not only that, the movie is an excellent depiction of the Holocaust. Black-and-white does the film justice, as it gives the movie a ""WW2 feel."" If it were in complete color, it's effects would not have been as strong. Watch this movie if at all possible. Emotions cannot be depicted by learning about the Holocaust in a classroom- you are simply being educated about the facts. Schindler's List reinforces this classroom learning by supplying empathy with the facts. After reading about WW2, this is one of the few movies that are a must-see. The acting, directing and editing is marvelous. Only problem I had was the length of the movie.",9
22 March 2019,Great for those who fetishize the holocaust but don't want to think deeply.,"I reviewed this movie far more thoroughly back when I had a different account but I want to have one on my profile.

The basic problem with this movie for me is that it is not the movie it should me, not unlike Bird Box. It SHOULD be the story of Oskar Schindler saving some Jews but it's actually just an exhibition of the holocaust.

There's little plot and as much as I like the macabre of genocide, it gets tiring just getting death after death without much sense of plot progression.

It's smugly blunt about its deaths without giving any real reflection on why this atrocity is happening. Then there are incongruously lyrical monologues.

It's a simpering and ostentatious historical slasher that jacks itself off over genocide without any real depth or characterization, imaginative moments notwithstanding.

Also, this is in English and that's not OK. Why go to such depths to recreate a particular time and place but then ruin that illusion in such an obvious way? Doesn't the German language convey the tone so much better?

17 February 2012,Changed my life,"There are almost 1000 reviews about this movie but I still have to write mine. This movie changed my life. I firstly watched it when I was 14 and it was the most powerful movie I have ever seen. I cried several times during the movie. Everybody should see this movie. It's universal and gift for all generations to come. Acting wise R. Fiennes's performance was one of the best I have ever seen and he deserved an Oscar for it.Liam Neelson is great as well very subtle in his performance. I believe entire cast was great. Excellent actors who played their parts with passion and devotion.Some ppl don't like the black and white picture I believe it created perfect atmosphere in the movie. If you haven't watched you must at least once in your life

5 January 2002,An awful story told in a brilliant way...,"I have to say this movie is one of those who have really touched me deeply. Imagine thousands of people being ""slaughtered"" because:

1. Their beliefs were/are different than others. 2. They had plenty of fortune. 3. They ""looked"" different. (Did they?).

Sounds stupid doesn't it?

Then imagine that all of this has actually happened for real, and that the reasons were among those that i have mentioned.

It is a horrible movie, but yet a masterpiece that we need to see to be reminded so that this does never happen again. I truly admire Oscar Schindler for what he did.

This is Spielbergs best movie ever, and he will probably never make a better one.

24 December 2001,A ray of light shining on the darkest page of history,"Steven Spielburg finally proved to everybody that he is indeed a great director. We see here a movie that cannot be describes with simple words. What, I believe, gave this movie its soul is that fact that the director and his crew truly dedicated this remarkable feat to the victims of the darkest pages of history. Frightening as the scenes were, so was its message of final redemption. Concentrating on the few who survived rather than the millions who perished was indeed a dangerous step that could have offended many. And yet Steven pulled it off. Through the survivors he honoured the dead. Such complex feelings I had never felt at the movie theatres before. More words are useless.

16 August 1998,Almost the movie Spielberg was destined to make...,"Don't get me wrong, this was a magnificent film, which portrays an accurate picture of the horror and inhumanity of Hitler's Germany. However, Spielberg still does not make the film he should have made. Granted Schindler was a hero and a legend for his humanity, although his motives at first were those of profit. Eventually he found his own humanity and redemption. As a Jewish director Spielberg felt obligated to make a Holocaust film. Why he didn't make a film focusing on one or more Jewish families struggling to survive is beyond me. As the son of Holocaust survivors I have heard first-hand accounts of the unique struggles and tortures endured, and every story I've heard is touching, horrifying and wrenching. One day a powerful Hollywood director is going to make a real Holocaust film. It may not be Spielberg, but someone will. It is also possible that Schindler's List is the closest thing Hollywood will permit to portraying the graphic horror of the Holocaust. I still remain hopeful. Steven Spielberg is one of the most amazing directors ever and deserves a great deal of credit.

14 February 2010,This is Schindler's List: the Great and Terrible,"Schindler's List is a dual film. I have seen it twice. The first time, I thought it was grossly overrated and won its awards only because it was a Holocaust film. This was because my grandmother and cousin were talking the whole time. I saw it the second time because my friend wanted to see it and I figured if there were ever an opportunity to give it a second chance, then was as good as any. Good thing my friend is quiet. I watched the film without distraction and now admit my initial feelings for it openly and ashamedly, and I both regret and rejoice in my decision to watch it again. Schindler's List is a masterpiece, a brutally honest portrait of the darkest and most despicable chapter of human history that seizes the heart with a black hand and shatters it as each crack of gunfire cuts off the life of another innocent man, woman, or child. I cannot ever watch it again, unless I am showing it to someone who has never seen it. It is the tale of one man who saved hundreds from the undeserved wrath of the Nazis. Oskar Schindler was and forever will be a hero, and this testament to his courage captures every aspect of it, great and terrible. I hate to clich√© such a work of art, but out of ten, I give Schindler's List eleven.",10
2 January 2023,Remember,"What can I say: sublime narration, substantial characters, spotless cinematography, and soul-stirring violin. Despite being a vital historic recount of the Holocaust, the movie itself as a drama is also beyond excellence. Seeing Amon's capricious animal-treating brutality, snowing ashes of burning corpses, and innocent children soaked in feces, it's impossible for any person of heart to not feel mournful, disgusted, or enraged. It will be difficult to find another fictional film that displays this tragic part of history as accurately as Schindler's List, while also bearing a complete and convincing main plot. However, I have to admit, the transformation of Schindler from a heartless entrepreneur to a benevolent messiah just through the witness of one ghetto massacre is a little sudden.

24 June 2015,"This movies is the answer to, why movies are powerful medium","I am from India. I am interested to see path breaking movies in any language. I watched many Hollywood movies in my laptop. After I saw/heard good review about this movie. I got this movie from one of my friend and I copied to my personal laptop, its been around 7 years I kept this movie in my laptop without watching it. I apologize for that. whenever I open this movie, the beginning scenes were not fascinating to me, that why I turned off and switch to other movies. 2 days before I decided to watch this movie without any distraction. I started watching at midnight 1 o clock. and I finished it around 5 o clock. I felt very guilty for not watching this movie for 7 years. But actually it was 22 years if I calculate from the year movie released.

What a movie !! I never felt this much emotional for any foreign language movie. But this movie touched my soul. I could not control tears rolling out of my eyes.

This is not a movie. This is lesson to everybody. And it shows what one rich man can do this to the world. We wont find any rich man like Oskar Schindler in todays world. He was rich at his heart. The moment Schindler started to realize the urge to help the Jews are really wonderful, only god like human can do it to them. I personally believe Gods are living in the world in form of men like Schindler.

About Spielberg, only Spielberg could create this much of emotional as he is Jew.

At last, movies like these are essential to make our world better. After watching Schindler's List I started feeling all the entertainment movies are crap.

If we deliver more number of movies like Schindler's List, our world would become full of wonderful people.

Finally, I prayed to God for Schindler's family for having person like this in their family. I bow down my head and thank to Oskar Schindler for this bravery to save mankind. And thanks to Spielberg to made this movie.",10
24 June 2003,Amazingly moving,"I saw this film originally in 1993 and have just recently watched the video. I did not truly appreciate the brilliance of this film ten years ago. If you have seen THE PIANIST which was a marvelous epic struggle of a single individual, take a look at this film about the struggle of 800 which is truly Spielberg's most amazing work.

The most incredible fact is that there are less than 4000 Jews remaining in Poland today, while there are 6000 decendents of those whom Schindler managed to save.

This film will insure that we never forget him or what he did in the name of humanity. It simply must be transfered to DVD as soon as possible.

22 January 2016,Masterpiece,"The movie is one of the fewer biography movies that I have recommended to others.

The portray of each and every character is spectacular. Liam Neeson's acting was no less than a pure portrayal of shear reality. He depicted each and emotion with all its perfection. From an unconcerned person to a emotional being with so much humanity is the real transformation showed by him. The difference between what you can do and what you should do is the best thing shown the movie. Though a biography still all the additional factual details are also so minute that you can not differentiate.

Spielberg is a gem of cinema.

7 August 2004,Spielberg's Finest Work,"There is a reason Steven Spielberg is a household name. He is, quite simply, the greatest director in the history of the medium. He understands film and how it works, but more importantly than that, he understands his audience. he understands how he can best communicate the story he wants to tell to the masses, without sacrificing truth and his own identity. Schindler's List is a glowing testament to that fact and it is Spielberg's finest work to date. Do I ever think he'll surpass Schindler's List? It's possible I suppose, but I think the story was so personal, that he won't really want to. This is Steven Spielberg's Magnum Opus.

There are conflicting truths about Oskar Schindler and what type of person he was. When you compare the movie to what his family say about him, there are small inconsistencies. Before I had seen the film I had heard both sides of the argument and felt fairly safe in feeling that both sides of that man were represented on screen. The business man, and the savior. I think the film portrays him as a business man who doesn't really understand the good he's doing until it's almost done. I like that. That's truth. That's human. That's who I'd bet Oskar Schindler was.

Looking back on the film, I'd say it's one of the best looking films I've ever seen. That's not to say it's pretty. It's high contrast Black and White was an inspired choice. I'm partial to Black and White anyway. There's something mysterious and nostalgic about it. But the lighting and cinematography by Janusz Kaminski (his first collaboration with Spielberg) are a glory to watch.

I particularly liked Liam Neeson's performance as Oskar Schindler. It was quiet and reserved until it needed to be loud and booming. I liked how he was able to shift character to blend with the Nazis then right back to dealing with his workers. It was a very nuanced performance. One of his best.

All in all Schindler's List is a powerful film about saving lives. One man spends all his life making a fortune, then spends every cent of it to bring safety to 1,100 Jews. That is beauty. Within Schindler's List there is a small bit of dialog about what power actually is. Honestly the answer doesn't come until the end of the film.

Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.",9
18 April 2015,A real masterpiece war history,"Although I had heard and read some of the best reviews for this movie, I have to admit that, initially, the first hour of this film seemed boring to me. Then I realized that the facts on that part of the film had to be referred so that we can understand and connect right the facts of the entire story. The interpretation of the main characters was of course astonishing. The murders and executions of the German Nazi were just as they had to be, not fake or incorrect. The finishing of the film was one of the best parts or scenes as the reality meets the directed. It is surely one of the greatest films in the history of the cinema and everyone should watch this because humanity, honesty and justice are honored.

It is a nearly flawless motion picture with impact that lasts long after the movie ends. Spielberg's storytelling techniques continue to amaze me and Schindler's is the film that he will be most revered for in the centuries to come.

23 February 2015,The Shark in a Glass Bowl,"Without Spoiling the film, I would like to describe the film as the shark in a glass bowl, that protects the goldfish, from the shop keeper.

An amazing tale that will keep you on your toes, an unexpected story of a man with power and prestigious. A story that will touch your heart, and deliver an impacting desire to help humanity around the world. Schindler's List is a must see for our current generation that is lost in the multi media realms of technology. The story teaches us to maintain a connection with our own humanity. To realize that life is a precious gift that is worth more than gold and other physical desire.

When I first saw the film as a teenager in my junior year in High School, the film taught me to be aware of the lives of others. The fact that the film had the ability to share a message was fantastic. Yet it was also able to provide a different perspective to the war. The cinematics in the film was extraordinary. I enjoyed many of the close ups that painted a picture in my mind and helped build an idea of the characters.

I truly recommend the film to anyone who enjoys WWII drama.",10
17 July 2004,bought a tear to my eye,"There were a lot of war films made that were focused on the holocaust or shoah, but there are probably none that iv seen or heard that come with in reach of the effectiveness, power and shear touching emotion of schindlers list. I'm not one to cry over a film, (in fact i don't think i ever have) but on more than one occasion during this film, tears came to my eyes.

I think the reason that schindlers list is so effective, is that it feels so real, instead of simply showing you the holocaust, it puts you right into it. You feel the pain and suffering felt by those in the film. You feel guilty about sitting on your comfortable sofa munching on your big tub of popcorn, watching so many people suffer.

The effect of the black and white picture is that it makes it even more real as most of the footage from the holocaust is in black and white, it also allows you to pick up a few small but vital details.

It the soundtrack is moving and deserves all the praise and awards it got.

Recommended; to people who take an interest in the holocaust or spielberg films in general

Not recommended; to people who don't like films that are sad or make you cry, this is definitely not going to be your scene.

29 January 2006,One of the few films that physically moved me,"As I am a 46-year-old male, there are few if any films that have been able to physically move me to tears. The realism and format are the absolute highlights to Spielberg's work here. But the overall sense of pain and anguish are the storyline that so many people missed that rated it less than five stars. I could expound forever on this film but just want to share my reactions. At the end of this film, the pain I felt could only be compared to the similar emotional exhaustion I felt when I was going through a divorce that involved losing my children. The uncontrollable emotion that poured out was frighteningly similar. The tears would not stop flowing. This film brought me to my knees emotionally and I will never forget it, ever.

Thank you Steven.

25 February 2017,A magnificent story in a beautiful cinematography,"This movie leads us through a dark side of world war 2. It shows us the horrors of the Holocaust without being too shocking nor ignoring the reality. The movie's running time is quite long (over 3 hours) but still the story line and the cinematography can capture us within the movie with ease. The cinematography is original with it's choice of black/white colours with some rare colours that gives meaning in emotional scenes. A real masterwork that should be seen!

1 November 2003,So many great films by spielberg - But this is the best one.,"Steven Spielberg directed a lot of the best films in history, such as: E.T,Close Encounters Of The 3rd Kind,Jaws,Jurassic Park,Saving Private Ryan,Poltergeist,The Color Purple,Raiders of the Lost Ark,Minority Report.....and the list just goes on and on....

But in my opinion ""Schindler's List"" is the most important masterpiece Spielberg ever made(and it's not because i am israeli..). The acting is breathtaking(especially from Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth)and the black & white motive is outstanding... But the real issue here is the true horrible story of the jews in europe of the 1940's.. U can see in this film the true horror and humiliation that the jews had suffered.

Truly Spielberg's best work with a very important lesson.. 10/10

17 January 2015,"A Beautiful, Haunting Masterpiece That Will Stick With Me For A Long Time","Out of all the movies I've seen in my lifetime, Schindler's List will always be a staple in my mind. The first time I watched it, I was just left in complete silence as the closing credits began to role. After the movie was completely finished and cut to black, I realized that I had watched what I consider to be the greatest movie ever made.

This movie really is an experience. Not only does it suck you into the time and place which it is set in, it makes you feel like you're there experiencing it all. You feel like you are here witnessing these events take place. The violence feels real, and the hand-held camera sequences give a reality and a look of how it must have felt to be there during this dark time in our nation's history. It's powerful and hits hard, especially during the liberation of the ghetto and the ending where we see Schindler break down because he feels like he could have saved more lives.

Liam Neeson gives what is probably his best performance still to this date as Oskar Schindler, and you really see his evolution as a character and his change in view as he watches the violence committed against these people. In the beginning he doesn't seem to care; he simply sees them as an opportunity to make money off of business. But as he sees these events unfold, and as we watch them as well, you see how much this impacts him, particularly when he sees the girl with the red coat in one of the movie's most famous scenes. Ben Kingsley also gives a powerful performance as Itzhak Stern, Schindler's adviser, and Ralph Fiennes gives a stunning performance as the menacing, hateful Amon Goeth, a merciless SS Officer. There are also some fine performances sprinkled across the supporting cast and many of the Jewish characters, and there is not a single poor performance here.

Some may feel that the 3 hour running time will be monotonous, but Schindler's List completely captures the viewers' attention throughout the entire motion picture. The situations these characters go through, the characterization of Schindler and Stern and their collaboration together, and simply seeing the brutality and merciless nature the movie depicts are all enough to keep one occupy, not to mention move them emotionally and thoughtfully. The black and white cinematography looks beautiful and helps with putting you in 1940s Poland, and the script and dialogue are so perfectly written by Steve Zaillian. Not to mention Steven Spielberg's direction on this is flawless. He pieces everything perfectly together, wraps it up in a bundle, and gives us an absolute masterpiece of a film.

Schindler's List is my favorite film. There has not been a single film that compares to my experience watching it. There has not been a single movie that has moved me and left me speechless like this movie has. The only movie that has come close to impacting me like this was Alfonso Cuaron's Children Of Men, and even that by comparison doesn't add up to how Schindler's List impacted me. I know some people will say ""You need a movie that you can watch over and over again that is fun and enjoyable. How can you have something so depressing as your favorite movie?"" Some will even say it's too obvious a choice. Well, you know what? It is an obvious choice, because it is obvious that this is a powerful, beautiful, and incredible film experience that excels in pretty much everything it has to offer. It's an incredible achievement and I can't wait to watch it again. Well done, Spielberg.",10
29 June 2020,In The Midst of a Human Catastrophe,"There is little praise that I can heap onto Schindler's list that has not been given previously. Most people familiar with the movie know the basic storyline about a German industrialist who uses his amassed fortune to save over 1100 Jews. Everyone also knows how good this movie is--that it takes Holocaust drama to a new level of realism and detail that make it irresistable.

I would rather talk about the effect that this movie has on the viewer. Schindler's List is so incredibly real that you feel like you are almost part of the drama. This is a scary fact because frankly, the last place that you would ever want to be in 1942 are the locations of this movie. Be prepared to have feelings of genuine terror, abject dispair, utter disbelief, anger, and above all, disgust. You will feel like the Nazi's are about to shoot you, you will feel like your own daughter is about to be taken away from you by murderers.

It is an amazingly useful experience to watch this movie, because frankly, we should never ever forget what happened in the historical time period that was depicted. That said, make sure you are psychologically stable enough to handle this movie, because the Devil is right there on screen in front of you.",10
21 January 2016,Wow.,"This movie has left me at a loss for words. This is a beautiful film and not just a film, but a work of art. The acting was incredible, the shots, the story, the dialogue, all incredible no doubt about it. The soundtrack to this thing is just as good as the movie. I'm sorry. I feel stupid writing this because there's nothing to say about it. It's beautiful. The Holocaust has really become a bit numb in the last couple years, dare I say decades but watching this I felt disgusted. It's f**king brutal. I really can't think straight after watching this movie so me trying to organize my thoughts is near impossible.

10/10 - Masterpiece. Just watch it.

6 June 2020,Still as brilliant as the first time,"When I saw this I was 14 at the time of release. I can remember having no desire to see this movie but was dragged to it by my family. The idea of watching a black and white movie seemed boring AF. What I saw astounded me and changed my very perspective of not only this kind of movie but what had happened during the war.

The acting, directing, cinematography, music, everything was so brilliantly done I was at a loss for words. The only use of colour at the very beginning and ending was powerful but the red jacket; beyond words.

Liam Nielsen not winning an Oscar for this movie was a terrible waste and he dang well deserved to win.

4 March 1999,Profound meditation on good and evil,"Steven Spielberg showed he could make grown-up movies with this powerful drama about the Holocaust and about one of the handful of people who tried to save Jews rather than kill them or allow them to be killed during this time. It's unflinching in looking at the nature of good and the nature of evil. The good is represented, at its most unlikely, in the form of Oskar Schindler, a womanizer, boozer, charmer, and money-grubber who nonetheless manages to do one good thing and save over a thousand lives. Contrary to what some people have commented, he is not presented as a saint, but as a complex, enigmatic human being, and Liam Neeson plays him that way splendidly. I do agree the scene where Schindler wishes he could have saved more feels misguided, but that's my only complaint about the film.

On the other side of the coin is Ralph Fiennes, in an absolute chilling portrayal, as Amon Goeth, who represents evil here. Yet like Schindler, his is not a simplistic portrayal, but is someone who doesn't feel anything, except contempt and maybe a little greed. He kills not out of pathology but rather out of boredom. The only time we see any feelings come over him is when he decides, as an experiment, to spare people who do wrong, rather than kill them, and it shakes him, so he goes back to killing. Also he's undone by Helen Hirsch, his maid, so he lashes out at her even more than if it was just some servant. The genius of the movie is to see him and Schindler as closer than we would like to think. Also, Ben Kingsley is very good.

Spielberg was trying to bring the reality of the Holocaust to people who didn't know about it, and maybe were being bombarded by all the hate groups who are spreading a disinformation campaign by saying it never happened. And I think he suceeded brilliantly.",10

2 May 2004,One of the best films of the 90's,"Initially presented as capitalistic and crude, Schindler's character gradually evolves into one of benevolence, and finally, humility. The film is shot entirely in black and white, with the exception of one character. A little girl wearing a pink jacket, which we see only twice in the film. It is that little girl, and the thought of what surely must happen to her, that sticks in one's mind. The two fleeting glimpses we get of this girl are more heart-wrenching than anything else in this film. This is not only an historical film;it has modern relevance as well. There are monsters among us, and poverty and ignorance are their life's blood. Overall,I give the film a 9. It's truly hard for a film to rate a 10 with me, which is the way it should be.

26 July 2013,"Disturbing, incredible, but...","I thought this movie was insanely wonderful. It was horrifically accurate and painfully real. The actors were all phenomenal. However, for being a movie about one of the most tragic events in history, there was too much sex. Granted, there wasn't actually a lot, but the unnecessary female nudity of Schindler's sexual partners was a tad distracting. I was hoping to watch a GOOD movie without any need to show women's bodies in a sexual manner. Besides that, it is really amazing and I recommend it to anyone who loves a heartbreaking yet eye-opening movie. Please don't get angry with me for being an arrogant feminist who ""doesn't understand the moral"", because I certainly do. It just made me uncomfortable. Although not extremely gruesome, the violence is unforgettable and shocking at times. Still an excellent film.

18 January 2022,one of the hardest movies to watch yet one of the most important moves made,"There are not many movies as hard to watch as Schindlers list and im a fan of horror even what ppl call torure porn ive know to like a hostel or even a cannibal holocaust but watching the real Holocaust is so much worse then some really well shot effect and knowing that a whole country turned there backs while a group who felt they were superior so that gave them the right to kill them 6 million men, woman, and children, murdered for no reason then there race and when you learn Hitler got alot of his ideas from the USA and how we treated Black men and women its just so wrong yet this kind of hate is still around all you have to do is turn on the news and there it is!! We have advanced in so many ways yet still are stuck with petty hate over skin color or what we call our God and which one is the true God ect ect !!!!!! Anyways movies like this show how disgusting and wrong those kind of actions are and its important to never forget this kind of hate.

30 May 2002,frighteningly realistic,"Reading some of the other comments i noticed that the only reason the film is EVER criticized is because of the fact that 1. It doesn't say how the war started blah blah it's just about the poor old Jews and 2. they always make the Germans the bad guys.. well i have much to say about that but first of all.. this isn't a STORY ABOUT HOW WWII BEGAN. It's a story about how one man saved hundreds of lives and countless generations. And about the 'poor old Jews'... More than 7 million jews were killed during the Hacaust. A period of less than a decade. Even if this many had died in a century, it's still unbelievable. So maybe, yeah, they deserve a movie showing what happenned. Also, I know it's unbelievable, but you'd be surprised at how many people don't actually know about the Halocaust and how much more you can learn from this movie than by staring at digits in a text book. The deaths begin to actually mean something. Each person who was murdered was a PERSON. Many people fail to understand that. That may be because it so incomprehensible.

Also, about the Germans always being the badguys.. obviously in this case, in this movie.. THEY ARE... The director isn't going to make the nazis Canadian or something just so the Germans won't be offended! This period in history REALLY did happen, sickeningly enough, and people will just have to get used to it. So for those who gave this movie a '1' aren't seeing what this movie really is. There's a reason why this movie is the top 10 of all time... on any list.. Some people are just too ignorant and blind to see it.

This is what a real movie is.",10
29 March 2013,Holocaust vividly came alive,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",9
29 August 2001,An Incredible Experience,"Schindler's List is as incredible a film as we are likely to come upon in American cinema. The story of the opportunistic Oskar Schindler's metamorphosis from greed to generosity is truly as powerful as it gets. Taking Polish Jews into his metal working factory as cheap labor, he initialy takes advantage of the people. The opening of the film is laced with wit and Schindler's magnetism. In a crucial turning point, he witnesses the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto and the movement of the people to a forced labor camp run by the vicious and puzzling German commandant Amon Goeth. From this point on, Schindler is forever changed and does whatever he can to help the Jews.

Schindler's List has an incredible script, full of wit and humor at certain points, then sadness and humanity at the next. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are exceptional in their roles as Schindler and Goeth respectivly, but the standout is Ben Kingsley as Schindler's quiet Jewish accountant Izshak Stern. His growing subtle passion and strength make the last scene with him simply beautiful. John Williams, better known for his booming musical companions to Spielberg adventures, delivers a score of beauty equal to the film. The cinematography is brilliant beyond description, it must be seen to be believed. Steven Spielberg should have won two Best Director awards for this film.

The movie urges the audience to never forget the horrors of the Holocaust and the reality of its destruction. Despite the tragic situation of the Jews and Schindler, the film is also uplifiting. Schindler's achievement outweighs the merciless killings by Goeth despite the lopsided statistics. Somewhere around 1400 Jews escaped death thanks to Schindler, and the lives he saved will always triumph over the Nazis. As Stern proclaims in the heartwrenching finale, whoever saves one man, saves the world entire.",

30 December 2014,Beautiful,"Schindler's List is the most significant and the most touching movie I saw. We recall the hell of war ... Liam Nesson is absolutely masterful. I personally saw this movie only once, a few years ago, I wanted to share my experience with my darling praising the film, but the horror of war 39-45 is a life event Co does not support that it was impossible to make him agree to watch this movie, despite my many attempts. Probably she lived a bad experience in a previous life. It is true that these events are really remarkable, the sensitive souls will have a hard time cashing them. Moreover it is not colorized version, it is absolutely plunged in the heart of the story. It will be understood in my comment that I loved this film is simply because in leaving the movie theater, the film belongs to those who marked me ... a movie to watch absolutely.

19 April 2022,Impressive,"Such an impressive movie to watch, so beautifully made. It showed the horror of the war in a raw way and the insanity of how some of the people alive back then behaved (like Amon Goeth early in the morning shooting people who weren't working just because he could and felt like it). Liam Neeson's performance was so good too.

The most impressive scene of the movie is actually the final shots at the end, of the survivors laying stones on Schindler's grave.

It's a hard movie to watch, but it's a beautiful movie and important for us to watch and remember those horrible times, so we may hope to never go back to such times.

15 May 2015,Masterpiece. Does it even need saying?,"Precious little to say about this masterpiece. It depicts everything with raw, meticulous, explicit simplicity -- the unthinkable suffering of the Jewish people, the inhuman cruelty of their oppressors, the heroism of some and cowardice of others... It is the perfect juxtaposition of the very depths atrocity and the light of kindness and empathy and altruism and hope. ""I could have saved one more."" Gets me every time. Liam Neeson did Schindler justice. We see the compassion develop in his face and it is amazing. In short, you cannot die without watching this film. P.S. Itzhak Perlman is my idol and to have John Williams come up with the music for him was sheer magic.

22 June 2008,Never Forget!!!,"There are many horrible things what happened with us human beings since we are on this planet. Crimes, wars, terror, fear and death illness sickness everywhere. The most things in our history are forgotten because it's too lot for us. But, some things are still here in our mind and life as a brutal portrait about what humans can do with ourself. One of these happenings are the World war I-II. The terror and brutality was never so perfect and planed. The story of the Jew's and other innocent nations between 1939-45 is never to forget. Steven Spielberg one of the best directors our time made an unforgettable masterpiece with Schindler's List in 1993. The story of Oscar Schindler the businessman who saved more than 1000 Jewish life at the end of the German terror is more than a movie. It's a documentary of years full with pain, fear and death. We can clearly see what happened in Europe and most in Poland until WWII. Spielberg's directing art in his most touching movie is phenomenal. The cinematography with the beautiful heart touching music of John Williams and the powerful acting with names like Ralph Fiennes, Liam Neeson and of course Ben Kingsley made an excellent work. Everyone should see this to never forget and maybe understand what can happen when mankind goes crazy.And if you can go to Poland, You should visit Krakow and the place where the Jewish ghetto was in Kazimierz. Or simply travel to Auschwitz where You can see everything what happened. And if You are there, visit the unforgettable memorial museum in Birkenau too. You'll return with something special in Your mind and heart. It's called love and piece...",10
20 December 2003,Very disturbing,"When I was younger, I lived in Holland for a while, which is where I saw this movie when it came out in the cinema. Holland was very much in the thick of things during the war, so I had learned all about the horrors that happened there during history classes. I would say I was awed by this movie, although that is perhaps not the right word. Shocked definitely, and saddened too. I watched it again last year, and although the impact wasn't as strong, I still thought it to be very powerful, and deserving of an 8/10

20 July 2008,"Watch, Cry, Feel and Think","I cried cried and am typing this with tears not fully dry. How is it possible for man to feel such contradictory emotions.

Steven Spielberg tribute to the JEWS through this film is immeasurable. Not only does it make us understand the historical perspective of the War, it gives us a glimpse of Human cruelty towards his fellow men.

The movie achieves what it is meant for- the question of ""why War?"", questions to pounder around.

Schindler saved the most important commodity on earth- Lives. War is cruel, it brings evil but it also raised a Hero, a flower in the midst of thorns.

Emotional and heart rending...

The stone kept on Schindler grave by the surviving Schindler Jews (before the closing of the movie)was simply the most realistic touching emotional translation of cinema to reality...",9
23 January 2001,My second favourite movie of all time,"Schindler's List is one of the best movies ever made, for many different reasons. I could repeat what has already been said on this list about the brilliant acting, direction and cinematography. But you already know all that stuff. What makes the film great for me, though, is the way it shows humans at their truest, improvising and scrounging to survive. This is what life is all about: trying to stay alive no matter what the circumstances around us.

The film is amazing in its restraint and subtlety. It would have been so easy for the movie to step on a soapbox and tell us all about the negative factors that led to the Holocaust. Instead it simply depicts one little corner of that massive evil, and shows how a few people outsmarted it, and did survive. The film trusts our own intelligence, and lets us draw our own conclusions about why Schindler changed, and also what the Nazis were like. Another thing I loved about the film is that Spielberg resisted the temptation to paint the Nazis as mindless villains. Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth is seen as having the same passions and mannerisms as Schindler himself. But somewhere along the line Goeth strayed from the path of good, and from that we can see that the line between good and evil is a fine one.

This is a masterful film. Fantastic acting, superb pacing by Spielberg, beautiful lighting and photography, great music, and extremely intelligent and profound insights into human nature. What more could you ask?",10
18 August 2016,Spielberg's best film,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"".

It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",10
9 March 2000,Good Lord! It's absolutely astounding!,"I'm easily moved by movies, I'll admit. It doesn't take much to make me cry. But the last few scenes of this movie set me absolutely weeping. Harder than I ever have before. And, after it was over, it set me thinking: about how people can be so evil, about how painful compassion can really be, about how compassion can transform a person. This movie is THAT good.

Where to begin? After seeing this, and my all time favorite movie, Saving Private Ryan, I must say that Spielberg is the greatest director of our times. Hyperbole? Maybe, but you find me another film with the power of Schindler's list and SPR.

Liam Neeson is an acting god. Only he could've pulled this transformation off without making it seem hokey. I guess that's what made all the performances in this film so great, from Neeson, Kingsley, and Feinnes down to the slightest extra, was the lack of all the acting flourishes; all the melodramatic conventions that might have gotten an easier emotional payoff, but would have cheapened the movie. Take Feinnes. His character is evil personified, Feinnes is never over the top. The cold, emotionless look in his eyes as he kills people is chilling enough. And when an element of humanity slips into his character, Feinnes makes it believable, not added in. His character isn't a stock villain.

I'm probably running out of room. Let me just say this film pulls no punches. It shocks you, terrifies you, makes you cry in sadness and in joy, and makes you feel that most painful, unpleasant, and glorious of all emotions: compassion.",
26 January 2005,My conclusion why he did it...,"First: is this a great and an important movie? Of course it is, like all the films about the holocaust. Truly, have you ever seen a bad movie (or series, or even a document for that matter) made about the subject? I haven't. Like most great, based-on-facts tragedies, stories about concentration camps require too much serious thinking, talent and at least adequate budget to start with before anything happens. Filmmaker just couldn't fail with real-life drama of this magnitude in his hands. Neither could Mr. Spielberg.

Well, still, even considering above-mentioned, Spielberg did an excellent job. ""Schindler's List"" is technically brilliant: beautifully shot with its vast use of different camera distances and angles, and stark b/w realization (which always adds extra-interest for modern day film-enthusiastic). Cast is also superb (Liam Neeson to me is almost the very personification of 'trustworthy') and set design perfect, naturally, due to on-location shooting in Poland. The only, but nevertheless quite notable complaint is length; the movie is by definition unnecessarily overlong.

So, why did Oskar Schindler do it? Now, I'm a Finn with some German-Swedish heritage, and there's very unlikely one Jewish cell in my body. And I'm no bleeding-heart liberal either, pretty much vice versa. But I'm an intelligent guy with very strong comprehension what comes to 'right' and 'wrong'. So, given the same opportunities, money and influence, I would had for sure at least attempted the same kind of rescue-mission Schindler accomplished. Because I couldn't bear either just stand aside and watch an absolute and continuous torment of innocents. That's the very and simple reason for Schindler, a human being, too: he HAD the money and chance to save those people and he did. Only it took courage and an ability to successfully deal with crazy monsters (Nazis). And I, too, think that when there's a decision between life and death to be made, money means nothing. So it's so easy for me to identify with Oskar Schindler. Only the world this rotten and greedy even questions his motives.

Still, one possible and a little more cynical explanation, which I anyway think must had played at least minor part considering Schindler's (AND also that German officer's in ""The Pianist"") motives: Germany had already clearly lost the war. One can only guess if they would had acted exactly the same way in other circumstances...",10
1 October 2021,This is true cinema,"As someone who enjoys movies like Saw and Midsommar and other shock film this was by far the hardest movie to sit through. 3 1/2 hours was not enough run time for this movie. This is a movie we should be showing in high schools all over the country. Speipburg creates a very lucid, graphic, vivid image of the holocaust through first hand accounts. This is why we have movies. No more is needed to be said as ""Schindler's List"" is objectively the best film ever made.

13 September 2012,The Pianist on steroids,"The only thing I did not like about this film, was that in the end I could not come to IMDb and give it an 11.

Schindler's list -is- one of the best if not -the best- film ever filmed. If I am exaggerating then I could easily say that it is in the top 5 films of all time, shoulder to shoulder with The Godfather. While The Pianist made me hate the war and realize how horrible a war can be, Schiendler's list made me love the life and realize how valuable and unique each person on this planet is.

I will only say that if you have not seen this film yet, I most sincerely envy you, for there is absolutely nothing that can be compared with the feeling one gets when watching this masterpiece for the very first time.

17 December 2001,Most Moving movie I ever seen,"I took my Mother to see this movie precisely because I thought it would be one of those 'special' movies. I have lived in the USA for several years now and only visit England 2-3 times a year and I like to take my Mother to the movies when I go home as she does not get to go very often.

I had no idea how moving a movie could be. I have been told that this movie is not as moving as the 'real footage' of what actually happened but how could it ever be? Especially if your family was involved in this nightmare.

However, for me this movie was the most moving I have ever seen. I have never walked out of a cinema and attempted to say something but could not because my words were choked back by the emotion in me. In deed, there were many times that the tears were flowing and not because of cheap cinematic tricks but because the way this story was presented was so effective that I could not help myself become immersed in the realism of the horror that un-folded but at the same time showing that there can be humanity even in those we least expect.

In two words - Amazing and Humbling, easily my number one film, even though it is difficult to experience, anyone remotely interested in film HAS to see this.",10
14 March 2001,a masterpiece,"This is truly a remarkable film, definitely deserving of the best picture Oscar it received.

Films based on historical fact can work if they totally absorb the audience, and this one does. The power of the movie, Mr. Schindler's full 180 from Nazi to helping the prisoners, and some of the images (such as the little girl wearing a pink coat in an otherwise black-and-white setting) contribute.

Being Jewish myself, I was especially impressed and moved. This movie is not to be missed. I think it will become a classic and be mentioned in the same breath as such movies as Casablanca and Gone With the Wind. It is that good.

17 June 2020,A true view of history,"There have been many films that have adapted World War II, one of the darkest stages in modern history. The Jewish holocaust has been portrayed in many of these films, but few can say that they have accomplished it with Steven Spielberg's mastery of 'Schindler's List'. The film tells us how an entrepreneur, Oskar Schindler, decides to hire Jews in his factory in order to save them from the holocaust. This story works perfectly to show the horror in the most direct way possible. Spielberg uses all the cinematographic resources to show this fact in an extremely direct way, with an almost documentary tone. All the elements in the film are arranged to represent this dark stage, above telling a story, despite the fact that this is a fundamental part of the entire context in which it unfolds. It is a fact that 'Schindler's List' is not only one of the best movies about WWII, it is one of the best movies in film history. Spielberg delivered a realistic and crude piece that should never be forgotten, as a reminder of vivid actions that should not happen again.

29 April 2008,Spielberg's Best Movie. THE #1,"Its time to comment on one of the BEST films I've ever seen. The movie based on the real life's story about a Nasi guy, Mr. Oscar Schindler (Leam Nesson), who start to make money with the Jews in the infamous II War. With a ¬®little¬® help of his finance man, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), not very happy with the idea, use the luck of the world and the situation of the German army to open a factory that pay almost nothing and get many money.

As the time passing by the situation of the workers in factory get worst and worst, the Nasi army turn more violent and careless about the Jews, but Oscar Schindler keep watching them like people and feel the weight of the slaughter, specially by Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) who treat the Jews like something less than animals.

The deal is that the Schindler's factory, inadvertently, becomes a refuge and the mean of salvation for an entire community, and he tries, despairly, to get them out of the fire line.

Steven Spielberg's masterpiece and a jewel in the films history. Spelberg brings the Schindler's List to life, the story of a man who got nothing and leave with everything.

This is maybe the 5th Nasi story I've heard about, cause am not very interested in the whole Hitler's madness, who should have said it??? Up on the violence and the blood, there's a beautiful story of true power drived by compassion and humility. An action like this, weirdly, is inspired by suffering and the pain of a community, can not be seeing every day, but Schindler did it, and its showed like a daily act. Not like a saint but a defective and womanizer Nasi, and that's why its so charming and inspiriting.

Leam Nesson is the chosed one to take you trough the Schindler's feelings in one of the most notables performances I've ever watch and so damn heartbreaking that made it so hard not to cry, serious.

I'm pretty sure that if there wasn't Forrest Gump this would be the 1st, and it is, but I can't chose which one is best, thought. Otherwise, beside of being a Nasi movie, is the most beautiful movie I've ever watched, and a lesson to many people.",10
9 August 2003,Spielberg Masterpiece,"Spielberg created a masterpiece. The movie is not an easy one to watch, because it's so grim, but that's appropriate when you're doing a Holocaust film. The fact that it's in black and white adds to the grimness.

The graphic violence in ""Schindler's List"" actually has a purpose, unlike so many gory movies. He's trying to capture the living hell that the Jews in the concentration camp went through. I wouldn't advise letting preteens see it, but in high school it would be good for all kids to view.

11 September 2003,Best movie ever made,"I cannot imagine how anyone would not like this movie, unless it is for political reasons. The three main actors gave the performances of their careers, which is an amazing feat considering their body of work before and after. Liam Neeson as Schindler undergoes a transformation which was powerful. Ben Kingsley's performance was subtle. Had it been anything else, the movie would have been diminished. And Ralph Fiennes was wonderful as an evil man who became bored with evil, yet knew no other way to act. I am glad Spielberg never won an Oscar until Schindler, the lack of one may have spurred him on to this magnificent piece of history. Lest we forget.

31 October 2001,Steven Spielberg¬¥s Best 10/10,"I liked this movie since the first time I saw it. I didn¬¥t understand how the director who made E.T., Jaws or Raiders of the Lost Ark would made in 1993 the film that proves all his talent. Schindler¬¥s List is a beautiful film in Black and White (a thing that surprised in the 90¬¥s) and was the best movie in the OSCAR AWARDS.

Pros: Acting (Ben Kingsley, and Liam Neeson too), the photography, the soundtrack by John Williams, the realistic holocaust scenes and the running time of the film. It isn¬¥t be told in lesser time. Cons: You feel sad at very moments. I gave this film 10/10 Or for the stars system: *****/*****

22 September 2022,A soul searing monumental achievement! A perfect ending to a perfect movie!,"The legend of Oskar Schindler is really the highpoint of this movie for me. Where he failed before in past business ventures in life did he finally realize what had been missing to be successful all along. War.

But once this war profiteer and nazi party member found his riches did he wallow in them? No, he took a less travelled path, but a noble path that would be remembered for generations. Even when all was said and done and all that could have been done had been done it wasn't enough for him, and that speaks volumes. It resonates for a lifetime and its moments like this that define what creates the most unforgettable movies out there.

Its realistic horror, stunning black and white and an all too real story of the nightmares not only the victims of this time period went through but the pain and ripple effects felt throughout the world and human history still impactful to this day.

These are my thoughts about this masterpiece generational pillar of a movie. A full detailed review isn't necessary today or any day, this is literally one of those MUST-SEE for yourselves movies that transport you to another world. Spielberg's most personal movie for sure and would have fit perfectly had he been around to have made it in the 40s or 50s, its so beautiful to look at it fits right in.

A stunning movie in every regards. Should impact everyone in a different way whose seen it.",10
16 September 2004,Oscar,"What can you say about this masterpiece of work is WINNER PERFECT BRILLIANT GENIUS SKILLED and an ARTIST AT WORK. Shindlers list is the best film ever made, without any doubt. Liam Neeson gives his best performance ever, along with Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes. It depicts war at its most horrific and eventful stages in the perfect way (it needs to be shown). Life is full of wars, and to really understand how bad war gets you must see this piece of art. Steven Spielberg is a genius, the best at what he does.

The way he blends a tiny bit of color (red) into this film is so so powerful and effective, you can see why he got best DIRECTOR AND BEST FILM in the Oscars. I believe this film should be watched by everyone who does not understand the horrors of war........

IT IS THE Great MOVIE!!! (maybe not my favor but it's have the notable place in my mind)

5 October 2002,A true masterpiece,"A fantastic movie from Steven Spielberg. I rarely use the word superb, but superb isn't even enough for this movie! A true masterpiece, as I said in my summary. One of only two movies that I would give that grade (the other being ""Breaking the waves""). This comes in as the second best film I've seen my entire life! This movie isn't a brutal film like Spielberg's other WWII movie ""Saving Private Ryan"" (which also is superb in my opinion), but deals with concentration camps instead of the battlefields. One of only a few emotional and moving movies I've seen - and one of the best!!

4 February 2017,Most Powerful Film I've Ever Seen,"* There is a possible spoiler to anyone who, by some fluke, never heard the stories of the holocaust. Nothing specific, just the overall basis for the film. More of a synopsis.

Once again Steven Spielberg has created a master piece. However, I do believe this one is his greatest work. Or at least among the greatest. Absolutely the most Powerfully Moving and Thought Provoking Film I personally have ever seen. Certainly, I do not stand alone in that statement. It is my observed opinion that a great many others will agree with me. In my opinion, Steven Spielberg is undeniably the greatest filmmaker, director, producer of all time.

When this film first came out in theatre's across the country; everyone was talking about it, everyday. I quickly realized that this film was a must see for me. In Schindler's List (1993), Steven Spielberg spawns world wide interest in one man's Heroic acts of humanitarianism... while recreating the most horrifying historical events ever known. Thousands upon thousands of people's lives were at stake. Schindler (Ironically, a member of the Nazi Party), putting his own life in danger, becomes the peoples hope for any possible future. Ultimately, Schindler heroically saves some 1,200 Jewish lives. No comparison to the shocking new evidence that claims Nazi's killed up to 20 million people. Truly a must see for everyone. I am not Jewish. But I do tend to feel strongly for other peoples pain. This film provoked a Bleeding Heart in me. I have since seen this film about 2-3 other times. Every time, this film causes a heart wrenching pain down deep in my soul.

Hear this warning! This film is deeply emotional and thought provoking, a heart wrenching like never before. The horrific acts perpetrated upon the Jewish people during this historic era is absolutely, completely, and undeniably the worst crime in the history of the planet. If you are among the younger society, this film may leave you feeling like this was far too horrible; that you can't imagine it is actually real, that these events never really happened or that it was in some way fabricated. Well, Let me tell you my friend.... it did happen and it was a very real event; an historical stain on our civilization.

Be sure to have some tissue available. Because this one is a tear. This is a beautifully crafted film. Partly in black and white, bringing more realism in this the film. Watch and enjoy! jerker.",10
17 March 2016,Best of the best,"I was riveted from the opening scene to the closing credits where the live people from the Holistic were laying stones with Ben Kingsly. Don't plan on answering the phone or trying to squeeze dinner in while watching the movie. Nothing will be able to interrupt you. This was the first real taste I got of Liam Neeson. After that I made it a point to see some of his other films. A friend had told me about the filming of the shower scene and how hard it was to do it. I imagine the train scene was also very difficult as actors as well as all the crew behind the camera. I wish for this film to be shown in high schools because I never knew of this movement in WWII. At least there was some little glimmer of humanity in that war as this film shows.

23 March 1999,Spielberg's Finest,"When AFI declared this as one of the ten best films of all-time, they were right on the money. Certainly an all-time classic, the film conveys the emotions of the Holocaust Jews like never before. The Holocaust was one of the darkest periods in the history of mankind and only a man like Spielberg could describe it exactly as it was. An absolutely perfect film.

9 February 2000,The finest film ever made. Period.,"Quite simply the finest film ever made.

Nothing even comes close to this film. It ascends to a new level; it so poignantly and delicately conveys its message that you are left breathless, speechless and completely in awe of what you have just seen.

Mr Spielberg so often shows his talent in a very forward and visible way; his restraint and control in this film adds so greatly to its power because it IS restrained and you are left with the memory of what the film is about, not just any specific effect, sequence, style or even performance.

Indeed these performances were second to none, Ralph Fiennes comes particularly to mind ¬ñ you feel such hatred towards him and yet there are flaws in the evil of his character, indeed this would have been a very hard part to play.

There are also reminders of the human tragedy of the holocaust that tie the entire event to one person, the use of the red coat on the little girl is a simple and brilliant way of doing this; it serves to shatter any desensitisation that we may build up to protect ourselves from horrors that we are seeing, it brings the entire thing back home; in such a simple and effective way and makes it personal ¬ñ VERY personal.

I think that this will serve to educate us and remind us of what happened for many centuries to come, it is a work that will stand the test of time like no other; I firmly believe that it will go far in serving its ultimate cause, that such events may never happen again.

In short I do not think that it is possible to speak too highly of Schindler's List. I fear that we may never see another film of this calibre but if we do it would have to be something truly remarkable and be of someone of at least Mr Spielberg's brilliance; a very, very hard act to follow.",10
7 July 1999,Transcendental Film-making,"Back in December 1993, I drove into Kansas City to view Schindler's List at a midnight showing. The film, which dealt with something as simple as human compassion in a time when compassion was far from simple was truly one of the most magnificent pieces of film-making I had ever seen. But as truly moving as the film was, my distinct memories come after the film, at 4 AM on a Wednesday, driving home through the Plaza Area of KC. Anyone who has ever been to Kansas City knows the beauty of the Plaza Lights. With nobody else on the road, with the frost glazing the streets, the stillness of the moment still haunts me. I know that if it were any other Wednesday morning, I perhaps would not have appreciated that beauty quite so much as that particular Wednesday. The real power of Schindler's List and its simple story of a man who did the right thing at a time when there was madness all around him is not just one of the most important films historically, not just one of the great films artistically, not just one of the most powerful films emotionally, but it stands as an achievement that transforms the very way you see the world. I know that watching this film on video, picked-up at the video store on some rather ordinary Wednesday cannot really convey as much power as it did to me on that winter night 5 years ago. Watching it on video is still more moving than many other films that could never even imagine itself to aim so high. But the real magic for me is that this one of the films that made me realize the power that comes through in the dark of a theater, or through the dark of night.",10

3 September 2006,On everyone's list as a top ten movie of all time,"The story of Oskar Schinlder, a German by birth who wants to make money in WW II by getting Jewish investors and workers to produce pots and pans in a factory.

The performances are outstanding. Liam Neeson is Oskar and he is wonderful. Ralph Fiennes is the Nazi camp commander and his performance personifying evil is astounding. Ben Kingsley, one of the great actors of ANY era, is magnificent as Stern, the accountant who helps Oskar and at the same time stays under everyone's radar while helping his people during their incarceration.

I could go on and on but that basically describes it. I give it the greatest compliment I could ever give a movie: DON'T MISS IT!

21 June 2003,Must see for anyone interested in the Holocaust,"I must say that I was not alive when the Holocaust took place but have heard all the horror stories. This film put pictures together with the horror stories. It is an epic, filmed in black and white for effect purposes, which will not be forgotten. Ralph Fiennes, Ben Kingsley and Liam Neeson are all casted beautifully in their roles. This is a film that will leave you thinking and is required viewing for those, like myself, who weren't around when this atrocity took place.

My rating : @@@@ 1/2 (out of five)

29 May 2006,Representation misused,"This is just another film like Amistad that Steven Spielberg thought might be important to put to film. But, after seeing a film like United 93, I feel that, going back to this film, I see it as exploitation. That it is exploiting the pain of the entire holocaust and the tragedy that it really was, and exploiting that for emotional reasons but worse, to give Oskar Shindler an opposite, and something to purify him from a narrative character perspective. It's not that I hate the film, it's well made in every aspect, but it is basically a Frank Capra picture set within a really huge tragedy. One character is not the hero or villain here, there is no black and white. Since it chooses to display the Holocaust so graphically, do it in a better way. But watching the film and contrasting it to what actually did happen, I have to wonder, is there a really truthful way of representing the Holocaust? It's such a monstrous tragedy, the big abomination of the 20th century, should it really be put onto film, and are the words now used to describe it, ""Never Again"", really a truthful representation? Is this how we want people to remember the Holocaust? Through a film that presents a hero struggling to be a capitalist and struggling to be a good man by Western standards by saving as many people as possible. If he had saved ""one more"" person, it wouldn't have mattered. The film is permanent, and the Holocaust itself is as well. I firmly believe this is not the appropriate way to depict something that actually happened and was so important. It's the singular voice of the director here, this film might as well by ""It's A Wonderful Life"", because that is essentially what it is. The same story, the same character arc for Shindler. It's just not appropriate and I think that the time has not come yet for us to truly be able to grasp the atrocity of the Holocaust. I believe the means of representation are not available for us or at our disposal.",1
4 February 2004,One man can make a difference,"There's the ancient story of Orpheus who's going into the underworld to free his wife and who failed. Then there's another story of a man who's going into the hell on earth called Auschwitz to free some hundred women and their children and he succeeded. The difference between these two stories is that the last one is true. Now many people will ask why that man by the name of Oskar Schindler did that. I think I know the answer. There's another scene in this great movie in which you can see Schindler and one of his many lovers by his side riding horses. They are witnessing the liquidation of the ghetto from the top of a hill nearby and staring at the scenes in disbelief and horror. Many Jews are killed in front of their eyes (of course the murderers are not aware of them) but Schindler isn't looking away. He isn't turning his back to the victims until the woman by his side is telling him to leave. Sometimes the last century is called the century of genocide. These genocide were possible because millions and millions of people were looking to the other side, while their neighbors were carried away, beaten to death, shot. I'm not sure if I would do the same but if you watch this film what you really should do you will see that one man can truly make a difference if he's not looking away.",10

6 December 1999,"Powerful, moving, mind blowing film","I had no intention to see this movie. From the previews I had seen, I could tell it was a true to life movie with social significance. However, I thought it would probably be long, drawn out, and boring. Boy was I wrong.

Luckily, it was showing on a movie channel and I sat down and watched it. At the very beginning I was a little confused with what was going on. I also didn't match up most of the character's names with their faces. However, this only makes me want to see it again. This is definitely a movie I could see over and over again.

This movie will blow you away more than any of Spielberg's other movies which are heavy in special effects. This is perhaps the most realistic movie I have ever seen. I can't imagine a person not liking this movie.

This is a must see and a must own!!! I give it a 10 out of 10.",10

16 February 2006,"A brilliant, sobering film","Schindler's List is a profound film that gives an eye opening look at one of the darkest, most despicable periods of the 20th century, the Halocaust. It unflinchingly tells the story of 1,100 Jews, who, when millions upon millions of their brethren were systematically murdered by the Nazis, survived, due to the actions of a greedy businessman. Steven Spielberg definitively proved his talents to the world when he made this film. No longer was he merely a sap-seller who made visually stunning summer films about alien landings, swashbuckling archaeologists, and sadistic Semi Trucks. He proved he could direct a harrowing, serious film which from every corner oozes artistry. I can't tell how much I love the fact that the film is in black and white. The medium works perfectly in presenting this grim time many of us only know of in shocking old photographs. More brilliant still are the sporadic uses of color. Much has been said about the moment when Oscar Schindler watches a young girl in a red dress walk quietly through the horror of the Krakow Liquidation, but not as much has been noted about my favorite instance of color. In the first scene, a Jewish family is gathered around a table to observe the Sabbath. The Father reads a prayer, and the camera slowly moves in on the candles on the table as the family fades out of the scene and color slowly dissipates. Soon, only the orange flame of the candles are in color, and they are soon extinguished. This, to me, represents the hope that was snuffed out by the Nazis during the Halocaust. Later in the film, Oscar Schindler, at his new artillery factory, allows some of the Jews to observe the Sabbath. They too gather around a candlelit table to read a prayer, and the flames of the candle glow orange; now that these Jews are safe, this is hope for them again. The performances are fantastic. I both applauded and scolded Liam Neeson as the alternatively brave and selfish Oscar Schindler, seethed with anger at Ralph Fiennes as the detestable SS Officer Amon Goeth, and felt immense pity for Ben Kingsley as the sorrowfully noble Itzhak Stern. Of course one of my favorite things about the film is the music. Not the traditional plagerized pomposity of John Williams earlier scores, the music for this film is carried by a gentle, sorrowful melody, often played by master violionist Ithzak Perlman. This is a film I believe all should see. Schindler's List will, hopefully, open your eyes to the immense evil that man carried out against his fellow man during the Halocaust.",10
16 April 1999,Simply amazing,"Two words: simply amazing. That is the just one compliment helping to describe this riveting and unbelievably well-made movie. Spielberg is the only man to direct this movie and he does an impeccable job showing some of the horrors of the Holocaust. I also loved the fact that Spielberg does not try to explain the change in Schindler. He just lets it flow through the movie. This is a brilliant masterpiece and on my list of top 5 movies of all time. Everyone should see this movie, not just the Jewish men and women whose relatives were involved.

26 August 2006,"One of the only films to make me cry (well, almost).","One night after all my friends left my house at midnight, for some reason I thought it would be a good idea to plop Schindler's List into my DVD player. I knew it would end at 3, but I didn't care because I had wanted to see this so called ""amazing"" film. I wasn't disappointed.

Spielberg managed to create one of the most beautiful films ever. Even though the subject matter itself is depressing and morbid, the way humanity springs from such a destructive environment is beautiful. Oskar Schindler's transformation from a war profiteer to a humanitarian is subtle and realistic. Schindler is human, and feels it too, thanks to great writing and Liam Neeson's wonderful performance.

Spielberg's direction has never been better. The executions of the Jews are brutal because there are no cuts; almost every slaying is done in one shot. This adds to the realism and the sheer bestial nature of the Holocaust. The cinematography is amazing in black and white, creating a sense of melancholy in a stark world.

What else is there to say? I could go on about the acting and the writing. I didn't even mention John William's morose, but poignant score, which provides much of the emotion that stems from the film. However, all I can say is that Schindler's List is moving, touching, and altogether brilliant. The final scene almost made me cry, but I didn't because I'm an unemotional robot. But as an unemotional robot, I was still deeply moved by Spielberg's sentimental tribute to those who died in one of history's saddest periods.",10
1 January 2010,amazing from start to finish,"This movie is brilliant.

Everything, EVERYTHING was portrayed so well. The settings, the characters, the emotions were all so solid and spot on to the time period.

Spielberg did an excellent job in his take on the Holocaust and Poland during World War II. The cinematography was more than amazing. I cannot get over Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson's performances in this movie. Both of them won me over, I hated and loved them. They made their characters so believable and REAL.

It's shocking how real everything was in this movie. It's almost safe to say that this is not a movie. Schindler's List will capture you from start to finish, and guaranteed, you will be changed at least a little bit by the end of the film. Definitely one of the best.

8 July 2006,The truth lies here,"""History repeats itself, the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce"" Said by Karl Marx. The Holocuast is one of the worst tragedies to befall humanity. True we have genocides, and holocausts today, in Rwanda, Chechnya. This is the first time though that a few madmen seduced a nation. Complancency was not a choice. The Jews had no way to fight back without the allies. There is no reason to assume that most who watch this film are not believers of the HOlocaust. But in case you are take it from someone who lost half of her family. It was real and the evidence survived. God I pray it is never like this ever again.

8 May 2001,The Best Directed Movie Ever Made.,"There are very few movies which excel in every category of good filmmaking. Schindler's List is on the top of almost every category in my mind. But what stands out the most is the direction. Schindler's List has to be hands down the best directed film I have ever seen. Saving Private Ryan is the only movie which truly comes close. Spielberg is perhaps the greatest director we have ever seen in the film industry. This movie is perfect. I give it more acclaim than any other film made within the last twenty-five years.

17 October 2009,"Loved the movie! Maybe the best one I've ever seen...and believe me, I've seen some pretty good movies in my life...","I must admit I was stunned! With so many bad movies, with no substance at all, it's wonderful to know that those kind of movies like ""Schindler's List"" prove to us that masterpieces are still possible. Congrats, Steven Spielberg!!! The movie presents an apparently vain character who wants to gain profit with his business, by employing only Hebrew people, because they are paid less( they aren't paid at all, only the taxes for them are paid). Through the movie we are given the chance to see some great and very very moving frames of the Holocaust...women and old people are being killed in front of our eyes, humiliation and cruelty is being presented as if it would happen right now...it is a lesson to learn and it is history relieved in a traumatic way. The movie is tragic, but the fact that Schindler acts in such a humanitarian way is reassuring for us to know that...after so many crimes and so much evil, there still is GOOD in us. This movie is a MUST if you wanna watch an unforgettable movie!

28 November 2016,Better with age,"There's not much to say about this film that hasn't already been said.

So I'll just add that this film actually got better with age. It's some 20 years since I last saw it and I'd forgotten much of it. My memory (faulty) had 'the list' playing a more prominent role in the film (from a screen-time standpoint). And while the list is the vehicle to the film's denouement, it is the film's ability to get us into the Krakow Ghetto, to get us standing beside and inside the atrocities, that makes the film a masterpiece.

Think of a documentary, think of how moved you are by the recitation and depiction of the facts of the Holocaust. Then add to that the fictive characters' lives that underscore each of the film's scenes and well, you're beyond moved.

14 March 2000,incredible,"One thousand words, the maximum for this review, are hardly enough to describe the direct impact this film had on me as well as some of my friends. Spielberg does a wonderful job depicting the harsh reality of Jewish Life back in the early 1940's. I vaguely remember one of his comments before the first commercial free showing of this film on NBC: ""We must not forget the tragedy these Jews had to endure..."" I am thoroughly convinced that I will never ever forget this movie now or 50 years from now. Schindler's List is powerful in direction, hypnotic in nature, and perfect in form. One of the best films of all time, if not THE best. Simply a great work, well deserving of all of its Oscars, especially Best Picture. I applaud you, Mr. Spielberg.

22 February 2014,Spielberg's Greatest Work,"This movie was, in my humble opinion, the greatest movie Steven Spielberg ever created. I have loved most of his movies, but Schindler's List trumps them all for one very important reason: it's a true story that not only tears at the heart strings of any human being with a heart, but it captures a piece of history that is personal to Spielberg himself. I am a major defender of the nation of Israel and a lover of her people. The idea that any man could glean pleasure from destroying any human life is a concept way beyond my grasp, but to feel a race of people is so superior to another that the other is deemed unworthy to live is beyond reason.

As you may have guessed, Schindler's List is about the Holocaust. Spielberg brings the stories of a relatively small group of Jewish families who were caught in the middle of the world's greatest tragedy right to your living room. What makes this movie so different from most other Holocaust movies is that you get a first-hand look into what a real life hero is made of. Heroism is not all muscles and brawn. Sometimes all it takes is a broken heart.",10
22 September 2000,Top Ten,"Schindler's List is Spielberg's masterpiece. It is brilliant, horrifying, dramatic, and artistic. It's simply one of the most powerful films I've ever seen, and it reminds us of the horrors that mankind has suffered as well as what we've committed.

This is a film that everyone needs to own, so they can watch it at least once a year.

29 August 2000,The directing brought the scary part of the REAL STORY into the movie.,"Cinematography, script, performance, directing... are all elements that have made this film so good to watch. Of-course the real story is the real notch behind which this is all so moving and amazing. The thing is that it takes brilliant directing, Spielberg, and performance to be able to reflect this true experience through a movie so smoothly. The attention to details has contributed to this very successful portrayal of the great pain, degradation and global disaster that took place 50 years ago. Details such as the nudity scenes of this large number of people that conveys the concept of lack of individuality to a degree implying disrespect and humiliation that is scary. The components of the characters of Oskar and Stern are very well presented because they are real characters with components of good and bad. Black and white certainly adds to the state of mind the movie puts you in. The idea of masses of people all the time enhances the magnitude of the catastrophe even further.

11 March 2009,One of the greatest and most important movies of all time,"I am not going into detail here - as all that needs to be said has been said...

But viewing of this film should be compulsory for all. It is to Spielberg's eternal credit that he was able to tackle the hardest of all subjects and humanise the most appalling period in recent history.

The scrip, characterisations, direction, performances and editing are all beyond criticism and after three hours I would defy anyone to remain indifferent to the central message - that in the darkest of hours humanity can overcome evil, and the actions of one person make the most profound difference to many.

Beyond entertainment and beyond compare.

17 January 2002,fine work from a master who will never die.,"(please ignore my previous comment as it contained some errors)

Let me begin by saying that the thousands of you out there who worship ""Saving Private Ryan"" should think twice about labeling it 'the best Spielberg film of all time'.

Schindler's list is by definition a masterpiece and in my opinion Spielberg's finest work to date. Unlike SPR, it focuses on true events and not only uses true locations and dates. SPR has a group of men risking their own life to save one whereas SL has one man trying to ""save the world entire"". Which one is far fetched though? Both, you would say unless you are historically inclined and know that Oscar Schindler(Neeson) did in fact exist and save more than 1100 people during the holocaust. Miller and his team, although loosely based on true characters do not depict an accurate incident in the chapter of world war 2.Thus we find Schindler's List more gratifying to watch as a film but also absorb as a historical guide.

The acting mind you, is exceptional in both cases and hadn't there been charming old Bennigni hopping and bouncing on the chairs of the Academy - Hanks would have certainly taken Oscar (forgive the pun) home to meet his other two brothers.

Schindler's list is deeply moving, and in every scene you get the feeling that you are there living in that misery and thanking your lucky stars that you have pulled through another day. What is most disturbing (and equally ingenious of Spielberg) is the way the Jews are killed. Sometimes they are lined up and shot at to save bullets, other times they are wounded and then shot in the head to make up for the 'mistake' (the scene where the woman dies in the hands of her husband spraying her blood all over him after the shot, is one of the strongest in the film). But Spielberg's genius does not emerge through the portrayal of gratuitous violence. It emerges through the way he shows what HAS to be shown. At times he creates tension by NOT showing an actual death (like the scene of the boy who couldn't clean the stains out of Goeth's bath and then gets killed by his sniper rifle) or else when you think someone is going to die - and they don't (the rabbi ) such subtleties always leave us uncertain as to what is going to take place next and always leaves us on edge.

The girl is the red dress contrary to what many think, is also a stroke of genius. Spielberg includes her for two reasons :

1) We are taken on a journey through which we can relate and through which we can feel what is happening around 'us'. Because she is marked her in red, we can easily follow her through the streets of the ghetto and not get lost in the violence which takes place around her.

2) She becomes a symbol of lost innocence when later in the film she is seen in a pile of corpses. Had she not been in red ( a very empathic colour) we might have not recognized her, or we would not have focused on the tragedy of her murder.

When the flames later on in the film are lit to celebrate the Sabbath (notice they to are coloured) we get the impression that hope is re-emerging and good will triumph in the end.

I particularly admire the scene where a German plays Mozart on a piano to the rhythm of stuttering guns being fired around him. This not only creates a macabre atmosphere but it also shows how cold blooded some Germans where (""is that Bach? No Mozart"").It is not surprising however that the film is praised in Germany today because most German's disassociate themselves rightly with the atrocities their ancestors committed against the six million Jews murdered.(one must notice the scene where the German soldiers decide to ""go home as men rather than murderers"", showing that not all Nazis where NAZIS, if you know what I mean.)

The portion in colour at the end then, always sends goose bumps down my back. Probably because we are seeing real people (the actors and actual characters still alive today (well 1993) like {amazingly enough} the girl Schindler kisses at his birthday party!) The very last scene then, where the road built from gravestones is panned on and ""Directed by Steven Spielberg"" appears, has me sighing and thinking ""wow"".

Add to all this a great character analysis (the typewriter's audition scene is amusing because we learn more about Schindler's character, and the scene where Fiennes says 'I forgive you' to the mirror shows us how hatable he really is) and development throughout as well as a heart pounding score by John Williams and what you've got is a film which I would surely beat myself to death for not rating it: ***** (Excellent) so I will (rate it 5 stars that is).",10
30 August 2013,A horrifically realistic depiction of the Holocaust,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",10
12 April 2005,Utterly beautiful and breathtakingly made.,"|This film is almost perfect,both in its place as a cinematic masterpiece visually,and in its sensitively handled subject matter.It is only given a nine by myself because i really don't think i will ever see a film that truly deserves a ten.The film is about a subject that affected millions,The Holocaust,but it has a very personal impact on the viewer by concentrating on a group of people that are characterised enough that the viewer relates with them so much more.If they had tried to show the wider spread effects of the Holocaust,the empathy would be diminished,because although based on harrowing events it would become just another historically based movie,with too much going on.What makes Schlindlers list so touching is that your given time to relate to the central characters in such a way that you feel you could almost imagine what they are feeling,and any film that can take you to that level of empathy is automatically a classic in my book! It is a good way to ''teach lessons''as it were because it affects anybody who watches it.Anyone harbouring fascist views should be made to sit and watch this movie repeatedly.If they can still be that way after seeing this,they must be in human,it really is that good at getting to anyone on an emotional level.This impact is heightened by the beautifully used black and white tones of the film,with significant items/parts in vibrant colours,stunning!The score is very effective too.Any one who can watch the ending without feeling moved is a robot!Fact!The film is great,granted but the cast also take this film to new heights,Liam Nesson is superb in his portrayal of a man forced to question his own values,beliefs and place in a system that is wrong,and who chooses the right path,absolutely mesmerising! Touching,informative and beautifully made.Easily one of the best films of all time,and THE best film on this subject.9/10",9
23 September 2006,Really Captivating and amazing.,"This has got to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. EVER. I thought that it would be very boring, since it's so long - I was Extremely wrong! The beginning is a bit slow, but you get a picture of who Oskar Schindler is, a rich, charming man with great social skills. I couldn't think of anyone better than than Liam Neeson to play this role.

Ralph Fiennes.. wow. He FREAKED me out in this movie as a SS officer/commander. He playes the part extremely well - I couldn't recognize his voice here. He really captured the personality of his role. Wow.

.. I mean wow.

I wasn't surprised when I saw that Steven Spielberg directed this. And I'm not surprised that Schindlers List won 7 Oscars (deserved more!) So if you have a lot of spare time on your hands, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD - SEE THIS MOVIE!

My rating: a clear 10/10",10
14 June 2002,A Great Film - makes you realise how lucky you are......,"This film is a must see for anyone, it is based on the true story of Oskar(Oscar) Schindler and his brave heroic saving of many lives during and after World War 2.

There is no way to explain how much Schindler did and must have gone through to achieve what he did. This is not a sci-fi film but a film of one mans manipulation of using evil people to save lives. The way Schindler risks his own life by cleverly ensuring that he has made friends of the most powerful nazis in the area he lives and works in, to ensure that if things go against him he has an 'escape route' shows the mans intelligence.

One of the main things that has to be said about Schindler was that he certainly never could ever be classed as a racist, or as some have suggested using the jewish people to save his own skin. This as shown in the film is far from the truth, Schindler is awake to the evil actions of the nazis and their intentions to wipe them from the face of the planet.

For anyone thinking of watching this great film that is in two minds as to whether to or not - the answer is go for it you will not be dissapointed. The film as I say is based on fact and not to be sniffed at when looking at what Schindler did for the jewish people, he saved the lives of many many jews and of course their offspring, many jewish families today owe their lives to Oskar Schindler.

One of the best films ever made in my opinion and will always be rated as such..........",10
29 November 2009,The Triumph of The Human Spirit,"I just have to chime in and agree with all the praise heaped on this movie. A movie is great when it shows a fundamental truth. What is the fundamental truth of this movie? The truth is that sometimes people will have an extraordinary reaction to evil around them, and can change their basic nature. Why is this so powerful? Because it is so rare. Most people do not change their nature. Especially when confronted by situations where it is easier to just go along. Oskar Schindler makes a moral choice to not go along. It is tough. It is dangerous. Yet, he makes the choice.

I was once watching a show about the holocaust. The show was about a recently discovered photo album, by one of the killers taken at Auschwitz. One comment that one of the narrators said really stuck with me. ""What made these people so monstrous, was that they were not monsters."" That is the true horror. Ordinary people during this time period were just doing there ""jobs"". In other words, what was so horrible about the Holocaust, was not that these people were deviants, but that they were so ordinary, and that this happened in our lifetime.

In the movie Oskar Schindler starts out as an opportunist. He realizes that he can become very rich by moving to Poland and taking advantage of the desperate situation that has arisen there. He does this in a masterful way, and soon becomes very rich. Gradually he realizes what is going on around him he decides that he has to make a choice. The choice is incredibly courageous. What was so extraordinary about his choice was that so few people like him did so during this time period. After the war, most absolved themselves of their responsibility by saying, ""I was only following orders."" An amazing story. Highest possible rating.

Offbeat trivia about this movie This movie was also written into a script of Seinfeld. Jerry and his current girlfriend haven't been able to be alone. He decides to take here to a movie to make out. What movie does he take her to? This one! This has to be one of the funniest scenes ever in a comedy series. Who could write a scene that is potentially so offensive, but yet hysterical. Much hilarity ensues when Jerry is spotted making out during the movie by a relative.",10
5 July 2000,Breathtaking,"This is Spielberg's masterpiece. Most members of my family found their end in the gas-chambers and so Schindler's list was a very personal movie to me. Before seeing it, I never would have thought, that a director like Spielberg, would be able to create such feelings of total distress, desperation and hope. Only the ending with the jewish rites of the stones on the grave of Schindler was a little bit disapointing. In my oppinion nothing else than a bow to the box office.

Schindler's list is a great film. It shows the holocaust as it really might have happened and leaves you with a feeling of fear that it might happen again in any country, at every given time.

7 June 1999,Excellent movie,"Schindler's List is undoubtedly one of Spielberg's finest films, and there countless reasons why. Spielberg is able to portray Oskar Schindler(Liam Neeson) as a womanizer, shrewd businessman, and profiteer of the war in a way that does justice to the character's complexity. Through the use of black and white he brings you back to the time of the Holocaust, while using color in the present to bridge the gap between past and present. In particular, the use of black and white to identify the Holocaust is appropriate given the brutal nature of the event. People dream in color, but they have nightmares in black and white. The scenes themselves help show the facelessness of the Holocaust and the horror it brought to its victims. In particular, there is one scene in which a number of Jews are forced into a shower expecting to be gassed. The looks on their faces, along with the moving music, makes this scene one of tremendous fright. Although in this scene the Jews are not gassed, the message of this scene is there- even when Jews were not being killed, they were subject to horrors beyond the imagination of the human mind- everyone was a victim, including those who were not killed. All in all, Spielberg uses the medium to his advantage and recreates in vivid detail much of the Holocaust, while also telling a story of how one overcomes his ignorance to help others in the end.",10

3 June 2016,My absolute favorite movie capturing the history of WW2,"My first recollection of this movie was in my early adolescence, and of all the movies I've seen that portray historical events, Schindler's list is one that evokes the greatest emotion and most memorable impression. The black and white representation provokes the feeling of desolation, and shows the seriousness of the events that took place during that era, but doesn't overshadow the brilliance of Schindler's unrelenting kindness and heroism despite all obstacles. It gives descriptive recounts of how heinously and inhumane Jews were treated, with raw and unforgiving scenes unlike those seen in most factual films. This is truly one of Spielberg's best works of art.

7 June 2020,A masterpiece.,"The movie is quite a masterpiece and it does truly reflect that dark period of history:holocaust...,which does shock me to a great extent. I also awe to Schindler 's bravery and great philanthropy-he is one of small number of kind and philanthropic Germanies at that time,and I know how much he has done for that race. In other words,Schindler is not only a person,but also a god.

4 January 2011,Do not miss this.,"Schindler's List is based on the novel Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally and on a true story about a German factory worker, Oskar Schindler, who is a member of the Nazi party and due to his decreasing number of employees, employs the Jewish residents in his factory. Schindler's List explores the true dark side of the Second World War. Unlike most World War Two based movies, Schindler's List is based on the Holocaust; the cruelty of the Jews during the period. The film is also a history lesson; it explores all the years of the war; starting from 1939, the start of the war, to the very end, although the main focus is Oskar Schindler whose actor is Liam Neeson (Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, A-Team movie). The character, not only is represented as a womanizer and laid-back, but he is obviously the odd one out; he does not see the Jews as bad people unlike the other Nazis and because it is his job to employ factory workers, cannot resist temptation in saving the Jews from the camps, where the Jews are imprisoned. This shows the message that working on the evil side is the only way to rescue innocent people, which is what would have occurred during a brutal era like World War Two. This is why the film deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Picture. John Williams' incredible score links very well with the German Jewish culture, but also represents sadness and bleakness in the story, because it tempts the viewers to feel sympathy for the Jews. The black and white tone also suggests the darkness of the story, but also links with the 1940s setting when most films used the colour tone. Even if it looks older than other nineties movies, Schindler's List was definitely a modern film; for one reason, the film combines black and white with colour; the first shot consisting of a group of Jews paying respects to Oskar Schindler is filmed using colour and the viewer will easily spot a tiny amount of colour during one of the crowd scenes. Another reason is due to the following actors in the film; Ben Kingsley (Gandhi, Thunderbirds movie) who plays Ishaak Stern, Ralph Fiennes (Wallace & Gromit In The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit) as Amon Goth and Caroline Goodall (Hook) the actress of Emilie Schindler. Schindler's List was directed by Steven Spielberg who won an Oscar for Best Director and is considered one of his best works ever. It proves that Steven does not just direct thrilling adventure movies!",10

I mean, they're incredible movies too, no doubt about that, but do they tell a true story and send a powerful message about the worst and best humanity can be? Didn't think so. Anyone who belittles this movie or it's message simply aren't human.

26 October 2003,Best movie of all time!,"Right after ""The fellowship of the ring"". I liked the second one more because of its story, effects, sound, acting and its a really magnificent movie. But on the other hand we have a moving, perfect movie. It presents a so important part of history, reminds us of what happened in a very emotional way, but never gets boring (sorry, but many other great movies have this HUGE ""error""). With Liam Neesons (Oscar Schindler) and Ralph Fiennes (Amon G√∂th) we see two of the best performances ever (together with Marlon Brandos and Robert de Niros Godfather).

It has also some moments which stand out from the whole movie and will stay with me for all time (what is a proof for really good movies). Here are 2:

-When the first train wrongfully brings the Jews to Auschwitz and we see a colon of people walking into a building. Then the camera moves slowly to the top where we see a huge chimney, out of it coming black dust and we hear only the sound of the fire...

-When Schindler is ""recrouting"" people for his factory he also employs a teacher. When the teacher is sad by the Nazis he isnt ""important"" he cant understand it. He says: Since when arent literature and history important? I love this sceen and its in my opinion the best of the movie. History-we must know the history so we dont make the same mistakes as people already made (racism...). and literature- literature represents of what are humans possible. Creating something beautiful, that has not really a practical use (dont misunderstand this!) but its made for higher reasons. The Nazis dont understand higher reasons, they just want them to work, so they can win the war. There is no space for something beautiful.

-Finaly one of the last scenes: When Schindler is driving away at the end. He starts to compare things to human lives...: This symbol, its made of gold. For it i could save two lives!...

And there are much more! One of the best movies of all time and for all time!",10

5 October 2002,#1 on Spielberg's List,"Since before I could remember, I have had an interest in World War II. When we began to learn about it, I was even more interested. Then I heard about Schindler's List. Sure, I've heard the title before. I just didn't know what it was about until High School. Never bothered looking it up. Then I saw it. Spielberg has never made a movie this good.

Ever since Star Wars Episode I, I've always been a Liam Neeson fan... And I feel this was his best performance ever. Ralph Fiennes was good at making me hate him (hard to believe that's the same guy who I thought was cool from the Avengers).

This movie makes you wonder why. Why would the NAZI party go through such great lengths just to make Jews suffer? The only difference is the difference in beliefs. Was it that they needed someone to blame for the depression? But why the whole religion? I've been asking these questions before I saw this movie, and this movie doesn't answer them... perhaps we never will know the answers.

This movie is really good. I give it a 15/10.",10

A brilliant camera work along with the print used in the accompanied with the most adequate lighting adds to the horror of the situation. The jarring camera work immediately transports us to that era of which we have only black and white memory. As far as the script is considered I think it will be much more than ten textbooks any one will read in script writing. Acting if Liam, Ralph and Ben have been most natural you will find in any kind of Cinema. It seems they never supposed that they were recorded on Camera. And finally coming to direction it is Most Brilliant. I just wish to be present at the point when Spielberg would have been explaining his scenes to his actors and the perfect coordination with the people at back ground and foreground. Some scenes such as small children's not more than the age of fine throwing stones at the Jew when they were moved to camps, the horror which women witness when they were moved to another camp and they apply there on blood on there cheeks to look radiant and young were beyond imagination and end I think is beyond what has ever been ever filmed.

4 October 2018,"The most touching, powerful, and important movie ever made.","When I first watched Schindler's List, I was completely amazed. No movie has ever moved me the way it did, and I don't think ever will. It manages to be both beautiful, horrifying, hopeful, and depressing all at the same time which is incredibly hard to do. With this film, Spielberg really shows what masterful director he is. Liam Neeson also gives a jaw dropping performance as Oskar Schindler. I can say without a doubt that this is one of the greatest acting performances I've ever seen. Every single line, ever single emotion, Liam Neeson acts it out perfectly. The next great performance is what I consider to be the greatest performance of all time: Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth. Ralph Fiennes' plays this character so good, that Amon Goeth is arguably the most unlikeable, despicable character to ever appear on screen. (Amon Goeth being a real person makes his performance even more stomach wrenching). This is a once in a generation performance. Ben Kingsley also has an incredible performance in this, playing Itzhak Stern. In my opinion, Schindler's List is the most powerful, emotional and important movie ever made.

Yes, it is a film based on historical events. But it does not attempt to paint its characters as pure. Liam Neeson delivers as Schindler, while Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes--hell, the entire cast--turn in some truly powerful performances.

The criticism of this movie astonishes me. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out some people in this world. Let me put it another way--if you are not moved even a little by this film, or if you use snarky, cynical reasons to bash it, you're not even human. You don't even have a soul. You don't care.

This film will resonate long after we are gone, as well as it should. The Holocaust did happen. And yes, millions of other people besides Jews were slaughtered. But SCHINDLER'S LIST reminds us to never forget the holocausts of history. Never forget--never again.",10
29 October 2022,A Masterpiece,"This is a beautiful portrayal of a hideous time in history. Steven Spielberg, being the visionary that he is, was the perfect person to direct this film which, as the title implies, is a true masterpiece. The use of black-and-white film adds a layer of authenticity, but also enhances the ""raw"" nature of the portrayal of the events of World War II. Not only is the movie a masterpiece, but the music especially, and Itzhak Perlman's solo violin performance, compliments the visuals so beautifully. Despite the subject matter, this movie is beautifully shot and captured, with an equally beautiful soundtrack. I could not begin to imagine what those who had gone through these events had to deal with; but this is a beautiful tribute honoring their suffering, and making sure the story can be told for generations to come.

13 April 2016,The quintessential narrative on one of the darkest chapters in human history,"Although there have been many attempts through numerous mediums to capture the horror, the inhumanity, the helplessness of the Holocaust, only through the eyes and hands of Spielberg has this black phase in the history books become the foundation for a superb masterpiece, a work of art that is also a tribute and a remembrance to those that perished and those that still live to this day and were unfortunate enough to live this savagery.

Schindler's list is likely to make you cry, and if it doesn't, it will definitely not make you feel happiness, as you slowly watch the brutality of men take away what little joy you had before and during the show. Its realistic and relentless substance generates grief and reflection that not many films can offer, and it is present in every minute. Any sensitive people are advised to be emotionally and mentally prepared.

Spielberg's vision for the Second World War and the depressing take on its participants (and ultimately victims) and their environments is unmatched. The cinematography stands out as some of the best that Spielberg has shown us, and never seems to disappoint throughout the entirety of the film; it does justice to those who most needed justice and their tale to the world.

The admirable and tragic life of Oskar Schindler, the manner in which it is portrayed by an excellent script and an outstanding performance by Liam Neeson, and the decisions he ultimately makes will probably make a small percentage of the viewers reevaluate their beliefs and outlook on life, but even if it fails to do so with the rest, it achieves the objective of history classes in schools: to learn not to make the same mistakes, and it does so with marvelous execution on a subject that is sometimes forsaken. It transcends as both a study and a visual art.

John William's score is nothing short of magical, majestic in a harrowing, yet spellbinding way. It is an essential addition to an already beautiful piece; the connection between the score and the film is the epitome of chemistry between the two that many other filmmakers should study.

Schindler's list may disappoint as a date film or as a family addition, but it will never fail to give us a glance of a subject that, although controversial, should serve as a lesson of why history is important to learn.",10
26 July 2003,Just My Opinion,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me.

3 February 2000,Excellent,"Even though this may not be my favorite film, it has to be the best made movie I have ever seen, in terms of cinematography. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes did an impeccable acting job, and Steven Spielberg triumphed.

20 March 2000,A film of unsurpassed quality,"This film is unquestionably the best film that ever touched the hand of Spielburg. He has definitely matured as a director, as he shows more restraint in Schindler's List than he has ever done before. This film proves that Hollywood can still make a truly thoughtful picture that touches the hearts of millions. I've must have seen this film over twenty times, and every single time there are still three scenes in this film that makes me want to cry. Words simply cannot express the greatness of this film. Definitely one of the best films ever made.

30 October 2009,Excellent performance..,"This movie fascinated in the sense similar to The Pianist(2002), but the movie forces the viewer to appreciate the beauty of representation of the movie. The scenes in the movie can be offending or heart-shaking, but this is the real quality of a movie that it can successfully urge the viewer to get sentimentally lost inside the movie and the words of appreciation comes out of his mouth. The movie takes a turn at the last hour, that makes one feel the greatness of Oscar Schindler and the exquisiteness of the movie that words of appreciation comes out of his mouth automatically.

Regarding the performance I would like to comment that everything from acting to cinematography, from story to direction etc. is fabulous and appreciable. The film is better, in my view, that The Shawshank Redemption(1994), which, in IMDb, is the top rated movie. A must watch!!!

10 June 2016,Thank you Spielberg,"An incredibly insightful film concerning the Holocaust. Spielberg recreates the story of German businessman Oskar Schindler - a man that would not typically be associated with savings the lives of people, as far as the Nazis were concerned, considered to be enemies of the State. Such a contrast makes the film so moving combining the horrors of what was experienced by the ethnic minorities under Nazi persecution with insight as to the atrocities that occurred in the gas chambers and ghettos to the generous, gentle nature of respected German businessman Oskar Schindler.

A tribute that will remain to be one of the most encapsulating films based around a remarkable man saving thousands of lives amongst one of the most devastating regimes witnessed by human history. A film that is to never be forgotten just as the Holocaust never will be.

1 May 2001,Masterpiece,"Put your preconceptions about the director aside. Clear your mind of Hollywood prototypes and what could and should be added to this film. Just enjoy this masterpiece as a thematic work of art in which the acting is superb, the time period represented is real, and the story is a blend of sorrow, shame, and awe. This is the only movie that overcame my emotions, resulting in tears. It will leave you spellbound with its haunting soundtrack and black and white canvass. This movie is truly a masterpiece of filmmaking, and whether or not you liked it, it should be respected. I voted 10/10.

30 July 2003,"""Who are you? Moses?""","Extremely well written drama centered around the horrors taking place within the Holocaust of World War II. But, I don't think the Holocaust is entirely the point. The point is moral choice and the ability to choose freely even when everything around you has gone to hell; and a real hell at that.

So many millions lost their lives in the Holocaust, and for that I pay my respects. But is a film good simply because of it's subject matter? Some people seem to think so. But I don't. I think this particular film is good because of it's pace, good writing, good acting, and good music.

And surprisingly Spielberg attempts to create a style of his own here; unlike his plagiarizing Kurosowa's action film techniques. It's so subtle, but at times it is highly artistic for a Hollywood director.

Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as Amon Goeth - in probably the best performance of the entire film. It's brutal and he takes no prisoners. For which I feel he deserved the best supporting actor Oscar.

One nice moral point of the story is conveyed through showing the one little girl in red. In doing this the film suggests not to classify it as tragedy for the millions who died, but in terms of tragedy on purely personal levels for each of those 6 million (give or take) people. Each of them suffered, and each of them are remembered as such.

B+: Fans of actors, directors, or material should give it a look. It's worth your time.",10
16 December 2014,An excellent movie by a brilliant director,"Schindler's list is undoubtedly a great movie of all times. It depicts the most inhumane crimes of human history, the holocaust. The movie has everything you want to see in a good one. brilliant acting,stunning cinematography,Excellent direction and above all a real life story. I had watched this movie when i was 15. This movie had lasting effect on my mind and the scenes kept on moving in my mind for many days particularly the seen in which amon shoots the workers from his terrace like animals. The scene itself was so disturbing to watch as a kid. The film is a must watch for who looks for a movie with difference but its also a worth watching. Its one of the best Spielberg movie.

20 February 2006,Performance of Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler,"After having viewed this movie several times both in the theater and on cable TV, along with having seen my own copy on DVD I have always been quite impressed of the Oscar nominated performance by Liam Neeson. Now with all due respect to actor Tom Hanks who'd won for his role in ""Philadelphia"" I've always felt that the best actor honor should've gone to Liam Neeson. I don't recall the other nominated actors that year though his portrayal of Oskar Schindler was outstanding and very convincing. And besides the following year at the Oscar ceremony Tom Hanks won the top acting honors for ""Forrest Gump."" Furthermore I've always found that this movie at the time was really over-hyped back in 1994. And today I still consider this movie to be quite overrated! There are many fans of Tom Hanks who'll disagree and that's understandable. I'll even add that Liam Neeson was robbed of the best actor award. I've followed the history of the Jews, the Nazi party and WWII for many years and still hold this film in awe.

6 February 2014,powerful,"What can be said other than that one word...powerful.

Stephen Spielberg has done what others have tried before, but failed. He has brought the horrors of the holocaust to the masses.

I just watched this again for the first time in ten years or however long it's been. Not only is it relevant, but it's hard hitting and difficult to pull your eyes away from.

Fiennes, Neeson and Kingsley - how often do you get that group of actors? I urge everyone, no matter how young or how old to watch this. Though it's painful, it's a necessary reminder of what happened.

This is an excellent film in every way.

11 January 2015,"It looks, without ever averting its gaze, at the darkest of the dark.","In Schindler's List, children - Steven Spielberg's long-favored vehicles for expressions of hope and sunny confidence about humanity's future - rush toward an ominous line of waiting trucks.

In their exuberant innocence, the youngsters wave a farewell whose finality they cannot know as their parents stand helpless, paralyzed by the horror of what awaits their offspring. Like many scenes in Schindler's List, this parting becomes more than an indelible, wrenching moment of shared pain. It is rendered with a restraint and a prodigious film making technique that transform an image into an act of scarcely bearable communion for the audience. The empty uplift seems contrived after the devastating power of what precedes it. But this coda does not detract from a testament in which a man finds redemption in saving others, and a director at the height of his art preserves the past with magisterial authority and conviction.

25 March 2015,Very Moving Film,"Schindler's List has always stuck in my mind as a powerful film, and I knew that this was no ordinary movie when my parents let me watch it when I was only 13. They normally didn't allow me to watch R rated movies (they didn't even let me see PG-13 rated movies until I was 13). I of course was familiar with the holocaust from school, but this film really shows just how horrible the atrocities were that went on here. Mr. Schindler was a great man for what he did, and this film does an excellent job of honoring his memory. Schindler's list is about a man named Oskar Schindler who owned a factory in Germany during World War II. After seeing how Jews are treated in the concentration camps he feels deep sympathy for them and wants to do something, anything to help. So he gets the idea to convince the Germans that he needs more help in his factory to help with the war effort and that Jews would make excellent workers. So this allows him to save at least some of the Jews from the horrible fate of being in the camps.

3 October 2020,The List is Life,"Schindler's List a film by Steven Spielberg, with a great cast, excellent storyline, conceptual quotes(I really enjoyed dialogues) and lovely music is the best ever movie, not only about holocaust but also about humanity and about war in general. The genre is biography that I like that because I believe they are important. The movie, based on a novel by Thomas Keneally, shows how Oscar Schindler, a member of Nazi party, saved the life of thousands of Jews during the World War II. This film was shot is black and white, it is because of some reasons such as black and white (duality) stands for sorrow - influencing the feelings of the viewer in addition by using this method, spectator can feel this is about history, sorrowful history of course. Despite its long time, the movie is not even a little bit tedious. I wonder how the movie impressed me, in other words how the movie stunned me is adorable. While watching the movie, I was not in my room but I was completely in another world. You can find lessons of life, generosity, self-sacrifice and many other things in this film. ""Oskar Schindler: One more person. A person, Stern.""(Oskar regret why he cannot survive more people) My mind was engaged with the word ""A person"", do not look the number, here I realized the worth of humanity. ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire."" on the other side savagery and cruelty are shown as well. In most cases, films based on novels cannot be as well as the novels so as soon as I finished the film, I purchased the book. Do not miss it. Overall thanks to the cast. The cinema must proud to itself because of such movies.",10
11 November 2004,What can be said that has already been said,"This film just speaks of one thing importance ,the importance of remembering what happened and the importance of realizing that there is evil that we as ordinary people cannot really comprehend . Not only is this film done stylishly but it is made in such a way that you are captivated by everything that happens there are powerful performance all round from Liam Neesons portrayal of a warm ,charismatic and gregariuos human being to the other side of the mirror Ralph Fiennes Amon Goeth who is bereft of a soul a brilliant portrayal of a man who is cold and is not a human being and does not have any real identifiable human charteristics apart from evil and that is what I think the movie is about not only the terror and horror of a human tragedy and disaster but showing how people can be and the two sides of human nature

A terrific movie

19 February 2006,Powerful and essential movie.,"""Schindler's List"" is a powerful movie that is a reminder to the world of where hatred can lead to. The movie shows the Holocaust in the most powerful and confronting way possible. It doesn't hold back with its images or story. In that regard ""Schindler's List"" is a daring movie but the end result is more powerful than you could have ever imagined. The movie tells the true story of Nazi-party member Oskar Schindler, who as the war progresses sees more and more horrors of the Holacaust and decides to help the Jews in the best way possible for him.

""Schindler's List"" is honestly one of the movie powerful movies ever created. Since almost everything in the movie is based on true events it makes it all even more powerful. It's hard to imaging that these horrible things all actually truly occurred. The movie is filled with graphic, confronting and humiliating images. It provides the movie with some unforgettable sequences that will leave a lasting impression on you. Never has the Holocaust been brought to the silver screen in such a detailed and confronting way. Not everyone will be able to handle watching ""Schindler's List"". It really is not a movie for the faint of heart.

Spielberg delivers with this movie his most important and perhaps also most personal and best movie. The storytelling of the movie is perfect and the way it focuses on the many characters of the movie is spot-on. It follows many different Jewish characters who all had their different experiences.

Yes, the movie does become over-sentimental at times, especially toward the ending but in this case I forgive Spielberg. It in no way makes the movie any less powerful or meaningful. The message of the movie comes trough very hard and direct. Everyone should watch this movie, not only because it's such a good one but especially because it's a very important one.

The movie is filmed in black & white. I think main reason for this was to make the movie look less graphic, since the main essence of the movie should not be on the graphic images but on the confronting and realistic emotions of history. It's not a movie that tries to shock, it's a movie that confronts in a very direct way instead. Whatever the real true reason was for making the movie in black & white, it works really well for the movie its time period and atmosphere. The lighting of director of photography Janusz Kaminski is really phenomenal at times. Also the dramatic musical score by John Williams is impressive and makes some of the sequences work even extra powerful.

Also the acting is great in this movie. The Jewish persons are mostly played by unknown and unexperienced actors. It makes them. in their roles, extra credible and believable. We see them as persons, not as actors playing persons. That's also another reason why the movie works powerful, the characters are all very real. Not only the Jews but also the Nazi-Germans. The movie launched the careers of both Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. Liam Neeson is great as the main lead and Ralph Fiennes is truly chilling as the camp commander Amon Goeth. Another fine impressive role is being played by Ben Kingsley.

Among the best movies of the 20th century but more important, it's a very important movie that reminds us of what happened- and should never happen again.

11 December 2001,A powerful and very moving film. Spielberg at his best.,"Arguably Spielberg's finest film. The acting, direction & scripting are all superb. Spielberg's films sometimes suffer from being overly sentimental. Here he very wisely avoids sentimentality letting the story tell itself.

The unusual choice of black and white film helps here -- the film would not have had the same atmosphere shot in colour.

The protagonists in this story are all depicted as being thoroughly human, a fact which not only underlines the horror of the Nazi regime -- these were real people, not comic-book villains -- but also underlines the film's ultimately optimistic message. Even when humanity is acting at its most beastly, some people will find it within themselves to resist this and help others escape the worst of it. As the case of Schindler shows (he started out simply exploiting the situation for his own gain) this may sometimes spring from unexpected quarters.",10
17 January 2004,One of the absolute best!,"I do not give away plot details (nor do I understand why Anyone does!), let me say this: you will Not be disappointed. A truly great film, most will agree. Much better than the Piano in my mind. I'm sure the B & W hurt the box office, but Spielberg isn't concerned with that, was he?! For me, the B & W made it less intense (I'm nearly sure, that wasn't the main M.O.; probably done because Steven ""saw"" the past in B & W) & I was glad. I do wish to single out Liam Neeson & Ralph Fiennes for electrifying performances.

Can not be overly praised.

17 July 1999,Definetly worth seeing!,"I went out and saw this at the bargain theaters back a long time ago. Back then, I thought it was a excellent movie, well based on the life of one man and the lives he saved.

I got a chance to see it again recently and thought I might add my own comments to the mix. I found it a very good movie, however, it was slow in places for me. I felt myself getting real tired at some junctions in the movie.

I really love movies like this though. Liam played the part of his character very well and the plot was well defined. I would definetly see it again, but it isn't as good as other movies I have seen.

Brilliantly acted, masterfully directed, subtly-yet-beautifully written, and horrifically realistic, this excellent drama is one of my all-time favorite movies. Truly a showcase for the talent of all the people who worked on it, this is definitely cinematic art. A very important movie to see, and I do not use the word frivolously.

19 June 2007,Extremely Brilliant,"When I first saw that Spielberg was behind the movie, I had my doubts since his earlier work doesn't really fall into this category, but I held faith and I have not been disappointed! From the beginning it is such a powerful and moving film and it brought tears to my eyes more then once. It is completely set in Black & White, except for the Red Coat Girl which is pure genius, since it really helps develop the time period it was portrayed in.

The Actors too were completely fantastic! Every single actor and extra seemed to be doing their very best and really lived their roles, especially Ralph Fiennes, who was brilliant as the twisted Nazi Amon Goeth. Not just anyone could make that character real and get away with it. All of the characters in the film have depth and substance and the best thing was that you actually see a few of the Jewish people throughout the entire film so we can sympathize with their tale more.

It's a film to watch if you enjoy depth and meaning. 9 Stars, Excellent Film!",9
31 October 1999,A true masterpiece,"Schindler's List is one of the best movies I've ever seen, only Titanic and maybe a few more is better. Steven Spielberg's directing contributes a lot to that, and he certainly deserved the Oscar. When the story is about 1100 jews being saved from the terror of German nazism, compared to the number of 6 million jews being killed in the Second World War, it doesn't really sound like something gripping and touching. But by showing the destiny of a small number of people, we somehow get the whole picture anyway...Liam Neeson is great throughout the movie... Like I said, a true masterpiece...

It is also in my opinion Liam Neesons best role of his career. The film is shot brilliantly and is serene in black and white. Spielberg is truly a film genius.

If you haven't seen this film for any reason, give it a chance. It is a master piece. You wont regret it giving it a chance.

I know people who are not really fans of history but they give this film a chance and loved. I know chick flick loving girls who adore this film. So you see it truly is one for everyone.

9 November 2002,Overated and weak retelling of a tired theme...,"I admit, I have never been a big fan of Steven Spielberg. I must also admit however that I have a great deal of respect for his charming and subsequent brainwashing of Hollywood, and how easily he has made himself a brand name that always commands respect despite having made some of Hollywood's most overrated and tired films. With Schindler's List he truly created some powerful images, thought provoking and inciting in how they make you react...BUT... That's about where it ends. The talent of Steven lies in his ability to pull the strings of an audience, and in placing his propaganda so effectively, yet in this film with such a weak cast (other than Ralph Fiennes who was very effective as opposed to the generally weak and painful to watch Liam Neeson) and tired subject he breaks no new ground. Not to say it did not have its beautiful scenes, the executions and murders were poignant and well done, but lost much of their effect being coupled with so much overdone melodrama and sap. Its about time Hollywood wakes up, we need new directors who are bold yet sensible enough to know that there is no such thing as too far, but are intelligent enough to make a film that can rely on something other than pure shock, and that sometimes just a little is not enough and this is perfect evidence of that point. This film would have been excellent had a master such as Stanley Kubrick made it, but as it stands Schindlers List garners a 2 out of 10 in my eyes and is one of Spielberg's better films, but if nothing else its far superior to ET and the wretched Saving Private Ryan.",1
14 June 2020,Dramatically characterised depiction of the Holocaut that filled by sorrow as ever.,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",9
5 February 2009,In the top 10 of all time,This movie is Spielberg's best movie and that says a lot. His direction is flawless (although he was averse to direct it) as is the movie. The choice for black and white was great. Those who say its fictional and that isn't how it was and I have no idea what they are talking about. Nazis hated and killed Jews during WWII. Thats exactly what the movie shows and in the middle of it all was a man named Oscar Schindler who really did fool the Nazis by bribing them. His spent millions and saved thousands and it really happened. And Schindler knew a man named Amon Goeth who was a psycho Nazi. The men who played these guys played them as close to perfection as possible. Liam Neeson was fabulous as the man who first cared for nothing but money and his heart was changed after the horror he witnessed (but respectively lost to Tom Hanks for Philadelphia). Ralph Fiennes was great as the crazy Nazi and truly made the performance believable. This movie is probably the greatest movie of the 90s and should have reminded most people at the time that not all modern movies are sub par. The three hour and change epic goes up there with the greats.,10
5 September 2008,amazing,"When I put the DVD in and the menu came in I already knew that the soundtrack was going to be amazing and it was. I loved how the movie was in black and white and it really fit in with the story and how dull times were during the holocaust. If it had not been in black and white the movie wouldn't have been as good. The picture in this movie was so beautiful and the directing by Steven Spielberg was very good also. Im glad that this movie won a lot of Oscars. The acting by Liam Neeson and Ralph Phiennes was amazing but I can understand why Tom Hanks won that Oscar for Philadelphia.

This is one of those few movies that become so emotional near the end that its hard not to start crying. The ending scene gave me goosebumps everywhere. It sure deserves the 8.9 rating and I bet it has a very high score on rotten tomatoes. If I hadn't by mistake seen the second part of the movie first I bet I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more.

13 July 2007,Amazing Portrayal,"I saw this movie last night, I was so moved by the whole movie, although the first hour is talking, once you see what happens to the Jewish when they are done talking you begin to be afraid for them yourselves.

I think Speilburg's idea to use black and white is simply stunning as is his idea for The Little Girl In Red and the tiny bit of yellow in eyes, it adds so much more. The characters in this make the movie so much more realistic (I've heard they were in talks for Mel Gibson or Kevin Costner to lead) every bit of acting is great even the children that are only on screen for several seconds how they get fear in their eyes. The end, just ends everything so nicely because how else could you end such a tragedy?

So My rating- 10/10 See this movie.

24 December 2001,Perfection,"Few Films on this planet can meet the feeling you get from watching this film. An amazing amount of emotions run through your veins and its through this emotions we are manipulated into seeing through the eyes of Steven Spielberg's amazing vision. After seeing this film for first time I cannot tell you the amount respect I felt for Jews and my fellow person. This film makes you realise who you are and what we need to become to put our petty differences aside. Liam Neeson is magnificent, his portrayal of his character is perfect and he shows a softness and a love for people throughout the film and Liam Neeson portrays this perfectly, his character is a womaniser yet he is very aware of his faults and to the viewer its remarkable how much you can understand from him. Through the actors Steven Spielberg brings this epic to life. Ralph Fiennes one of Britain's amazing exports shows how a character can be consumed with hate and be able to survive with the things he has done. The acting in this film is creative and very very believable. Ralph represents the element of fear. As his character develops and matures we see that his character can change yet he doesn't want to. here is a amazing amount of subliminal messages which are put in this film and the viewer can identify with this everytime. Ben Kingsley is absolutely perfectly cast as he plays his role with an amazing amount of power and strength eventhough his role is supposed a very fragile person. he portrays this person perfectly, but allows the viewer to see the hope and the hate in others. This is how Spielberg not only has made the perfect film but he manipulates our fears and our truths and shows we can change, he does this in amazing fashion. 3 hours plus this film is short and its short because you cannot feel it, if you are prepared to give this film the chance it deserves. Its beautifully set and the black and white colour of the film portrays a meaning that only a viewer can interpret, Ill leave that to you.",10

26 October 2014,"All the pain and cruelty of war showed in it's best way, fighting for my favorite ever","The movie is truly dedicated to tell the true story of Oskar Schindler, giving us every detail of how he saved 1,100 Jews from their dead (this is not a spoiling this is what history says)

Using Liam Neeson for rolling Schindler's paper, Spielberg makes his most exciting, beautiful work full of pain, heartbreaking scenes a terrible but astonishing script.

The movie is almost 100% black and white, showing only a couple of minutes in color, but this minutes are absolutely necessary as every second in the whole movie.

And not only the story and the script of the movie are really great, also the cinematography is one of the bests ever made, it's full, uncolorful but marvelous, a kind of legend for the history.

In fact, Spielberg's List is terribly awesome and a treasure for the cinema history

¬®Power is when we have every justification to kill, and we don't¬®",10
2 August 2008,"Schindler's List, or How I Learned to Stop Profiteering and Love the Jews","Schindler's List is one of the most overrated films of all time: It won seven Oscars. It is the 6th highest rated film on IMDb. The critics loved it, and the Internet is flooded with reviews where people rave about being ""deeply moved"" or ""touched.""

Ultimately, the film is a shallow failure.

A good drama film needs several qualities. Of these, the most important is the exposition of characters and their interactions. Schindler's List flops spectacularly in this respect. We start out following the tale of Oskar Schindler, an opportunistic, profiteering businessman. But midpoint in the film, this Schindler persona has disappeared, and we have a new character clothed in the same flesh -- a self-sacrificing philanthropist who spends his entire amassed fortune to save the Jew workers. How did we get from one to the other? How did Schindler transform from the evil Mr. Hyde to the benevolent Dr. Jekyll? Steven Spielberg certainly doesn't show us -- maybe it happens via magic, like the bicycle ride in ET?

And what about Amon G√∂th, the representative Nazi? A ""grotesque caricature"" if there ever was one. He's an evil, sadistic, Jew-hating Nazi bastard -- but do we get to know why he wakes up every morning, takes a swig of booze and snipes Jew prisoners for fun? No. Spielberg thinks the answer is obvious -- he's a Nazi, and Nazis don't have reasons for the things they do. They're just rabid dogs out for blood, utterly devoid of any moral dimension. But this sort of shallow political correctness can't possibly cut any slack with intelligent viewers. We want to know why G√∂th hates the Jews so much that he fires his pistol into a pile of decimated corpses, but we never get to know. Apparently, he does it because he's an Evil Nazi, and that's all there is to it.

The attempt to add depth to G√∂th's character by dwelling on his twisted love affair with a Jewish girl is easily seen for what it is -- a cheap exposure of Nazi hypocrisy. How about trying to dwell on real issues here, Spielberg? How about trying to pass these people off as genuine (albeit twisted) human beings?

This shortcoming is not restricted to Spielberg. When will Hollywood own up to the fact that the men who ran the Third Reich were not mindless monsters? Some of them were cultivated intellectuals and scientists, others compassionate family men and devoted friends. Germany was the best educated country in Europe when the Nazis rose to power. The true intrigue of the Holocaust does not lie in the brutality, but rather in Hannah Arendt's ""banality of evil"". How can a man (or millions of men) arbitrarily narrow the moral sphere to exclude people seemingly no different from neighbours, friends and family? How can a man fall under the sway of a dispassionate and cruel ideology while leading a normal life of compassion?

Needless to say, none of these issues are explored by Spielberg.

Another peeve of mine: Accents. There are English-speaking films and then there are German-speaking films. Schindler's List, on the other hand, does not belong to either of these categories. Instead, Spielberg opted to have the characters speak English with a German accent. What the hell? Listening to Liam Neeson strut about trying to sound like an Anglicised German is just pathetic. : Spielberg's trying to please Hollywood audiences by making the film accessible to them (and hence, no spoken German), but for the love of God! We get the point! They're in Nazi Germany. Yes, Hitler's in charge. Yes, it's a nasty, genocidal regime. Please, no cheesy accents.

One of the truly unforgivable aspects of the film is the ending. A mildly touching speech by Schindler about being a war criminal on the run, wanted by the victors of the war, set just the right mood. It would have been perfect. But no, Spielberg couldn't resist messing it up -- he had to have Schindler break down, bawl and cry, grief-stricken and lashed by pangs of conscience. Spare me the anguish, Spielberg. The grief should have been that of the Jews, not Schindler.

When Schindler took off his gold ring and blubbers out ""I could have saved one more"", I experienced a feeling of mild revulsion. Look, the guy did a great job, he saved a lot of lives. No point in getting all worked up about the fact that he didn't literally sell the skin of his back to save people he didn't know.

What does this film leave us after 195 minutes of running time? Let's see:

* The Nazis were *Really Evil* * There was a man called Schindler who didn't care about anything but money at first, and then for some reason he started to care about saving the Jews.

Brilliant, Spielberg. Positively brilliant.

All of the above-mentioned flaws are bad enough -- but the way the film manipulates the viewer really takes the cake. Shots of emaciated, shaved potential Holocaust victims starving and screaming, with tragic violin music to boot. It has been done in many films before, and will be done again. It doesn't take skill for a film-maker to coerce the viewer into sorrow -- It takes skill to produce the same feelings without resorting to cheap, melodramatic trickery. The Pianist is a superb counter-example. A journey of the mind is so much more satisfying than a journey of the senses...

Like most of Spielberg's films, Schindler's List is technically outstanding. It captures the mood of wartime Germany perfectly. The sets, costumes and cinematography are all top-notch, and the acting is not too bad either. However, none of these things can overcome the fact that Spielberg is a director of extremely limited vision. His moral and intellectual depth is that of a child.

Stick to making films for children, Spielberg. Stick to making children's films. You're out of your depth.",5
20 October 1999,Is it just a movie?,"First I have to say that being born in Poland, I knew about holocaust since before I was 10. I guess only in Israel people are more aware of it. It is a very sensitive topic, and making a movie about how millions of people were exterminated in death camps seems like trivialising the topic. On the other hand criticizing the movie for it's factual faults is even more slippery nontheless. The movie itself is very good indeed, with great acting, memorable scenes, and overall very impressive. I remember that when the end credits started rolling people in the theater were very quiet, and didn't move. Many were shocked by the realism of this movie. It surely is one of the greatest movies ever, but Steven Spielberg intended it to be much more than just a movie. This is where I stop admiring his work.

Many will take this film's version of history as a fact. I'm talking about the way Poles were shown in SL. Mr. Spielberg presents us as hateful antisemitic creatures, and he does it so convincingly that if I didn't know any better I would surely believe it. The second issue is the gas chamber scene - in reality, none of the people who would enter the so called ""shower room"" would survive. And as for Oskar Schindler - he didn't consider himself as a man on the mission, not concerned about his profits at all. To sum it off - If you didn't see this movie, go see it.

But don't stop there, find some real live accounts of holocaust survivors.",9
13 March 2013,"a great story, and well directed!","Okay, what can I say about this movie that hasn't been said or isn't that obvious. This movie is the most heart-wrenching movie that I have ever experienced. I have always been a fan of Steven Spielberg. I would just about watch anything that he would direct. This is by far his biggest accomplishment...EVER. Everything is perfectly acted and perfectly shot. It is wonderfully scripted by Steven Zaillian, who in my opinion should keep continuing to write screenplays because he did a beautiful job. God a master piece that will let your tears go out, when i saw this film in my home i was surprised that a director had created such a motion picture not the best film ever but it gets to your heart, a film that is long but its worth watching the whole thing, i don't think that is the greatest film ever but yes is good, other films that show a great story is The Pianist which is one of my all time favorite films, you should watch that one its pretty good to.

25 December 2009,"Great, Not Just Great For You","Before I saw it, Schindler's List seemed to me to be spinach cinema; it's good for you, but you don't like it. I planned to watch it out of a sense of moral obligation rather than keen expectation. I knew its reputation and felt its importance bearing down on me heavily. I got the DVD. I put it in the player. I settled down. Within a few minutes something truly remarkable had happened: the movie had started working. It drew me in and held me there. I was solemn, but not depressed. I was absorbed, but not entertained. I was taught, but not preached to. This is not a conventional movie in any way. It does nothing you expect and many things you don't, but in the end exceeds all expectations.

1 March 2016,Very accurate Portrayal by Ralph Fiennes,"Schindler's List,in my opinion, was a very accurate portrayal of the man and war themselves. I enjoyed the cast and was very gripped in the story right from the beginning thru to the very end,and that doesn't happen very often. World War II was very complex, to begin with, and when Oscar Schindler assisted with placing Jewish People in jobs, in order to keep them out of the Concentration Camps, that was the nicest thing anyone had done for them in a long time. The people he placed appreciated it,and he was a good employer as well.His friends didn't realize he was doing this,and I don't think they would have themselves. When the Nazis came and took some of the people who worked for him, he tried everything to keep them out of the camps.

5 February 2010,A political message for an apolitical movie,"What an astounding movie. Spielberg is able to show the suffering of the Jewish people in a detailed and humanised way that makes their stories tangible. This movie took great efforts to show that each life is precious, and the sheer number of those murdered should not lead to ignoring that each person had a unique story. What is unfortunate for a movie that attempted to elucidate the amount of human suffering clear from any politics, is that a blatant political statement was made at the end. the line by the Russian officer, 'Don't go east, that's for sure. They hate you there. I wouldn't go west either, if I were you' when the Jews are freed is a clear attempt at a justification for a Jewish state. the entrance of politics could overshadow the othewise far-reaching message of the film, which is a human one. other then that, the movie was impressive at arousing a feeling of human sympathy and compassion.

23 February 2013,A Masterpiece in shades of Grey,"The Greatest masterpiece of veteran director Steven Spielberg, Schindler's List is an emotional and harrowing account of the Holocaust during the Second World War. The movie delves deep into the darkness of human heart and depicts the metamorphosis of a shrewd businessman and womanizer into the greatest philanthropists humanity has ever seen.

The movie is almost entirely shot in black and white which gives it a grim and timeless look, a remarkable effort by the cinematographer Janusz Kaminski.

The acting is brilliant. Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler has given his career best performance for which he received an Academy Award nomination. Ben Kingsley has also stood well with him in his role of his Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern. However, it is Ralph Fiennes who has stood apart in his portrayal of Amon Goeth, a sociopath Nazi officer without a moral code. Unfortunately, he did not win a well deserved Academy Award for supporting actor.

Furthermore, John Williams has come up with a brilliant score bringing out the misery, horror and tragedy of the Holocaust.

Schindler's List is Spielberg's unforgettable piece of art that makes one cry many times over, especially in the final moments of the three hour seventeen minute epic. Its a must watch.",10
3 October 2017,one of the best!,"this movie deserve 10/10 rating. it shows us what exactly happened during ww2 without shocking too much. this fact opens the movie to a bigger crowd who can watch and even learn about the suffer of the Jewish people in east Europe. this movie also teaches us about choices and not to include the individual according to characteristics such as social group and political views.

6 October 2016,The story of human spirit prevailing over such evil makes Schindler's List a simply incredible tale.,"Schindler's List Film Review

After viewing Schindler's List, there is only word to describe the film-Powerful. Steven Spielberg is able to take history, make it a gripping story, and bring it to the camera. The movie showcases the forgotten horrors of the Holocaust in such a dark way, at times, it can be hard to watch. However, this is one of those films that truly everyone should view at some point in life. Yes, from a filmmaking standpoint the movie is very good but the message proclaimed is even better. The story of human spirit prevailing over such evil makes Schindler's List a simply incredible tale. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is an up-and-coming businessman in Krakow, Germany planning to make a fortune at the start of WWII. Over time, he gains power and respect within the Nazi regime. He buys a factory and begins to mass-produce products the German military needs, hiring Jews from the local ghetto to make him a profit. Business begins to thrive until one day, the Nazi SS clears out the ghetto and sends all of the Jews to concentration camps. At first, Schindler attempts to get his workers back as he is only focused on making money for himself. However, as he witnesses the horrors occurring in the Krakow concentration camp, Schindler must make the decision to put his life-earnings second and make the lives of his innocent Jewish employees first, one life at a time. Steven Spielberg's goal was to make Schindler's List as simply as possible from a technological standpoint. There were no cranes, zoom lenses, or steadicam at all used in the film and the entire thing is in black and white. Spielberg's choice to make a black and white Holocaust film in a time when color film was the norm stands out and also enhances the movie. It creates a sense of horror and pure darkness that victims of the Holocaust actually faced while also making the movie gritty and brutal. For several hours, it took the emphasis away from the filmmaking industry and put it solely on the story. Every film is a product of its time and this is exactly what Spielberg was trying to accomplish. Historical accuracy cannot be the only thing that makes a movie special. It also takes quality actors that can give superb performances and Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are able to do exactly that. The two men are foils in the film, Neeson being the symbol of morality and Fiennes, the epitome of pure evil. In his performance, Neeson is able to embrace everything the real Oskar Schindler stood for. His character is believable, dynamic, and someone that an entire audience can feel for. Viewers can see how emotionally torn Schindler is. It is very impressive when an actor can become a man hated by so many. The task is certainly not easy. But Fiennes embraces his role as Amon Goeth, the despised Nazi in charge of the camp in Krakow. He becomes the man that killed so many and excels at doing it. The special effects are another element of the film that excels. Spielberg and his effects crew make each gunshot and fatal wound seem so real that it seems like each one is happening in real life right in front of the viewer. The scenes of death and violence provide realism that gruesomely hit hard. All of these elements allow Schindler's List to thrive both as a film and as an educatory device on the Holocaust. Some people were outraged by the movie saying it exposed women due to the amount of nudity on camera. Others stated that Spielberg made all of the Jews supporting characters with no real background instead of the main characters of the movie. Although these are among a few of many complaints, the movie truly has no flaws and is extremely well made. Unfortunately, this film cannot and should not be watched by some simply because of the pure evil and brutality depicted. Despite this, its importance in historical film is evident and needs to be seen so something incredibly evil can be learned from and therefore, never repeated. Steven Spielberg is considered one of the best directors ever and Schindler's List proves why. The film is worthy of a 10 out of 10.",10
17 June 2020,Prepare your tissues,"I don't cry while watching movies, but this one almost broke me. Spielberg is an genius and really knows how to capture your emotions. One of the greatest movies ever!

7 March 2002,This goes beyond being just a bad film.,"As possibly the world's most influential film-maker, Spielberg has a responsibility. And that responsibility entails NOT using his cheesy, shallow sensibilities to turn one of the most profoundly horrible parts of human history into a soap opera-style piece of fluff. This film is more than just a bad film, it is a downright dangerously bad film that will be watched by millions of impressionable people who might have had few other sources to base their knowledge of the Holocaust on. Most of us agree that the worst thing to do about something like the Holocaust is to forget it, lest it happen again. The next worst thing is to trivialise it to the point where it resembles so many other Hollywood pieces of trash.

What possesses a man who has become rich and powerful in the film industry solely through the making of shallow, transparent films for children to think that he is talented and wise enough to present to the masses a subject which should only be touched by the most careful and socially responsible hands? A Mid-life crisis, and an over-inflated ego, most likely, not that it matters though.

Only someone with many years of study may be a doctor; only an experienced engineer may build a bridge, and even the guy who fixes your toilet must be a qualified plumber. Yet this fool, whose only previous qualifications have been cheap, shallow, movies made strictly for entertainment, thinks he is in a rightful position to educate our children. Because, unfortunately, many people have a frighteningly limited amount of knowledge about the second world war, and Schindler's List will be for many of them their main source of information. Showing it to them in as cheesy and hollow a fashion as almost only Spielberg can, is simply a crime.",1
31 July 2001,A staying film,"well, again, it was R(A) here and i really guessed why when i watched it on VCD borrowed from my tutor. (maybe too many slaughters...but SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was not R(A)...) but i'm still glad that i was lucky enough to encounter this film. i've read the novel before so i roughly had an idea about the story, yet the movie impressed me. black-and-white filming is certainly a factor - as in TO KILL THE MOCKING BIRD - and i was totally drawn into the story and the acting, thinking of the scenes from the novel as i watched. and needless to comment on the little girl in red - as she moved down the staircase fading into darkness i was almost crying.

but when i say this film is 'staying' it doesn't only refer to the plot and the camera work. John William's music has to be mentioned for its sheer shattering beauty. years after i watched the movie i could still recall how the violin sang and cried when i played the theme on the piano.

26 January 2004,"Wonderful, horrible film.","This film shows how low human beings can go in their treatment of each other. It shows how deeply people can care about each other. It's all true and it clutches the heart strings like no other film I think I've ever seen.

This isn't a film where you leave on a massive high like watching superman when you were a kid, wanting to run and jump and shout all the way home. This film is dark. This film's hero starts as a shallow man intent on making money and not caring about how it happened. He is changed into something great and worthy by how he behaves when he becomes aware of the reality of circumstances around him.

Its gritty. It should be compulsory viewing. It's a wonderful film. But it really not going to cheer most people up.

14 September 1998,Staggering and Sublime,"Not only is this masterpiece the greatest film ever made, it can be considered one of mankind's greatest artistic achievements, to be compared with the best of Mozart, Shakespeare and Michelangelo. Using the subtle but startling shadings only black and white cinema can produce Steven Speilberg has created a protean achievement both thought-provoking and shattering in content and scope. Ralph Fiennes portrayal of the concentration camp commandant shows the horrifying side of a human both sad and twisted. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give performances equally compelling. John Williams musical score is flawless, evoking an emotional response without overcoming this disturbing story about a German industrialist who slowly learns about the Holocaust and tries to save the few Jews he can from certain death. This miraculous piece of cinema should be required viewing for anyone interested in the human condition and the depths and height to which we all can reach.

8 July 2012,A Cinematic Masterpiece From The Best Film Maker In History,"I first heard about this film through my Grandfather's reading of the book, and as a keen historian especially the 2 World War's, l was immediately drawn to viewing this film. As i sat down to watch this, l was told that this is one of the most powerful cinematic masterpieces of all time, it was hard to see it before the viewing, but after the viewing of this film, l have no doubt that this is one of the greatest films of all time. It captures the horrors of humanity and the best in humanity. All this in 1 film is almost impossible, but the genius Spielberg has done it somehow. This is his finest work, yes ET, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, all fantastic films, but Schindler's List is his finest work. The actors in this film are incredible. Liam Neeson in probably the performance of his well established career is the Protagonist Oskar Schindler. The Antagonist Amon Goeth portrayed by Ralph Fiennes is one of his best performances of his career is chilling as a brutal Nazi Guard. The story of Oskar Schindler had to be told and it was due to the incredible film making skills of Steven Spielberg, the best film maker of our generation if not of all time. All in all, this must go down as one of the greatest films of all time. I certainly enjoyed this movie. WARNING: Extremely graphic scenes, coarse language and violence. These graphic scenes were necessary though for Spielberg to convey to us the brutality of this horrible war.",10
13 August 2004,Is it REALLY beautiful?,"The simple answer to that one line summary is yes. As i read a review here once about this movie being beautiful and that's only too right. Of course it is very rough and violent, but then again it's a movie about war and about the oppression of a hole religion. The right thing to do by director Spielberg was to make this like a journalist would. And John William's music is too touching to describe.

Usually I dislike movies of great historical happenings or big battles and so on, but Schindler's List is an exception. Though it tells of Schindler himself, clearly the movie's real concern is the Jewish, not the one man who made that difference. And that is there as clear as it could be. What the Nazis did there on work and concentration camps is so shocking and this movie tells of that so shockingly as you can imagine. It even goes to sadistic measures with the character of Amon Goeth a bit too much at points maybe. But maybe not. That actually is the fact that makes this movie so powerful and interesting.

Schindler's List is one the best ever made because it is the prime of big movies. You just can't ignore all the perfectness of every single frame, shot, piece of music and of course that acting great too. But really as said this movie is about what happened during the holocaust, from the beginning to end. If you haven't seen this watch it now, because there are not many movies that match up to this. Truly and clearly the best picture of Steven Spielberg.",
3 March 2015,Amazing,"Guys this movie is really great.It is very realistic,it may long 3 hours but it draws your attention and you do not get tired.Also Liam Neeson is amazing,you may cry at the end!The Director has done an amazing job with his realistic scenes.The most important thing though it is that all these things-crimes have happened and people didn't pay much attention to these crimes.To be honest I believe that this movie is the best of the ones which had to do with Jews and the 2nd World War.I think after watching this movie your opinion about what has happened there will be effected and you will start seeing things differently.That's my opinion.

10 July 2021,Truly beautiful yet haunting movie,"I am a big fan of ww2 set movies, mainly because of how sad of a history it was and movies like these give insights of what might've it been like for those that lived through it. Honestly, this was one of the best.

8 November 2004,The most powerful movie you will ever see,"Schindler's List was by far the best movie of 1993, and it could vary well contend for title of ""greatest movie ever made."" This is because it was made to portray suffering of innocents at the hands of sadistic evil, and all that a lone good man can do to save them. Because this movie is so well made, directed, acted, etc., it nails its goal, and leaves the audience completely moved by the story it spent three hours witnessing.

The acting in this movie is tremendous, and winds up being crucial towards capturing the story's emotion. 1993 Best Actor should-have-been Liam Neeson, and Ben Kingsley, who should have walked away with a Best Supporting Actor award, steal the scene as the heroic Schindler and his good friend, right-hand man, businessman and (sometimes) sense of good, Itzhak Stern. Their performances, combined with the evil Ralph Fiennes injects into his role as the monstrous Amon Goeth, make for a film that rises above any other historical drama and is placed into the upper echelon of movies and masterpieces. The emotion, pain and suffering is all real, and when you combine this with superb acting and flawless directing, you wind up with a film that demonstrates completely the passion of the Holocaust. Schindler's List moves the viewer in a way no other movie has approached, it takes anyone with a heart and makes him or her recognize their emotions and feelings on the matter. This film is important, and should at some time be viewed by everybody.",10
2 May 2000,Extraordinary!,"CAREFUL- COMMENTS ON THE PLOT!!!

I don't much like to go ""high brow"", as it were, but this was recommended to me by my mum and after watching it my breath was taken away. I haven't felt this way since another Steven Spielberg film, ""Hook"" in 1991.

All the actors were really good- Liam Neeson (Star Wars) and his hidden attraction for his secretary, Ben Kingsley (Ghandi), Ralph Fiennes (Lawnmower man) sarcastically killing jews in his camp. And all with a cliffhanger ending- will they make it to the end of the war? As a final point, the soundtrack, by John Williams (ET) really left a lump in my throat.

Go and see this film- it'll make you think differently about war and human nature.

9 July 2000,"Memorable, Fantastic","I remember watching this film first in Year 9 History class whilst studying Nazism. We didn't get to finish it, and I had never been bothered to get it from the video store. Now, I'm glad I did.

At 3 hours long, Schindlers List is a forceful look at the true story of Oskar Schindler (brilliantly portrayed by Liam Neeson [Rob Roy, The Phantom Menace]) who saves Jews from extermination in concentration and death camps by way of putting them to work in his enamel ware factory. Although, it is confusing about whether he really wanted to save Jews or whether is was all about the money and the lifestyle: mistresses, drinking. This he shares with Commandent Amon Goeth (chillingly evil portrayal by Ralph Fiennes [ The English Patient, Quiz Show]). Amon is an exceedingly evil character, exampled by him standing on the balcony of his villa over looking Plazow forced labor camp and randomly shooting people with his sniper rifle. Ben Kingsly, well known for his role in 'Ghandi' gives an excellent performance of Itzhak Stern, a smart Jewish businessman, hired by Schindler to keep his factory in order.

This Oscar winning film is definately worth a look. Steven Spielberg outdoes himself and so does the cast *****/*****",10
15 March 2008,"""The list... is an absolute good. The list is life. All around its margins lies the gulf.""","I've seen this film countless times and I know I've said this before but this is still, to me not just the best film ever made but it is also the most powerful film ever made. The haunting complexity of this masterpiece can only have been so brilliantly delivered by a true master of cinema. Without question, Spielberg's masterpiece. And it's an it is exquisitely well made film. Spielberg's direction, the writing from Steven Zaillian, the editing from Michael Kahn, the cinematography from Janusz Kaminski, as always the hauntingly beautiful score from the great John Williams, the performances from Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Kingsley and every other cast member are all beyond perfection. Through this work of cinematic art I see what I believe is the motion picture masterpiece not only of the 1990's but of the late 20th century. Simply incredible and breathtaking motion picture.

10 June 2020,Great!,"This masterfully made film shines under the helm of Steven Spielberg and is a creative success on every level. The star-filled cast does not disappoint and each of the leading actors delivers moving, chilling and superb performances. The film is intense and makes an excellent use of all its visual resources to tell a powerful true story. Not a single minute is wasted in this very fine portrayal of the Holocaust and its horrors. It is a film with a heart. It is hard not to call it Spielberg's best film. There is one small scene that I never really found particularly satisfying and drags a little. Other than that, the film does everything it sets out to achieve. Objectively 'Schindler's List' is impeccably shot and justifies its status as an all-time classic.

2 February 2015,"Brilliant, a masterpiece","MASTERPIECE. By far, my favorite Holocaust movie so far. It depicts the horrors of the war and the Jewish nation's suffering and tragedy. It perfectly shows that there is nothing more valuable than human life, powerful and touching. Spielberg directed this movie superbly, and the work done by Janusz Kaminsky (director of photography) was magnificent. I must admit that I don't always pay attention to these details, but what was done in Schindler's List, captures your attention and is hard to ignore any detail. The performances are also pretty amazing, Liam Neeson's Oskar Schindler is perfectly interpreted. Every expression builds a man, who starts as an ambitious business owner, and eventually, turns into a compassionate man. Yet, my favorite performance was Ralph Fiennes as the cruel Nazi officer, Amon Goeth; twisted, cruel and believable. He creates a perfect villain. Great movie, shocking and heart-shifting.

7 July 2004,Spielberg delivers again,"This film is unique, inspiring, haunting, and ... well, long, all at once. It differentiates itself from all other movies that have so far been made about the Holocaust. Why? Little things like filming in black and white, John William's amazing score, and a look at the perspective of the Nazis, which is uncommon.

Not only is the story beautiful, but it is reinforced by wonderful performances from the actors, good dialogue and music.

Go see this movie. It will change the way you see things. It makes the victims of the Holocaust as well as the Nazis real people, instead of generalizing like our modern day does without knowing it.

6 March 2004,Split Personality,"To me this story of Schindler is a split personality of a film. On one hand its stark black and white photography and realistic view of life in the ghetto and the camp is a kick in the heart. The problem is what should have been a stark gripping in your face take on the Nazi destruction of those it hated is undercut by a classic MGM 1940's style photography in every other scene. I kept thinking one of the great directors of the period was making this and not Spielberg. To me it has always felt that Spielberg waffled on the subject because he feared what the reaction would be.

Its not a bad film, its just not the great one it wants to be.

12 January 2015,Best Movie Ever...Period.,"This is flat out the best movie I've ever seen. PERIOD. Its the most moving. Most horrific. Most true to life. Most in your face. Required watching. Nothing else comes close. This is the second time I've seen a movie in which nobody exited the theater during the credits. The first was Platoon (my second all time favorite movie). At the end of Platoon the audience sat quietly through the credits before anyone dared to get up and leave. But never before have I seen an entire audience rise in unison and give a standing ovation. And not for a minute or so, but during the entire length of the credits, as if Steven Spielberg himself was standing before us. Then absolute silence fell. Nobody could come up with the right words to say. We were stunned into utter complete and total silence as we stood absorbing what we had just seen, as if a modern day Mona Lisa had just been unveiled before our very eyes. BEST MOVIE EVER...PERIOD. Thank you Steven Spielberg for a job well done.

16 March 2016,Oskar Schindler: Good or Bad?,"At the beginning of this movie it was unclear to me whether Oskar Schindler was a good person or a bad person. Since he was German, my first instinct was that he was the enemy. However, as the plot progressed it was clear that he in fact was one of the good guys. He had an accountant who was Jewish but Oskar treated him like he was a human rather than a disposable creature. He also creates a list of Jews he wants to work for him and provides them with a safe work environment. He insists that he Rabbi carry out religious practices and take part in the sabbath. Schindler is unlike the other Germans portrayed in this movie, he is kind, accepting and overall a good person.

7 May 1999,Best movie ever!,"What can I say about this movie that will truly honor the masterpiece that it is? Well, to start with, I can say that this is by far the best movie I have ever seen. It stirs up numerous emotions inside me when ever I see it. Spielberg- being a jew himself- has in a remarkable way, managed to re-tell the story of the destiny of the WWII jews. One can almost believe he was there in person and lived through those years in the 40's.

Schindler's List works like magic on the screen. Of course the actors, Neeson, Kingsley and Fiennes in particular are tremendous, but what really makes this one the milestone that it is, is the fact that it is shot entirely (except a couple of min. at the very start of it) in black and white. This makes the viewers completely captivated on what's going on on the screen. It's almost as if we are being held in a state of believing we are in the movie ourselves. No other movie I've seen can I say have made me feel that way. Steven Spielberg finally got the reviews and critics he deserved for Schindler's List. He is truly the greatest Director of today. No one can disagree there I think. Make sure you all see this one soon, I promise you a movie so strong, you'll remember it for a long time to come.",10

3 March 2005,Definitely a modern masterpiece,"First of all it is a reminder of the crimes committed in the times of World war II, and second it is a homage to Schindler, something that he really deserved and he wasn't always recognized for what he did.

At the beginning of the story, Schindler is with no doubt another Nazi, with the same mentality of them, and so he decides to take double advantage of the war, not only manufacturing things for the armies but also hiring Jews to pay them less than he should , so his benefits were going to be spectacular, he really makes lots of money doing so, but with the course of the war he sees with his own eyes what was actually happening to the Jews and he begins to change his mind about that, it is true that the character played by Ben Kingsley helps to the change even though with a low profile, so that's when he realizes that he can save people instead of taking advantage of them, how? When he hires Jews he is automatically saving them from death, so he does so, but only in secret he knows the real reason of Jew-hiring otherwise, he would be accused of betrayal against the Germany.He even gets to pay money to the Nazi's to hire Jews, and that's when he makes a sacrifice and invests the money he made from the war, and so he proofs once again why he is worthy of acknowledgement.

All that is about the plot, but i have to say that the way Spielberg carries the story is really interesting and makes you stay still in front of the TV, he shows us a view of World War II from another perspective than the traditional of the battles, it shows us how much that group of people suffered in that particular period of history and why we shouldn't forget the past to don't make the same mistakes in a future.

First, when the movie is just beginning you wonder why is it in black and white, but then you realize it is some kind of history lesson, and Spielberg didn't actually need the colour for this movie, it had no special effects and was focused in the plot, and the development of it. In this movie he demonstrated why Cinema is considered as another art.

For all this is that this movie deserves to be with the greatests movies ever, and mainly because the story told is true and no fiction.",10
25 February 2005,"Schindler's List: Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.","Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, is based on the novel written by Thomas Keneally. At the height of WW II, the Jews are ordered to register their family members' names and relocate to major cities in Europe. They are forcibly pushed into an area of only sixteen square blocks, called as ghettos.

Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a Czech-born businessman and member of Nazi party, finds the war a suitable opportunity to make money. Schindler, the womanizer, appoints a Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), and assigns him to recruit the Jews, including beautiful women.

Schindler's metal factory is the haven for the thousands of Jews to escape from the merciless Nazis. He slowly changes his attitude towards Jews and even persuades ruthless Nazi officer Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) to show his humane face. At a time, when the fierce battle is ravaging Europe, Schindler make his list of Jews to transport them to his hometown. Schindler risks his life and goes bankrupt to save more than 1,000 Jews from certain death in concentration camps. Today, more than six thousand descendants of the Schindler's Jews are living in different parts of the world with his memory.

Nominated for 12 categories, Schindler's List won 7 Oscars.

Thomas Keneally's novel 'Schindler's Ark' is based on interviews with 50 Schindler survivors as well as other written testimonies and sources. To gather costumes for 20,000 extras, the costume designer took out advertisements seeking clothes. When permission denied to shoot the death camp inside Auschwitz, a mirror-image set was created outside the real location. The highly acclaimed, touching drama is the only movie from 90's ranked in American Film Institute's top ten list. Spielberg called Schindler's List 'the most satisfying experience of his career.' Steven Spielberg's emotionally packed melodrama drenches us in tears with its realistic creation of sorrowful Holocaust days.",
19 March 2002,One of the Best!,"I've just seen this movie for the first time last week, and I think it is absolutely marvellous. As part of a project for school, I have chosen to do the Holocaust. I decided to see this movie, ""Schindler's List"" because I heard about it from many different people and I was interested and wanted to see it. I think that I was touched when I saw it. It was sad and yet I learned alot from it.

I think Liam Neeson did an excellent job as Oskar Schindler. I give this movie 5 stars!!

11 December 2005,A Holocaust Spectacular,"If you could call a holocaust movie spectacular, then this would be the one. The Holocaust was a period in human history that should never have happened, yet it has become the most reported on in all of human history. In Schindler's List we see only a small portion of Hitler's ""Final Solution"", the plot to eradicate a segment of humankind from the face of the earth. We see a businessman who wants to make money out of war, dealing with a sick Nazi, who only cares about doing his duty, trying to survive a world war. Eventually we see how the Nazi mentality takes over the soldier, and how a man finally realizes the inhumanity of the regime he is serving. The fitting portion of Schindler's realization is when he holds the ""Nazi Party Pin"" in his hand and realizes he could have freed a few more people for that small piece of gold. This is a movie that all should watch and wonder how each one can contribute to the humanization of this world of ours.

5 June 2022,There will always be good people,"Personal/Plot: (What film was about/enjoyability?) I enjoyed this film despite the horrors shown on screen. The film depicts the 6 year struggle that jews in Krakow, Poland endured under Nazi rule. 2/2

Aesthetic/Cinematography: (How film was made?) Whenever I watch a black and white film, I always find it being beautiful. The reason being is because you can play around with gray color gradients and even, as seen with the little girl in red, throw in some color that catches your eye and keeps its attention. 2/2

Spiritual/Ending: (Beauty of film/inspire towards the transcendent) Spielberg threw the duality of Amon and Oskar in my face as soon as Amon stepped on screen. You can look at attitude during dinners, general hygiene, kindness, love towards others, etc. If you watch the movie, you don't need me to explain how Spielberg brilliantly contrasts the two individuals and how they exist in a time full of death. Another aspect that I thought was beautifully executed was schindlers development from being an industrialist set on profit to a man who understands/acts for jews in a time of persecution. Gives me hope that at any time in human history, regardless of the pressures and evils in power, people can still have the ability to be good. I also audible gasped at different points during the film when I saw how Jews were forced to do nasty things to survive (the toilet scene with the kid). 2/2

Acting: (Can I do it better?) Honestly, Liam Neeson went crazy in this movie. From the very beginning he did an excellent job of portraying a classy and likeable industrialist. His acting was great the enitre movie, but the 1 more scene at the end was his peak in terms of acting. However, Ralph Fiennes played an amazing antagonist the entire time, and should get an award for his acting. 2/2

Score/Music: (Goosebumps/complement scenes?) Great music. 1/1

Recommend/Rewatch: I would recommend this, but I would not rewatch as it hurts your soul seeing other humans commit atrocities to each other. 0.5/1

Pacing: (Bearable?) Despite this being a 3 hour long movie, it wasn't intolerable, but it wasn't easy. 1/1

Total: 9.5/10.",10
14 August 2007,Perhaps the greatest film I have ever seen.,"I never thought that Schindler's List was going to be as good as it was when I first watched the movie. A year later it is still amazing how much this movie impacted me. It's hard to put into words how perfect this movie was, which is why this review will seem very simple. Yet, I guess that perfect is the exact word for Schindler's List. It is beyond me how some people do not like this masterpiece or how some people do not think that the Holocaust happened. To the people who do not like this film, you do not know what a movie is and are probably to busy watching movies like Epic Movie. And to those think the Holocaust never happened, well than you just go on believing that BS, cause it did happen. All I know is that this is the only real movie that has brought me to tears. Truly a perfect movie that I am not sure will ever be surpassed.

18 January 2007,A realistic film that should be shown in history classes,"To me this is clearly Steven Spielberg's greatest film. It is far reaching, intelligent and historic and it addresses a sensitive issue in a meaningful way. The choice of black and white (with one hint of red) was brilliant and added a darkness that was truly dire. The film also gave a feeling of the European Jews and the Nazi's as human and not statistics. The Goetz was a psychopath but a lot of Nazi's were historically. The SS welcomed people with violence problems and obsessions. The whole regime was run by dark eccentrics and uber-patriots with a chip on their shoulder. I felt that this was history in a way that other films (the Piano not included) did not make me feel.

27 June 2001,Required viewing,"No more analysis need be done on this movie. My wife and I firmly believe this should be required viewing in schools. As much as there is literary license taken within the movie, it yet illustrates, more than any other movie in memory (with, perhaps, the exception of The Sorrow and the Pity) the inhumanity and reality of life (and death) in Europe during WWII. This is a lesson that needs to be well understood and never forgotten.

1 January 2017,Spielberg's masterpiece! The best holocaust movie ever.,"This movie has showed how legendary Steven Spielberg is. He did an outstanding performance directing it. The idea of making it in black and white was pure genius, it showed how life was drained during the holocaust. Superb acting by everyone especially Ralph Fiennes. And I have to say it again Spielberg did a legendary job!!! The story being real made the movie more interesting and more sad and dramatic than it is. Some people called it the saddest movie ever made and one of the most influential biographies ever told.

A bold and daring movie that had o be forbidden in many countries for its realism and showing the cruelty of the Nazis.

Watch for yourself and see Spielberg's greatness.

9 June 2005,Finest Film of Steven Spielberg,"With no doubt this is an excellent movie about love, hate and nearly all emotions about human nature. i saw this movie 7 times and i always get stunned and shocked by the performances of all the actors. In my opinion Liam Neeson could have win the Oscar for this role, he was just fantastic and this was the first movie i ever watched of this actor and after watching his other movies , i couldn't find him that good as he was in this film. This is a masterpiece made by Spielberg.The black and white color makes u feel in that world and i think the movie would not be good in color as it is in back and white.

This movie has three strong performances and i gave this movie 10 out of 10.

22 January 2004,Unseen Importance,"Everyone knows the importance of this film. Some of the moods and feelings that this movie produces cannot even be put into words. But perhaps the most important thing I've seen this movie produce was in the person of Byron Smith. Byron was a Lieutenant in USA's neo-nazi movement. He was your typical tatooed skinhead. I met him during a prison visit where I was doing volunteer work. I have met many of these people and he was the most devoted and intense. He watched Schindler's List to prove to others that he could do so without being affected by the 'lies' it contained; Byron was wrong. This movie changed his life. Since his release he tours the country paying visits to skinhead and nazi groups with a DVD player and a well worn copy of this movie. They listen to him because he still has the tattoos and knows how to reach these people. Take away everything this movie has accomplished and changed save for Byron Smith and it was still worth all the money, time and sacrafice it took to create.

2 August 2005,A powerful and compulsive epic like no other!,"Throughout the history of historical drama's, Schindler's List has been recognised as the most powerful and emotionally distressing film ever made. The film tells the amazing and capturing story of Oscar Schindler who was an experienced war profiteer and was incidentally a member of the infamous Nazi party, but it is the incredible triumph of one man who saw through the brutal demise of his comrades and therefore committed himself to give him up his livelihood to save the lives of 1,100 Jews. Schindler's List is the one and only film that explores the triumph of this one man who has saved generations and the film itself has become the most compulsive drama ever made. The most realistic thing about this epic is the camera work, in order to make the film look more realistic to the times, Steven Spielberg wanted the film to be filmed in black & white, the ending sequence was actually considered to be unusual as the survivors from the Holocaust do the vow to commemorate Oscar Schindler by placing rocks on his grave which is considered to be an old Jewish tradition. Due to the authenticity of the film, Schindler's List garnered an astounding 7 Academy Awards and has now been recognised as the most greatest epic ever made.",10

I don't cry after i watch movies, because a i am not that touchy, but after this movie, i let the tear go every time i watch the end of the film!! Today its a movie everyone should see, maybe more than ever. This movie, along with a couple of other should be mandatory in our schools, just so that our kids, and the future generations never forget the atrocities that was done to the Jews, gay people, Gypsies, blacks etc during that war.

But it isn't enough to make a cinema masterpiece. Schindler's list gives to the public all what he may expect from a movie.(drama, great feelings and emotion) Spielberg has reinvented the Greek epoch Tragedy.

I've never been so moved by a movie.Moreover,Spielberg takes the public into a deep introspection about Humankind... Just go and see it! (It's an obligation).

21 August 1999,So Sad,"I saw this alone. I arrived right before the film started and found a seat in the front row. It was so close, I had to tilt my head back to see and fight a sense of vertigo.

After it was over, I just sat there in the theater until they came to sweep out the popcorn. This isn't a movie you want to see over and over again, but you'll want to see it at least once.

The dark, much talked-about cinematography and the Itzhak Perlman's sublime violin work are so, so sad. Ralph Fiennes is the very personification of human evil; Liam Neeson (as Schindler) is an opportunistic war profiteer. He doesn't have any grand epiphany or sympathy for the Jews. He just knows somewhere that he has to help how he can - despite his fear and greed.

Like Saving Private Ryan, however, the core of the movie's power is the documentary-like scenes that bring home the atrocities we've heard about our whole lives, but never maybe never FELT like this.",10

4 February 2000,Truly remarkable,"Little more can be said about how wonderful this film is, but I just wanted to note that the handing out of the Best Supporting Actor Award to Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive in lieu of Ralph Fiennes has to be one of the, if not *the* (Titanic's awards notwithstanding), greatest injustice in Oscar History.

6 December 1999,"Despite some flaws, one of modern moviemakings best","Schindler's List was Spielberg's confirmation as one of America's best storytellers. Despite Spielberg's extraordinary body of work, straight drama was one of his shall we say, less successful line of storytelling. Yes, The Color Purple was a fine film, but at times it showed Spielberg's desire to overendow the viewer with his good intentions. This was also the case with his Empire of the sun.

Spielberg doesn't seem to believe in evil, unless it is cardbox evil as in Raiders... So, how do you tell a story about evil without going overboard and try to usurp the viewers with your statement?

Spielberg used the best way of storytelling. He based his film on characters and not around scenes or plotlines. His characters flourish as the story enfolds them. Yet on two occasions in the film Spielberg forgets about his storyline and inserts two scenes to portray the real persona of his story. First, you have a scene where Ralph Fiennes shows his affection for his young housemaid. Obviously Spielberg's intent was to show us the nature of this character. Unfortunatly this doesn't work, because from our own backround and the story itself, we know the nature of that character and this scene breaks the rhythm and the credibility of his story. The second scene is the end, where cast and crew present their respect to the dead. This is all nice and well, but it makes you realize that you've been watching a piece of fiction and therefore the movie loses some of it's unbearable strength.

Visualy the film is Spielberg's best and once again he states himself as an extraordinary actors director. Pitty that Spielberg has that desire to tell us more than we need to know. But despite these flaws Schindler's List ranks among the best of modern moviemaking.",8
18 July 2012,Totally recommended,"""Liam Neeson continues to amaze me i feel i am his latest victim top notch performance in"" Shindler's List""(1993) totally different from his current action hero image what a versatile actor , this movie send u right back to the Nazi exploitation era it makes u feel that u are present their & makes u to revolt against the exploitation,its been black & white makes it realistic , one cant miss how beautifully everything turns colorful in the end when Jews come to honor Schindler's grave , this movie taken 7 Oscar is not meant for entertaining u with mindless plot & it is a brilliant example of how a true event can be told so if u are interested only to get entertained better watch something else :) ""

28 January 1999,A work of art.,"Schindler's List is one of those movies that elicits such a strong reaction not only the first time one sees it, but every subsequent time that people often respond without fully being able to think through what they are saying. Personally, it is one of my favorites, as I have emerged from each viewing of it exhausted, torn, and enlightened from an experience explores many sides of humanity during one of the most terrifying times in recent history. Some, however, have responded very negatively to what they term historical inaccuracies, lack of focus on the real issues, or for others, overblown sentimentality. Not being Spielberg, I have no idea what his intentions were, but I would argue that no single movie can ever truly capture the experience of an entire continent during a six year period or war, much less a 13 year period of Nazi rule in Germany. Regardless of how incredible Schindler's List is, it should only be the first of many Holocaust movies to be made. Thus, I agree with people who argue that there was more to the Holocaust than this film, but to not recognize the greatness of this film for that reason is simply ridiculous. This movie explores human nature, therein lies its true greatness. It asks each and every one of us to search the depths of our character, and ask ourselves what we would do in a situation where our moral, spiritual, and physical beings were threatened from every direction. Do we really expect film to be reality? I don't. I go to movies to make me think, to make me look inward and learn something about myself, to tell explore a part of reality that I had not ever seen before. Schindler's List does exactly this better than almost any other film through nearly flawless acting, beautiful cinematography, and a fantastic story, historically accurate or not. I don't want to relive the Holocaust, I consider myself quite fortunate that I have never had, and hopefully never will have, to make the decisions facing either Stern, Goethe, or Schindler. Instead, the Holocaust should be taught and learned about to discover more about humanity, hopefully to reach an understanding of ourselves that we can use in the future. That's what this film does; it's a work of art.",
1 February 2000,an unbelieveable account of the truth,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"".

It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",10
2 July 2000,Schindler's List is one of the best films about WWII,"Rating: 9/10

Schindler's List takes place during World War II. It revolves around the Germans and the Jewish Ghettos. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is an influential business man in the Nazi party, looking to make an enormous profit due to the was. Schindler brings several hundred Jews onto his work crew and starts manufacturing. Schindler runs into trouble a few times with keeping his work crew from being killed by Nazi rule and their general way of running things. Schindler hires a jewish accountant to run his business for him and keep track if the business. The focus of the movie revolves around Schindler's relationship with his workers and their struggle through the war.

Schindler's List is a black and white movie which turns a lot of people off, however it was a wonderful concept that was executed very well. Schindler's List made more of an impact being in black and white. It gave the movie more of a sense of actually being involved in the war era. Spielberg did a good job at directing this movie, but could have altered a few things to make the movie less awkward and more focused. For instance, there were a few shots of nudity that were completely unnecessary and could have been avoided and modified and still effectively portray the concept being presented. The nudity with a few individual lovers of Nazi members, for this movie, took the film from an engaging story with meaning to a meaningless question and cheap entertainment thrown in to captivate the audience. In my opinion the film did not need to be ""perked up"" to keep the audience awake. However, there was mass nudity during a few scenes, both male and female, which I felt was completely necessary and helped in presenting a more real illustration of the camps the jews were forced to dwell in. Schindler's List was an excellent film that did an extraordinary job at portraying the Jewish struggle and Nazi politics during World War II.",9
31 July 2013,A milestone in cinema,"This film IS a masterpiece! Spielberg infused his camera-work with urgency and attention to detail and he never strays away from horrific images, and then he films them just enough so they make an impact, never over the top... This is a rare movie which genuinely made me feel sad, happy, anxious and horrified in one afternoon, I can't think of an able counterpart... Late Mr. Ebert told in his review that Fiennes plays it too demented, as if the whole Nazi movement could be simply branded as evil- I disagree, it's subtle nuances in Fiennes's performance that show you how complex these characters really were.Cold, psychotic, resolute on the outside and torn apart with his lust for Jewish girl and the hardwired need to hate her people... It's incredible just how he pulls it off; In my opinion he made the movie, it wouldn't have worked with some other random actor.And not to say that I'm trying to justify Nazi movement, on the contrary, I'm only saying these people need to be understood and their actions put in a greater context, maybe Amon is a bad example, but a lot of those foot soldiers were just following orders. We can't just tag them as evil, as that's not enough, don't forget- they were able to seduce a complete nation, you can't do that just by playing evil, other factors come into play.It is exhausting movie to sit through, but in a good way, I would urge everyone ,as I have my complete family, to watch this milestone in cinema, such is its cultural impact... Only by watching this film and then dissecting it, can we truly appreciate its message- we are not born evil, we become evil when we fall under someone's spell and who intricately covers our eyes, by blaming everything that is wrong with our world, onto someone who is an easy target and can't defend for themselves... Only by including this film into mandatory school viewing can we only prevent that horrible event from happening ever again. People must understand, it's the only way to go about it...",10
14 May 2000,Moving and timeless,"I can honestly say that this is one of the truly great films. The way it creates and image of one of the most tragic periods of human history both educates and moves us as well as providing a fitting testament to those who died, and because it deals with a subject which will never be forgotten it is a film which will always be relevant, thus making it a timeless work which throughly deserves the recognition that it received.

25 December 1998,Very impressive,"Everything about Schindler's List is impressive. Never before have I seen a more painful portrayal of the Holocaust. The horrible images about the humiliation, the fears and the pain of the Jews are combined with the extraordinary absorbing story about Oskar Schindler, great camerawork, music and acting, both from the principal characters as the minor characters. A quiet, but nevertheless very impressive scene was the one in which the personal belongings of the Jews, who just had been put on transport, were sorted out. The first time I saw Schindler's List, this shot just seemed to go on and on, and thus gave me an idea of the enormous extent of what happened to the Jewish people. We witness how war can bring out the worst in men, like it did in Amon Goeth. Men like him were given the power, the opportunity, to develop the evil qualities in their characters. Luckily, Spielberg didn't portray only the evil side of Goeth, he also showed his audience that this horrible man still was capable of feeling something for another human being, even though he didn't want himself to. Thanks to the superb performance of Ralph Fiennes, the Amon Goeth character is in every way believable. We see how war also can bring out the best in men, like it did in Oskar Schindler. Spielberg very subtly develops the relationship between Schindler and Stern. They both know Schindler's feelings changed during the war, but neither of them talks about that. But still, the audience knows, just as Schindler and Stern know. Liam Neeson was very impressive, Ben Kingsley gave one of the best performances in movie history. Many people say that Saving Private Ryan is Spielberg's best movie, but I don't agree. Schindler's List has much more depth, and touched me far more deeply. It's a real masterpiece. A tip: Read the book! It gives a lot of details Spielberg couldn't show us, because of the limited length of the movie. It's worth your effort.",10
26 May 2016,Perfection.,"Unlike the film, I'm going to make this review short and sweet. Schindler's List is the single greatest film I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. It has brilliant casting with Liam Neeson taking on the role of Oskar Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, and Embeth Davidtz as Helen Davidtz. All four put on outstanding performances, but personally I'd say Ralph Fiennes gives his best performance of all time in this film. He displays the beautiful struggle of a man who does the unthinkable without thinking, yet behind closed doors fights with an inner turmoil. The cinematic decisions made in this film also pay off brilliantly. The choice to keep a large portion of the film in black and white adds to the authenticity of the piece, yet the subtle colouring of the little girl in the red dress adds emphasis just where it needs to be. Aside from all the details, the story is one of few that really got to me, and in the end that is why I must say it is the greatest movie of all time.

15 June 2020,Schindler's List,"In the film, Schindler doesn't start out as a hero. Why he ends up as a hero is not explained. Mr. Spielberg employs a small symbolic effect: the little girl in the red dress, whose conviction is reinforced every time Mr. Schindler looks at her. She symbolizes the innocent and fragile life, as well as the courage and power to defeat evil, and is the only color in the film.

24 April 1999,Black and White,"I've watched this film about half a dozen times over the last five years and I still don't really understand what Spielberg was trying to do. Was he trying to outline the horrors of the holocaust or was he trying to examine Schindler himself - why the man did what he did? Maybe both. In neither case does he succeed. One can't help but feel the atrocities were greatly toned down for this film thus not really reflecting the true horror of what really happened, and he fails completely in exploring the character of Schindler. Why did Schindler do what he did? The man was a philanderer and a shrewd business man who didn't exactly go out of his way to be nice. Did witnessing what he did make him wake up to himself or perhaps there was an ulterior motive? Spielberg looks at none of this and serves up a modern day saint. It is kind of ironic that Spielberg shot this movie in black and white because that is the approach he has taken to his subject material. He gives us the saintly Schindler, the stereotypical evil Nazi, the honourable Jew and none of the complexities that made these people what they are. This was Spielberg's attempt to become accepted as a serious film-maker but yet he takes exactly the same approach to making this as he did with his marvellous popcorn movies resulting in a rather dictatorial film that has more answers than questions!",1

18 January 2023,The best movie ever made on this topic,"At least from the western world film industry. Because behind the iron curtain, between the fifties and seventies, for instance from Poland or Czechoslovakia, you had several gems also speaking of extermination camps, all made in black and white too, and terrific, but unknown for the bulk of western Europe and US audiences. So Steven Spielberg chose to evoke this painful part of the human history. It is purely magnificent, despite its subject, this unbearable, horrible topic. Liam Neeson gives here his best performance ever. Forget the movies which he stars in now; forget those craps and remember him in SCHINDLER'S LIST. The same for Raplh Fiennes. I will never forget the dialogues lines when Neeson's character says to Fiennes' one that power, the absolute definition of power, consists precisely to show it without applying it, without using it. Ralph Fiennes who is here the Nazi commandant of the extermination camp, who takes pleasure by killing Jews when he wakes up, after or before peeing. This sentence summarizes all the relationship, the balance of power between those two men. Outstanding. Unforgettable.

It starts slow and builds and builds. After five minutes it will not let you go until the end. The actors with the actual people they portrayed was a nice touch.

The girl in the red coat was a true master work. One single identifiable story amonst the fog of war and atrocity. It made the entire envent more personal and gripping.

If you have not seen it you must. At least once.

7 September 2008,An Exceptional Masterpiece...,"Schindler's List is an undeniably the greatest drama epic ever displayed on the silver screen. The film was an institution in itself. Steven Spielberg endeavors with all his strengths to bring alive a magnificent script rendered by Steven Zaillian. Even though based on a book by Thomas Keneally, Steven Zaillian puts in a lot of effort mingling the originality of the book with the actual events of Holocaust. Brilliance begins from the very first frame of the film and doesn't end until the end credits. Liam Neeson delivers a wonderful performance, very believable. Ben Kingsley offers an equivalent performance. Ralph Fiennes is very good in his role. The emotions portrayed in this work of art are tremendously related to every human that exists in the world. I'm sure every bit of audience had felt the impact this film leaves by its concept. The aura of the film leaves the audience pondering after its end. Overall an exceptional film that leaves the audience with pain in the heart and tears in the eyes.

""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.""",10
26 April 1999,The Greatest Film I have Seen,"This is a work of art. Not only that it proves that Spielberg is a great director. I first saw this movie when it came out. I was twelve and even then I was impressed. This also managed to bring out some of the greatest acting I have seen. Liam Neeson was perfect for the role. He brought strength that no other actor could. Ralph Fiennes was at least equal if not better. He created one of the greatest villains in history. Yet he brought the human touch to the role. It was the saddest movie that I have ever seen and the most important. Spielberg has created a masterpiece that will be remembered for many years.

21 May 1999,Spielberg's masterpiece to the darkest epoch in human history.,"I saw this movie in Nevada when it first came out and since i am a german, it touched me probably even more than the whole audience. During the intermission two americans were standing next to me talking to each other.""This cannot be true"", ""No, Spielberg probably exaggerated, it is Hollywood"" That touched me even more. Spielberg showed the Holocaust as true as it was, as brutal as it was and as merciless as it was. It is an awesome movie to learn about history, since in school everything is only from books and so far away. Spielberg did the same in Saving Private Ryan, Another way of teaching people abou that period of time. We owe Steven Spielberg a lot. He keeps history alive and let us not forget.

17 June 2002,Speilberg's Masterpiece,"This is as close to perfect as films get. I was overwhelmed by this film from beginning to end. Spielberg really grew up with this project and created a true masterpiece. From the story, cinematography, acting and music, this film gets it all right. I would not change a thing. Brilliant.

27 December 2001,Words can not describe...,"I don't think I can tell you how wonderful this movie is..... but I will try. So here is the basic stuff. The movie is too good to be true, the acting, the cinematography, the directing, the story..... but is a true story. One that will bring you to tears on any day. The girl in the red dress was a tearjerker. Where as most movies will not show that children die too, it did. If you haven't seen this movie I advise you do so.

18 October 2008,The greatest portrayal of the holocaust!!,"Schindler's list is a very powerful and emotional portrayal of the Holocaust and no other films or documentaries have portrayed the sufferings of the Holocaust in such fine detail. It is beautifully directed film with some incredible performance(Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes) including with the soundtrack of John Williams which is another aspect of the film that is beautifully done. there can be no errors found in this film and is such a powerful and moving film that should appeal to any adult.

This film is surely on my top ten, might even be my second favourite film of all time!!!! Overall this film is a masterpiece and will be remembered for ever as an epic Steven Spielberg directed.

22 November 2002,Injustice at the Oscars,"An actor usually has that perfect role when he excels only once in his/her career, Liam Neeson portrayal of Oskar Schindler was such a role and was the best performance of that year.

For Hollywood to give this award to Tom Hanks in Philadelphia for political/sentimental reasons is nothing short of a disgrace.

Don't you think it is funny that the film (Philadelphia) is never mentioned when anyone is ever talking about great movies and great performances, is everyone embarrassed?

It is no wonder that people don't think much of the Oscars.

20 July 2016,"Spielberg makes a masterpiece for the times, driven by emotion and loyalty towards history, it's victims and characters.","Steven Spielberg is a known director. Most of his works focus on adventures, genre movies, be it with children, explorers or Extra- Terrestrial beings. So, when Spielberg decides to focus on historical dramas, usually based on true events, we can see the full array of his abilities and capacities.

Schindler's List is a movie that occurs during the holocaust, and this time period serves as background for characters study. Spielberg was smart enough to realize that such a theme could not be tackled head on. Instead, the focus is on the humans of the time. Why they did what they did, how could they and, specially, how they endured it.

The narrative focus on the actions of ""entrepreneur"" Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson). How he dealt with the holocaust and how he was touched by the Jews situation after seeing their torment and suffering. He had to take care to not have such a feeling be discovered by any of his many Nazi friends, such as Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes).

Being a Jew himself, Spielberg finds the fine line between homage to those who died and survived without falling in any melodrama. Spielberg is, above all, a director. And a director has only one obligation: to make a good film. Even though directors are human beings, Spielberg is professional enough to know how much he really must use of his emotion, sensibility and identification with the victims of the holocaust.

It's safe to say that this is one of the best Spielberg films. For many, like me, his best. A historical piece with much to add in the discussion of mankind tragedies.",10
1 June 2001,10? how about a 20,"Not the best movie ever, but it has got to be the most accurate, and heart wrenching movies ever made.

The holocaust is portrayed in a way that is almost documentorial. I do not like most of Spielberg's movies. In fact, I think he has made some very terrible movies (Jaws comes to mind). But Schindler's List is a masterpiece. If only Spielberg would stick to films like this one. 10/10.

18 September 2006,The best film I have ever seen,"This movie has left me wanting to cry and cheer at the same time. I did actually cry; the first time I really cried when watching a film. I usually can separate myself from the fictional events of a movie, but not during the last ten minutes. I was appalled at the scenes included in this movie, and they were both cold and moving at the same time. This is the best movie I have ever seen. If I had been in a room with a hundred of my peers, swearing to laugh and taunt me for life if I cried I would have still wept. Two of the starring actors' performances were definitely grade 'A'. Liam Neeson puts on a flawless performance in my opinion, as does Ben Kingsley. However, the performance of Embeth Davidtz (cast as the maid, Helen Hirsch) left me disappointed, as did Raplh Fiennes'. As far as story goes, this is a moving and powerful one, that ought not to be forgotten. I wish I could touch on the specific parts of the movie that moved me most without spoiling any of the ending. I also wish I could personally invite the entire Nazi regime over for ""special coffee"" laced with strychnine; especially Goeth, if he was a real person, and definitely Hitler if he were alive.",10
27 September 2014,"A wonderful film, deftly blending humanity and barbarism into an emotionally resonate masterpiece.","This is one of the greatest films ever made. It will stand the test of time and ensure that one of the greatest tragedies in human history will never be forgotten.

Schindler's List is crafted with care and precision. The cinematography is subtle and haunting and the film is beautifully shot in black and white, symbolising the duality of tyranny and hope. The acting is utterly flawless, especially Ralph Fiennes as the embodiment of Nazi oppression. However Liam Neeson is also fantastic as Schindler himself, bringing a dominant screen presence and an emotional strength.

One of the most powerful aspects of the film is the realism that is consistent throughout. It is as if the audience have been propelled back in time to witness the horror. The 3 hour running time allows the viewer to reflect on the 6 years, which leads to an incredibly powerful emotional climax. But as the film unfolds it's Schindler's transformation from self-serving Nazi to compassionate protector which bears the most emotional resonance. For me, this was the most striking aspect of the film, that despite the scale of the monumental atrocities, the capacity for human goodness remained.",9
12 March 2022,Strangely Powerful!!,"The movie highlights the power of one individual and how can it make a difference. Best sequence of movie is the climax at the end, but that doesn't mean the other parts of movie isn't good. Spielberg has created a masterpiece that radiates hope while all that happens in the movie is destruction, a movie about the mistakes of men and its regrets. A terrifying villain and Liam neeson's flawless performance are some other aspects elevating this movie.

4 March 2002,Hero: Schindler or Spielberg?,"First of all, for those of you that critique this film for it's cinematic purposes, you may be right in your critiques, but maybe that is not the point. Spielberg is one of the best directors of all time, and although he is not the best, he can do something extremely important: display the purposes and stories of cinema to a generation that struggles with the concept of film for a purpose. Although there may be better directors, thier masterpieces are pretty much wasted on the new (any my) generation. I cannot stress enough how important it is to keep meaningfull cinema alive and in the public's eye.

Now on to the story, that's right the story not the movie. Obviously great acting and the reality of this tale made this movie great, but what made this a masterpiece was the plain balls shown by Spielburg to produce such harsh reality to the American, and worldwide, public. Obviously Schindler is portrayed as a hero, even though his historical prospective was mixed between hero and a man in the right place to have a change in heart.

Yet I find Spielburg the real hero here. You can not underestimate the service he has done to society by preserving this tale that reminds us how important the lessons of WWII are to our society, and how the real trajedy would be to forget. After all, many have tried to take over the world, many wars have been wages, and millions have been wrongfully and ruthlessly killed. The only reason for repitition is that we forget the lessons these awful spots in the history of mankind. Truely if the moral lessons from this story, and the war are preserved, it would be an unprecidented victory for mankind. Imagine.... John Lenon wasn't dillusional, he just knew his history.

Spielburg, who is a great director, I now see as a great man, for I cannot over-emphasize the importance of this tale that he re-tells. Truely, Spielburg is a hero in his choice of tale here. One more note, the only way this movie would go to waste is if you did not see it. This is a must-see for anyone with half a brain and even a quarter of a brain.",

10 April 2007,my brief review about the movie,"Schindler's List is an Academy Award, Golden Globe, BAFTA and Grammy winning 1993 movie based on the book Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally. The movie, adapted by Steven Zaillian and directed by Steven Spielberg, relates the tale of Oskar Schindler, a Sudeten-German Catholic businessman who was instrumental in saving the lives of over one thousand Polish Jews during the Holocaust. The title refers to a list of the names of 1,100 Jews whom Schindler hired to work in his factory and kept from being sent to the Nazi concentration camp.

Schindler's List is consistently ranked amongst the finest movies of all time. It is currently ranked as 9th best film by the American Film Institute [1], and, as of March 18, 2007, rated number eight on the top 250 films on the Internet Movie Database with an 8.8/10 rating

20 February 2016,"Schindler's List"" Review = Perfection.","Perfection.

There are films, admittedly few, that transcend themselves. In fact, they transcend even the art of filmmaking. Sometimes, these films are simply grand on a scale not before seen...films such as ""Titanic"" and ""LOTR"" may well qualify here...other times, these films achieve such utter perfection that they simply take on a life of their own...still other times, the films become a symbol of the times. These are the films that make the perfect statement at the perfect time in life. Finally, there are films such as ""Schindler's List."" Films such as these, perhaps the most rare of all, are films that touch the soul of all humanity with a universal truth that is so profound and so vividly presented that it becomes an icon unto itself. ""Schindler's List"" is, indeed, an icon of American cinema.

Steven Spielberg's 1993 story of Oskar Schindler, a man whose greed, vanity and self-indulgence is somehow transformed during the Nazi Holocaust into a self-sacrificing, humanitarian existence saving the lives of 1100 Jews from the Auschwitz death camp, is a powerful, deeply insightful, brutally honest and constantly moving film that transcends itself by bringing to light with great clarity one of the most troubling times in global history.

""Schindler's List"" is not necessarily a comfortable film to watch and I dare say the casual film-goer might not rate it highly. It is not, to the casual eye, an entertaining film. Only the film-goer who is well versed in cinema and dedicated to the mastery of filmmaking will most likely consider this film entertaining, though many others will still appreciate it.

There are, quite simply, films that are not meant to entertain. They are not designed for our pleasure, but for much grander purposes. ""Schindler's List"" is a challenging film but a deeply healing one.

Virtually every aspect of ""Schindler's List"" achieves perfection from performances to production quality to script to direction. It would be most challenging to find a film that achieves such balanced perfection.

As Oskar Schindler, Liam Neeson presents a multi-faceted performance of great depth with a unique balance of self-indulgence and self- sacrifice, shallow materialism with generous offering. Neeson offers a Schindler who is confident yet often indecisive. What makes this performance remarkable is its pacing...So often, in these humanity films we get a ""superhero"" approach or a man who suddenly and immediately transforms into Mr. Wonderful. Schindler's transformation here is a quieter, more subtle transition that allows the audience to watch him change...watch him struggle with this change. It's a remarkable, controlled performance in what could have been a stereotypical ""tour de force.""

While Neeson clearly takes the lead here, the supporting roles are simply outstanding including Ben Kingsley as accountant Itzhak Stern, a man who works with Schindler yet remains wary of him and the Nazi's. Ralph Fiennes offers, perhaps, the ""tour de force"" performance as Amon Goeth, a sadistic Nazi whose callous brutality is disturbing yet, in many ways, very complementary to Schindler.

The list could go on and on in terms of exemplary performances...yet, it's so hard to single out individuals when truly every aspect of this film is perfect. The score of John Williams is magnificent, blending perfectly the desperation of the situation with the moments of great life and the moments of great rage...the cinematography of Janusz Kaminski utilizes perfectly the use of color (largely black and white) with tremendous shading and just the perfect mix of brutality and hopefulness.

The film's attention to detail is astounding, including the music, costuming, language and production design.

Yet, in many ways, watching ""Schindler's List"" makes me not want to comment on any of its production values. This film is so much more than its acting or its writing or its anything else...It is a film that transcends, truly, the art of filmmaking and becomes a story and a film and an experience for the entire world. Yes, it truly is that grand.

""Schindler's List"" inspires, and yet, simultaneously horrifies. It is, in my opinion, Spielberg's finest work and one I doubt he will ever top. ""Schindler's List"" is more than a film...it is a life experience of such depth and beauty and greatness that I think it almost calls out for an 11th Commandment...Thou Shalt See ""Schindler's List.""",10
20 June 2003,Oscar's List,"I have chosen this headline because it has a double meaning; 1.The person this is about is Mr.Oscar Schindler 2.This film was awarded with 7 Academy Awards (Oscar).

Something is happening to you when you see this film. I can't think of any film before who has shown the Holocaust in the way this film does. Everything is so fantastic, John Williams' music, Janucz Kaminski's filming and of course; Steven Spielberg's directing. And the film gets even more realistic when it's filmed in black/white.

There's so many things to say about this film. I could have written about it for several years. The locations they have used for the shots from the Jewish ghetto. The almost magical symbol with the little girl in red running around in the ghetto, the German maniacs that are burning all the dead people and the brilliant photograph who has filmed this,it makes you feel you're a part of the story. There is especially one shot I would like to say something about. When the steam-trains filled with the cold Jews are arriving the consentration camp in Auschwitz and the all the moments that are captured by Janucz Kaminski you really understand how these people must have been suffering. Yes, it's a sad film. But it is fantastic!",10
28 May 2013,A film to watch over and over again,"The feelings I experienced while viewing this film are almost indescribable. I am an avid fan in World War II history but more specifically Holocaust history. It is my belief that humanity has a huge lesson to be learned from cowardly acts such as the Holocaust, and this movie has an uncanny way of helping pass the message along. This film shows human compassion even in the darkest of times. I do not think my eyes were dry at all during the movie-I found it so deeply moving. My rating of 10/10 originates from both the acting as well as the message gained. The movie will have a place not only on my shelf but also in my heart.

Boy, was I wrong.I watched this movie and felt horror, shame and relief. It inspired me to apply (as a mature age student) to University to study History, in order to try and understand this period in human history.

I wasn't interested in the Holocaust when I watched it - I was more interested in Liam Neeson. But since then I have made an effort to try and understand it from the three different angles - the Nazis, the Jews, and the Rest of the World.

Awake your social conscience and watch this movie. If you've already watched it and can't understand what I'm saying, then read some accounts of the Holocaust - try 'The Diary of Anne Frank' - then watch it again.

27 June 2000,"Spielberg's amazing WW2 classic, which tells the true story of a Nazi, Oskar Schindler, who saved the lives of hundreds of Jews.","Everyone who's seen SCHINDLER'S LIST, Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning 1993 film distributed by Universal, has loved it. Most even cried (myself included), due to the realistic Holocaust story. The film takes place, of course, in WW2. Starting in 1939, a German man named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) comes into quick fame at a Nazi private party, using only his money and suave manor. With help from high-ranking Nazi officers, he starts up a pots and pans factory to help the Jews work. After a few years, when we have seen many Jews massacred and shot, Schindler makes a list of Jews, to be escorted to a German arms factory in his home town, and saves them from a trigger-happy, power-mad Nazi officer (portrayed by Ralph Fiennes). After YOU (who haven't seen it) see it, you will agree that it will not soon be a forgotten masterpiece.

In my opinion, Schindler's List IS the best movie of time. No movie has ever made me cry until that one. Steven Spielbergs masterful direction was great, but also the stellar cast. Of all, Ben Kingsley was most definetely the best, but great performances by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes as well. John William's score was the most masterful, powerful, and beautiful I have ever heard. Normally most Nazi movies tend to focus on one family surviving, and although that isn't bad, Schindler's List is much better. It shows the Holocaust as it really was. I hear people criticize Spielberg because he showed full nudity of both sexes, and many acts of violence, and I say, shut up. Now that isn't to say that this is a movie for small children. But if you feel they are ready for it I suggest you rent it and let your teenage son or daughter watch it(with them of course). This is truly the #1 movie. Rent it and see it.

21 April 2011,Greatest List of All Time,"I just saw this movie and tears rolled down my face unconsciously. I could not hold back my feelings especially when Oskar Schindler said ""I could have saved more"". He said his car could have saved 10 more lives and the badge another 2. One can imagine how valuable the funds spent on intangibles can actually save lives if channeled the right way. He saved so many, the list is the creation of generations, the novel ascribed the list as ""Ark"" similar to the biblical Noah's Ark. This movie is the definition for all movies of its kind. No wonder the director keeps winning Oscars and no wonder great movies are rated by Oscars because one of the greatest men is ""Oskar"".

16 September 2003,The Greatest Film Made,"Is this the perfect film ? I believe so. So film has more astonishing acting than Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley (no acting oscars!) The most extraordinary handling of this subject, wonderful cinematography, editing superb andthe overall look of the film is something that stays with you.

A movie that will last its generations.

28 December 2010,The possibility that one simple idea can change your life and the lives around you.,"The connection between the people in the film and the audience is almost incomparable with any other film. Even the people who are not regulars, you feel that you know who they are, that you've experienced what they have been through but also realising that how bad this film portrays the war the experience of the Jews will never be displayed to its full effect on the people involved. Spanning through the workers at the end brings to light what a good job Spielberg has done with this connection.

In my opinion this film has more in common with inception then any other . in that there is the possibility that one simple idea can change your life and the lives around you. In the case of Schindler it was the red coat of the young girl who provoked an idea to grow and i believe this is the reason for this film to be black and white. To make sure the audience got the poignancy of that scene, that something so beautiful cannot help but stand out against the rest of the world and effect the people involve more so.

Ralph Fiennes brings a brilliant typically perceived German into the picture, ruthless and cold blooded in the way he unnecessarily kills the workers for fun almost but eventually shows heart. One of the hardest rolls in the film well played.

The ending of the film is perfect as you feel that it has already climaxed with 20 minutes to go and in ways of personal actions changing the storyline drastically it has but in drama it has certainly not . An unbelievable performance by Liam Neeson in its last moments is what pushes this film to 10/10",8
13 March 2023,Powerful and Heartbreaking,"This is a movie that I remember coming out. My parents rented it if memory serves and I know they ended up buying the two VHS box as well. It is one that they let me catch a glimpse of so I knew about the girl in the red coat. It wasn't until much later, after college, that I sat down to watch this start to finish. What I will say is that it is a heavy watch. Jaime and I also watched this as we are working through the Internet Movie Database Top 100 movies poster.

For this movie, we are following Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson). He is a member of the Nazi party in so far as he can exploit the Jewish population who are being persecuted in this town in Poland. He is a good a buying favor and can talk around them as needed. What is interesting is that he is a failed businessman until he can use slave labor.

He enlists the aid of a brilliant Jewish accountant, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley). Together, they create a successful pot making facility. The world around them is ever changing as the war grows and the allies get closer. We see the Jews forced to live in the ghetto through a few different people and families. This eventually leads them to a camp that is ran by Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes). It is as things go and Oskar is punished for a kissing a Jewish girl on his birthday that making money isn't enough and saving as many as he can becomes the goal.

So I decided to go a bit lighter on my recap as I'm assuming most people have seen this that are reading this already. This is a masterpiece. I'm not afraid to play my hand, but this is where director Steven Spielberg is at his best. He is able to capture the atrocities that were committed to his race in a way where you are captivated, entertained and mortified at the same time. This runs over three hours, but once you settle in, it doesn't feel like it. It flies by.

Now I wanted to interject that before I saw this movie all the way through, I asked my father about it. He informed me that Oskar Schindler wasn't a good man. He was exploiting the situation around him, which is interesting that throughout American history, we have families doing the same, but we applaud them. Oskar redeems himself though. He uses the money that he earned to do goo once he sees the horrors of what is happening around him. Neeson has an amazing performance here.

While watching this as well, Jaime kept asking how we could do this to people. This does a great job at the Nazis showing the problems with herd mentality as well as when you objecting people to the point where you don't see them as humans. Amon does this. It is also fitting to watch this in such close proximity to Inglorious Basterds because that is what the Jew Hunter in that movie also does, calling them rats. There isn't an easy answer to what Jaime asked, because this film makes me cry with what we are seeing. It is horrifying at what people will do to others when given the chance and told it is your job. I'd also credit Fiennes here with his interactions with Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) to show that.

The acting here is great with even those I haven't mentioned. Kinglsey and the rest of the prisoners are wonderful in showing the terror and not fully understanding what is happening. This being filmed in black and white is also an interesting choice. It does hide things. There is an interesting aspect to where a little girl in a red coat is showcased. Jaime and I believe this was done to draw attention to something in the end.

With all that said, this is an excellent movie to showcase the horrors of war and the depths of evil residing in humanity. I know it happened, but it still is shocking to me what humans can do to others, especially when conditioned to not look at those who are different as being the same species. This is a hard movie to recommend. It is powerful though and needs to be seen at least once. Not one I can say I'll come back to regularly but will show my daughter when she is ready.

My Rating: 10 out of 10.",10
28 April 2004,Meticulously crafted!,"Astoundingly magnificent, meticulously great, as this is one of the greatest movie ever done. Boasting seven Academy Awards and taking home two of the major Oscars in Best Picture & Best Director respectively. Blockbuster mighty Steven Spielberg won his first of two Oscars, he will go on to win his second five years onwards for 'Saving Private Ryan', has crafted one of the most mesmerizing and importantly structured movie in the history of motion pictures. With a screenplay by Steven Zaillian which earn him an Oscar for his in-depth accuracy and depictions. With a wonderful array of art and set direction done by Allan Starski and Ewa Braun provides the perfect tones to the screenplay. John Williams harrowing original score garnered him an Oscar also, while Michael Kahn whose previous collaboration with Spielberg on 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark' will also carry him home an Oscar for Best Editing. It was the flawless cinematography though by Janusz Kaminski that stands out, his first of two Oscars was well appreciated to this master, who took his game to a higher level when he won his second Oscar for his collaboration with Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan'. With a great performing cast that includes Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley just help attributes the films well rounded orchestrated extravagance. Schindler's List is the only movie from the 90's that made the top ten list by the American Film Institute",10
30 November 2012,Summary of others reviews in my opinion,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"".

13 January 2020,A film of contrasts that hits the gut,"This movie is built on contrasts, and it includes one of the most devastating single cuts in movies. It's a dual narrative that almost feels separated for a while before the two become completely intertwined in the final hour. It's impeccably made, acted, scored, and assembled. It is one of, if not the, greatest single film by Steven Spielberg, and it's the best example of an ""important"" film.

The first sustained sequence to the film is our introduction to the main character of Oskar Schindler. It's largely wordless, showing him putting on his finest clothes, pocketing a large stack of cash, and zeroing in on some Nazi officials in a Polish nightclub. He means them no harm, he only wants to schmooze with them and gain the contact necessary to get a manufacturing contract with the Nazi military early in the Second World War. It's an intoxicating scene as Schindler works his magic, going from an empty table to hosting a dozen officers and their dates, all to get in with the high ranking officer who reserved the best table in the place.

And then there's a hard cut to Nazis marching through Krakow.

The music is gone, the levity is gone. We went from being seduced by the fun of hanging with Nazi officers to the cold hard reality of a Nazi occupation in a major Jewish population with one edit. It's hard, and it's very effective.

That contrast is at the heart of everything in the film, including Schindler's character. Visually, we see things like Schindler in his office above the factory floor while the slave laborers remain separated from him below in much the same way that Goeth sits on the porch of his house above the labor camp. Schindler wants to use slave labors to make a fortune, which he does. Schindler and Goeth contrast really well as well. They both sit in positions of power, Schindler in the private sector and Goeth military, but they end up going in different directions. Schindler watches the liquidation of Krakow, focusing on that famous little girl in her red coat, and something clicks within him. He's never seen the Jewish people as anything more than tools for his own personal wealth, but there's something about that innocent little girl, weaving her way through the mass murder going on around her, that makes him reconsider his assumptions. Goeth, on the other hand, is a monster through and through (apparently toned a good bit down from reality), and, once he's given the opportunity to exercise what Schindler calls ""real power"" (letting the guilty man go free), Goeth realizes it's simply not who he is and he snipes the boy who couldn't get the stain out of his bathtub.

Through the events of the film is the quiet figure of Itzhak Stern. When Spielberg and Ben Kingsley were discussing the character, they both boiled the man down to a single word. Spielberg chose ""conscience"" and Kingsley chose ""witness"". Both words perfectly capture, especially together, who Stern is in this story. He's largely our eyes into the world, playing a placid man in the face of constant threat, who does what he can to help his employer. On the other hand, he provides little nudges to Schindler to move him in the right direction, like getting Schindler to meet the one handed worker who credited him with saving his life. He's the one Schindler ends up confiding in and plotting with to create the list of 1100 Jews to save from the Nazi ovens.

The parallel story is the story of the Holocaust as a whole. We watch the story unfold from persecution on the streets of Krakow to the ghetto to the labor camp and finally to the death camp. There are criticisms of the film that it doesn't go far enough on this end. I think, regarding the actual story at play, the creation of the list by Oskar Schindler, it doesn't necessarily fit, though I get the idea. We see the crackdown, liquidation, and oppression of the Jews in exact detail throughout the movie, but once we get to Auschwitz, the movie turns away. We don't see the piles of bodies or them being cooked in the ovens, though we do see the smokestacks belching out the ashes from it. It feels like the movie could have taken another step to really embrace the truth of the horror, but Spielberg was unwilling. I don't know...I think we might have seen enough and just the implication of the final solution was enough.

It's a harrowing look that, perhaps, flinches in the final moments, but the central story of Schindler's exposure and reaction to the horrors of the Holocaust are magnificently capture and presented. Liam Neeson is great as Schindler. Kingsley is quiet and great as Stern. Ralph Fiennes is pure evil as the (toned-down) Goeth. John Williams' music is somber, touching, and distinctly Jewish by design, fitting the film perfectly. Spielberg made it because he felt like a Holocaust movie needed to be made, and he used every bit of his talent to pull it off. This is a great, great film.",10
25 February 2017,You HaVe To Watch ThIs MoVie,"One of the best second world war story-movie ever made.The movie makes you think about stuff that man have to think more often about.brilliant acting and screenplay.Liam Neeson is perfectly chosen to play this role.A movie makes you cry ,feel joy ,be sad.Its an example for Humannity,sacrifice,heroism.You HaVe To Watch ThIs MoVie.For me is a clear 10 of 10.

It also does a great job in showing how Schindler lived and changed the lives of so many Jewish people.

1 February 2014,"Great, touching movie","Short & sweet: It's Realistic. It's Heart-wrenching. It's dramatic. It's honest. It connects you to the protagonist's character.

When Oskar exclaims in misery that he could've helped more, could've done more, looks at the ring on his finger, and almost falls the the ground, it makes you cry. You wish you could've yourself done more, even though you weren't there. Liam Neeson is amazing in this movie. I don't cry often. Yet, this movie takes you through such a story, and makes you imagine yourself in this time and place, wishing you could do more. I like when a drama still has enough suspense combined with plot, character development, that it pulls at you from several angles. This is well- thought out and remains at the top of my list today.

14 November 2022,Disturbing but needed,"This disturbing true story on the holocaust and Oskar Schindler is one I will never forget. It has such a powerful message and one that needs to be understood better. The film itself is brilliant, the acting is superb and the music is so moving. The film doesn't hold back at all and includes everything that the Jews has to go through back then. It really gives you a clear image of the pain and struggle they went through. I admit that watching this film was very difficult and struggled to reach the end but it was well worth it. I had to pause and just think of something happy mid way because it started getting really depressing. Steven Speilburg truly is an artist and really captured the realism of the holocaust. I would like to watch this movie again and it is definitely one of my favourites. However I would not recommend this movie for young children. If you are a teen you might be able to handle it but anyone under shouldn't watch it as some of the scenes are pretty horrific and I'm a little bit surprised it isn't an 18 but I can see why it's a 15.

Other than that, WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!",10

30 October 2006,Powerful Movie!,"This movie was jaw-dropping. It was so blatant and direct, it was painful to watch, and even more painful to think about the fact that these things really did happen.

The black-and-white filming threw me off at first, but then I realised that it was very effective and had an element of sophistication that I don't believe a colour film would have had.

However, the rating of 'R' was very well-deserving - the violence was shocking, for one.

I personally think, tho, that it could have done without the sex. Thus, I'm obligated to give this movie a 9.

8 September 2007,The Truth,"I have no trouble agreeing that this is Spielberg's best film. That's not as much of a compliment as you might think, because the majority of them have been embarrassingly awful.

Stevie learned a long time ago that there is big money in mawkish sentimentality and set out to capitalize on it. There is a substantial, guaranteed segment of the cinema-going public that will accept schmaltz as art. They simply do not know the difference.

So, while I will accept that this is a good movie, there is no way it belongs in the top 250. Or even in the top 2500. There are too many historical inaccuracies, too many factual liberties, too many scenes overdone for deliberate shock value. The whole thing is fake. It is only vaguely based on what actually happened. Yet it is presented as a factual historical drama and has been widely accepted as such.

The excesses of Hitler's Germany can never be forgotten or swept under the rug, but embellishing them and making gaudy parodies of the real thing does not well serve the memory of those who suffered through it.

""The Pianist"" was not a perfect film, either, but it is a lot better than this one.",4
17 June 2005,"Brilliant, absolutely incredible film is Spielberg's best","This film does not have one error in anything in it: This film is absolutely brilliant in any standard, it is flawless, perfectly executed, shocking (REALLY SHOCKING), extremely violent (the many scenes of Jews being executed are definitely the most graphically realistic, totally believable brutal killings ever put on film, AND I MEAN THAT.) and extremely intense, in every sense of the word. This film does not have a false note in it's execution scenes, storytelling or acting. And this film is so moving (especially for Jews) and so engrossing that it felt like this whole film was really happening around me when I watched it (and I was dead scared, don't get me wrong) There is no way anybody will be offended by this film. The last great, unforgettable, internationally critically acclaimed 5-star and classic film of the ages. And it is all based on a true story.

Liam Neeson is extraordinary as Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi party who saves the lives of 1,100 Jews by employing them to work in his factory. Ben Kingsley is compelling as Schindler's Jewish accountant (and WHY wasn't he at least nominated?) and Ralph Fiennes is terrifying as the foul-mouthed Nazi Commandant. Both Neeson and Fiennes were nominated (they should have both won) Neeson for Best Actor, and Fiennes for Supporting Actor.",10
18 November 2002,"""sometimes movies are needed to make people open their eyes""","This movie shows why people need to understand each others behaviors. Culture colissions have been reason to many traumatic events in history and this is a film showing what will happen. By just showing when Nazi soldiers shoots a jewish worker through the head because of this old mans culture and his handicap (one arm) gives people a hint of the cruelty that enrages when misunderstanding takes place. Seven Spielberg is a master of filmproductions and shows that sometimes movies are needed to make people open their eyes. The story is great, and it's special effects too. This beutifull masterpiece also is filled out by John Williams fantastic score that touches your heart. If you don't like this movie (or find it boring) you do not have any compassion to fellow man. A movie like this, entertaining and a lecture, is hard to find. It is one of the best movies ever. 10.

28 September 2010,Bloated and Artsy,"Spielberg's List: (1) This is a SERIOUS film so shoot it in black and white (except for some gimmicky use of color) with such stark contrast between extremely bright artificial lighting and darkness that every scene screams ARTIST AT WORK. (2) To make it clear that the Nazis were evil, have a scene where they randomly shoot Jews. And another scene. And another and another... (3) To really drive home the point that this is an IMPORTANT film about a SOMBRE topic, fill it with enough repetitive scenes that it lasts nearly as long as WWII. (4) Rinse. (5) Repeat. Schindler was no doubt a great man, but his saintliness is way overdone. Neeson is fine, but Fiennes chews the scenery.

13 July 2001,A very powerful and emotional film.,"The movie, Schindler's list is a very powerful and emotional film. It had great casting by Liam Neeson, who played Oskar and excellent acting by the fellow cast. The script couldn't have been wrote any better, and together with the horrible facts produced a film which is both informative and moving. You'll never see another one like it. However, as it was filmed in black and white it wasn't as clear I would have liked, although it makes it seem a little ore realistic.

It certainly deserves 9/10

9 December 2021,"Spielberg lapses into ""epic"" filmmaking from time to time","It's historical fiction set in and near Krak√≥w, Poland, during World War II, and interprets the activities of Oskar Schindler, a German from Czechoslovakia, during the war. It's based on the 1982 novel ""Schindler's Ark"" by Thomas Keneally. It includes actual persons but necessarily creates fictional content to pull things together.

Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) comes to Krak√≥w soon after the Germans have conquered Poland. He sets out to make a fortune. Schindler is part of the Nazi party and cultivates relationships with local SS and Wehrmacht leaders to help his manufacturing interests. SS-Untersturmf√ºhrer Amon G√∂th (Ralph Fiennes) arrives to construct and oversee the Plasz√≥w concentration camp. G√∂th and Schindler become friends, and Schindler uses Jewish prisoners in a factory that makes cookware. The prisoner he uses to actually run the factory is Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley).

We see Schindler gradually remove his blinders to G√∂th's cruelty and what is happening to the Jews. He begins to try to protect some of them, primarily through bribes paid from the massive amount of money he is making. When the Plasz√≥w camp is ordered to be closed with all prisoners sent to Auschwitz, he manages to divert 850 Jews in Plasz√≥w to a new munitions plant near his hometown in Czechoslovakia. He does this through bribes that he continues to pay until the war ends.

This film is over three hours long and is mostly in black & white. It is almost overwhelming in its intensity as we see the experiences of individual Jews, such as Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz), who served as G√∂th's maid in his home in the concentration camp and was saved by Schindler. Color might have made some of the horrific execution scenes unwatchable.

It's not a perfect film. Spielberg lapses into ""epic"" filmmaking from time to time. He makes Schindler a heroic figure who has discovered his own humility by the end. I suspect it is an unrealistic portrayal of a man who, for much of the film was conflicted, and probably remained so until his death. This is a very good Holocaust film, but I suspect there are better ones out there waiting to be made.",8
21 October 2017,Best film ever,"Many have tried and done very god jobs too (Zookeeper's wife, Life Is Beautiful, Once Upon A Time In America, Fiddler On The roof) but Schindler's List is the undisputed masterpiece of humanity.

Whoever directed this is a genius. I suggest you watch it and then watch it again and get copies into your friends hands. It shows the evil done upon God's Chosen people and asks for penance. Sad beyond words.

4 July 2004,"A fantastic movie, a work of art","Schindler's List is undeniably one of the most emotionally moving films ever made, not only for the Jewish people, but for humanity. The perfectly accurate depiction of the persecution and execution of Jews is indeed heartbreaking and moving. The portrayal of Schindler, who transforms from being a cold, egotistical, greedy bastard, who only cared about making money, profit, into a selfless, giving person who worked very hard, and gave everything to save as many people as he possibly could. The film also perfectly and chillingly depicts how the Nazi's threw the Jews around, shoving them around, shooting them if they felt like it, for no reason.

The film has a great cinematography, that really captures the intensity of the situations and scenes. The plot is good, and moves along at a good pace, though it will test your patience if you aren't interested in the subject of the film (though I don't really see why anyone wouldn't be, at the very least, interested). The acting is all great, by every single actor, but the one I really noticed was Liam Neeson, who portrays Oskar Schindler, a character who undergoes a major development through the film. The script is good, as it allows the audience to see an accurate depiction of just about every single situation that Jews were in, during the war. It is a depressing film, yes, and a sad one, since it tells a very disturbing story, but it should be seen by just about anyone who can sit through it(it does have some violent scenes, but nothing very graphic), as it is a very important and beautiful movie. Any person who considers him or herself to be literate and intelligent should see this movie at least once. You don't get a more accurate portrayal of the horror of being a Jew during that time than this. I recommend this movie to anyone who can sit through it, both concerning the length and the violence in it. 10/10",10
2 February 2020,Everyone has to see this movie ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10,"I mean honestly who gave this perfect film a negative rating? This is a contender for the greatest film ever put to screen - this is not an overstatement. This was one of those rare instances where a film moved me on such a profound emotional level. In telling one man's story of selflessness during possibly the greatest human caused atrocity ever done to our own species, the Holocaust, Spielberg is able to tell a story that is not intended to entertain, but move audiences. In every sense of the word, Schindler's List is an experience, it is more than just another movie you sit on the couch and watch. If you didn't ball out your eyes watching this then do you even possess a soul? At it's core, it is an example of the little glimmer of hope that is surrounded by hopelessness, it is the showing of the value of life. the real Schindler's List was and is much more than a list, it meant living when others died. I have seen horror films that are fake but are able to hold up my suspension of disbelief, but with this piece of cinema I was shown maybe the scariest thing ever filmed - what happens when prejudice and discrimination lead to violence. If you haven't seen this, go and rent it or buy it and cherish it as something not to repeat in our future here on planet Earth.",10
29 May 2002,Personal thanks to Mr. Spielberg,"Mr. Spielberg: Thank you. ""Schindler's List"" is certainly more than a motion picture masterpiece. To simply attach adjectives leaves me unfulfilled, so I am compelled to leave this offering:

As a 40-year old American Protestant man, my only personal connection to the holocaust is my father's distinguished military service in during WWII.

Like so many young men in the early 1940's, my dad answered the call and joined the army in a rush of patriotism. He arrived in Europe armed only with basic training and the gear thrown on his back. He returned two years later as a decorated veteran and moved on with his life. Marriage and family and many years of hard work followed.

Through my childhood in the 1960's, the war was in the past and rarely spoken of. The medals he earned and the black and white photos he brought back from his tour of duty did most of the talking¬Öbut only when they were pulled from their closet storage box. I spent hours looking at the pictures. Smiling soldiers, posing with their guns and tanks, or with civilians. A few showed marching columns of German prisoners. Some had smoke rising in the distance, indicating where the ""action"" was, or had been. But for the most part, they were innocent snapshots taken during the war's quiet moments.

The photos captured my imagination and gave my own feelings of patriotism a foundation. But I always sensed there were more pictures, the ones not taken with a camera. There must have been many images captured and stored only in my father's memories. As I grew up and learned more about the war, that sense became a certainty. Beyond acknowledgment, however, dad wasn't one to offer details of the war's darker experiences, and curiosity could never overcome my reluctance to ask about them.

He passed away in 1993.

What ""Schindler's List"" has given me, in addition to a phenomenal movie experience, is a glimpse at the images that my father didn't capture with his still camera. And those that he did capture have changed. The soldiers' smiles are different somehow. The poses aren't as carefree as they seemed to be years ago. The snapshots have lost much of their innocence.

Did ""Schindler's List"" do all of this? No. Age and education change perspective more than any movie. But the film certainly played a part, and it serves as a reminder with each viewing.

And for that, Mr. Spielberg¬Ömy thanks.",10
1 December 2021,Delivers Under All The Adulation,"The intended purpose or role of Schindler's List is one closer to a documentary than a movie, but don't let that make you think it is just some bland recital of history. The film seizes your attention and holds all the way through an effective viewing.

21 August 2021,"Spielberg's portrayal of evil will make you cry, guaranteed","I have seen this film multiple times, I have watched others see it multiple times. All of us have the same question, how can fellow human beings do such horrible things to each other?? If you want to ball your eyes out from a history lesson, watch this film. It is sad but top notch film-making. The suffering of the Jewish people and other oppressed minorities of Europe will never be forgotten.

13 October 2006,Truly one of the best movies of all time!,"I'd heard this movie was one of the best of all time and I was curious to watch it. Naturally, I expected everything of this movie and had already set very high standards for it - Schindler's list didn't disappoint. It is indeed one of the most fabulous movies of all time.

The movie is difficult to watch, but truly touching. Spielberg sometimes shows very graphic scenes, but its never overdone - these scenes only add to the realism of the movie making it all the more human.

I must also comment on the use of black and white. This is one of the rare movies where the conscious choice to use black and white instead of color works well.

the acting was great and the characters were very realistic. None perfect - all human.

Truly one of the best movies ever!

28 May 2014,One of the best movies I've ever seen,"It was not surprising when a name like Steven Spielberg is printed on a film cover to be so sensational and mind-blowing. The film could be called a masterpiece which is compelling due to fabulous acting of Liam Neeson at his best. Not to mention that the whole concept of the film only came to realize when Ralph Fiennes force you to comprehend the abstract meaning of humanitarianism.Apart from the actors and their glorious plays the storyline was sad and drama but worth even ten visits.When a conceited businessman gradually changes during his war life and decide to help his workers to survive you can feel the true story that lies behind the movie. Thus if you have not seen the film yet I strongly recommend watching it as soon as possible.

21 August 1999,hollywood drivel,"oh dear, spielberg really should stick to his normal forte of brainless hollywood epics because he is WAY out of his depth here.

I didn't hold out much hope for this one despite all the ridiculously overblown praise. Its amazing how one can go from being the epitome of film-making mediocrity to genius just by choosing the holocaust as your theme!

This film is not a tribute to those that died it is an insult, it reduces their suffering to the level of Indiana Jones and Jurassic Park. I'm surprised he resisted the temptation to stick a dinosaur in it.

But he is, as always, laughing all the way to the bank! This should get 0 out of 10 but unfortunately i'll have to award it a 1.

1 April 2003,"Good Movie to find out what the Jews had to go through, and also inspired by a True Story","This film was given many awards just for showing the truth about the Jews and Nazis and sometimes we really need the truth to see what was going on at times we only read about. The name Schindler was very known then and also today is he remembered. The movie was made with care and just to tell us the importance of seeing the Jewish side and what they had to go through in the Holocaust.

The movie is in black and white but some color was put in because those pictures or situations should be noticed and it comes back throughout the movie.

The whole structure of the movie was really good because after viewing the movie we get a clear picture of what was going on in the World War II. By being inspired by a true story makes it more believable and we can appreciate it more.

No film has ever had the impact on me that this has had - even more so second time around. Hard at times to watch and I had to switch it off for a while.

Last scene is unforgettable.

16 September 2013,"The review on ""Schindler's List""","This film is an extraordinary tale of 1 man saving 1200 lives of persecuted Jews during the Holocaust.

Oskar Schindler is shown initially as an opportunist industrialist who is out to make the most of the war.But as the war continues and as he witnesses the atrocities, he focuses of saving as many Jews as he can. The film has one of the most gripping and heart-touching portrayals of the Holocaust. The Nazi soldier Goeth is another character the viewer would find intriguing.

The Jewish saying ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire"",is a pivotal element of the plot. The value of Human life is unequaled.

The direction by Steven Spielberg,in combination with spectacular performances from Liam Neeson,Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes makes this movie an Epic to cherish.The B&W touch in the cinematography transcends the viewing experience to another plane.The score,which materializes the horrors and tragedy of the Holocaust,by John Williams deserves special mention.",9
11 October 2006,It couldn't have been better,"When I first learnt about Schindler's list, I had great expectations on how Spielberg would have made the greatest ever human tragedy. I expected big shots like Hitler, Himmler, Eichmann... but Spielberg had made the movie with stern, Helen heitsh, schindler and goeth. When I first saw the movie I thought Spielberg had missed quite a lot of incidents. I thought some scenes in the first 1 hour could have been cut to accommodate other incidents and I felt the movie was overrated. But only after watching the movie a second time I realized that the movie was 'Schindler's list' and not a documentary on holocaust. I also appreciated how important each and every scene was and got convinced that there couldn't have been a better version of the movie. While scenes like burning synagogues would have been sensational, It would have provoked outrage. But Spielberg had given this movie an emotional and human touch. Schindler's transformation from a corrupt flirt profit-minded businessman to a great saviour has been fabulously portrayed. This movie, though not a great tearjerker, has a lot of emotional dialogues and scenes.

Schindler viewing the ghetto liquidation from the top of a cliff, Schindler's soothing words to helen, Schindler trying to change goeth by telling about power,Schindler's talk to stern after orders on special treatment, Schindler thinking on what to do one fine night, Schindler saving the ladies and subsequently the children and many more of these scenes simply break you to give a wet eyes. Observe Neeson's body language on all these circumstances and you'll understand how nobel a heart he was and what kindness actually means. The scene where schindler gets furious with a Jewish woman and later brings her parents to his factory is my best in the movie. Goeth's split personality was frightening. The background score of music during the liquidation of the ghetto was moving. The lead trio of Liam neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley have performed exceptionally well in the movie. Its quite sad that none got an Oscar. Thank god that the Reich officials were corrupt otherwise the Schindler Jews would have perished at Auschwitz and the world would have missed this great masterpiece.",10
1 January 2018,Great Insight on the Holocaust,"Great movie that really engages audiences in the shocking reality of the time. Doesn't over-attach audiences like other holocaust movies but really embraces the truth in a cold and surreal way. Provides great understanding of the politics, ethnics and morals of German Society in the 1940's. A great insight for anybody that wants to have some background of the holocaust or just an idea of what the situation was like despite being in the perspective of a rich business man that profits off Jewish workers.I enjoyed the movie a lot and would recommend it to anybody else interested in history. :)

4 July 2006,I found this to be very boring,"I found this movie to be very boring. Not sure what people could possibly see in it. I went with some friends who wanted to see it the 1st day it was released in the theaters. The whole first hour was just about this guy setting up a pots and pans factory. I was ready to just walk out at that point, but my friends wanted to stay so I was stuck there watching the rest of this.

I've seen many documentaries on A&E, History Channel, etc on the holocaust and I guess I just presumed that everyone else had too. Apparently a lot of people never have, never read about it in school or anything either. After it was over, these people in the theater were all sitting there like they were stunned or something. Like they just had no idea that stuff like that happened during WWII. I was thinking to myself ""lets just get the heck out of here"".

If you never get drawn into a movie at the beginning, it can sometimes be too late - no matter if it gets better later on you can just lose any interest in it.",3
10 September 1998,My favorite film of all time!!!,"An absolutely brilliant rendering of life during the Holocaust; Steven Spielberg's powerful direction shows you just what Hollywood is capable. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes give towering performances as the title character and a frightening Nazi commandant, respectively and Ben Kingsley is just as impressive in a quieter role. John Williams's wrenching score and Janusz Kaminski's excellent photography complement the writing and directing of this incomparable drama, in my opinion, the finest film ever created. May Spielberg live in glory for showing the world what horror lived behind those textbooks and what strength can emerge from that horror!

27 April 2011,A masterpiece,"I saw Schindler's list in Religion, our teachers wanted to show the evil in our world. Schindlers list did exactly what was asked of it, it showed the horrors of war and it showed how good can prevail.

The acting is spot on, Liam Neeson manages to put on a great show as our protagonist Oskar Schindler but I must mention Ralph Fiennes. This man's talents in portraying a ""baddie"" are truly spectacular. Fiennes manages to show the evil inside Amon Goeth,he is a cold hearted killer who has no mercy.

The black and white filter is also a nice touch, I'm not exactly sure what it represents but it may be to represent the fact that war is pointless.

Last of all I have to mention the music score. John Williams managed to create a score that fit the film perfectly. The music is sad and almost makes you want to cry. The idea to play iton a violin was smart and added to the sadness. John Williams truly deserved the Oscar and always will.

Schindlers list is truly a classic,directed by the great Steven Spielberg it manages to portray the horrors of war, how one man can make a difference but most important of all it showed hope.",10
8 June 2011,Schindler's List Film Review,"This is not a happy movie, or a feel good hit. It is a moving story of one light in the darkness of Germany. It shows the depths to which humanity can sink without God. I recommend this movie, but with warnings. It contains penury; shows violence of nature; and the subject matter is about one of the most hideous times in recent history. However, it is all in the telling of this true story; a story that should be told. Exactly, not a film for children.

This an elegant film and an accurate description of the Holocaust. You cannot change the Holocaust around to make it a happy. The Holocaust was a sad, dark event. The scenes of violence and nudity were relevant to this film. The brilliant director, Steven Spielberg, chose to show mild scenes from the Holocaust. I have seen a lot worse things. And the reason the film didn't show any of the other groups tortured was because Oskar Schindler saved Jews, so it was probably unnecessary to show or mention the other groups. And also because the fact that Jews were the main group targeted. The penury was important, too. In the scene of the selection in the concentration camp, the penury was necessary to make an accurate definition and the sexual scenes were there to show that Schindler was a womanizer. This film is one of the greatest motion pictures ever made and everyone should watch it.

While it's a movie for mature audiences, the viewer shouldn't fast forward through any scene. They'll miss something if they do. Spielberg's best movie and one of the best films ever made. To many Holocaust films shy from the truth. That is sad, because it is one of the most important events in the 20th century. Watch this movie, watch it carefully, and see what you learn from it‚Äîthe nudity has a part in this film.",9
19 September 1999,Overrated!,"It's not that Schindler's List is a bad movie; in parts, it's quite powerful. What has always annoyed me about this film, however, was the way it was so unreservedly embraced by critics and unsophisticated moviegoers. Seriously, am I the only one who was unimpressed by the main ethical point of the movie? Really, what does this film have to say beyond, ""the Holocaust was a bad thing?"" I'm sorry if I don't consider this to be groundbreaking, cutting-edge historical analysis. Furthermore, am I the only one who was offended that Spielberg made a fundamentally ""feel good"" movie about the holocaust? Was I the only one that was offended by the fact the film ends by dedicating itself to the six million Jews who died in the Holocaust (and about the five million non-Jews who also died you say nothing)? Did anyone else notice how the main characters in Schindler's List were not actually Jewish, thereby following in the grand Hollywood tradition of turning the story of oppressed people into the story of a sympathetic member of the oppressing group (a la Cry Freedom, Mississippi Burning, Beyond Rangoon, and so on)? What really offended me, however, was an issue that, in all fairness, was peripheral to the film itself. I was infuriated by the way Hollywood patted itself on the back for making a movie it hadn't wanted to make, a movie it should have made decades before. Schindler's List was made about forty years too late, and at its core is the same innocuous Hollywood nonsense that has pervaded the world of cinema for far too long. The memory of the members of my family who were murdered during this tragedy deserved better.",6
22 March 2018,Phonenomeunal.,"Truly an extremely well made film with extremely high production values. The story, pure fact based on the foundation Spielberg created and through thousands of interviews. The film showed true detail and portrayed the era in a very bare honest way. Definitely recommended for every Jewish person, and for every person willing to learn about the Holcaust and the wide struggle Jews had gone through.

The organization is perfect, we meet a savvy business man who sees opportunity in misery only to find himself lost in his own humanity. His evolution is incredible, Liam Neeson's hallmark performance.

This movie symbolizes hope in humanity, I love watching it at least once a year because it is so perfect that even in black and white you can appreciate the metaphors and hidden symbols that indulge the watcher in a roller coaster of emotions through pure art.

20 July 2016,An absolute depiction of WW2 darkest days,"What made Schindler's list special to me, was the authenticity that is displayed throughout the movie. Till I saw the movie I thought Nazis were an army of fanatics, with a psychotic commander. Through the analytical and accurate recounting of the movie I was intrigued to ask questions I never thought I would. Acting of all the actors make you feel the movie, make you want to learn what really happened, make you want to understand why. There are plenty movies based on true stories and I think I have seen enough of them, but none of them had affected me that much. In most cases I would put myself in the main character's shoes and think how I would react in similar conditions. In this case I didn't even bother, I thought I wouldn't manage. What made these feelings though so strong and vivid, were the acting, the directing, the very well done research over historical events, even the idea of shooting the picture B&W I think made more realistic. I hope I will have the chance to watch the movie once more and I wish we will be able to watch movies of equivalent quality in all its aspects.

The soundtrack is just ""spot on "" as it is in the other above-mentioned movies.When u compare Fiennes performance in this vs The Constant Gardner , it shows his tremendous versatility. Likewise , check out ""Sexy Beast"" and remember Ishtak Stern.Kingsley-u are the man.(remember that tear when he finally decides to ""have that drink"" with Oskar) .As for Neeson,this is the movie he will look back on in years to come with the most pride.To all involved, thank you most sincerely

17 November 2013,"Technically it's perfect and often it's very moving, but I wouldn't call it a 'masterpiece'","Schindler's list tells the story of Oskar Schindler (Neeson)who is a Nazi businessman who decides to open a factory that employs 'skilled' Jewish workers to make pots and pans (as well as other metal products). He then trades these goods and ends up making an awful lot of money. He employs Itzhak Stern (Kingsley)as his accountant and ultimately his 'right hand man'. Whilst he is clearly exploiting his workers, they don't mind as they would rather work for Schindler than be under the brutal regime of the SS. When Schindler's workforce are taken from him by the evil general Amon Goeth (Fiennes) and when he witnesses the horrors of how Goeth and his men are treating them, Schindler decides to take action and tries to save as many of those that are being persecuted as possible.

If I was to judge this film on a technical basis only then it would get a 10 for me; the directing, the cinematography, the acting were all perfect in my book. I also liked that it was filmed in black and white as this helped to not only capture the 'bleakness' of the Holocaust, but it also helped in getting a feel for the era. I also liked how the era had been recaptured and created - it certainly had an authentic feel to it. Finally we come to the acting and for me it was Fiennes that shone as the evil General Amon Goeth - he was really creepy and absolutely personified evil. Neeson and Kingsley were great too, but for me Fiennes put on the best performance.

So having said all that, you might be wondering why I'm only rating this 7/10? Well for me, it is technically perfect, but Schindler's list (at well over 3 hours long was far too long in my opinion). The first hour was brilliant and the last 30-45 minutes were also very good. It was the middle part of the film that dragged for me. I personally felt that 2 1/2 hours max would have been sufficient, but at 3 hours and 15 minutes it was just ridiculous.

Having said that this is still a film that everyone should watch. It's not an easy watch at times, but it's still a very important film. As a side note, the end of the film is probably one of the most 'moving' and 'touching' moments I've ever experienced when watching a film. Great film - but a tad too long in my opinion.",7
6 December 2005,Unforgettable doesn't even begin to describe it!,"This is without any question one of the the most horrific, but in the same time perfect and wonderful films I've ever seen!

Liam Neeson is outstanding with unforgettable acting in his role as Oscar Schindler who becomes human through the story. Ralph Fiennes gives Neeson spectacular support as the psychopathic Nazi-official Amon Goeth; his body language as well as his acting is so cold and realistic that it really gives you the chills! John Williams's amazing music-score brings involuntary tears in every viewer's eyes, and Steven Spelberg's directing has never been (and never will be) better than this. And let's not forget Thomas Keneally and Steve Zaillian who wrote a screenplay that is probably the best one ever written. All of this put together makes you sit through the entire film, even if sometimes it gets so powerful that it feels like you're being punched in your stomach over and over again.

In short, ""Schindler's list"" deserved every Academy award it got. My opinion is that very few future films will ever reach up to the standard that it holds. It's a movie that everyone over 15 should see!",10
15 April 2016,Great Movie!,"Schindler's List

When we think of the holocaust we think of Hitler, Jews, and for some, Oskar Schindler. Steven Spielberg took an absolute horror and showed us how there was still good in man. The movie is an excellent tear jerker and at some times send shivers down your back due to the gruesome inhumanity that was shone. The movie was fantastically crafted to show us the horrors of the holocaust and really toy with our emotions.

For instance, Spielberg's use of color during a black and white film was fantastic and brilliantly thought out. For example, the scene of the of the little girl with the red coat was so incredibly sad and shows us how utterly atrocious it really was that they would have killed a little girl as such. Spielberg had such a way with making the viewer feel a certain way in the film with his use of all special effects, it was fantastic! When it comes to the acting side of the film I have nothing bad to say what so ever. Liam Neeson, usually portrayed as a killer in his other films, found his soft side and acted as Schindler brilliantly. His voice change and overall talent throughout the film made it such a better film. Not to mention all of the supporting roles such as Amon Goeth (played by Ralph Fiennes) who was an S.S. soldier and how ruthless and emotionless he had to be in some scenes when he killed in order to really get Spielberg's point across. After this film was released in 1993 the world not only remembers how many lives were lost, but how Oskar Schindler risked everything to save twelve hundred Jews and his only regret was that he couldn't save more. ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire."" (Oskar Schindler)",10
2 February 2003,Ralph Fiennes was spectacular..,"Oh my God... The commandant really scared the crap outta me.. especially the scene when he is hitting Helen Hirsh, or when he talks to his reflection in the mirror and says ""I pardon You"".. But I do at the same time find him very attractive.. But I've read that the real Amon Goeth was a ladies man so they had to get someone attractive I guess.. and they sure did.. The film itself is fantastic.. Great acting, great music and really scary scenes...

BUT!!! When Amon calls Helen when he wants to say thank you to her in the scene with Schinlder, Amon and Helen, he says Lena not Helen... Bye

31 October 2002,Gross manipulation and a trial to watch,"I have lost my enthusiasm for any Steven Spielberg movies over the past several years, ever since he made the switch from good entertainment to preachy message movies showing people all angsty and heartfelt and noble, emotions which he approaches with all the subtlety of Gallagher and his Sledge-o-matic. Spielberg's films are now more like the corny ramblings of grandpa in his dotage where good people are really good and bad people are bad and even people who are in that grey zone are given a black or white role in the end. It's all quite tedious to watch.

It took me a long time to finally get through Schindler's List, as it did Saving Private Ryan, because I was all too aware the entire time that I was being manipulated -- what to feel and when to feel it. Some reviewer put it best when he likened Spielberg to the Wizard of Oz, hiding behind a curtain and pushing buttons and pulling switches on people's emotions. Then he is hailed as an artist and a genius when it's all gross manipulation.

Liam Neeson did give a good performance. His character had more depth to explore than Ralph Fiennes. Excellent actor Fiennes may be, but he was saddled with a pitifully cardboard character. Still, I rooted for him until the end.

If I want to learn about the Holocaust, I'll watch a documentary and see the facts and have genuine emotions, not be told what to feel. Jaws, Jurassic Park, and the Indiana Jones movies are plain fun and have the true Spielberg touch, doing what he does best.

1 July 2007,"Great, Dramatic Movie","This movie while disturbing, is a movie worth watching. It makes you angry at the horrors the Nazies put the Jews through and it makes you question mankind. It wasn't watered down and it shows that there can be good in the heart of someone who seems hopeless. It's not a movie for those made uncomfortable by the sight of blood. The violence in the movie is what really happened to the Jews and the horrors they faced. The emotion of the plot comes across to the viewer and brings it out. Most of the people that I have spoken to have said that this movie brings out what we have been trying to learn for generations. A very good movie that all should see.

8 August 2002,Spieldberg's Masterpiece,"Schindler's list begins as the story of a man who believes he can use a war that takes millions of lives, and a Nazi regime that murders millions of innocents, to turn a profit. But as the story progresses he begins to see the human side of whats going on, not just the profit margin. After learning of the hardships of those imprisoned, and of the murderers who control the camps, he begins on a quest to try and save not only his soul but the soul of everyone around him, and to keep the flame of humanity lit during the dark destructive reign of Hitler. This is without a doubt the best film of Liam Neeson's career as well as the best film of Steven Spieldberg's career. It shows you how even during a time of chaos and evil, goodness can still be found. It also shows a level of character development that I've never seen in a movie before or after it was released. Without a doubt the greatest movie about the time period of World War II.

12 October 2008,Amazing heartfelt film.,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",10
13 December 2002,Spielberg's Best,"This film, is without a doubt, Spielberg's best work to date. This film captures the horrors of war like no other film before it has. The fact that is centers around the suffering of civilians rather than the military singles this film out from others in the genre.

Filming it in black and white was ingenius for several reasons. First, it makes the film look much like a documentary, thus increasing the realism, and at the same time creating more sympathy for the people in these dire situations. Secondly, I believe the film would be far too graphic in full color. I was also very impressed with the unique use of color in a select few scenes (the little girl with the red coat).

I must admit that this is one of only a handful of movies (and when I say handful, I mean 2 or 3) that actually brought tears to my eyes. This film gripped me like no other. I recommend this movie to anyone who would like to see a reasonably accurate, but not overly graphic depiction of life in World War II Poland.

9/10",
12 October 2001,The best movie I have ever seen,"I have seen this film 12 times and every time I like it more. I like the fact that Mr. Spielberg has done it in black and white. So the film seems very authentical; more like a documentary film. Also the actors are great. Especially Ben Kingsley's act of Stern is fantastic.

But is not a movie that you can watch, relax and forget it. You have to think about it for a long time and it can you make very sad. But otherwise shows you the film that there is always a small hope. So it's an optimistic film as well.

9 December 1998,..a masterpiece that will do more than touch your heart...,"When I first hear about this movie, I was scared to see it, because I heard it was so real and vivid. But when I saw the motion picture, I cried tears of sadness, and of sympathy. It depicts the truth about the other side of WWII. The side that some are ignorant enough to deny ever happened. It teaches us that by doing little, can do so much. The beautiful music, and graphic depiction of the movie add to the wonderful acting, and harsh reality that is cast into the audience. Personally, I think this is Spielberg's best picture, and the one that touches that special place between your heart and soul, this is one movie everyone should see.

26 March 2001,A terrifying rumble through the soul,"After seeing this movie, I regret not seeing it on the silver screen, as this would have done this terrifying, magnificent, powerful film even more justice. As it is, on the TV it is a mesmerizing and gripping story.

I have long ago decided not to have a favorite movie. Too many films offer their own unique pleasures, and singling one out as a favorite is simply to difficult a task.

That being said, 'Schindler's List' is definitely one of my favorites. I am surprised at the criticism I read, but I guess that is what makes us the human race.

The only real flaw in the movie that I saw was near the end, where Schindler is berating himself for not saving more lives. I hope the scene occurred in real life, otherwise it just seems contrived and unnecessary. If it really happened, then the worst you can say is the Neeson simply could not convey the impact of the scene. Or perhaps Schildler really sounded like that at the time. Either way, it was a minor scratch on an other-wise magnificent film.

I won't comment on the films realism because my knowledge of history is weak and I expect Hollywood to take liberties. As long as they kept the spirit of the story alive, that is all that matters to me.

To any one who hasn't seen this movie, I definitely say: see it! It is not light viewing and parents taking their younger children--even their older children, really--should be in attendance, and remember not to dismiss this movie and the scenes therein as mere Hollywood magic.

While I don't pick favorites, I do believe this movie will rate higher than any other movie I have ever rated, with a 9.8 out of 10. If given a choice between a 9 or a 10, I will give it a flat 10.

Thank you.",10
26 September 1999,loved it,"excellent movie, great use of lighting and using black and white film to illustrate the story was great....not everyone nowadays can manipulate black and white film that way anymore, but then, not many are willing to try.

1 April 2018,Great movie,"This movie is great, it potrays the harsh environment of nazi Germany with great detail and while lots of people seem to disagree gives us an intriguing protagonist as at first he only cared for his business and slowly had a change of heart.

There is only one problem with this movie in my opinion, and that is that it drags from time to time. The thing is every scene is interesting but is kind of like a paper you have to write for uni or school and it has a word count you can't exceed even if everything you have written is relevant some of it still needs to be cut out, and the same goes for this movie, some scenes should be cut out even though there was no one scene that stood out as unnecessary.

So 9/10, one thing I must say is that when checking actual reviews here I'm surprised it has the 8.9/10 rating since the majority has been 1/10 reviews.

29 February 2000,The best film ever made ??,"I say the above not in ""entertaining"" meaning, but in the fact that Spielberg has made THE most powerful and thought provoking film ever. It was rightfully given the reviews and awards its deserves at the time, and even after repeated viewings the film always makes me cry at the final scenes.

After looking at the votes cast here for this film, all I can say to the people who voted 1,2,3 just to be ""different""is that I pity them for not having the vision to see just what this film is. Admittedly the film can't to be everyone's taste but even those in the minority can see what the film intended to do and that is the message that atrocities like the Holocaust must never happen again.

17 May 1999,As near perfect as anyone has been,"An extremely difficult subject done to near perfection by a director no-one would previously have thought capable of this level of expression. All style choices complemented the subject matter perfectly, and the film veered away from the mawkish to leave real emotions. The colourised coat has been criticised, but there is really no other way to show the individual tragedies of the holocaust so well. Lifetime best performances are given by all of the leads, Neeson in particular giving a magnificent portrayal of Schindler's moral conversion. Spielberg uses the medium to the limit, to create a lasting and moving testament to those who died.

The fact that it was dragging from the beginning to the end could not satisfy the audience with the pleasure of watching, just as it could not satisfy me. Actually, I don't like to comment on movies a lot, but this is different.

You should definitely save it to your watch list and watch it in your spare time. Even make space for this movie.

20 September 1999,Film making at the top of it's form.,"Your finest work to date Mr Spielberg, a legacy and warning to future generations. Film making at the top of it's form. A beautifully told, harrowing story and that grows with each viewing. Pictures that haunt the mind for ever. A wonderful job from Janus Kiminski and possibly John Williams finest work for the cinema.

Shooting the picture must have been horrific - to recreate the slaughter for weeks on end...must have been dreadful. All those who took part added something this moving and heartfelt

10 September 2002,Doesn't stand the test of time,"Is it possible for Spielberg to make a film that isn't horrendously mawkish ? Can someone please turn off his sentimentality button ?

Viewed nearly ten years after its making, this film's sole purpose of letting the world know how guilty we all should feel about the holocaust only serves to point up the horrors of the ongoing Israeli occupations in Palestine.

I really don't feel that this is a particularly good film besides that.

Ben Kingsley is insufferable, Ralph Fiennes hams it up, Liam Neeson sounds like The Count from Sesame Street.

Spielberg has stated that he set out to make a memorial to the suffering of his people, and he has done a pretty good job of that. Unfortunately, his undoubted talents lie in the field of fantasy, not reality, and this self-indulgent polemic will not earn him his place in history.",1
5 May 2001,Absolutely Brilliant! Instantly put my problems into perspective.,"Simply stated, this was the movie of the 90's. If you were to put each Best Picture Winner in the 90's up against each other and vote to see which movie people thought was the best, it would assuredly win. Words simply cannot describe the power of this movie. For an even better movie experience, read the book ""Night"" by Elie Wiesel before viewing this film. You will then gain a better appreciation for Spielberg's attention to every detail, and you will instantly sense the realistic power and importance of every scene. Its ending brings goosebumps to me even after viewing it several times. The acting is superb, the details and authenticity are unmatched, and the movie is sheer brilliance. In the long list of smashingly successful Spielberg films, ""Schindler's List"" ranks at the very top.

18 December 1999,Great movie... that's all that I can say!,"A great movie showing the life of a ""Nazi gone good""... who other than Oskar Schindler, himself, could join the SS just to avoid being labeled as a ""Jew Lover"", and then turn around and basically stab your own in the back by saving so many of them? I personally have a great respect for the man, and this movie is the reason why. I have done much research on the life of Schindler, and I have come to the conclusion that it was excellently portrayed in this movie, and who else could have done it except Stephen Spelberg? Nobody!

28 December 2020,"Devastating, honest and authentic throughout...","Steven Spielberg has made a huge impact on cinema as we know it. Movies like Jaws and Saving Private Ryan just show how great of a director he is. Schindler's List is another example of Spielberg's talent as a director.

Schindler's List follows Oskar Schindler, a German businessman and a member of the Nazi party, who decides to save the lives of his Jewish workforce after being exposed to the horrific treatment they receive from other Nazis.

What can I say about Schindler's List that hasn't already been said. It's such a disheartening experience that shows the worst of humanity. Through this 3 hour 15 minute film, Schindler's List conveys the brutal and horrific ways Jews were treated by Nazis and Spielberg presents this with as much authenticity as possible. The film's lack of colour captures the bleakness and terror of the Holocaust brilliantly. The black and white created this depressing feeling that loomed throughout the entire film making each scene as gut-wrenching as possible. The film is very long but it felt purposeful as Spielberg explores the barbaric nature of the Nazis and the immense torment Jews had to go through to the fullest. There are still some scenes that are etched in my memory by how realistic and well executed they are. Like the opening scene from Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg doesn't hold back here as there are many graphic images but it's those scenes that carry the most emotions and paint a realistic picture of the Holocaust.

The performances in this film are absolutely spectacular. Liam Neeson is fantastic as Oskar Schindler. His expressions along with the graphic imagery make up for some really powerful moments that I won't forget. Ben Kingsley as Itztak Stern is incredible. The ending involving him and Neeson is one of the most heartbreaking scenes ever and Ralph Fiennes is truly outstanding as Amon Goeth. Goeth is shown to be as evil and ghastly as possible and Fiennes captures that perfectly whilst remaining grounded at all times. Who can also forget John Williams's devastating score that evokes of sadness every time it plays. It's used during all the right moments and elevates the distressing nature of what's taking place.

Along with The Pianist, Schindler's List is one of the best Holocaust films to ever be made. It's one of the most honest and personal depictions of the Holocaust I've ever seen and for that I have to applaud Spielberg and the rest of his crew for the amount of work they put into it. Schindler's List is a film that remains close to many people's hearts and won't be forgotten anytime soon.",10
4 May 2000,The Holocaust in art,"There has been a long-standing debate whether the holocaust could ever be captured in a meaningful way by art. Can an esthetic form be used to describe its antithesis? What should be the purpose of an artistic rendering? Spielberg has proven that the artist can convey the impact of this event that leaves a lasting imprint on the viewer. By selecting an isolated event, the fate of the 1,000 Schindler Jews, Spielberg allows an oblique glance at the vast enterprise of this historically unique genocide. The understated tone of the picture and the brief allusions to the well-known horrors of the time,while concentrating on a small group of protagonists allows the viewer's imagination and emotions to experience the atmosphere of the time in a profound way. The most gripping scene is the evacuation of the Krakow ghetto. During the mayhem of soldiers, gunfire, attack dogs and terrified victims a small girl walks through the black and white scene in a spot of color. Six million victims are not fathomable, but one little girl can represent them all. Spielberg has shown the power of art to describe the indescribable.

This is a true Epic movie for all ages. It's depth and storytelling ability are astounding, no matter what your opinion on the ""facts"" are.

This is a Must see movie. The music, picture work, and script are so incredible, as well as heartfelt. This story must be told, and is in no way biased or self-important.

His combined use of effective technical components and brilliant actors creates a moving, genuinely important film. The actors are wonderful, Liam Neeson in particular. Every time I see this film I feel like cursing the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for not giving him the Oscar. The main reason I love this film is that not only is it a work of entertainment, it is important. I do not usually cry at movies but this one gets me every time. Everyone should see this film; I guarentee you will not be able to forget it easily.

21 May 2003,The More I See It The Less I Like It,"I thought SCHINDLER`S LIST was a masterpiece when I first saw it a few years ago and having seen it again a couple of times over the years I find myself admiring it less and less after each subsequent viewing . This is down to my gut feeling that the film sugarcoats many events , especially the eponymous character . Remember the scene at the end where Oskar Schindler gives away his goldnes parteiabzeichen in order to finance the saving of some more lives ? It`s a very touching scene but in reality this badge would have no value , so how is this explained ? Very easily - The holocaust happened but that scene didn`t. And I find the character interaction somewhat cheesy between Schindler and Stern . It`s like Stern`s manipulating Schindler while Schindler is making it clear that he doesn`t need manipulating because he`s going to save as many human lives as possible . It`s like the film is trying to say only someone who is good by nature can benefit humanity , an almost insulting simplification and rose tinted view of human nature . This is why I enjoyed Ralph Fiennes performance as Amon Goeth so much . He`s a Nazi murderer who shoots woman and kids , but Fiennes plays him not as an inhuman goose stepping monster but as an all too flawed human one .",7
23 December 2000,A moving movie,"Schindler¬¥s List is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It shows in a true and uncensored way how the nazist abused the jews. What Oskar Schindler did is something noone who's seen the movie will forget.

Liam Neeson is great in this movie, he really made us see how he turned from being a nazi to become its enemy.

24 June 2007,One of the Best Films I've Seen,"I've read a lot of the comments on this movie and while everyone is entitled to their opinion, it pained me to see that many people missed the point of the movie altogether. Many people have labeled this as a horrible movie simply because it was made by Spielberg. Others criticize the way he used Black and White film (with the exception of the Girl in the red coat) and still others claim that there was no Schindler.

Just because a movie is made by Spielberg, doesn't mean it's going to be trash. This has to be the first movie of his I've seen that I actually really learned something from and left me wanting to make the world a better place. Maybe that seems stupid to some people, but knowing what Schindler did makes me believe that maybe one day I can help someone too.

As for the black and white film, I think it fit beautifully. In the 30's and 40's there really wasn't a lot of color film used, especially for Journalism and the news. It fit with the time period very well. Also, the little girl in the red coat was a wonderfully sentimental touch. There actually was a little girl wearing a scarlet coat the day of the Karkow Liquidation that caught Schindler's eye and it completely disgusted him that people could commit such atrocities in front of a child. What happens later is symbolic of what was happening to the millions of people (Jewish, Gypsies, Homosexuals, etc.) and the fact that no one was standing up for them. The little girl and seeing her running through the crowd and what happens later helps to open up Schindler's eyes in the movie.

Many people here have claimed that the character of Oskar Schindler was completely fabricated so that Sielberg could get some money. Fortunately enough for those 1,200 people, there was a real Schindler and he really did help them. He wasn't the best of men and he certainly had his faults. He drank excessively, he was a renowned womanizer, he supported slave labor, and he was a member of the Nazi party. . . but despite all that, he still did something good for other people. Oh, and contrary to what some people have claimed, while Schindler did in fact make a fortune during the war, he spent practically all of it to save the Jewish workers. He lost everything he had gained during the war to save them.

Liam Neeson, I felt, did a great job portraying Schindler and Ralph Fiennes was brilliant as Amon Goeth. Fiennes in particular was rather frightening at how well he portrayed such a feared member of the Nazi party.

There is a lot of nudity in the movie. Some people complain about that, but honestly, what do you expect? Do you really think that the Nazis told them that they'd turn away while they got changed? No. The nudity in the film (as portrayed by the Jewish and other victims) was necessary because it helps to demonstrate exactly what these poor people had to endure.

In closing, don't listen to all the negative reviewers out there claiming it's bad because of nudity, Spielberg, or any other number of things. This is truly a movie that you can't judge until you've seen it for yourself.",10
23 December 2021,He who saves one life...,"""In a place where there are no men, strive to be a man.""

Extraordinary movie about Oscar Schindler who brought humanity amid WWII darkness. I refuse to believe that there were no heroes in this most dark time of the humankind. This film closely covers the story of a man that witnessed the grim reality and made a life changing decision.

A masterpiece!

25 February 1999,It is great with passion,"Martin Scorsese was right. A jewish director could do a better job. Steve Spielberg made this the best film anyone could make it. Everything about it was done with great care and great respect for the 11 million victims of the Holocaust. The acting was also done with care and respect. Liam Neeson playing Schindler had the best male performance while Anna Mucha ( Danka Dresner ) and Embeth Davidth ( Helen Hirsh ) had the best female performances.

Although it isn't a film you would enjoy seeing you should see. Just so you can find out what really happened in the Holocaust.

26 October 2015,Probably the most heart touching movie ever!,"As a millenial, the happenings of World War 2 and The Holocaust was probably one of the least understood topics of our generation. This movie takes the viewers right into the gruesome but realistic happenings of The Holocaust, in the backdrop of the Second World War.

Steven Spielberg has done a fantastic job of making this movie as close to perfection as possible. The direction, the acting, especially that of Liam Neeson deserves applause and the black and white portrayal makes it even more heartening and gives a sense of timelessness, adds more to the 'hopelessness' theme as other reviewers here have mentioned. The movie is pretty long, about >3 hours but every second spent on this movie is worth.

The story-line develops smoothly. It tracks the journey of a man named Oskar Schindler from a War Profiteer to that of a man who'd go on to save over a thousand Jewish lives from the horrors of The Holocaust. It also gives a very realistic portrayal of the life in Nazi occupied Poland.

There's one particular scene that will melt away the toughest of hearts. I won't spoil it for you, but it's about a girl in red!

Overall, it's one of the best movies made in the history of Hollywood and it's the best movie about World War 2 and The Holocaust.

Worth watching, every bit. Personally for me, it's one of the best movies ever. Go watch it. 10/10.",10
15 July 2004,Perhaps the most important film ever made,"When I first saw this film, the words of a close friend of mine echoed through my head. He had said to me that he 'could not sit and watch this film in one go without getting emotional'. My friend had Polish roots and felt affected by the very events the film portrays.

I watched this film and was disappointed... disappointed that this film did not feel so much like a movie, but more like a very harrowing documentary. I admit that I was able to what the movie in one sitting, but that fact is due to the sheer power with which the film has been shot. I, like I imagine my friend did, cried during the final scenes.

There are few movies that truly touch on the subject of prejudice without giving it the ""Hollywood"" treatment, but this film manages to ascend beyond such grandiose ideas and achieve its goal.

I hope that when I get older I will be able to dig out a copy of Schindler's List and show it to my grandchildren and say to them that the world used to be a terrible place, where those who were different were treated badly, but because of films of this quality we learnt so much more about the world around us and learnt to embrace our differences and what makes us individual, rather than what makes us weak or strong.

I could NEVER love this movie, because it is too upsetting to love, but I admire this move for the strength of its convictions and the story that it tells.",9

7 February 2020,The Film of the Century,"While it's a hard film to watch, it is in my opinion the greatest film ever made. The score, the cast and the overall feel of the film is breathtaking and a film that should remind us all, that not only is it our job to remind our children of the horrors of Nazi Germany but never allow it to happen again.

4 December 2017,Story,"I generally enjoyed this movie, but it was also really sad. It was very well done (the cinematography, acting, scenery, & non-fictional historic events). I recommend this film if you're studying World War II, but I wouldn't recommend this movie for children, because it's pretty graphic and violent.

16 October 2014,One of the best of it's genre ever! Poignant and moving.,"Spielberg's finest! Superb writing, acting and directing. I honestly couldn't say who was the better actor, Liam Neelson or Ralph Feinnes. The character's were so real and the actors gave performances that will never be forgotten. The cinematography beyond spectacular. Can't say enough about this one. Loved the black-white effect. It made the movie more bleak, dark, horror of the Holocaust. John Williams' musical score is wonderful. Schindler's List is a film that everyone should see and appreciate to its fullest extent. Spielberg will remain an immortal filmmaker through the work he put into this film. This one along with Jurassic Park, Jaws,E.T, Raider of the Lost Ark, Saving Private Ryan, etc. Schindler's List will remain in my humble opinion his best!

19 September 2018,One of the best I've ever seen,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed.

20 January 2005,The Best?,"This is a complex issue, but I still think this is the overall best movie I have ever seen. The characters, acting, storyline, cinematography, and general atmosphere and emotional depth combine to make a movie like no other.

Haunting, exciting, once in a while funny, gripping, rewarding, moving, significant, etc, etc. Wow!

It may paint a slightly rosy picture of Oskar Schindler, but, remember, it is a movie. I think this picture almost perfectly blends a documentary and cinematic feel. I is literary, artistic, and substantial.

I love Casablanca. Citizen Kane is a classic, maybe the best by many standards. But Schindler's List is movie of the modern generation which achieves classic status by both prior and current critical standards.

It is the last ""great"" film I have seen at a cinema. No doubt there are great films I have not seen. Any suggestions?",10

8 March 2023,Masterpiece,"I'm still in awe. It's been probably a year since I watched this movie for the first time. I haven't watched it since then...I still think this movie is flawless.

Everything in this movie feels so real (I mean, it's based on a true story after all).

Most of the time, It didn't feel like a movie. It felt like found footage from one of the darkest, if not the darkest, times of history.

I had to legitimately remind myself that I was watching a movie, not a documentary. There was people behind it, who took their time and patience to make this 3 hour long opus.

It's rare that I say this genuinely, but this movie is a fucking masterpiece.

26 May 2001,Is Schindler a saint?,"Wow. arn't we all amazed from the effect of the movie on us. Either it was the inhummanity or hummanity of man to man,both were equally surprising. If Shindler was not real I would have thought that this movie was a big 'stretch' and fake. The movie is an excellent proof of the holocaust. But let us not forget that the holocaust happened to the jews,but many other races.

Now, looking at Shindler, and all the wonderfull things he has done

to the jews. Why would a person like him who is a briber, womanizer, and a Nazi, even care ? Is it because the sake of saving lives?, is

it for the sake of going against the flow or rules of the country?,is

it for being bold?, is it to be loved and admired by a minority?, is to be rememberd by history?, is it his duty assigned to him from god? or is it to fill a need iside himself?. These are some of many questions trying to justify Shindler's actions. No one knows which are the true reasons for what Shindler did. Does anyone one know why Nazis were

against the jews and many other races? It is an injustified and mad

world. In my opinion this is the movie's theme. How could man commit such a terrible crime against fellow humans and how could some people, like Shindler, be kind enough to do such a good deed?",
10 June 1999,One of the greatest movies,"This has GOT to be one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I was so deeply moved when I first saw it that I could hardly watch it. I cried for nearly all three hours of the movie. Liam Neeson, as usual, did a superb job in acting his part. He was a charming lady's-man, and you couldn't help but like him, even in the beginning. This is a movie about the Holocaust that people should not miss. A definite classic

17 May 2004,awesome,"I saw this film for the first time last night, and was moved by the entire production. Yes it is a film, and it is fact that certain liberties would have been taken, it is Hollywood after all, but i have yet to witness a piece of such magnitude and such endeavor to portray the Hollocaust as it was. Spielberg could have ruined this and made the event seem like such a trivia that Hollywood had to glorify it to make it powerful, instead he stuck with the truth and what happened, he produced a film that is a credit to all involved.

ritualphilosophy needs to get his priorities sorted. the masses that were massacred and in the fashion in which they were has been well portrayed in this film, and shows one particular historic event that effected millions. Maybe your just a fan of Arnold and Sly stalon movies that bear no truth just big bulky men saving an entire nation with a toothpick. open your eyes and realize a piece off film that is powerful and inspiring about one particular historic event doesn't mean others have been forgotten. why don't you go and sit with a hot drink and cuddle up with a good Ben Aflec film such as hmmm, ""pearl Harbour"" is thats your idea of a film depicting an event so accurately!!!

19 October 1999,Perhaps the most socially significant film of all time,"No film has ever been more deserving of the Best Picture Oscar. In the same category with ""High Noon"" and ""On the Waterfront"" in that it shows how one imperfect human being willing to make himself available in the fight against evil can make a difference. The scene near the end where Oscar Schindler takes leave of his ""people"" is certainly one of the most profoundly moving in cinema history. If I could save only one film for posterity, this would probably be the one.

11 November 2003,Superb and moving film,"This film is a masterpiece it shows the ferocity and evil of the Nazi regime during WWII. It displays the dehumanising of the Jewish people of which previous films had failed to display to the level that Schindler's list has shown.

The film shows the change over an individual who at the start is seen as a cruel, vindictive businessman who after seeing the tragedy of the jewish people shows compassion and empathy to those that the Nazi regime wishes to get rid off like lambs to the slaughter.

Having the film in black and white is a masterstroke, allowing the viewer to see the footage rather than being distracted by the colour, it is a superb film and if watched should move you to tears.

30 August 2009,"Perhaps the most important movie, and the finest movie, ever made","Steven Spielberg has stated that it took him ten years to even become comfortable with making 1993's Academy Award-winning Schindler's List, and it was worth the wait. Well-crafted in almost every aspect, this movie is a little over three hours long but is capable of holding the viewer's attention and teaches a lesson of tolerance that no movie has ever done before. Featuring a professionally-written screenplay, flawless acting, brilliant direction, a tearjerking storyline, and unbeatable character development, Schindler's List is essential for all movie buffs!

4/4 Stars

6 September 2001,Pretentious Oscar-pandering is Spielberg's WORST,"OK, I really don't like this film. So I'll start with the positives. That would be Ben Kingsley....ok, I guess that's it.

First of all, there's the obvious fact that Spielberg was gunning for the Oscar on this one. He picked an issue that was popular in the politically correct world of Oscar voters, one that nobody can remedy or do anything about but they all like to discuss to show how much they care, and ran with it. The full weight of the concentration camp massacres can only really be seen in that French documentary (the name eludes me.) And if you want to get a feel for life in Nazi Germany, you might as well watch the propaganda film ""Triumph of the Will,"" giving the viewer a chilling glimpse at the culture of national socialism.

Spielberg's attempts to be ""artsie"" are incredibly phony, particularly the ""red dress girl""'s presence in a B&W film. An Liam Neeson simply does not pull off his part. At the film's end, you REALLY want to sympathize with Schindler when he laments that he could have saved ""one more,"" but Neeson's performance in that critical scene is unconvincing. He plays the cold and reserved parts of Schindler's character so strongly that the character development leading to that emotional climax is lost.

People rate this film highly because they feel that they're supposed to. Don't take their word. The film (with Kingsley as the exception) is poorly acted, drawn out, and pretentious. If you've been fortunate enough to miss this film so far, keep up the good work.",2
20 June 2022,Horrfic,"The shots, were perfect, the dialogue matches just as well.

My heart dropped many a time, and I found myself shocked at the true nature of humanity.

The whole time, I was praying it was a fake dystopian world.

Tragically and horrifically realistic ,

This is a faithful adaptation of the book ""Schindler's Ark"". And as for the critics who said the at the little girl who had the red coat being a little ""cheesy"" and a typical Speilberg moment, this little girl actually existed and did indeed wear a red coat. One moan, please can someone explain to me how Ralph Fiennes lost out for an Oscar to Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive) - if anything made a mockery of the Academy Awards, this decision did.

13 February 2001,Black and white,"It appears that the comments by IMDB users have to be every bit as black-and-white as the plot of the average Hollywood production? A film has to be either outstanding or miserable?

Sorry, can't comply. I recommend Schindler's List to my friends on the basis of its beautiful photography and the outstanding performance by Ben Kingsley. I wouldn't have said that Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson do a great job. Charismatic though they both are, they just put on their usual stone faces for their respective parts.

The film is definitely worth seeing, but I would argue that it's overrated all the same. Because... such an immoderate amount of praise has been heaped upon it. True, Spielberg's story about human kindness in adversity is a sweet and all-American story. But it doesn't have much to do with the black-in-black disaster that was the Holocaust.

31 July 2001,One of the most important films of modern times,"Some events in human history are of such a magnitude that no single film made anywhere, least of all Hollywood, can ever do them complete justice. But in 1993 Steven Spielberg put all his heart and soul into a film about the greatest injustice that Man has ever foisted upon his fellow man--the Holocaust. SCHINDLER'S LIST is the result.

This epic movie, shot in a somber, documentary-style black-and-white, focuses on Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a savvy Nazi businessman who had opened an enamelware factory in Krakow, Poland after the Nazis basically overran it. Schindler was every bit the womanizer and con man, and initially he saw the Jewish people of the Krakow ghetto as potential slave labor, nothing more. But when it became rather clear to him what his fellow Nazis were doing to the Jews, he began to use his powers of persuasion to shield his workers and their families. In doing so, he somehow managed to save twelve hundred lives from extinction.

Spielberg clearly does not gloss over Schindler's gamier side, though he may be accused of romanticizing it. But he also does not spare us the horrible fact of the Nazis wiping out at least six million people because they were Jews, and perhaps three times as many more of other ""inferior"" peoples. Ralph Fiennes is about as chilling a villain as there could possibly be, since he's portraying the notorious Auschwitz death guard Amon Goeth. This is a film about pain, death, and murder on a scale never before seen in human history (and, if we're lucky, which will never been seen again). But it is also about redemption. Oskar Schindler was no saint; and for each life he saved, at least 5000 more died. But he did as much as he possibly could, and went broke doing it. For that, there is a place in heaven for him.

Winner of seven Oscars, including Best Picture and Director (which Spielberg clearly deserved long before this), SCHINDLER'S LIST is one of the most important films of modern times, a monumental statement against hatred from a master of the cinema.",10
27 February 1999,A great commentary on a terrible time in history.,"This film is easily my favourite ever. It's unbelievably well acted, the backdrops are flawless and I don't think that the cast could have been any better. Also, I think that this film, though criticised for being seemingly ""historically inaccurate"", comes closest to depicting the Holocaust as it most likely was. All the rushes of emotion that come to you are powerful indeed. The fear, horror and anger leave you shocked at what that generation had to go through, and happy and relieved that nothing of that caliber has yet to befall our generation. I think even that it can affect the actors, as well as the audience, not unlike ""Saving Private Ryan,"" a more recent film. I have heard Ralph Fiennes say that Amon Goeth was and most likely will be the most difficult role he's ever had to play, simply because of the complexity of the character. Liam Neeson is also brilliant, and I think his character best sums up the majority of Germans at the time: taking advantage of the situation, because they don't know what's going on. Then they find out, and views undergo complete modification. My overwhelming view is that the movie is a wonderful commentary, full of sophisticated symbolism, yet isn't over the head of an average viewer. A work of art.

10 December 2002,A copout!!!!,"Warning, I am one of those Jewish people who has never been so offended in my life. This film shows that Speilberg cares only about likeable characters and whimsy. What a copout! Jews in this film are only shown as rambling ethnicities in tableau shots.

Speilberg would rather take a German Gentile, ficitonalize his story (that speech he gives at the end as Schindler is about to leave and Stein gives him the ring was made up, it is historically incorrect and totally made up) and make a movie about the Holocaust from that point of view. My grandmother, who was a Holocaust survivior, walked out in tears from the theatre claiming his film was all lies.

Spielberg makes lovely shots, just beautifully photographed, of violence. This is suppose to make us feel the pain, to feel the irony and all it really does is fetishize violence. We don't learn anything about the jews in this film so it doesn't even hurt that much.

Historically incorrect, Speilberg has the nerve to send the Jews to Auschwitz until Schindler can fix the mistake. UM excuse me by the time Schindler had a list, Auschwitz was practically empty and was no longer gassing bodies. If you want a real look at the holocaust, look at the footage actual nazi soldiers shot in the camps. Or read books by the surviovors. Don't watch Schindlers List because all you will get is a redemption story, designed to make us feel as if we too, like Schindler, would save the Jews. It's embarrassing and inaccurate. How dare Spielberg bastardize the pain my heritage, my family, and other Jewish families went through, make it historically inaccurate and then give it to schools around the country? Yep, thats cool.",6
10 April 2022,Powerful Film,"To say that this film is disturbing and deeply moving is an understatement.

Incredible production , the acting was excellent , also the idea to film this in black and white , was a stroke of genius .

I cannot praise this film enough, I did not even notice that it was so long , because I was so captivated throughout .

It is a hard and difficult watch , but a neccessary one .

The final scene is incredibly moving .

This movie is a true masterpiece , it is a must watch for generations to come .

8 April 2001,I cried.,"Really, what more can you say than that? When the children of the survivors placed their stones on Schindler's grave at the end, I was touched on a level that no film had reached me at in years. Ignorant people always say it's not manly for a man to cry, but I think if you can watch this film and not come away profoundly changed then you have nothing but cold darkness in your heart. To this day I still can't believe people deny the Holocaust ever happened - that's as ludicrious as saying the Middle Passage is a hoax or that the Trail of Tears is an exaggeration by Native American activists. Bullsh*t. The level of depravity humanity can wreak on one another is heartbreaking, but this movie proves even in the greatest darkness people can STILL find hope.

7 February 2002,Gives even the most ardent skeptic hope for the human race.,"The fact that this is based on a true story makes one pause, look into the mirror and ask yourself if you would have had the courage and resolve to do what Schindler did.

Most of us would probably verbalize that we would have. Many of us have probably even convinced ourselves that we would have tried to do the right thing. Maybe its just the skeptic in me, but I'll bet that, given those circumstances, over 99% of us would have taken the easy way out which would have been to do nothing.

27 April 2020,One if the best film ever.,"I'm from Russia, and for all russian people theme of WWII is very important because 27 millions Soviet people died at this war. We have a lot of good or even perfect films about it. I think this film is very popular in my country because it tries to show the madness of nazism, the inhumane of fascism. Firstly, the plot of this film is interesting because it based on real story about man who tries to save lifes despite of fact that he could be killed for this. Secondly, the cast is wonderful, all actors did their work perfectly regardless of the amount of screen time. Of course, the pair of two brilliant actors: Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes did one if the best performance. At the film they have a kind of psychological duel. Thitdly, the atmosphere of film is made by colour decision and music. The end of film can leave you in the tears. So, it's one of the best film ever.

18 August 2014,"Leaves you stunned and mesmerized, with your mouth agape","The Holocaust during World War II forms the backbone of the plot in this highly-acclaimed, heart-touching movie. Oskar Schindler is introduced as an opportunistic and avaricious businessman, who hires Jews as workers merely because they constitute cheap labor. But, soon enough, his greed is subdued by his attachment to them and he plans to save them from Hitler's persecution, even if he has to throw away his hard-earned savings as bribes to the Nazi officers. A very commendable job by the writers makes the character come alive very convincingly. Liam Neeson cannot be given any less credit for portraying the protagonist and Ben Kingsley as Stern adds a cherry to the cake. But, the portrayal of the setup actually used by Nazis to slaughter the Jews, makes the audience shiver with fear and disbelief. The detailing and hard-work put by Spielberg is quite evident in the scene where the Jewish children try to elude the Nazi soldiers by hiding in places inconceivable to any ordinary man. Another such instance is when the Jews are transported in trains, huddled like cattle without enough space to take even a whiff of air.

An unbiased judge may opine that there were quite a few instances where the protagonist may have been idealized in order to make the people really adore him. This can be defended by accepting that the real Oskar Schindler acted only as a source of inspiration for the role, and the rest had to be cooked up as per the appetite of the audience. All in all, the movie stands today as a masterpiece made once in a lifetime.",9

When Oskar exclaims in misery that he could've helped more, could've done more, looks at the ring on his finger, and almost falls the the ground, it makes you cry. You wish you could've yourself done more, even though you weren't there. Liam Neeson is amazing in this movie. I don't cry often. Yet, this movie takes you through such a story, and makes you imagine yourself in this time and place, wishing you could do more. I like when a drama still has enough suspense combined with plot, character development, that it pulls at you from several angles. This is well- thought out and remains at the top of my list today.

27 November 2002,Wow...,"This movie has to be Spielberg's best movie ever. This movie cannot be explained in words. Simply put, it is breath taking as well as touching. There are so many scenes that create such feelings of disbelief to joy to sadness. If you love movies and you HAVE NOT seen this film, truly there is something wrong with you. When Spielberg's career is over and when it is all said and done, this will be the film that will define his career. Enough of me, you must go out and buy this video (as it is not on DVD at the present moment)and watch it over and over again. Then when it comes out on DVD, you can buy that too.

Outstanding. 10/10!

13 August 2004,Worthy examination of moral complexity,"In general, I do not rate Spielberg all that highly, primarily because of his history of big-budget garbage like ET and Jurassic Park - movies that appeal to the most base aspects of humanity - but I think that he redeemed himself with this movie. Firstly, if I were to be a cynic, I would say that the choice of the Holocaust as a setting for a drama that would establish Spielberg's artistic credentials is a little too obvious. I am not going to be a cynic, however, but instead will share a couple of thoughts that I have about the story. What I find is the most significant aspect of the movie is the way the character of Oskar Schindler fits nicely between his initial role as a war-profiteer through to his eventual role as a local saviour.

What I am saying here is that the ambiguity which a number of you have expressed regarding the character of Schindler can be answered quite succinctly whilst simultaneously demonstrating that Spielberg had not established a character whose 'virtue' was defined at the outset and which was exposed to the evils of the Nazis. The most important details about Schindler are that he was a cynical, exploitative, manipulative opportunist who always kept his real motives hidden from others. We see glimpses of this in his relationship with his wife, and the introductory scene where he essentially establishes his Nazi support-base by presenting himself as someone who he is not, but, through a convincing performance, as a confident, wealthy and important businessman (which he was not at that time). Combine this with his tactical resourcefulness in securing the capital for his enamel factory from a couple of wealthy Jews and his entrance into the Jewish underground market, and we see that Schindler cements his position in the movie as a man of power through the use of cynical, selfish methods. The moral complexity of Schindler, however, comes when he uses exactly the same methods to secure the lives of his workers. If he had not been the cynic as I described, there would have been no way for him to secure a position in which he would have been able to save the workers.

So for those who may have some qualms regarding Schindler as a man, the lesson is that the very vices that he had were precisely the reason why he was able to do what he did. To place this in the wider context of the Holocaust, what we learn through the movie is that in a situation that is so incredibly dire and hopeless, normal understandings about morality and virtuous character have no application. A genuinely 'good' man would have been powerless to resist the Nazi deathmachine; only a 'bad' man like Schindler would ever have been able to find a place within that climate to do what needed to be done to resist the genocide. This exploration of the dual-nature of vice, being reprehensible under ordinary circumstances (the fact that he was a failure before and after the war) but absolutely essential to do good in exceptional circumstances is, I believe, one of the most significant lessons that Spielberg portrayed in ""Schindler's List"". It was certainly a relief from the usual wholly good heroes that Spielberg seems to love in his other movies. Bravo.",
21 June 2017,Extraordinary,"For me is a Spielberg's masterpiece. An amazing cast makes this one of the all time best movies.

There were many touching moments in the plot. Especially the closing scene, where Liam breaks down , simply heart touching.

Schindler's List has become one of my favorite.

30 January 2015,"Great Movie, Liam Neeson at his best!","Based on a true story, Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List stars Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, a German businessman in Poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews who've been herded into Krakow's ghetto by Nazi troops, Schindler has a dependable unpaid labor force. For Stern, a job in a war-related plant could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for Schindler. However, in 1942, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp, overseen by Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), an embittered alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in his plant, but, as he sees what is happening to his employees, he begins to develop a conscience. He realizes that his factory (now refitted to manufacture ammunition) is the only thing preventing his staff from being shipped to the death camps. Soon Schindler demands more workers and starts bribing Nazi leaders to keep Jews on his employee lists and out of the camps. By the time Germany falls to the allies, Schindler has lost his entire fortune -- and saved 1,100 people from likely death. Schindler's List was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven, including Best Picture and a long-coveted Best Director for Spielberg, and it quickly gained praise as one of the finest American movies about the Holocaust.",10
19 January 2022,Perfect,"Best historical movie I advise everyone! Very cool movie, this has never happened before! In general, it is worth watching, the film teaches a lot: compassion, love, sincere friendship. It's hard to watch, it's violent at times. Recommended to all history buffs!

16 September 2009,"I watch it annually, it's THAT good!","Everyone needs a slap in the face once in awhile to jar their senses...and this movie was that slap for me. I needed to be jarred awake from my apathy over the events of the Holocaust. In 1993 I got that awakening thanks to this film by Spielberg.

This is probably one of the most graphic and compelling accounts from a Nazi death camp, juxtaposed to more modern fare, say ""The Boy in Striped Pajamas"" which left me very disappointed and unmoved.

Schindler was very moving. It made me cry. At times the images shocked me enough to want to look away, but I did not. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I loved the use of black and white film, except where the color red was splashed in (i.e. the little girls coat at the beginning).

I've made it an annual ritual to rent this film and watch it. And when my daughters get old enough, they'll join me in this important ritual. Never again will I get apathetic towards the horrors of the Holocaust.

29 April 2004,Some of the best acting ever!,"I can't believe I've finally seen this movie, after 11 years! This is Spielberg at his best, it must have been tremendously emotional to have watched the first run of this masterpiece. I'm not going to give a university professor like analysis of this movie, but suffice to say, it was worth the wait. Obviously there are several horrific moments of human brutality that we witness, but when I finished watching the movie, it wasn't so much the random killings and scenes of mass carnage that affected me the most...no, it was the sheer hopelessness that was portrayed by the Jewish prisoners. The feelings of utter doom, separation of families, and watching the children being hauled off to Auschwitz. I say this, because in some ways, I was prepared for the scenes of mass burnings and atrocities, thanks to the old 16mm high school history films back in the early 70's (remember those?). Ralph Fiennes is absolutely chilling and brilliant in his role, but it's Kingsley and Neeson that really steal the show. I've always admired Kingsley....I think his role in Ghandi is one of the top three performances of all time. He's truly the voice and conscience that we witness penetrating the soul of Schindler. But let's get to Neeson's role in this movie. To put it bluntly, how he never won the best actor for his role in this movie is beyond me. It's simply stunning. Don't get me wrong....Tom Hanks was great in Philadelphia, but I have to rate this performance as POWERFUL! One of the most powerful aspects of this movie was at the end, when they brought out the survivors along with the respective actors who played their role, and put the stones on Schindlers grave. I had tears in my eyes....this must have had a tremendous impact on the actors. So that's it....a simple summary to a complex movie in a horrific period in our history. It reminds us of the evil that has perpetrated in the hearts of men in the past and continues to do so in the present. This is a movie not to be forgotten and should be watched by all who enjoy top rate acting.",
14 March 1999,Very Touching,"This movie was an experience that should never be forgotten. My English teacher recommended that we should see this movie since we are studying the events of WWII and I am glad she did. This movie gives a better glimpse into what actually happened during the Holocaust although not everything. The movie was wonderful except for the scenes with sex in it. I don't think that was needed but overall it was great!

10 March 2023,Raw Unmitigated History,"I don't usually write reviews. But in this case I fee compelled to. The horrors I witnessed in this film were so numerous and the lack of decency directed towards of other human beings was completely in line with everything I've been told about the living nightmares visited on innocent people during the Holocaust.

It is raw and unvarnished truth albeit with certain liberties taken. As would any film. However the peril and surrounding of death is captured perfectly for lack of a better term.

I will be showing this to my children so they will see and understand the true horror that happens when people stand by and do nothing.

20 April 2009,A Must See!,"If you haven't watched it yet, you better get it! I watched the uncut version. It is a very sad movie, but uplifting at the same time. Who cares about special affects, and all the really extreme graphics movies have now days. This movie doesn't even have any of that except for the one red colored item in the whole entire movie. It is everything a movie should be. I recommend this movie to watch, but it is not for the faint of heart. The horror it reveals of the actual holocaust is something the faint of heart would most certainly be torn from. It's true. This is what happened. And this is a movie that truly reveals it exactly how it went.

19 May 1999,The most moving piece of art ever created.,"This movie, which at first I was reluctant to see turned out to be a revelation for me. I was absolutely shocked by the horrific pictures Steven Spielberg wove throughout the film. This movie had me crying (and I don't cry for much) from the beginning to the end and if you have one ounce of sensibility you will too. This movie not only informs you, but it also shocks you and makes you think about yourself and the whole human race in general. What makes me sad is that there are people who didn't like it or even detested it; these people, I believe should watch it again to grasp the importance of this film. This, I beleive is the greatest movie of all time.

5 September 2004,The Beauty of Life Beyond Horror,"Life goes on despite carnage and war! that is the overriding theme of the movie.During one of the darkest hour of human history despite brutality and holocaust ,a radiance of hope emerges from one of the least likely member of the human tribe.

That is reassuring!!

Spielberg masters his craft well to restore our faith in humanity.The black & white picture adds a sense of stark realism, authenticating the plot.The story of the German businessman Schindler is well known so its futile to repeat.His transformation from a war-profiteer to a saviour is miraculous yet heart-warming.Liam Neeson gives a memorable performance as Schindler.So does the brilliant Ben Kingsley as Ithzak Stern.Who can say that this man was so convincing as Gandhi just few years ago? Ralph Fiennes too delivers as the sadistic yet shrewd villain Amon Goeth and so does the other side-actors.Indeed the subtle diplomacy between Schindler and Goeth is one of the stand points of the film.

Dedication can be sensed in every frame of the movie right from the camera work to the background score.It seems the crew members realized the importance of history they were re-creating.The script is taut and does not drag despite the over 3 hrs length of the film.The scene with the little girl in red dress(only color frame in the movie) involves the audience with its underlying innocence.From there on Schindler's transformation affects us too as we realize the enormity of the journey he embarks upon.Beyond the macabre mass murders and ""killings for fun"" we start to share the collective joy and grief of the struggling community-that sense of togetherness lingers on far after the film ends.That is the biggest reward from the film.

Today there are few thousand Jews left in whole Poland while Schindler's Jews alone have grown beyond 10000.

Whosoever saves one life,saves the world entire.

Who said we cannot make a difference?",9
4 July 2020,The Most Important Film in History,"This is easily the most powerful film that I have ever watched. I always knew about the atrocities that were committed by the Nazis during the holocaust. Schindler's list is a haunting depiction of those atrocities. The highlights come in the form of the performances given by Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley. Ben, who plays Itzhak Stern (hope I am spelling that right), never allows us to forget the glimmer of hope that is seen in the darkest of times. Liam Neeson is outstanding.

This is a film that everyone needs to see. It is the most important film ever made. When you watch it, it will stay with you for the rest of your life.

13 December 2013,literally takes your breath away,"This film is a masterpiece, it truly is one of those films that you watch and can never ever forget. Many people have written reviews, and I agree with most of what's being said. The choice of black and white to portray the bleak, hopeless atmosphere, coupled with those few flashes of color to underline the horror and make it more personal, is just genius.

However I mostly wanted to write this review because in very few of them did I see John Williams' name. True, the acting in this film is topnotch, the direction is basically flawless, but it's the music that makes this film. Seriously I dare anyone to hear those violins crying and not cry themselves.

There is something extremely powerful in it and I truly believe that the film would not be half of what it is without it, that feeling of horror, stupor mixed with anger and outrage that I personally felt at the end of this film mainly stems from the power of the music. Of course I'm not taking anything away from the actors and the director which were all BRILLIANT , but I just felt that there hadn't been enough said about John Williams...",10

21 September 2022,"smooth in most time , very eotional on the end",I m not very sure if the local Greek TV has aired this movie . Thanks to Netflix I seen this marvelous movie just little before it was removed from their servers (watched Sept 20th with system removal on Sept30th ) Blow I notice some musings Its biggest problem is its huge length : 3.30 hours watching it tired my eyes The movie is al in grayscale noticing the past except the colorful end hatis the present Liam Neeson is one of my top performers since the last 10 years . He shines in this movie and is quite convincing is tis role .Amon is quite crazy and drunk person and overzealous as the gestapo person killing for no reason Most of the actors play well Scenics are very good as the photography Surely Spielberg's business Story goes smooth though quite slow . I could prefer if t could be quite faster Even the results of the story was very good : a good entrepreneur who respects his Jew employees destined otherwise to be killed and protects them from any possible hurdle in the war times . Very humanly. This is the reason they respected him so much as in the end of the movie The last 20 minutes were the most emotional. Surely an antiwar movie .,9
17 September 2000,An intelligent piece of work,"To say that this movie is ""great"" or ""horrible"" does not begin to define the purest form of emotion that can be drawn from a movie. ""Schindler's List"" is the closest thing to poetry that I have ever seen on film. I have always believed that Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes were both shafted in the Oscar category, but Oscars are only one year victories. This movie lives on as a testament to the most important event that has occurred during the course of the last century. If I analyzed how to write, direct, film, or orchestrate a film of this kind of magnitude, then I would know how to make classics, which ""Schindler's List"" is. Steven Spielberg is an artist...both in entertainment and in realism. This is a film which I have not seen for many years and decided to see again to see if it had the same impact that it had when I was younger. Now 21, I truly understand the message he was attempting to get across. It was that one man can understand the value of life through the violence and pain that surrounded him as he attempted to profit from it. Seeing it again also re-established my acknowledgement that this is one of my most favorite films of all time. A true 10 on my scale.

29 September 1999,A comment,"The film was great. In fact I saw it on video 3 times before I saw it on cinema. The best scene was when the train with the women came to Austwitz instead of Schindler's new factory. The starving prisoners and the snow made a great impression on me, and i must mention the black smoke that came out of the crematory. A great movie, didn't made me cry, maybe because of the documentary-filming...

3 December 2002,The horrors of war.,"On my list, this is one of the greatest movie that depicts the horrors of war. Its black and white cinematography used in the film reminds me the images of the dark ages. And everyone who watched this film would somehow realized that life is much more precious than wealth. And one man named Schindler used his wealth and influence to save the Jews. Schindler's List is more than a movie than I've expected. It depicts the realities of war, and most of all, showing that 'Life Is Precious'.

24 September 2002,An unforgettable tale of hope and justice brought into the light by one man.,"In the peak of the Second World War, one non-Jewish man strives for justice for the Jewish people who are being inhumanly slaughtered. Oskar Schindler produces a list on a 1000+ names of Jewish beings whom he would like to work in his factory. The list is genius and saves many people from the realms of the Nazi reign. The film has superb cinematography, directing, music, editing and more. But most of all the performances are astounding. Liam Neeson as Schindler is absolutely astounding and as is Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern. Their performances are by far, perfect. Embeth Davidtz is amazing as Helen Hirsch. She gives the viewer a million reasons to shed tears. However I was most taken up by the performance of Ralph Fiennes who portrays the chilling Nazi officer Amon Goeth. Fiennes gives a sense of fear and yet he is appealing. Never before have a cast been so perfect. This film is definitely the greatest film of all time. Thank you Mr Speilberg for producing such a real and beautiful film!

26 September 2016,Schindler's List,"Schindler's List is a 1993 American epic historical period drama film, directed and co-produced by Steven Spielberg and scripted by Steven Zaillian. It is based on the novel Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally, an Australian novelist. The film is based on the life of Oskar Schindler, an ethnic German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Schutzstaffel (SS) officer Amon G√∂th, and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern.

Ideas for a film about the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the Schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission to tell the story of Schindler. Spielberg became interested in the story when executive Sid Sheinberg sent him a book review of Schindler's Ark. Universal Studios bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself.

Principal photography took place in Krak√≥w, Poland, over the course of 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot the film in black and white and approached it as a documentary. Cinematographer Janusz Kami≈Ñski wanted to give the film a sense of timelessness. John Williams composed the score, and violinist Itzhak Perlman performs the film's main theme.

Schindler's List premiered on November 30, 1993, in Washington, D.C. and it was released on December 15, 1993, in the United States. Often listed among the greatest films ever made,[4][5][6] it was also a box office success, earning $321.2 million worldwide on a $22 million budget. It was the recipient of seven Academy Awards (out of twelve nominations), including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score, as well as numerous other awards (including seven BAFTAs and three Golden Globes). In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked the film 8th on its list of the 100 best American films of all time. The Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2004.",10
31 January 1999,A Monument For LOVE,"This movie is not entertainment, but terrible history that sadly goes on today. Not like in the movie, but in smaller groups around the whole world.

This movie contains more true love and hate than any movie, it has happen. Some people deny this, well, to deny is to commit suicide. They killed people like you and me. People with a reason to live. Oscar Schindler had a lot of feelings inside, thats why his breakdown at the end when he leaves. He showed feelings that he was not used to show. The meanings are severals, but always remember this: Nobody can save everybody, but everybody can save one... If you want to see this film, pick a day when your feelings are strong. It is important to let everybody understand history, and to really start to love each other. Must this movie stand as a monument for LOVE..

From Ingar Einar to the whole world and Steven

24 May 2016,One of the best Holocaust movies,"Schindler's list takes a look into one of the most compelling visual pieces of the Holocaust. The black and white movie will take you into a journey of what it was like for Schindler and his thought on hiding Jews during the 1940s. You will love the ending and will feel the horrors experienced by the Jewish people during this time. There is a small splash of color in this movie which is figurative once you see it. This film will take you through a range of emotions and will impact your take on what people had to do to survive. The movie is a must see for all adults and is a completely true story. It is perhaps one of my favorite films.

30 September 2013,Review Of Schindlers List,"One of the best movies i have ever seen. Its depiction of the German war was absolutely brilliant, very detailed and well directed. A powerful and inspirational movie that shows the struggles of the Jews and the Atrocity of the Germans. Followed up by brilliant performances from Liam Neeson, Depicting the role of Oscar Schindler brilliantly, his acting was flawless and without a doubt the best i have seen. Also as brilliant as ever Ben Kingsley played Itzhak Stern and completely mastered the character. Ralph Fiennes also brilliantly characterized the role of Amon Goeth and nailed it. Overall the movie was a excellent example a masterpiece and to have a Director like Steven Spielberg, with his enormous experience and brilliant directing took the movie to the next level.

25 March 2023,Schindler's List: An Unflinching and Powerful Portrait of the Holocaust,"Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List is a cinematic masterpiece that tells the story of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved the lives of over a thousand Jewish refugees during the Holocaust. The film is a haunting and unflinching portrayal of the atrocities committed during one of the darkest periods in human history.

Liam Neeson gives a career-defining performance as Schindler, imbuing the character with a mix of charm, compassion, and complexity. The supporting cast is also outstanding, with Ben Kingsley delivering a poignant turn as Schindler's Jewish accountant, and Ralph Fiennes delivering a chilling performance as Amon Goeth, the ruthless Nazi officer in charge of the concentration camp.

Spielberg's direction is masterful, with his use of black and white cinematography adding to the film's stark and harrowing tone. The film is not an easy watch, but it is an important one. Schindler's List is a reminder of the horrors of the Holocaust and a testament to the resilience and strength of the human spirit.

The film's impact on popular culture cannot be overstated, with its message of compassion and hope resonating with audiences around the world. Schindler's List is not just a great film, it is an important one, and it will continue to be regarded as a masterpiece of cinema for years to come.",10
19 April 2004,Brilliant!,"""Schindler's List"" is a movie so epic and far reaching in its impact that one stops watching it and says, ""...so that's why film was invented."" Steven Spielberg takes us back to the haunting horror of war-torn Poland and its condemned Jewry during WWII in a film so impeccably well filmed and performed there need not be any kind of ""suspension of disbelief"" on the part of the viewer. Liam Neeson delivers the performance of his life starring as Oskar Schindler, a true person who takes pity on the imprisoned Jews and helps over 1,100 to safety. He does this against the will of supervillain Amon Goeth, masterfully played by Ralph Fiennes in what in my opinion is the finest theatrical presentation ever captured on film. The film is primarily historical but beautifully touches at the theme of the survival and triumph of the human spirit. Truly, the only disappointment about ""Schindler's List"" is that not enough films such as this grace our lives. END

31 December 2005,Shindler's List Still Quite The Film!!,"There has been so much written about this film but I wanted to touch on areas that I found quite impressive and I might have some minor reservations. Ray Fiennes playing the Nazi Amon Goeth was astounding. Yes, he was sadistic but that is only part of it. The scenes he had where you saw into his eyes and there was nothing there. I have know idea how Fiennes pulled that off but it was dead on and I suspect it was probably closer to reality than any other actor to play a Nazi. Usually, actors who are not the nationality of the characters they play sometimes are betrayed by their own appearances if only slightly. That was not the case here. Both Fiennes and Neeson are Irish, but I was thoroughly convinced of the characters they played. This Schindler really looked Czech. Goeth really looked German right down to the eyes and that is why Fiennes should have won an Academy award for his performance. It was so stunningly convincing. I will agree with most of the comments on this film about the excellence that went into producing it. I do however, have one regret that the film does only covers the suffering of the Jews. This is not the fault of the film but a general regret that although 6 million Jews suffered in the war, 3 million Poles and million upon millions of Russians also lost their lives in the war. There are so many stories of tragedy and heroism out there. Let Schindler's List not only stand for the Jewish plight but for all who lost their lives at the hands of the Axis powers.",9
19 January 2022,Wonderful,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",10

12 December 2015,A Timeless Snapshot,"I finally had a chance today to watch this movie in full, and literally my only complaint about it is that I had to remove the double-sided DVD partway through the film in order to flip it over and watch the rest of it.

Looking back on it, it is hard to believe that Spielberg made this movie in the same year as Jurassic Park (1993); both movies are great in very different ways.

With Schindler's List, I feel that every technique used within is used deliberately and with purpose. The film is in black-and-white because that is actually how Spielberg envisioned the Holocaust from the documentaries he had seen; we see the coat on the little girl in red in color in order to indicate that Oskar Schindler is focused on her; and so on.

It is wholly evident that Spielberg wanted to make this movie the best movie possible so that, in turn, it becomes a timeless document depicting but one story of the Holocaust. And indeed, while we still enjoy the fun adventures in Jurassic Park, E.T. and the like, it is Schindler's List that will be remembered, years from now, as one of the greatest films of his entire career, if not the greatest.",9
18 September 2015,Good tragic story,"this one of the most tragic stories; it is worth watching and one of the best movies from the last 25 years, warning its emotional, filled with historical knowledge, this movie is truly a one of a kind, a Masterpiece, simply Brilliant! Easily a Classic! Actors should be proud. Deserving of its audience, response and awards as its ability to reach our emotions is unbelievable, I am glad to have the privilege to be able to watch it. I recommend this to everyone, but will only appeal to an audience of older age. Quality of picture is great. A movie not for the emotionally weak, a Spielberg great like E.T.....................

20 December 2004,A heart warming tale of mass murder and genocide,"""Gawd bless you mister Schindler"", is one of the few phrases not to appear in Schindler's list, which is useful in that it enables us to distinguish it from a Frank Capra film. Well, to be fair, the phrase ""Shoot her now, on my authority"" isn't in It's a Wonderful Life either.

Schindler's List - the story of a war profiteer who saves the lives of over a thousand Jews from Krakow Ghetto during WWII - is one of the Sacred Cows of modern cinema. This is partly because of its subject matter, the excellent performances of the three lead actors, and the epic length and flashy direction of Stephen - ooh what a long film I'm making (it's in black and white y'know) - Spielberg.

Schindler's List is a good film, and there are some performances of real note. Kingsley reprises his role as Gandhi and Fiennes and Neeson look fab in black and white. There is also nice mutual tension and understanding between Schindler and Goeth, which makes their scenes together really watchable.

Having said all that, the film can be really infuriating.

Why, for instance, does Spielberg try to blur the film/history distinction by shooting it in black and white and having real holocaust survivors turn up at the end? Does the film really need this kind of ""legitimacy"" for audiences to take it seriously?

And where are the Jewish characters? I can almost hear Spielberg with his screenwriters... ""Woody, hi, I'd like you to do Schindler and Goeth"". ""Ah, but, you know, like, that sounds great! But what about the Jews huh - I think I could do really good job with some of the Jewish Characters"" Woody Allen replies. ""Yeah, hear what you say Woody, but I've promised that to my old buddy George Lucas - he's getting in some practice for a project he's working on called the Yellow Peril, or the Phantom Menace or something"". One review of Schindler's List describes Stern as ""Schindler's conscience"" and that's just about it. Spielberg has outsourced his casting for Jewish characters to Jimny Cricket, which is a real shame because, apart from anything else, it denies them their humanity.

In fact, you don't have to be a particularly attentive viewer to see Spielberg's less-than-light touch all over this film. You get the sophisticated monster clich√©, with the Stormtrooper playing Mozart (suspiciously well) on an old upright piano during the liquidation of the Krakow Ghetto. You get the violent guard cooing over a Jewish baby ""Ein kind, ein kind!"" You get the Goeth proving how evil he is by hitting his maid. And, of course, you get that ridiculously over-sentimental ending where Schindler makes his final transition to Avatar of the Almighty.

Then there's the death. Young girls and boys are killed, women are killed, old folk kick it - I wouldn't be surprised if the tragic death of a young girl's fluffy rabbit only just made the cutting room floor. But, you know, I struggle to remember any adult Jewish man between 18 and 60 killed on camera. Did these deaths not count? David Irving would be delighted.

However the holocaust has been used subsequently, it remains one of the most significant and tragic events in European history. It deserved a great film treatment and it nearly got it. Tragically, though he got great performances from his cast and had one of the best stories going, Spielberg was unable to forget he was the same director that brought us ET and Close Encounters. Surely the point about Schindler's story is that, however bad a person is, and however black the times are, everyone has a responsibility to do good when the world is going bad. The danger of this film is that the MTV generation might regard it as a clarion call for inaction ¬ñ there'll always be a saint like Oscar Schindler along to do the good work for you. 7/10.",7
25 October 2016,one of the greatest movie,"This is the best war film about the Holocaust I have ever seen. It depicts the horrors of the Holocaust and war, the tragedy of Jewish nation, and I know, this film could be directed by a Jew, who keeps these horrible times and crimes against humanity in his heart. The tag line says ""Whoever saves one life, saves the entire world"". And this film shows us that no human life can be replaced by another one, and that there is nothing more valuable than HUMAN LIFE. I have not seen a film of such a power in my life. Superbly directed by Steven Spielberg, magnificently photographed in black-and-white by Janusz Kaminski (one of the best directors of photography in modern Hollywood, so to say), perfect performances by Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley, and, especially, John Williams' beautiful, brilliant score, brings the whole horror and tragedy, cruelty of Nazism, Holocaust and War. This is Spielberg's Triumph. Congratulations!

14 January 2022,"Epic, Masterful Film-making","This is a really tough watch, the subject matter is heartbreaking and makes you wonder how man can be so cruel to man. The story is so well-told and cinematography so brilliant that you are gripped all the way through for over 3 hours. I don't think I could watch this film again, it's too emotionally draining. But I think everyone needs to watch it once. I hope humanity learns from the past and that we never witness such evils ever again.

1 January 2014,Schindler's List,"Oskar Schindler is a business man who decides to take advantage of the war to make money... He starts out making pots and pans eventually growing fond of the Jews he has working for him.... As the war goes on he goes from making pots and pans to ammunition.... He is well liked by the Nazis and the Jews who work for him... He eventually becomes known to the Jewish community as the Saviour of the Jews because of the list his clerk makes.... He does become a rich man until the end of the movie, where he ends up broke because he spent all his money to get more and more Jews on the list of people who work for him... It's a wonderful movie that tells a story about the Holocaust and I recommend watching it....

3 November 2016,best film,"The film focuses on how a German named Oskar Schindler saved the lives of thousands of Jews by employing them to work in his factory during WWII. However, I feel the film's primary aim is not to show us Schindler's kindness but the horrors of war. There are some of the most true and graphic scenes here ever captured on celluloid. People being shot for no particular reason, hiding in fear, stripped and gas ed, abused......so much so that viewers watching it for the 1st time will be deeply affected. We have never got to see this ""flip side"" of the war in many Hollywood productions which only focuses on action and their unrealistic ""gung-ho"" heroes. ( Another excellent film would be ""Saving Pte Ryan"" by Spielberg again ) War and its horrors are finally and faithfully recreated for the audience.

Like the film Raging Bull, its shot beautifully in black and white to reflect the era and tone of the film. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are excellent, esp the latter for his frightening portrayal of Amon Goethe. The scene where they discuss about power is a classic and the subsequent one where Amon 'pardons' a young Jew remains as one of my many fa-vs!",10
9 May 2022,Best Movie Ever,"This is the best movie I have ever watched, even better than either Godfather. Liam Neeson is great, Ralph Feiness is great, and Ben Kingsley is great among the many great performances. It is sad because of the subject matter but does not dwell on the mass murder aspect of the camps. You just couldn't write a better movie than this.

1 May 1999,Do not wait to see this film.,"I waited six years before seeing this film for personal reasons. I finally watched it today, and I can only hope that no one else ever waits to see this.

'Schindler's List' is film-making at it's finest. Take a story like this, and a director like Spielberg, throw in incredible performances by Neeson, Kingsley, and especially Fiennes, and you have one to the best motion pictures ever made.

It is phenomenal. Thank you Spielberg.

9 October 2017,well done,"One of the on living legendary pieces made ever, you could easily cry, it is one of the movies I discovered way later only realizing that not every one of the people working with the Germans was bad, there were a few good ones.

Also the dominant use of hard light in the film gave it the old 40's mood and vibe that made us feel as part of the people in that time.

It is also interesting how the director chose to high light the girl in red a color that stood out in black and really made it very powerful.

It was interesting to discover how good of an actor liam Neeson is given that time, because to be honest most people knew him from the film ""Taken"" at least for average movie watchers.

25 June 2023,"It's hard, but you must get through it.","Schindler's List (1993) -

It is hard to keep putting myself through this film, because while it was incredibly well made, acted and the story came from a superbly put together book depicting real accounts of the atrocities faced by the Jewish people during the Second World War, it really was horrifying and nauseating to bear witness to.

I first watched this film when it was released on DVD and would openly admit that it got to me even then during my teenage years, but I think that as an adult it had an even more harrowing impact on my empathies and sympathies.

I recently made my way through the novelisation that this production was based on, although there were times that it was nearly hidden in the freezer, especially towards the end, because it was so terrifying and upsetting.

As such I decided that I needed to see the film again, but I put it off for as long as I could.

I can honestly say that, in my opinion, Mr Spielberg did incredible justice to the various collection of experiences collated by Thomas Keneally's book and I believe that both writer and director honoured, respected and delivered a sympathetic and caring, well thought out piece of art and literature in memory of those that were and weren't able to get on to 'Schindler's List'.

There was a little girl shown throughout the film that wears a red coat and everyone who reviews this film will probably mention her, but her few scenes, shown with a haunting tune was a stroke of directorial genius and not just something that Steve came up with on his own, because she was actually mentioned in the book, so she was really there and she really went through such horrible things. Making her the only colour in the entire film was clever though.

In some ways the story reminded me of another one about Starfish, which I think might be from the Bible. In that tale a man was standing on the beach throwing starfish back in to the sea so they would not dry up and die as the tide went out. Another man sees him and tells him that he can't possibly make a difference, because there were too many to try and rescue, but the first man throws another starfish back in and says ""I made a difference to that one"". And although I have really paraphrased that, it would be a good philosophy to live by.

It didn't appear that Mr Schindler (Liam Neeson) was a saint by any means and in fact Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) was shown to be the one who really took care of who got a job at Oskar's factory, but he knew what was happening and certainly towards the end he did all he could to make a difference to as many as he could.

I was glad that they showed that he wasn't entirely selfless, because it gave a balance to his character/representation. He liked women, booze and the good life and who could blame him for that and for trying to keep himself safe too, but the man really should be recognised as one of the biggest heroes of WWII, especially as he didn't have to shed any blood with guns and bombs to achieve his prison breakouts.

In that leading and titular role I felt that Liam Neeson was robbed not to receive an Oscar, although the rest of the film rightly won 7 of the little gold fellas in total.

I don't think that I will ever see another more important and well made film like this in my lifetime and it was definitely Liam's greatest role by far.

I also liked the fact that it was generally cast appropriately with German actors and that those who were not German did at least speak with an accent, even Liam who has struggled to not just be Irish in many films.

And the black and white filming added to the effect that it was based in historically fact and it also hid a lot of the dirt and the blood quite cleverly. It may have been too awful to even contemplate otherwise.

There were times when it appeared as if they were utilising real footage too, the type I might find in a documentary, although I could see that it was the actors recognisable from previous scenes, but that made it easy to connect with the families and to believe the reality, carefully depicted by a fantastic cast of actors, who must surely have needed a lot of therapy after making this film.

I heard that throughout the production of this film Robin Williams used to phone Steven Spielberg to tell him jokes, because he knew the toll that it was having on the Director's mental health.

It did lull me in with a relatively easy start, but at least on this viewing I had the foreknowledge of what was to come.

With that said the ending was still way too much for me to take as I watched with tears streaming down my face.

It should be shown in all schools to show how evil the world can be and just because it had such an important message all round.

I thought that because I had recently read the book it made it even harder, because I knew the accounts that married so perfectly with what was produced here.

It was a truly horrifying to watch and even more horrific to know that it was true. An absolutely heart wrenching experience that I don't think m I could take seeing again, because it made me physically nauseous and even writing this review has churned my stomach.

This is my warning that it will always be a very tough film to get through, but everyone should do just that. It was quite possibly one of, if not THE best film ever made. My score might not reflect that, because it didn't have thar re-watchable factor to it, but I dare any Director or producer to come up with something even half as impactful and valuable.

23 June 2006,Truly thought provoking,"When I was done with seeing this movie I realized that I had stayed glued to the screen for 3 hours without my attention getting diverted.The acting especially from Liam Neeson as Oskar and Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goethe is a notch above anything I have seen.

When one realizes that Oskar Schindler,a man who initially started out with the intention of making a quick buck out of the war situation and who after having failed in earlier businesses must obviously be determined to do well this time around, gives up all his money,his fortune and his shot at a good life in order to save the lives of people who were being cruelly butchered,one is moved,deeply moved.

The scenes of the massacre of the ghetto and the way the people trying to hide were systematically hunted down are disturbing scenes..yet they serve to elevate the viewing experience and also are stark brutal reminders of the depravity humans are capable of.

With the rising intolerance the world over this movie acts as a reminder,a warning and also a beacon of hope.it is both a testimonial to what one man's conviction is capable of...on the one hand we have Schindler who almost singlehandedly saves 1200 Jews and on the other we have Hitler who is responsible for the near extermination of Jews.",10

12 August 2006,Spielberg's greatest film,"When I recommend this movie to friends who haven't seen it, I always get the same answer...""Yeah, I've heard it's excellent, but it's got to be depressing."" I teach high school honors history and every spring I show my seniors this movie as part of a World War II unit. Ten graduating classes have experienced it. Spielberg has never been better. His one-two punch with this film and 1998's Saving Private Ryan should be required viewing. I was vindicated this summer when the American Film Institute ranked Schindler's List #3 in its latest Top 100 film series, Most Inspiring Films. Over the years my students have agreed with me...this film about mankind's darkest hour and the horrors of the Holocaust ends on a most beautiful and hopeful note. Spielberg's use of color in a black and white film, though simply done, is the most powerful thing I have ever seen in film-making.

15 October 2002,Haunting,"Before Private Ryan Speilberg proved just how much of an artist he is. Taking this project to levels no one else could have ever dreamed of. So many haunting images in this film, the one that still gets me is of the ghetto cleansing where you see the little girl, running and the only color on the screen is her red jacket. Later as the camera pans by the piles of bodies to be burned, off in the corner but still very frightening is the same red jacket. I shivered in the theatre, and every time I see this it still shocks me. Beautiful film, haunting image. Thank you Mr. Spielberg.

This movie is a clear view to the inhumanity of the ""Third Empire"". The colors black and white stay for the death in the Nazi regime. The color red for example is exclusive for life in form of the red dress of the little girl. The atmosphere mirrors the darkest time in German history. The cinema was full of depressing silence after that movie. This is the best a movie maker can earn.

Why didnt he continue the legacy he left after this movie. So sad. Totally recommended, but because its a movie that will put you in thoughts, i would recommend you to see this alone. We, and all the next generations should see this movie and maybe even show this in schools as education.

This film is very possibly Spielberg's opus. That is saying quite a bit.

Screenplay, direction and performances are at their best. Story and the message it delivers to world makes this movie a Must watch. I mean a compulsory watch.

Steven Spielberg has proved from this movie that he has the greatest cinematic mind. Disguised awakening in Oskar Schindler's character could have been the most difficult part to picturize in this movie. Hats off to Mr. Spielberg.

23 July 2003,The most affecting movie I've ever seen.,"Everyone knows the story of The Holocaust. Very few, including myself, had such intimate, detailed imagery to deal with. From Issac Stern's masterful rendering of John Williams' opening until the very end I was unable to tear my eyes from the screen, much as I wanted to. This film demands, in the name of those living and dead, that you watch, that you have this monstrous example of human depravity burned into your very soul. This film also does something wonderful; it gives hope. Amidst the human wasteland we find a small, inextinguishable flame of decency and justice survive that evil wind's every attempt to snuff it out. I came away from this film exhausted and bewildered. Every emotion I possess, vying for dominance, assailed me in a blinding white noise. Should I rage at the evil, the stupidity, the casual indifference? Should I weep for the suffering and loss? Should I rejoice that, ultimately, a choice for right and good was made? Eventually, I recognized that of course I must do all these things and more. I must insist that every one I meet see this film that reminds us of our obligation to history and to each other. I must speak out when I see injustice being committed. And I must never, never forget.

Liam Neeson (as Schindler) is phenomenal, except for one minor, over-dramatic scene, Ben Kingsley is (as usual) fantastic, and Ralph Fiennes does a frighteningly good job of being evil. The movie is beautifully filmed in black and white in order to be consistent with the time period, but there are a few artistic splashes of color for meaningful, symbolic ideas and images. I you haven't seen this amazing movie, bring some tissues and be prepared for great acting and disturbing images and scenes. It is very moving and very powerful.

17 February 2008,The best and most important movie ever made,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed.

The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",10

31 December 2007,Much Beyond EXCELLENT!!!!!,"I saw this movie last month and was extremely disappointed and at the same time really happy. Disappointed at the fact that I took so long to watch this movie and happy that I didn't miss it out!!!!

Definitely the BEST movie I've ever seen. The direction, cinematography, acting...in fact everything was really good. But at times I felt some scenes were too long, especially the torturing scenes. But then I realized that maybe these scenes really gave the over all impact to the movie. This movie is shown at the backdrop of one of the most darkest period of human history (World War II).... Its shown in black and white due to that very reason!!!!! This is the shocking true story of Oskar Schindler, who never lost his sight when everyone from his own land were blind, who never lost humanity when he was surrounded by animals!!!

Never before have I got so involved with a character in a movie that I felt each and everything that went through Schindler's mind. Who do I have to praise that for, the style of direction or the well written script???? In the climax part when Schindler breaks down to tears I was shocked to find myself break down to tears for the first time after seeing a Movie!!!! Thats the power of this film!!!!!

If there is anyone else out there who hasn't seen this movie yet then PLZ....Please....Don't waste your time reading this or any review, instead rush and watch this movie as soon as possible!!!! In fact this has to be watched by everyone at least once in their lifetime, not for the purpose of entertainment but for a wonderful LESSON!!!!!",10
17 March 1999,"If you have one, this film will break your heart.","One can hear it, and still not get it; read it, and still not get it; see the photos, and still not get; see the film, and I'm afraid, still not get it. But if the raw emotion that came out of me upon viewing Schindler's list was ""not getting it"" then it's as far as I'm willing to go to understand the horror of this era. If war is hell, then the events portrayed here represent that place where even satan is unwilling to set foot. It is hatred left unchecked, or even cultivated into a fine tuned machine that reduces the objects of hatred into nothing more than insects.

3 June 2006,A brilliant film. A strong tale against dictatorship and war.,"What can I say about this movie that haven't been told....

Its an incredible strong movie, that tells a strong tale of war, human nature, incredible cruelty and bravery.

Its a movie against all the evils of war, and the depths man will sink down to.

It most likely have some historical flaws, and maybe something has been forgotten, or ""hollywoodized"", but its still such a strong tale that these flaws can be forgiven without any troubles.

Today its a movie everyone should see, maybe more than ever. This movie, along with a couple of other should be mandatory in our schools, just so that our kids, and the future generations never forget the atrocities that was done to the Jews, gay people, Gypsies, blacks etc during that war.

13 June 2015,"Every actor was awesome, also helped along with the real survivors of Schilder's List on-set helping the movie become as real as possible.","This movie is real! The holocaust did happen! Watching it in a theatre for the for first time, the audience was completely silent as the credits rolled at the end with only a few leaving. When I composed myself enough to get to the car, I burst out crying. My grandfather escaped the Warsaw ghetto (he died shortly after I was born). My father who was older than my mother, grew up, in part, in a Japanese prison camp and was stamped (he went away when I was 10). So while you'd think I'd know more about my heritage and all my family killed in Poland by the Germans, I do not. I only heard bits and pieces. So when I saw it come together in a way that only Stephen Spielberg can do, it hit me--hard. My family endured this and only a few survived. I believe regardless of heritage, that everyone should see this film to know what could happen in the future-again. The fact is, it is happening today in North Korea where daily acts of unspeakable cruelty happen. It's a must see film for the acting, the authenticity and the truth. NEVER FORGET!",10
26 May 2017,Schindler's List is epic film for humanity.,"Schindler's List is one of the finest movie I have seen ever. Story sits in inner of heart. When ever i see this film, I get lot of positive energy. I get fighting spirit, way to go forward and energy to stand up. Grandness of this film gives a lot to learn for a film maker. Minute detailing and it's execution is nice which attracts us to watch again and again. The concept and treatment of the film is amazing.Film creates impact and convey the importance of humanity. Every man is good or bad. Situation explores different shades of life.

It's beyond words. It Stirs your inner self to the point where you question the cost of humanity.. so well written & craftily directed, brilliantly acted and have moments which time & again question the collective conscience of a society, humanity & challenge the very idea of what it takes to be just human.......

9 January 1999,Wow,"This movie was extremely touching. The only thing I didn't like was the sexual content--one scene. I don't think that it was necessary to include in the movie. I still give it a 10. It showed a lot of what happened in death camps and the horror Jewish people faced that I only read about. It brought it all to reality.

26 November 2020,Great,"There's not much to say about this one other than its pretty great. Many shots are framed so beautifully, they look like a painting you could hang on your wall. The 3 hours fly by, and the Spielberg camp isn't too distracting.

This is my second viewing; on my first watch, I thought the ending was kind of cheesy, reminding me of Hacksaw Ridge, and the use of color and black and white was a bit on the nose. On my last watch though, it really affected me emotionally.

There is one issue I had with the scene where the workers are forced to run in a circle naked, but I can't talk about it since my old review was automatically deleted, I think because certain words got flagged.

The lines are wonderfully written, the movements are amazing, and the story adaptation is great. This was such a sad movie, but at the same time it was so much fun to watch. I have seen Harry Potter 4 and I could not believe that Ralph was the same man! And all the actors seemed to understand the challenge of playing their given roles. I LOVE this movie, and anyone who hasn't seen it , should ASAP!

It is a film that will withstand the rigors of time itself. Everyone should be shown this film regardless of their stance on the subject matter. This should be a required part of the school curriculum, and should be considered in the same vein as the works of William Shakespeare. This is a film that I have seen alter the life of not only myself, but everyone that has seen it. Bravo to the cast and crew! Be assured that this movie will lend you immortality.

7 December 2006,the movie was awesome,"this movie, while extremely upsetting at times, was outstanding. this was a compelling, heart wrenching drama that tugs on everyone's heartstrings. not only do i suggest watching this movie but i suggest that everyone who watches this should watch this multiple times to make sure that you do not miss a thing. From start to finish this movie is moving, and while at times may be rather disgusting, it is a must see. Though the movie is a must see for everyone it is not appropriate for young children. If you have read this review and have still not decided to watch this movie i strongly suggest that you reconsider your decision and rent or bye a copy of this movie immediately. This is a definite must see and anyone who has not or does not plan to see this movie is out of their minds. i promise you that if you do watch this movie you will not regret your decision.

16 July 2006,"Oskar Schindler uses Jews to start a factory in Poland during the war. He witnesses the horrors endured by the Jews, and starts to save them.","Great movie that really touches one's hart. If you're not moved by this film, you are most likely made out of rock. (Please note the jokingly tone in that sentence:) It's not the script or the theme that carries this movie forward, it's the brilliant performance of the actors/actresses and the unique atmosphere in the black and white world on the screen that rips your heart out and steps on it. The glances, the body language, the tension between the actors... I can't point out exactly what it is with these things that give the movie such credibility, I can only say that it -d-o-e-s. A black and white movie about the Nazi-regime might sound boring, or a bit over the top in being serious and dealing with an important issue, but in this case the director did a great job. It's not boring. It doesn't seem like a documentary, like many films about these events does. Still, knowing that the plot is based on a real story really makes you feel like this film is reality. And that, ladies and gents, is definitely a good thing. Ten out of ten stars from me.

25 June 2010,I Could've done more,"Paraphrasing ""I could've done more"" has to be one of the most heartbreaking lines of dialogue in not only this movie, but any movie. It sums up the world's feelings and regrets for not having done more. It is a regret that we will always live with, voiced very eloquently by Neeson.

By far Spielberg's most powerful film and shows truly what a master of his craft he truly is. The black and white felt like all that old concentration camp footage we have seen over the years giving it that realism that made it even more uncomfortable too watch.

Fiennes performance was dynamic from monster to person to monster. it makes us wonder how people can become this way. Are they truly evil or not even realize that they are evil. Or is that this biggest form of absolute evil?

The film's running length seems to breeze by, although every moment feels completely heavy. I cannot think of another film that has ever had such an effect.

this is something that should be shown in every school as a mandatory requirement.

May we never forget.",
16 March 1999,Genius,"This film is Spielberg's true masterpiece. It depicts something that is so hard to describe, a story so hard to tell in true honesty. But it was. True brutal honesty. I can definitely see why this film won Best Picture.

Besides the fact that this was probably the ONLY film I have seen that has brought me close to tears, it has other characteristics that also make this such a technical work of art. The black & white tone of the film was not only there to make it seem like a dark and dreary film, but to make other, more important aspects, stand out. In one scene you see a girl running into a building; the girl is wearing a red coat. It stands out among all the shades of gray to symbolize something important: the death and suffering of the holocaust. In another scene, dead bodies are pulled away as Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) watches. The corpses' blood is pure red, to show the major amount and therefore pointlessness of their bloodshed. In one of the last scenes in the film, Jews light a bright orange flame which is ignited on the candle.

Now, I'm not saying that this is the most spectacular piece of work ever accomplished (after all it was pretty slow and almost 3 1/2 hours long), but it is something. This is a film that can never, ever be forgotten. Well done, Spielberg.

10 / 10 stars.",10
3 September 2006,"Excellent, the best film ever","This film was truly moving.I recommend this film to anybody who enjoys a great war film. Set in World War Two, this movie is an exceptional display of the true nature of war. Although there are gory bits it is a very true account. Another good thing about this film is that it is a true story based on a real person Oskar Schindler who i believe was a war-time hero. To be able to rebel against such a man as Adolf Hitler would take a lot of strength. The scenery in the movie is very fitting to the story and is a large part of the movie. Anyone who doesn't have a weak stomach should see this film. It has a great storyline which will captivate you until the very end. Without giving anything away, this was an excellent film, one of the best ever made! Therefore, I give it a rating of 10/10 :)

21 January 2001,Horrifying realistic,"I saw this film at school as part of my history GCSE. Our class sat down to watch and were all rowdy and chatty as usual. After ten or so minutes the room was silent. I remember when the film finished you could hear a pin drop. The reason for this was that Spielberg left nothing to the imagination, he showed every detail such as the one-armed man being shot while clearing the snow, the girl in the red coat on the pile of burning bodies, I could go on. I think that the most moving part was at the end of the film when the actor and the actual person put a stone on Schlinders grave, at that point, I could see that some people in the room were close to tears. Throughly deserved 'Best Film' at the Oscars and Neeson I don't think I've ever seen in a better role.8/10

14 August 2001,Spielberg's masterpiece,"This is without a doubt at the top of my list of the best movies. If you don't like this moving film, then feel for a pulse.

It tells the story of Oskar Schindler and his factory of Jewish slaves forced to work. The factory eventually becomes a haven for the Jews, and Schindler becomes a willing partner in saving ""his"" Jews.

A note about the use of black and white. This is a master-stroke by Spielberg. The impact is extreme especially when the few touches of color are added for effect.

Another note about the director. In SO many of Spielberg's movies, he is right up front with his direction. When you see one of his movies, you KNOW it. If I did not know Spielberg had directed it, I would have been surprised to find out. He steps back from the material and lets the story tell itself.

EVERYBODY should see this movie at least once. Spielberg will NEVER do anything as good.",10
23 July 2008,Pure Gold,"I'm a man of few words and rarely comment on movies or leave reviews, however, after seeing this film, I had no choice but to. This film, although quite long, will keep you glued from start to finish. Steven Spielberg's directing efforts are remarkable and will have you in an array of emotions in showing the horror's of the Holocaust. The acting, music and costumes from all involved are second to none, and go hand in hand with the spectacular settings.

Don't miss this epic. Do yourself a favour and hire, buy or steal to see this one, you will not be disappointed.

14 June 1999,One of the greatest films yet made.,"The mark of a truly great movie is defined by its cinematography, script, characterization, acting, and directing. Schindler's List soars in these categories. A film of this stature leaves an indelible mark in our minds and souls. The haunting images of man's inhumanity to man juxtaposed with the essential goodness of man linger long after the last reel ends. Each frame exquisitely tells a ""thousand stories"" with their great attention to detail, clarity, composition, and camera angle. Coupled with John Williams amazingly poignant musical score, each and every scene infuses itself into our consciousness. In addition to the incredible cinematography, music, and story, the acting was clearly driven by a deep and heartfelt conviction of character by all of the actors. Especially notable performances were delivered by Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes. In the modern age of special effects and high action films, this film renews the truly great creative potential of some of our filmakers. Mr. Spielberg took a bold step when he decided to finally make Schindler's List. Shooting the film in Black and White further emphasizes the boldness and greatness of this film. Like its great B and W predecessors ""Citizen Kane"" and ""On the Waterfront"", Schindler's List clearly takes its rightful place as one of the greatest films yet made.",10
6 July 1999,The best movie ever made!,"This is, by far, the greatest movie ever made. The emotion conveyed in every scene is so palpable, it's difficult to watch in one sitting. The acting is incredible- Ralph Fiennes delivers one of the single greatest performances in acting history, while Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley deliver their own unparalleled excellence. Steven Spielberg's directing for this movie is unprecedented- the use of black and white (with only two elements of the film appearing in color) delivers the message even more clearly than color would have. The script is sensational- I cannot think of any aspect of this film that is not incredible. Nothing compares with the power of Schindler's List.

But as the movie went on I realised that the portrayal of the movie in black and white was the main ingredient to depict the holocaust the way Steven Spielberg did. This movie successfully showed the horrors of holocaust and of course the great humanitarian activities by Oskar Schindler.

18 January 2018,Best movie ever,"Schindler's List is not only a pure masterpiece but, for me, it is one of the greatest films ever made in the world.

The film starts off to reveal a womanizing, Nazi business man who profited off of slave labor. The Nazi business man is of course Oskar Schindler. Oskar is just like most men. He has a love for good wine, beautiful women, and pursues happiness through the success of his business. But on his journey to a successful business, millions of Jews were being killed during a time which most label as one of the darkest periods of human history. As Oskar made money, innocent people were being murdered. That's when the self-centered, often money hungry Oskar steps in and gives up his goal of having a successful business to save the lives of over 1,000 Jews.

This film is about redemption and was beautifully photographed in black and white by Janusz Kaminski (cinematographer). At the helm is no one other than Steven Spielberg, who brilliantly called non-pretentious shots and brought back to life a time and period most want to forget, but shouldn't. This film is a must see by me. I give the film an ""A+"" (wishing I could give it a higher grade than that) and a 10 out of 10...",10
27 August 2003,A sad period in the history of the world where one light shines,"I'm still learning about my Jewish history. And when I saw the movie it touched a spot in my heart that seamed to be surrounded by a wall. Schindler's List is a black and white movie to make you feel that it was a dark time in our world's history. There was only one time color was used and it was used to follow a small girl. I wonder how he really felt after the war and the madness was over and he ran at the end of the movie. I'm looking into the historical fact of the movie as Hollywood tends to stretch the truth at times. One part is true Oscar Schindler was announced a just and righteous man and the tree planted in his name is still growing in Israel.

27 August 2003,Touching,"Never could imagine that a filmtheatre could be so silent. It was an amazing film and it touched every one in the room. The worst part of the movie was for me to see the red jacket in the pile of ashes from the little girl. I have seen the movie 3 times already and still i'm crying.

26 March 2018,An All Time Classic....Spielberg's Schindler's List,"To me, Spielberg's Schindler's List is one of the most incredible movies made to date for several reasons. This classic film is an emotionally charged historical drama; based on true story. It thugs at your heart, it tells the story of the good in all of us, as Oskar Schindler becomes the unlikely hero, saving the lives of over 1000 Jews during the Nazi madness. I have a VHS collector's copy of the film.

31 January 2022,Schindler's List,"1 - An absolute stinker of a film, with no redeeming features. It's unlikely that any film will receive this score.

2 - Oh, not great at all. Amongst the worst films ever made.

3 - I won't be back, and am less than pleased I've just spent time watching this.

4 - Very poor effort. Struggled through.

5 - Mediocre. Nothing special at all, but not completely unbearable.

6 - Tries hard. On its way to worthwhile.

7 - Solid viewing. Can't complain - would recommend.

8 - Cracking. Enjoyed immensely. But it takes a lot to get 9.

23 January 1999,Emotional pornography.,"Spielberg's much hyped film is a dangerous piece of work. It is unforgivably manipulative, using cinematic effects to connote horror and emotional involvement which serve only to distract the viewer from any sort of truth (in particular: the girl in the red coat, trite heart-string pulling). Yes, I know the intentions were good and that something like this should exist to continue the memory of the holocaust, but this is not it. This is emotional pornography, it's worthiness is sickening and it's heavy-handed nature merely bruises the audience into submission. This is how the tragedy of the holocaust will be remembered, a single story (with a seemingly happyish ending) with a hero. It's not totally factually accurate, yet it holds itself up as evidence. It is not. It is a fiction BASED on real events. Spielberg, with his influence, has rewritten history forever, a morally dubious thing to do. The photography is good, there are a couple of good performances (especially Ben Kingsley), the special effects are superb. But this is not a brilliant film, aesthetically or morally. It is disgraceful. If Spielberg was not Jewish himself, there would have been an uproar. It is a dangerous document. And as for playing it in schools (along with Amistad and Saving Private Ryan - both of which are as bad if not worse that SL) as has been suggested above, that I find very disturbing.

This film, preaching on high morals has made a few people a LOT of money. I know it was in black and white and over three hours long (which is uncommercial) but if Spielberg wanted to get closer to 'truth' (b+w IS NOT TRUTH, these things happened in colour! Newsreels are not TRUTH, they only act to remind you of the distance between you and what you are watching) why didn't he use all German and Polish speaking actors with subtitles? Because it wouldn't have made as much money, that's why. I'm sick of all this worthy praise of such an incredibly dodgy film. Watch 'SHOAH' instead and maybe you'll all actually learn something.",
4 December 2021,What an emotional journey,"Spielberg is the only Film maker who can direct two masterpiece in the same year.

The Pain of every character you will feel during War.

Black and white Color was the brilliant decision a film maker can take for the Grey situation of the war.

The music was just melodious and editing was done fantastically.

17 February 2009,a wonderful educational film for kids,"This is a wonderful educational film for kids, I mean the youth between 12-18, to inform them about the horrors of Nazism and the Holocaust, but for adult Viewer who knows a lot about the Fascism and Concentration Camps this film will seem too straightforward and even tasteless. It is not enough to use a serious theme and a black and white film to make a good picture. And I definitely do not understand the viewers who behave as if they haven't seen any of anti-fascist films of much higher quality.

It is true -Mr. Spielberg is a great Master, Master of Manipulation and a great specialist of Exploitation Cinema. This is what exactly he does here - he exploits the Important and Painful topic of Holocaust (or it can be slavery, terrorism, etc) being perfectly aware that many would praise the film not for its artistic merits but for the STORY and the MESSAGE, and if one dares to say that the film is lousy - he/she will be immediately accused of being a revisionist, indifferent to peoples suffering, holocaust denier and almost Neo-Nazi.

Let me put this straight - I am none of these and still I think that Spielberg film is not good. It is not good as a piece of art but it might be good as an awareness raising reel - for those who had no or very little idea about Nazism and holocaust, but for those of us who don't need a gaudy movie from a Hollywood hack to know basics of history - there is nothing of interest here - I can name two or three dozens of feature films of documentaries that dealt with Holocaust much better, I suspect many of admirers of this film simply have not seen any of those.

Uneven script and even worse direction is camouflaged with the important messages and arty shell of BW photography. What comes tomy mind is another film about Nazism - somewhere in mid 70-ies Art-Porn maker Tinto Brass (of Caligula fame) took Nazim as a background for his film Salon Kitty. He invited famous art house stars Tulin and Berger who had previously acted in very highly regarded anti-fascist film of great Lucino Visconti and made own film about fascism. The result? Despite the sets, the stars, the important issues - the film still ended up being Art-Porn - as this was the only thing Mr. Brass could do. The same is problem with Spielberg - he might be really willing to make an important picture but still ended up with what he is best at making ¬ñ exploitation movie.

As to the rain of Oscars ¬ñ well, didn't ""Around the world in 80 days"" once get an Oscar?",2

18 February 2005,He's best,"I'm a big fan of Spielberg and i have to admit that Schlinders List is he's greatest and best ever made movie. Even with movies like JAWS, Saving Private Ryan, Jurrasic Park, E.T they don't have the same class as Schlinders list. The movie is made in white n black and not many movies are made so now days and that he had the courage to do it and manage to win a Oscar. The movie makes you really think back to the past with the black n white and the places that he's been filming that makes our minds go flash back to the old good times. Yet there are some mistakes as the most of the directors and actors make. He makes this movie to much.. if you understand he makes it the Spielberg way that means that he loves the action scenes but he hasn't been using it as he did in Saving Private Ryan.. He makes the action go good with the picture ""the piano scene (Ghetto) "" ...

8 November 2004,"""A masterpiece!""","This movie is proof that Steven Spielberg is the best director of all time. While i was watching this movie i was crying my eyes out and not just because of the greatness but because i realized that i will never be able to begin to understand how incredible this movie is, but from the stuff that i did understand was how great the meaning is and how it still gives hope to man kind. This movie truly is the best war film of all time. This film just might even change the way you look at life. If this film dose not impact you in any way then watch it again or go to film school because you are blind or just take a look back on some of his other great movies. Such as E.T. Thank you Steven you truly are my inspiration and my hero.

12 May 2014,Steven Spielberg brings his vision in a great style,"""Schindler's List"" tells the story of Oskar Schindler, a nazi at WWII that decides to save jews from a concentration camp. At first, he did not intend to save them, he was only interested in money, to buy jews to work in his factory, and make him money. But lately, we see Oskar change his mind, and secretly, saving the most people as he can. It wouldn't be bad if Martin Scorsese had accepted the offer to direct this feature, but Steven Spielberg shows the story in a magnificent directing, cinematography, screenplay, score and performances. With 7 Academy Awards, ""Schindler's List"" is considered a classic of movies and keeps touching all kind of people's heart.

18 December 2021,From being a profiteer to a geunine affectionate,"G√∂th is not the only villainous character in this movie. Many of the scenes that showcase the tragedies of the Jewish plight are unrestrained in their depiction of these atrocities. Spielberg clearly depicts how unfathomably callous Nazi soldiers were during this time period. One especially poignant scene has soldiers scouring the ghetto looking for children who were in hiding. Each time they find a child they riddle them with bullets. As this goes on, two soldiers take a break and listen to a third playing the piano and talk about what composer's music the third is playing. For them, murdering children is as inconsequential as shoveling dirt.

5 March 2003,One Hero's Story,"""Schindler's List"" begins in September of 1939 at the start of WWII. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) opens a factory at the beginning of the movie and needs Jews to work in it for free. Although he doesn't pay his workers with cash, they receive something more valuable in the end--their freedom and their lives. In the beginning, Schindler is only out to make money, but by the end of the movie, has given up everything to help save the lives of over 1,100 Jewish people.

Spielberg is trying to tell Schindler's true story so more people will know the truth about him and his contributions to help the Jews. Schindler isn't made out to be a saint, however, as he loves women and mingles with the Nazis. Spielberg also wants to show how one man can make such a difference in the world. Although Schindler feels he could have spared more lives, Spielberg illustrates that countless generations live because of his concern and generosity.

The black and white film gives the movie more authenticity and realism. The little color used was utilized very effectively. At times the film is hard to watch, as it is gory, vulgar, and contains nudity, but much of it is needed for the full effect of the film. After seeing scenes that depict how the Jews were treated in the ghettos and death camps, we have some understanding of what they lived through. Spielberg pieced the elements together to make the movie as close to actuality as possible. It is an informative and heartbreaking story that is very well put together.",
19 September 2021,The greatest movie ever made.,"Out of all the movies i've seen, Schindler's List affected me the most. It's the most powerful movie ever created. It's dark, extremely evil and so powerful. Schindler's List Showcases the best and worst of humanity and the death of innocence.

Spielberg showcases the raw horrors of The Holocaust and World War Two like no other director has managed to. Schindler's List is a movie of extreme importance in the history of cinema and it's a must watch to understand the terror and horrors of the holocaust.

Liam Neeson and Sir Ben Kingsley as Oskar Schindler and Itzhak Stern is nothing short of pure brilliance and they form a special and unique friendship in Schindler's List. Together they create some of the most powerful scenes ever.

The outstanding perfomance by Ralph Fiennes as Amon G√∂eth is simply magnificent. It's one of the greatest performances cinema has ever seen if not the greatest. Ralph Fiennes makes Amon G√∂eth a truly unforgettably evil and haunting character.

I have nothing, but the highest of praise for this movie. Schindler's list is the most powerful and most important movie ever made. It's Steven Spielbergs masterpiece. This is also the ONLY movie that i consider better than the Lord of the rings movies.

Schindler's List is simply the greatest movie ever made.

20 August 2004,Most powerful film of all time (Slight Spoilers),"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",
26 November 2004,Best Movie Ever Made!,"In 1942, a German Nazi named Oskar Schindler developed a business, in Krakow, Germany. It was managed by a Jewish man, Itzchak Stern, and populated hundreds of working Jews. One day, the workers and the living Jews in the ghetto were overruled by invading Nazis, led by Amon Goeth. They were evacuated and taken to a concentration camp near the ghetto. Devastated by the loss of workers, Schindler demanded to Goeth that his workers be released immediately. But not so; Goeth told Schindler that the Jews were to remain in the camp. Determined, and self-willed, Schindler opened a business near the camp, and made a list of Jews that could work there. The list was only meant for a couple hundreds, but eventually became a list with one thousand and eleven Jew names on it. The Jews were shipped out, and worked until the end of the war. Afterwards, at midnight the day World War II was strictly declared over, Stern and some friends made a letter of evidence that Schindler was innocent, and a ring out of a Jew's tooth, with the words ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire"" inscribed on the side. It was at exact moment that Schindler learned that not only did his factory become successful, it saved the lives of Jewish victims.

This is a beautiful yet horrifying crafted movie about the terrible Holocaust. It is a very well-done picture, with fantastic cinematography-all done in black and white-, flawless acting, and a powerful score. Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler, showing the kindness yet fierceness of the man who was considered a 'savior.' Ben Kingsley is wonderful as the Jewish assistant, Itzchak Stern. But the most recognizable performance of the cast is Ralph Fiennes, who is incredible as the root of all evil, Amon Goeth.

The story is incredible all in itself, and it contains such mind-blowing images, text, and sounds. Spielberg used his directing skills very well, showing audiences the real horrors and incredible sadness through these elements. Such complex things are heart-wrenching to imagine, but not even this film can display the Holocaust. This film shows only but a pinprick of the evils of this senseless massacre.

Notable scenes are the liquidation of the Ghetto, the children escape, and, most of all, the heartbreaking close-to-the-end scene. The final scene is emotional, because you see the 'Schindler Jews', along with the actors that played them, place rocks on the grave of Schindler. And the last person, whom is only but a shadow to us, places a red rose in the middle.

I cannot tell you the incredible and durable sadness I felt as I watched this film, but it made me realize that even ordinary people can save lives. I recommend that everyone should see this; it really is more than a regular film. It is a masterpiece.",10
19 January 2022,An unsurpassed masterpiece even after 30 years,"Due to the abundance of domestic films about the war, the Russian viewer rarely thinks that foreigners also know how to shoot worthwhile pictures about those sad events. Perhaps one of the most famous among them, even after almost 30 years after its release, remains ""Schindler's List"".

I can assume that many people start watching this film because of director Steven Spielberg, but they watch it to the end for the sake of the story. In a good way, such a movie should be shown to teenagers at class hours dedicated to humanism and moral education. After all, insight can overtake even the most ""black"" soul, and you should always strive for this.

Not paying attention to the fact that the film is quite old and black and white, I would like to focus on the plot. The Holocaust is a difficult and painful topic even for those who have nothing to do with Jews. Therefore, those inhuman conditions and chaotic tortures that were shown in the ""Schindler's List"" do not cause anything but disgust and silent tears.

At the same time, introducing us to the main character Oskar Schindler, the creators present him to us in the form of a money-hungry man who sees prisoners as only a source of income. It probably was, but because of this there is a certain feeling of ""failure"". We are not shown at what specific moment Oscar's attitude changes... the true reason remains vague.

It's hard to believe that before that fatal massacre of Jews, which turned his life upside down, he had never watched their suffering and torment, albeit in some other form. But in any case, what happened happened. And even if his motives remain not completely clear to us, because we are used to comparing the Germans of that time exclusively with immorality and ""universal evil"", thanks to his decision more than a thousand lives were saved.

At the same time, he does not act impulsively. Oscar understands perfectly well that it is impossible to save so many people, guided solely by emotions and nobility. That is why he purposefully yanks in front of his superiors and bribes the ""right"" people.

Despite the fact that ""Schindler's List"" is a feature film, it feels like a documentary. It is not surprising, since the plot is based on real events, but a significant role in this was played by a black-and-white picture without unnecessary sounds and anguish. It's like you're watching archival recordings, for example, of the siege of Leningrad. I had a similar feeling, for which the director has a special respect.

28 September 2004,Still the best film ever,"I still consider this the most powerful and emotional experience I have ever encountered in the cinema. No other film has come close to evoking that sort of reaction from me. The performances are superb and the the direction breathtaking. A story everybody should be made to see. Criticisms of the final scene are, in my opinion, unfounded as it humanised the whole story and made it hit home how one man's actions saved and affected (and created) so many lives. I doubt Spielberg will hit this height again but that's OK. I would be proud of this as my towering achievement. It's a shame that that the DVD did not have more in the way of special features. I would have loved to have known more about the making of it.

5 February 2007,One of the greatest and most important films ever,"Without a shadow of a doubt, Schindler's List is the finest film Spielberghas ever made; it is also, comfortably, the most important and is a movie everybody should make an effort to see, not just because of it's quality as a film but because of the message it carries with it. Everyone must surely now know the basis of the film - war profiteer OskarSchindler, a Nazi party member, works to save the lives of over a thousand Jews during the Holocaust, risking his own life in doing so. It is a story that, told incorrectly, could have been overly sentimental or that could have failed to make the points it needed to make about the Holocaust.Instead, it is told so well, it transcends the boundaries of it's media and has become both a vital historical document, cataloging the terror of the Nazis in a way everyone can understand, and a salient warning for our future. The strength of the film lies in the fact that it makes no attempt to preach to the person watching it. The primary characters are painted in shades of Grey. Schindler is a womanizer, a drinker, a profiteer who seemingly puts money before morals much of the time. He laughs and jokes with Nazis, including the primary villain, Plaszow commandant Amon Goeth,who himself is never presented as entirely evil. Throughout, the viewer is presented with a document of the actions of the characters and left to make up their own mind. Spielberg shot the film in black and white, often using hand-held cameras,to give it the appearance of a documentary, and it works. Coupled with the realities of the characters, and the fact that Spielberg neither draws back from the brutality of the Nazis nor uses the script to preach about it, this gives the film ""the ring of truth"". One of the hardest things in film-making is to take the truth, make no major changes to it and then make it believable on the screen; here Spielberg succeeds in this totally. The central performances in the movie are immense. Liam Neeson, RalphFiennes and Ben Kingsley give utterly convincing performances in the lead roles and the scenes where they appear with each other pin the film together and carefully chart the development of Schindler's sympathies.They are the final link in a film that has no weaknesses. This is a dark film though - how could it be otherwise with it's subject matter? It is upsetting and deeply moving and anybody who watches can'help but be changed in some way. The emotional climax of the film, in Auschwitz itself, is one of the most harrowing scenes ever put on celluloid. Spielberg handles the ending wonderfully as well, avoiding cloying sentimentality but still managing to provide some hope after all the darkness that has come before. The final scene, involving some of the people Schindler saved, is profoundly moving. If you haven't seen this film and are considering buying it, do so. Quiteaside from the fact that this is one of the finest movies ever to come out of Hollywood anyway, it also stands alongside books like 1984 and TheGrapes of Wrath, and films like The Battle of Algiers, as being""entertainment"" that is far more important than the genres which spawned them. The 2-disc set is beautifully packaged, and somehow this seems important for once. There is a deeply moving documentary included featuring interviews with survivors from Schindler's List. The transfer of the film to DVD is excellent as well - clear, bright and smooth. The choice of starting point for the second part of the film on the second DVD is also well made and poignant. For those who wish to further their knowledge of history's darkest hour,the best starting place is Martin Gilbert's book The Holocaust. Alsorecommended are Primo Levi's books If This Is A Man, The Sixth Day and IfNot Now, When; Roman Polanski's film The Pianist and, in music, Gorecki's3rd symphony and Shostakovich's Babi Yar. Equally important is another Martin Gilbert book, The Righteous, which catalogers the actions of some of the 17,000 other people so far recognized by the Council of Yad Vashemin Israel as righteous people who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust. All these works help further tolerance and understanding,as does Schindler's List and that, surely, is the film's greatest credit and testimony.",10
16 September 2013,A Cinematic Genius you'll come to see in Ages...!!!,"Seriously talking, when I first tried to watch this movie I was surprised by the length (Over 3 hours) and that too in Black and White motion picture. I thought of leaving this movie. Then I thought of giving it a try taking into account that this movie is directed by Steven Spielberg, a legend.

I gave this movie two-three tries to watch but after watching 10 minutes I was taken aback every time due to its length.

Finally, I thought of giving it a final try. That day me and my very good friend both started watching the movie at their own houses.

After watching the initial 15 minutes, I was so engrossed in the movie I forgot everything that whether its in Black and White or its length.

The complete 3 hours+ was a roller-coaster ride where I was spell bounded by the performances of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and not to forget Ralph Fiennes.

I was completely lost for the next few days only thinking about this movie, the direction of the Genius, Spielberg, the writers, etc.

After watching the movie that night, Me and my friend talked over the phone and we both were speechless, watching this masterclass.

A movie over Jews and Nazis during world war II, cannot be portrayed in a more beautiful way than this one.

Some scenes will leave you stunned and might even cause you to lose faith over mankind.

I will recommend this masterpiece to every movie lover who sees movie from their heart and loves watching masterpiece like these.

This will for sure remain the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life and I love to watch it again and again.

A full 10/10 for this one, as I don't see any flaw in this movie and Hats-Off for the legend STEVEN SPIELBERG!!! #Respect",10
22 December 2013,The film is another example of a number if big budget movies about Holocust and Jewish people in world war II being massacred by Hiltler army.,"The story and form of the film is moving and engage the audience in to dramatic core of the film. What I have observed more as specific talent and skill of the director is mood and tone of the film being transformed to the audience; heartbreaking sequence of the film where Jews are moved toward the gas chamber and moments later where the smoke comes out is utter shock and depression which we as audience feel it, also the camera shot choice and composition makes the sequence identical.The hand-held camera in some sequences has achieved the aim of the filmmaker to engage the audience into story shift between objective to subjective point of view. For instance where the Jewish women being run into the chamber and the doors are locked on them, apart from the suspense of being burnt in the chamber which we see is not the case and they have shower, the audience feels the tension and terror in the scene.

This film's only ""bad thing"" is that it's in black and white but this believe it or not gives it even more beauty. I think that this movie is suitable for kids 12 and up if they are watching it with their parents. Also remember that is film is based on a true story. Schindler was a man who helped the Nazis in many ways (suplying weapons etc)but he did not think that what was being done to the Jews was right so he helped many of them who are still alive today and many who left their children to tell the story.

In diving this would be 10 on execution and 10 on level of difficulty for a combined score of 10.

17 January 2005,Spielberg's masterpiece,"Personally I find this is Spielberg's masterpiece. Showing the monstrosities that took place during the 2nd world war. Of all the holocaust movies that have ever been made this is the best by far because this movie has it all showing the emotions of the different people. Even the sadistic Amon Goeth has emotions he just has problems handling them. The way he shows the inhuman things that took place is just spine chilling. Its the best movie of its kind and should be in any top 10 of the best movies ever where any masterpiece belongs. If you haven't watched this movie yet you shouldn't be reading this but on your way to the video store to get this movie.

Watching this gave me chills, made me shake, cry, and stare astounded and astonished at the end of it. The Holocaust is perhaps one of the most shocking and horrific times we will ever learn about. True, events this like that have occurred before, but this is the one that everyone knows about, survivors from this event still live and are able to talk about its terrors. It's beyond most of our imaginations, the systematic killing of races just because they are different. To us, it just makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The eleven or some say up to twelve million people who were murdered became victims of a cruel, heartless, callous, and brutal time; an atrocious idea that it was OK to carry out the ""Final Solution."" It was not OK. The Jews, Gypsy's, handicapped, Slavs, mentally ill, etc; anyone different from the way the aggressors thought people should be. Anyone who opposed them went away as well. It is so unheard of. Call me na√Øve, but everyone is the same. Do we not all laugh, cry, bleed, love¬Öthere's only one race and that's mankind. Hatred and scapegoats leads to forceful and concentrated suffering. No one should ever have to deal with that. In my school's One-Act play, we adapted some events from Schindler's List that made our show even more intense. The black and white theme is remarkable, and the touch of the little girl in the red coat is so overwhelming and deep. The authentic and actual landmarks, the recreation of such images that make us the audience gasp in fear, and cry out in agony. It felt like we were there, witnessing the fact, but we couldn't do anything to help them. We were frozen in time, glued to our chairs, shocked at what was happening on screen. Seeing it on screen was real enough, imagine witnessing it for real. Something like that must never happen again. Ever. Oscar Schindler really was a hero who doesn't get enough credit. I'll bet few people even know his name. The millions who died are simply martyrs for a cause; a cause of loyalty to one's faith, family, friends, and a deep devotion to never surrender. We could all learn something from this movie. Generosity goes a long way. Thousands of people are alive today just b/c of Oscar Schindler and the millions of victims and survivors who never gave up. That movie is the only one that has ever made me cry; it is just so powerful...",
10 November 2019,One of the greatest war films,"This film is astonishing, Liam neeson at his very best, Spielberg at his very best. A film to seriously make you think. You will remember this along time after you first see it, truly an absolute masterpiece.

2 September 2023,A Sobering Examination of Humanity and Heroism,"The film is a deeply affecting yet crucial viewing experience, offering a candid portrayal of the Holocaust through one individual's efforts to save lives. The direction is masterly, utilising stark black-and-white cinematography to enhance the gravitas of the subject. Exceptional performances lend depth and subtlety to characters who might otherwise have been depicted simplistically. Beyond serving as a historical drama, the film compels the audience to grapple with the ethical complexities and human toll of indifference and malevolence. It's a profoundly moving work that leaves an indelible mark, affirming its place as a significant contribution to both cinema and historical comprehension.

20 January 2009,Greatest Film of All Time,"From the Musical Score to the direction to the acting, the movie is flawless and should be recognized as the greatest Film of All Time. A gem form Steven Spielberg, Schindler's List dives deep into the works of humanity and what a person is worth.

Watching the Jews just slaughtered in this movie is very difficult however. It's not that this movie has a TON of blood, although there is a decent amount, it's what the Germans do to the Jews, or what the Jews are forced to do, and how cruel and unnecessary it is that is so deeply unsettling.

Liam Neeson gives one of the greatest acting performances ever. His one scene with him talking about how he could do more reaches out and truly touches people, more than just the Jews hugging him in the scene.

Schindler's List is the idea of a perfect Film. Something with as strong a message as it may speak out to us and truly touch us is outstanding. The acting is flawless, and the direction is breathtaking. The one film everyone needs to see before they die.",10
15 August 2014,The film depicts the story of schindler and how he helped the Jews in the time of Nazi rule.,"One cannot become a movie lover,if he/she has not watched this classic hit from the evergreen director Steven Spielberg.I regard this as one of the best movie the Hollywood has ever seen.The director and the crew dedicated themselves completely for the making of this movie and their hard work is reflected in each scene of the movie.

One of the major notable feature of the film is the art direction and cinematography.Both stood marvelous apart from some other movies which depicts the past.The symbolic representation of black and white throughout the movie and the use of candles in some scenes brings a magical style to the scenes.The movie has discovered far beyond the miseries of Jews,which includes unity,humanity and love.Moreover the close examining of each character was able to present the sentiments and the actual situation in a more sensational way to the viewers.

I tried to find the negative sides of the film ,but couldn't get them.And I rate it as an outstanding must watch movie.",9
19 November 2002,Spielberg's masterpiece.,"Schindler's List is the most deeply-moving film ever made. Steven Spielberg has created a horrifying realistic account of what the Jewish people went through during WWII. I can't express how much this film moved me emotionally, so I won't even try. Simply put, it's one of the very best cinematic experiences you'll ever witness. Brilliant.

4 March 2006,i can't watch this movie with other people,"I weep a little bit more each time I see it.

I've given up trying to explain it to my intelligent friends that have yet to see it.

It occupies a rarefied movie space along with Star Wars, Cuckoo's Nest, Casablanca, Spinal Tap and Patton. In my world at least.

That's all I have to say about Schindler's List.

However. As much fun as it is to play the rank the movie game (or the rank the anything game for that matter), I've decided that it's a limited way of looking at things. There's no inherent need to stratify.

I find it preferable to acknowledge certain examples of things as holding an elevated status in my pantheon. Once something reaches that level, there's no need to differentiate between the brethren (or, sistren, if you prefer).",10
27 November 2014,Incredible how breathtaking this movie is,"I first saw this movie in school for my trip to Auschwitz. The movie showed the Holocaust really realistic. The black and white touch gives it a some kind of historical flair, which I really like and it goes well with the movie. This is the story of Oskar Schindler who kept over 1,000 people alive during the Nazi reign. Liam Neeson is phenomenal in his role as Schindler. What I like it the faded splash of faint color in the little girls red coat; the rest of the movie is black and white, which only adds to the impact of the total emotion of this fantastic film. Schindlers List is such an emotionally shattering and gripping movie that no words can even describe it.

13 September 2005,Beautifully poetic,"In many cases, I have found that Steven Spielberg movies, while usually very good for sitting in a theater and enjoying were never really my kind of thing. I bought this movie on a hunch that this one would be different. Well, it really wasn't, but I can't deny the absolute perfection of such a blatantly Hollywood movie. In typical Spielbergian fashion, the movie lifts you up and throws you down throughout, but never enough to make you very happy or sad, but at the end... The end is where the real kick is. I've never seen such a blatantly obvious attempt to make a person cry, but, even though I tried not to, I still did. It was an impossible temptation to escape. Sure it's propaganda, sure it's a Hollywood, ends happy, leaves you with a good feeling inside type of movie, but it was still more powerful than many other movies could even try to be.

7 March 2003,You owe it to yourself to see it!,"I don't know why, but I've never seen this film before. Despite all the awards and buzz, I was just never moved to rent it. On one hand, I'm kicking myself for not having watched it years ago. On the other, I think this is a perfect time to watch it. With everything going on in the world today, I think it would serve every one of us well to watch this ... and be reminded of how the US stood by, knowing full well what was happening as Hitler marched across Europe, and did NOTHING. My wife and I were very moved throughout the film. If you have one ounce of compassion in you, this movie will bring it to the surface!

6 June 2003,Thought-Provoking,"I loved this film! It is a very thought-provoking film. It has made me cry the first time I have watched and every time there after. It has shown us what genocide is really like and how stupid it would be to re-create history in a bad manner. I believe a lot can be taught through this film. The metaphors and realism in this film has made me reflect upon the moments in history, violence is never the answer!

And even if this isn't even your favorite genre, you will come to find that you will not regret it for watching it at least once. Anyone whom I've shown this movie to so far has not regretted it.

15 August 2014,One of the most depressing movie experience ever. But a good one.,"In my opinion everyone should watch this movie at least once. It might be depressing but you'll be taught a lesson: NEVER AGAIN. And this movie describes the holocaust quite realistic. Thats why the impact on the viewer is so immense in my opinion.

I've never seen a movie where shooting a person was so realistic. The blood, the falling, the sound...It's really disturbing. (Does anybody know another movie where this is so realistic?)

Despite the age of the movie already it's not even close to be old production wise (in 2014) for me. It doesn't look bad or old. It's just well made and still has some great effects. The actors are all great and I can't point out some bad things.

9 October 2020,Amazing,"I would rate the film as follows

1. Characters 10 2. Acting 10 3. Plot 10 4. Cinematography 11 5. World building 10

This movie is so great that you think it's real. That's why the Cinematography gets 11 points.

The world building is perfect, you really feel like Nazi Germany, everything is believable. You think it's all real.

8 April 2014,I loved it.,"I have to hand it to the director, he really made the movie come alive, I was practically crying through the whole thing. He did a really good job with casting too,I think the people he chose were perfect for the parts.It's a very touching story, it defiantly touched my heart. I'm not the type of person to watch these kind of films but I got told so much that it was such a good film I watched it and I do not regret it. in the future I will watch more of his films for sure. Not only was it a really sad (and true) story it had a bit of mystery - For example through the whole thing I kept wondering who the girl in the red coat was, that's also what kept me watching.

26 March 2022,The best movie about the WW2,"Movies like ""Come and See"", ""Inglorious Basterds"" and ""the boy in the striped pyjamas"" are other great movies from the WW2 but this one is the best in my opinion.

I didn't know if I was going to like the black and white theme but it gave A good texture about how dark it really was at that time. As the movie plan out we see more and more of the terrible things that happened and I like that this movie really doesn't have any filters.

I also like the actors in this movie. Liam Neeson makes an incredible work as Oskar Schindler and Ben Kingsley was great aswell. I was hyped about to see what Kingsley would be like in this movie as he is in my favourite movie Shutter Island and he didn't dissapoint at all.

As I said the movie is really dark so don't show this to your kids, otherwise I recommend Shindler's list to the fullest.",10
19 January 2022,11,"I can't possibly describe with words how great ""Schindler's List"" is. You can't realize it unless you watch it. Spielberg not only makes you feel like you're in the middle of it, but you continue feeling that way for hours after watching the movie. Liam Neeson does a top-notch job as Oskar Schindler, a man caught between loyalty to his government and the desire to save over 1,000 people. Equally good is Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, whom Schindler saves from getting exterminated, and then helps Schindler save more people. And Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, a Nazi Kommandant with plans to rape a Jewish woman. Like I said, I can't possibly describe how great this movie is. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT TO UNDERSTAND IT. 11/10.

25 April 2006,A modern day classic,"A few months ago when a friend of mine suggested that I watch Schindler's List, and I wasn't too keen on the sound of it, but eventually after repeated attempts for him to get me to watch it, I gave in and I watched it. I was totally blown away, it's been made so well, it's such an enjoyable film that has inspired me along with a generation. I love watching the film, even though it is one of the depressing and disturbing films that I have ever watched as the acting was so believable and they were able to act together so well, that I value this movie as one of the best of all time, and I'm not the only one if this film is currently sitting at the #6 spot on the IMDb top 250

Only a Great Director, like Steven Spielberg can explain the Holocaust, this accurate.

Steven Spielberg did his job expertly and Introduced the world with the WW2 Hero Oskar Schindler. Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley just nailed it. The production design, song and the screenplay were Legendary.

One of the few Great movies in History that is Hard to watch Again.

12 July 2004,Amazing Movie,"I don't know how I waited eleven years to see this film. This was one of the most amazing works of art I have ever seen. The cinematography, the music, the acting are monumental. I can't remember the last time I have felt so touched by a movie. The scene in which Schindler is leaving the camp to flee the allies is emotionally gut wrenching. He is truly a man transformed. The plight of the children in the camps as depicted in the film is particularly awe inspiring. To see them separated from their mothers and while others hid in the toilets was almost too much too bear watching. This movie should be watched by everyone for generations as a reminder of the evil that man can perpetrate on man but that one person can make a difference if they are willing to be ruled by love.

15 May 2004,Our History in a film,"The first time I watched this film I was 13 years old. I saw it because my History¬¥s teacher put it on class, as he explained us The Second World War. I watched it that day in class and 2 more times at home that afternoon. I couldn¬¥t belive what I was seeing!! We all knew what had happened to the Jewish but as a I saw the film time after time I couldn¬¥t understand how people, how ourselves, could go too far.

I agree with many people about this is a very hard film and about sometimes it is difficult to continue watching it, but I think it is the most perfect film I have ever seen because of its realism, because this film explains us what it really happened. It is disturbing, sad and horrible, but actually for me it is the most beautiful film in the world because thanks to it I can see (not study, not read, I CAN SEE) what happened during one of the most important moments of our History.

7 June 2008,Director has an equivocal attitude.,"the director's point of view shown in the film is something more than that of the Jews. Rather his point includes that of the Germans at the same time by focusing mainly on the storyline of the German hero 'Oscar Schindler'. This whole plot clarifies his intention to make the film hold a balanced view of two sides. Thus, It escapes from a dichotomy which the Jewish people as the victim may easily fall into; beautification of the Jews and demonization of the Germans.

In this sense the director somewhat exceeds the limitation of the nationality. In addition, his viewpoint puts an emphasis more on the individual level than on the national one. There is actually a wide spectrum even among German people in the film; merciless Nazi 'Goeth', merciful Nazi 'Oscar' and most people who sit back and watch uncritically.

It's exactly the individual traits which make the result different. In specific ""Shindler's List"" especially focuses on the motives and acts of such kinds of people as Oscar who gave up his profits in order to save others. Therefore the movie is basically a further study about those who have a great soul which rebels against the atrocities and pursues the idea of 'Humanity'.",9

Tragedy (WHICH IS SHOCKING IN IT'S OWN RITE), But because of the style of the movie. It was not the style of SPIELBURG that I am used to! from the black and white Cinematography to the little girl in red, I was so overcome with the intense drama that I actually cried at the end, which for a QUENTIN TARANTINO fan is a giant leap!

This movie is a Ocean of Drama which drowns you is pure emotion that entails a story that this world will not and cannot forget!

12 December 2005,The most moving work of art in history. No kidding,"Every scene in Schindler's List is a thread being woven into a tapestry of pure humanity. The film has a conventional climax, but only in the final scene do we reach the emotional climax, where the tapestry attains completion and perfection. Per Jewish tradition, many stones are placed upon Oskar Schindler's grave, and then -- while you hear Itzhak Perlman's violin soar to its most sorrowful note -- a single rose.

At that moment, your heart will simply break.

Performances by Neeson, Fiennes and Kingsly are fantastic and memorable but I think Fiennes delivered the best performance of his career as the heartless, psychotic nazi officer Amon Goeth, his scenes steal the screen and are the ones you won't soon forget after the credits roll. Schindler's List is the work of master and is masterfully crafted on all counts, this is an unforgettable, iconic film that simply cannot be missed.

9 January 2020,Must watch!,"The story revolves around a businessman who helps in saving jews during World War II. The movie takes you back in time and potrays the barbaric horrors faced by jews in Nazi Germany. Oskar Schindler is deeply impacted by horrors being inflicted on jews; and tried to save as many jew employees of his. Oskar Schindler slowly morphs from an astute businessman to an altruistic considerate human. Liam Neeson is well, Liam Neeson at his best. Performances delvered by actors are impeccable.

From any point of view of the film, Schindler has achieved the power of directly striking people's hearts. In the face of human nature and life, Schindler has made the choice to let history remember. It's a classic. It's moving.

3 April 1999,Beautiful a masterpiece.,"It is a rare occasion for me to cry during a movie. However this movie moved me to tears. I believe everyone in the world should see this film. Liam Neeson does a wonderful job in the portrayal of Oskar Schindler. Ralph Fiennes does an excellent job as the Nazi Amon Goeth which he has said is one of his toughest roles because of the complexity of the character. One of the scenes that stays with me is the one with the little girl in the scarlet clothes walking down the street in the middle of a Nazi Aktion. It really shows you that these horrors must not be forgotten. There are many people who deny the Holocaust or just don't care. I believe that we should try our best to keep these memories alive if we are to have hope for the future. That is what this film does thank you Steven Spielberg.

One of the best soundtracks, brilliant acting and a depressing but equally interesting and exciting story about the magnificent part of Oskar Schindlers life we all know. I would rate it a 20/10 if only it would be possible. And more than a masterpiece in movie history has Spielberg created and founded the Shoah foundation. I don't think there will ever be a this great and important movie in the future.

12 September 2013,A Must See!!,"Everything about this film is amazing.

From the acting to the cinematography... all of it is visually pleasing. More importantly the story itself is moving, and disturbing. while watching Schlinder's List, I found myself continuously (and unsuccessfully I might add) fighting back tears.

I think this is a film that should be shown in film schools to illustrate how to make a great film.

I applaud the Director Steven Spielberg for his incredible vision and brilliant story telling. The performance of each of actor the made me believe and feel their individual truths. Special credit goes to Liam Neeson for the transformation in his performance. The man is amazing!

18 September 2003,Great!,"I think this is absolutely a great movie! There are definitely things in this movie that are not good to see. I think that this is probably one of the most informational movies of all time. The sad part about it is that Oskar Shindler really did help the Jews, but only for his own personal gain. The German leaders knew this, but the tiny number of Jews that he saved did not constitute an emergency on their part. Good movie!

Main roles and extras are playing like never before. This is a must see film, involving every aspect of life and death itself. The war is bad but also beautiful with its strange aspects and turns. The situation and all the scenes in the film are unique and the atmosphere catches you from the first moment on. In one moment you will stop realizing this is a film and will totally dive into the whole feeling of being a part of that altered reality. Definitely a film, that should be watched with a nice party- from beginning till the end! Happy watching! Enjoy!

8 April 2006,A brilliant way to capture the moment,"I have visited Krakow in Poland where the film was mainly made, the atmosphere there was distressing and to be able to capture that equally as emotive through a camera shows genius. I loved the entire film straight through, it promises to draw tears every time without fail. A must see. The film also portrays the sadness of the camps better than being in the camp in person; i have been to auschwitz and berkenau myself. I think Neeson plays schindler excellently, he has the charm to demonstrate the real Schindlers nature with women. I also thought at first that black and white films were not appreciated in the modern age, however, this film shows that black and white can work, you would not get the same effect from the film if it were in colour.

Although this has raw footage of unimaginable events, there are also great stories and character studies involved.You become close to the people in the film. This movie is almost, if not completely, flawless.From its incredible direction to its effective editing and black and white presentation.From its music, cinematography, and impressive cast, this movie will remain in your memory for the rest of your life.

1 June 2000,"With Schindler's List, Spielberg completely shattered the limits of what I thought film can do.","Schindler's List is by far the most powerful and profound movie going experience I've ever had. No other film I have seen even comes close to the kind of power generated by Schindler's List. Spielberg did things with the medium of film that I never dreamed were possible. Somehow he managed to raise the artform to a transcendant, supernatural level - something that no other film in history (at least that I have seen) has accomplished. Citizen Kane may have set the standard for film, but Schindler's List completely shattered it - breaking free of the realm of normal movie making. Viewing Schindler's List went far beyond a merely passive experience of viewing a poweful film - for the first and only time I can remember, I was living the experience in a way that is almost inexplicable to me. It was a truly awesome existential and spiritual experience. There are single scenes in Schindler's List that are more brilliant, profound and powerful than entire films I have seen. There are sequences and images that haunted me for years afterwards and still haunt me. To this day I get choked up and tearie-eyed when I recall certain scenes or images to memory. Apart from that, the film is brilliantly shot with the best black and white cinematography I have seen since Citizen Kane. The screenplay is remarkably subtle and the performances are first rate all around. Liam Neeson, who has amazing screen presence, was the perfect choice to play the character of Oskar Schindler - a man who is likeable and charasmatic, but ultimately mysterious. And Ralph Fiennes was mesmerizing as the evil and complex Amon Goeth character.

Although this film is by far the high point of all my movie going experiences, it is also the low point in that every other film that I have seen since (even really great ones) seems so mediocre and ordinary in comparison.",10
1 August 2000,A compelling cinematic experience,"A masterpiece. Quite simply one of the finest films ever produced. Touching a subject that most viewers cannot even comprehend Spielberg weaves a moving tale that informs, shocks and ultimately illuminates the audience. A compelling experience.

17 April 2004,Best portrayal of the Holocaust,"I've researched the holocaust greatly, and have watched numerous movies about the Holocaust. Schindler's List has to be the best movie I've seen on the topic. The frank presentation of the violence and indifference of the nazi officers is amazing. Perhaps the most intense scene is when the Schindler's Female workers are sent to Auschwitz instead of his camp. The presentation, music, and cinematography make it one of the best scenes in any movie I have seen. All of the acting is fantastic, but I find Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Nazi Camp commandant Amon Goeth stunning. Also well acted is Embeth Davidtz in the role of Helena Hirsch, the jewish made of Goeth. He shows both the evil and human sides of the man, and acts them incredibly well. The cinematography is wonderful. Overall, this is a must see movie for all people interested in history.

28 January 2023,Spielberg's harrowing and heart wrenching masterpiece,"Helmed by one of the greatest directors of all time in Steven Spielberg, Schindler's list is undoubtedly one of the most powerful, unforgettable, and chilling movies ever made.

The film boasts a phenomenal cast with the three main stars, Liam Nesson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes, turning in some of the most believable and human acting performances I have ever seen. Nesson is particularly memorable as the film's protagonist Oskar Schindler. He masterfully conveys Schindler's slow transformation from a greedy opportunistic businessman who shamelessly profits off the suffering of World War 2 to an empathetic hero who saves over a thousand human lives.

These phenomenal acting performances are enhanced by a brilliantly written screenplay which emphasizes the flaws, humanity, and moral complexity of the characters.

Cinematography and visuals are another area where this film is near perfect. The choice to shoot the film in mostly black and white works very well here as it helps to fully immerse the viewer into the oldschool time period that the film is set in. The brief flashes of colour seen during the film are used to powerfully emphasize the importance of certain imagery.

The film does not hold back in the slightest when portraying the horrors of the Holocaust. In fact, Schindler's List is perhaps the most realistic depiction of this genocide ever put to screen. The nightmarish and grisly violence seen in the film feels as if it is happening to real, helpless people and as such is absolutely gut wrenching. The film also accurately showcases how horrendously Jews were treated in the Nazi labor camps and it is sickening to watch. Truly Schindler's List can be said to have some of the most disturbing and shocking scenes in motion picture history, however it never feels exploitative. It simply feels like Spielbergs true to life recreation of one of the most horrible atrocities of the 20th century.

However, despite all the bloody carnage, fear, and dread that the film conveys, it still has plenty of uplifting qualities. The film showcases both the absolute worst and best of what human beings are capable of, and it does so with remarkable care. It is truly inspiring.

Overall, Schindler's List is a timeless, compelling, and moving masterpiece. It is a prime example of a film everyone should watch at least once in their life and I believe it will continue to stand the test of time for years to come.",10
10 March 2004,"Of all the films the '90's produced, this is the best","To watch this film, you must be prepared to be horrified. By horrified, I don't mean that all of a sudden, a killer comes from out of nowhere and hacks off someone's limb, with blood and guts all over. No, I mean the true horror... from the fact that what you watch really happened sixty years ago. It is a film that just leaves you without the ability to speak. To walk away from this film dry-eyed is to not be human. Many 'Best Picture' winners are actually overrated... Chicago?... A Beautiful Mind??... The English Patient???... to name a few recent ones. Yet Schindler's List is not overblown, and for all its praise, is still underrated, for it deserves better than the best recognition. This is not just a film... not just three hours to while away your time. This is a lesson in humanity. Schools everywhere should make this part of their curriculum for High School, to teach the future leaders of the world what mankind is capable of. It's not what we could do. It's what mankind DID.

Some say the number of Jews murdered -- Six Million -- is overblown... but I say, be it six million or two million, or even just one single person, what happened was horrible and inexcusable. I myself am a descendent of a Nazi, and for their crimes, I say to all... LEARN from history, and never forget it.

Steven Spielberg, my hat's off to you.",10
7 March 2004,Horrifying and true.,"Steven Speilberg's Masterpiece is a real eye opener into human evil, and the triumph of the human sprit. An accurate account of the inhumanity of people who would rather blame and condemn those who are of different religious background, and to condone their hatred with unspeakable acts of violence and cruelty. I glad that this film is finally coming to DVD, because it time to reeducate the public of the most horrifying time in human history. Especially now when people really needed to see it to know the danger of misconception and the horror of misleading propaganda where power does corrupt, even when it involves religion.

This is a perfect time for this movie to come out.

21 June 2013,A surreal & invigorating experience !,"Steven Spielberg, through this movie has portrayed holocaust in a picturesque and surreal manner. The screenplay is brilliant and in all its grandeur. The story-line has been woven to instigate a sense of empathy and faith in the viewers and it sure excels at doing so. The utmost of detail and scrutiny has been given on the setup and the props used, giving it an authentic WWII feel. All these combined with the acting delivered by some of the legends concocts a ensemble of drama. This is one of those movies that is sure to leave you pondering into the abyss of humanity. Pretty lengthy movie, but totally justified. Definitely a must watch.

27 July 2001,"A touching, brilliant and tough film to watch","Schindler's list is without a doubt fantastic to say the least. A masterpiece. It is very much historically correct and worthy of all the academy awards it won. I must admit though, I found this film hard and tough to watch. After I viewed it I had to really think about whether I liked it or not. After the second time I viewed the film, I fell in love with the feature.

The story is based on Oscar Schindler's factories during the war and how a greedy, charming and womanizing man was the unlikely Saviour of more then a thousand Jews.

Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give fantastic and dramatic performances, but the real credit here goes to Ralph Fiennes who plays the evil murderer Amon Goeth. His performance is fantastic and haunting. As soon as neither Liam Neeson or Ralph Fiennes received an Oscar for their roles in the film I went completely against the Academy awards and didn't watch the Oscars again until 1997 where Titanic won the Best Picture Oscar. I watched the Oscar's again in 1998 and my jaw flew open as soon as Shakespeare in love beat Saving Private Ryan to the Best Picture award (what a joke). I haven't watched the Oscar's since.

This film is my third Favourite movie and I give it 10/10. Well done Spielberg you've amazed me again.",
18 June 2016,One of the most powerful movies,"One of the most powerful movies of all time! It is difficult to watch but I feel that it is the least thing we can do is watch and try to understand what these (real Holocost Survivors) went through. This is a part of our very dark history and we need to know about it and understand it so we do not ever have to go through this in our world again, unfortunately we still have not eradicated these racial or hate in our world. I believe it opens eyes for some and others choose to ignore these choices that have such a profound consequences on our world. I think everyone should see this movie and really study the subjects of the real Holocost!

14 May 2014,Epic movie with an epic ending,"A little slow in the beginning (you'll wonder what's happening), but as the movie progresses it will become awesome. The ending is epic. And considering that this all happened in real makes it even more interesting. Liam Neeson has done an epic role in the movie. Ben Kinsley is also extremely amazing. The movie has been directed in an awesome way by the epic director Steven Spielberg. The movie is black and white in spite of being in the 90's which goes with the movie and has been used well by the director. The movie is a little long (3 hours) but is worth the watch. The Nazi torture has been shown very appropriately.

25 April 2006,"One of the most powerful pictures in the world, if not THE most powerful. A Must-See flashback, what you won't forget.","This MOVIE (with all big letters) is one of the most beautiful, and horroristic pictures in the whole world. All of the actors have given their most perfect and powerful performances in their filming career. Ralph Fiennes gives us a breath-taking skill of being a lazy, brutal and ruthless, but still a calculating commander of the Jewish camp, and Ben Kingsley, who plays the accountant of Oskar Schindler, almost made me cry (I never dropped tears for a film), when he gives his tenets up (as a Jewish man, he can't drink alcoholic drink), and ask Schindler to give him a whiskey. I think without John Williams' music, this film still could be good, but when you hear the Piano Theme, it will make your soul heavy as a hammer, and you can't think about other things, just the Cruel Reality of the World in the WW2. Steven Spielberg has done a very-very good and exhaustive directing, with all the Black-and-White effects he used and controlled, like a work of art. This film grabs you, climb in your soul, and then won't get out of here until you watch a better movie than this. (it's impossible). Howewer the screen is black and white, the quality of sounds and the effects is cutting edge, and you can fell that you're there next to Amon Goeth, or one of the characters. But these words are nothing, you need to watch this movie to recognize it's true meaning, otherwise, this comment is nothing, it can't bring back the feeling of this picture, and you only will know, how great film is this, when you watch it with your own eyes. Congratulations, Steven Spielberg, you made an instant classic, which is recommended for ALL people in the world, at least for an one-time view with it's three hour playtime, but when you watch it, you grow up. Suddenly, for ever.",10

It is amazing the way in which the protagonist changes its thinking throughout the film, until end transformed your business in a salvation for members of the breed.

All aspects are positive in this film. Actors camera script, etc..

I hesitate to rate it the highest rating because surely I let go of the feelings that I produce my viewing of the film, and try to be as objective as possible.

But i recommend it for all the people!

Very beautiful in all the scenes and things

I mean, the OST is excellent, actors too...

It's very difficult to say something bad about this film, ins't it?",9
3 May 2004,An excellent film,"The shear beauty of Liam Neeson's performance of this thrilling story, is just the start. The directing and casting capture the moment superbly and make it invigorating to watch. A none-negotiable 10/10. One of the best films ever made. Better than the lord of the rings..... ALL 3 PUT TOGETHER The justice in the film is based upon peoples lives and what they went through. Adolf Hitler is only shown 2 or 3 times which is the beauty because it puts across a broader view and more facts are encouraged.

Love the movie,,,! Spielberg must put all his heart on this.. Liam Neeson and John Williams are the best. If anyone wants to see best drama of all time, i highly recommend this movie..

9 June 2013,An amazing film. An amazing experience!,"This is perhaps the only film that I feel compelled to review. Take the first two Godfather films, I prefer them over Schindler's List slightly, yet I did not feel the need to write a review for them. But this, I just feel I HAD to do it.

This film is not just a film, it's an experience. Each time I watch it, I feel like I'm actually there. Something about the film does that, the use of black and white works perfectly. Not only does it bring out the horrors of the holocaust and make it scarier, but the soundtrack fits perfectly too. The film is probably the most accurate depiction of the holocaust, ever to grace the silver-screen.

The acting is superb, there is no over-acting at all. The first 30 minutes are perhaps slow, but as the movie progresses you feel the pain of the Jews. The soundtrack at times it haunting, but also hopeful.

The film is inspiring and carries a message of hope and redemption. It sure did make me cry.

Schindler's List is a master of story-telling, with strong narrative and a beautiful soundtrack, it never get's old. To this day, 20 years later it still remains one of the greatest films of all time, but also Steven Spielberg's finest work.",10
30 March 2004,Shocking,"i had never seen a movie like that, it seem so realistic and it surly convinced me on how cruel those years were.... My opinion is that this movie is truly a masterpiece! i have seen several movies with this subject, some were good some weren't but history is the same and it is unbelievable what those cruel soldiers thought about themselves and their leader ..................................... the film is based on a real story and that makes it special. the actors are great , the directed by Steven Spielberg, what do you want more? let's say it had it all Drama Action War and so on..... this is my last line.... and i am finishing... the end!

8 July 2014,Film on the happenings of the Holocaust.,"Excellent filmography, the film just gets better with age and as it progresses. Extremely deep and meaningful and the casting was phenomenal, music choices were great and the overall feel of the film was emotional. There were many great choices made by all parties, being the director and actors as well as the designers. All these parts inside the film made me as an audience member feel as though i was really there experiencing these tragedies. The use of black and white was very powerful and showed how dreadful these things were, the end had a very dense and intense core and I loved it, highly recommended for any fan of this genre.

19 November 2002,Saving the Jew,"Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. Abraham Lincoln

The 1993 black and white ""Schindler's List"" was directed by Steven Spielberg. The Holocaust based movie lasts about three hours and fifteen minutes. The movie is based on a true story about a man named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a Nazi businessman. In 1939 Oskar Schindler tried to convince Jewish people to give him money to open a factory. Coming in contact with Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingdley), a Jewish accountant, he arranged a financial agreement with him. Osker's idea did not really take hold until 1941 when the Jewish dollar was basically worthless. In 1941 there were several elderly people who decided to invest their money in Schindler's idea, during this time the Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik was built. Hired as cheap labor to work in the factory, the Jews soul purpose was to make pots that would be sold to the army.

When compiling his list of Jews he wanted for workers, Oscar had one blank space left at the bottom of the page. Going to Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) with his list, Amon noticed that there was a blank space at the end of the last page. Schindler wanted to add Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz), Amon's maid, whom Amon had fallen in love with and not even realized it. At the end of the movie, we learn that Schindler managed to save 1,100 Jews from a cruel death. From those 1,100 survivors, we now have 6,000 Jewish descendants. I find it interesting to watch and to learn about one of the most horrific times in history. One of the most memorable remarks for me was one made by Oskar Schindler: `This car. Why did I keep the car? Amon would've bought this car. 10 people right there. This pin, 2 people, This is gold! 2 people he could've given me 2 people at least one. One person. One person who is dead. One person I could've gotten out and I didn't!!' It seemed like the Jews were just workers. It did not seem like he cared what happened to them. Oscar did not make any kind of emotional connection to the workers; they were just people whom he could purchase for little money. When he made this statement and almost had a nervous breakdown, it seemed like he cared for the people and did not want to see them killed. If I had to rate this movie I would give it 4 out of 5. One of the things that I did not like was when they would talk in German. Unless we know how to speak German, we do not know what they are saying. This movie gave a vivid visual of what life would have been like living under the rule of the Nazi party in the 1930s.",
31 May 2020,Schindler's List,"This is my favorite movie. I feel very sad after watching it. From music to the scene, it's very depressing and sad. When I saw that the Jews had cut gold teeth and made a ring for Schindler, I could not help but cry. This movie has achieved the ultimate level of war movie at present, no matter in thought, plot, photography and music.

15 March 1999,Objet d' art,"Schindler's List is unquestionably the finest re-enactment of Holocaust horror there can ever be. Dubious historical accuracy aside, it's infinitely more important for the audience to recognize how perfectly the film duplicates the emotional impact of the Holocaust. One cannot feel such fear, shame, rage or love for humanity through any other means. To see this film is to witness the full potential for human good and human evil, side by side. To weep as you watch is not to fall prey to the director's manipulative imagery, but to acknowledge the abhorrent events of the time. You can watch it any way you want; my recommendation to take the fullest advantage of the magnificent craft employed by the director is to let yourself be placed right inside it as you watch, without fear or trepidation.

3 March 2010,Certainly a movie to judge for yourself.,"The critically acclaimed epic story of a Nazi (Neeson) who witnesses the atrocities bestowed upon Polish Jews during the brutal Nazi Reign. Ooh, Spielberg is so genius with his use of coloring and his pulls-no-punches portrayal of WWII! Just the type of film Hollywood loves to pat themselves on the back for and tell themselves that they're edgy and honest. However, the reality is, the use of symbolism in this film is so shallow, even a sixth grader can interpret its meaning. What's the point of symbolism if there's nothing to search for? It seems a bit redundant, because any meaning behind this film, aside from the ugliness the Jewish people endured during WWII and the sacrifices Schindler made, is there on the screen. There's nothing to search for. There's no ambiguity for each individual to take something personal away from it. The symbolism serves no purpose. Not to mention other Spielberg flaws; he underestimates his audience¬Ö as usual, and continues the story when its finished¬Ö as usual. Keep in mind when watching that not everything in this ""masterpiece"" is historically accurate. Ralph Fiennes chooses to play Amon G√∂th as a theatrical villain, rather than a three dimensional evil and twisted man. Christopher Waltz makes Fiennes look like an amateur as Hans Landa in ""Inglourious Basterds"". That's another thing, why is this in English? Is it so Hollywood doesn't have to read subtitles, while the rest of the world has to? Certainly a movie to judge for yourself.

11 April 2007,The best movie in filmhistory,"No doubt is this the best movie ever made. It's a unforgettable movie. It's a strong and demanding movie, but every second is pure art. It takes you three hours in history and hell. Liam Neeson is perfect as Oskar Schindler.Ralph Fiennes is amazing as the nazi-psycho Amon Goeth. He shows authority and is very frightening. Ben Kingsley is also great but his performance is in the shadow of Neeson's and Fiennes'.

This is the most dramatic movie ever, and is a movie that everybody should watch, either they want to or not. It's a important movie which reminds everyone on this tragic thing.

6 June 2004,A MUST for everyones lifetime,"This movies should be mandatory for high school and collage students. They could replace Greek mythology and teach real history. History they we should never forget. Schindler's List!!! The movie has a very powerful story. The facts are backed up with hours of interviews from the survivors. The pictures and story that cannot be put into words has made it to the screen for everyone to learn from. If you know someone that has not experienced this movie. Make sure they see it even if you have to rent it for them. Our family has watched it at least 8 times I never tire from it. Each time I learn something new. And now the box set is the Best with so many extras. Our school library's should keep this in all US school from JR>High on.

1 October 2013,"Steven Spielberg made a powerful testament to the suffering of the Jewish people during the Second World War, ""Schindler's List"".","It gave him the critical acclaim he wanted with seven Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director.

Shot in black and white, with the odd carefully chosen touches in colour, the horror of the holocaust is laid bare and speaks for itself. The documentary style allows Spielberg to deliver his message without preaching. The clever use of light and shade also makes it visually stunning. When Oskar Schindler visits a night club, he looks like a 1930s movie star as his cigarette smoke spirals above his head, his eyes hidden in the shade.

It is the story of German businessman Oskar Schindler which captivates right to the end. He is transformed from physically imposing, charismatic philanderer to the humbled man, wishing he had saved more lives.

We watch nervously as he tries to save over a thousand Jews from almost certain death in concentration camps by getting them to work in his factory. He bribes officials and befriends Nazis including evil camp commandant, Goeth, played brilliantly by Ralph Fiennes.

Spielberg has cleverly juxtaposed Goeth and Schindler as two sides of the same coin. They both love the finer things in life, easily swayed by money and women. Playing on this, Schindler tries to show his contemporary that power can be better served by sparing people's lives rather than taking them. It is an idea that Goeth acknowledges, but is destined not to adhere to for long.

The film finishes on a powerful note in present day with the real Schindler survivors and their descendants visiting his grave. It is the final reminder that this is a true story of one man's bravery and that in ""saving one life, you save the entire world"".",

2 January 2014,heart touching filim nice making,"after watching this felt like we were there in some corners in second world war.A very beautiful, epic and dark story about courage and the desire of living, a masterpiece made by Steven Spielberg this is one of those films which if you didn't like it, you have got no heart.Because this film touches us so deeply, the catharsis has a power that few -- if any -- other moments in film history can match. And that's what establishes this as a transcendent motion picture experience.The film's ending brings me to tears. At the end of the war, Schindler's Jews are in a strange land--stranded, but alive. A member of the liberating Russian forces asks them, ""Isn't a town over there?"" and they walk off toward the horizon. The next shot fades from black and white into color. At first we think it may be a continuation of the previous action, until we see that the men and women on the crest of the hill are dressed differently now. And then it strikes us, with the force of a blow: Those are Schindler's Jews. We are looking at the actual survivors and their children as they visit Oskar Schindler's grave. The movie began with a list of Jews being confined to the ghetto. It ends with a list of some who were saved. The list is an absolute good. The list is life. All around its margins lies the gulf.",9
8 November 2021,A true masterpiece,"I think this movie is as close to perfect as a movie could be. The film making tells one of the greatest stories ever. The cinematography is beautiful in the way it creates the dark, and tragic events of the holocaust.

This story is just incredible. The change that can happen in people is incredible. The selfless and willingness to sacrifice everything for others brings me to tears. To see this kinda compassion in such a horrific time and place, around so much evil gives me hope for humanity.

Everyone needs to see this film. Not only is it a great example of film making, but an important lesson we all need to learn, and to remember the tragedy of the holocaust.

19 January 2014,All about it,"Schindler's List is a 1993 American epic historical drama film directed and co-produced by Steven Spielberg and scripted by Steven Zaillian. It is based on the novel Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally, an Australian novelist. The film is based on the life of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Schutzstaffel (SS) officer Amon Goeth, and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern.

Ideas for a film about the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the Schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission to tell the story of Schindler. Spielberg became interested in the story when executive Sid Sheinberg sent him a book review of Schindler's Ark. Universal Studios bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself.

Principal photography took place in Krak√≥w, Poland, over the course of 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot the film in black and white and approached it like a documentary. Cinematographer Janusz Kami≈Ñski wanted to give the film a sense of timelessness. John Williams composed the score, and violinist Itzhak Perlman performs the film's main theme.

Schindler's List premiered on November 30, 1993, in Washington, D.C. and it was released on December 15, 1993, in the United States. Regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, it was also a box office success, earning $321.2 million worldwide on a $22 million budget ($35.6 million in 2014 dollars). It was the recipient of seven Academy Awards (out of twelve nominations), including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score, as well as numerous other awards (including seven BAFTAs and three Golden Globes). In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked the film 8th on its list of the 100 best American films of all time. The Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2004.",10

25 February 2005,it has so many things that it's impossible so summarize,"If at some time you remain without desire of continuing forward, or it seems to you that the life is complicated, simply take some popcorn many handkerchiefs and sit down in front of the television with this movie.

It is a unique experience in life that you will never be able to forget, the reaction that produces from the first scene up to the last still, leaves us without breath without aptitude to assimilate the human evilness, and certainly the kindness, the delivery, the passion, the commitment...

Later, close you eyes, breathe deeply and think that though for every person his problems, are the major ones of the world, the life itself encloses all the solutions, feel that it is possible to extract of the worst thing, the most horrifying thing, the best of every person and of every situation.

I hope that you enjoy this magnificent movie. A greeting.",10

26 May 2013,It's a perfect movie that one should certainly watch,"The movie revolves around the war period between Germany and Poland. The movie begins with how the Jews are homeless and forced to shift into ghetto. Meanwhile a young man named Schindler is in search for riches and fame. he hires Itzhak Stern as his accountant(who later becomes his Jewish eye), with an aim to start a business of 'pots and pans'.He hires the Jews for their cheap labor. With time, the atrocities and violence against the Jewish people keeps growing. Amon a brutal German general makes life a living hell for them. But Schindler is determined to help the perishing people. The movie is beautifully directed. On one side there is this monstrous war and on the other, the heart of a kind man, celebration and the hope of people.

18 May 2022,My Favourite Film Ever and one of the best movies ever made!,"Schindler's List really Surprised, Shocked and made me feel feelings I have never experienced before from a movie. It moved me and I felt a bit upset at myself for not knowing who Oskar Schindler was before this Movie Liam Neeson plays Schindler and he is Just Excellent, probably his best performance and the same as Ben Kingsley just amazing as Itzhak Stern and the actors who played the Schindler Jews are more then just background characters they have there own personalities because they are all based off of real people.

I was shocked to realise that the runtime was a total of 3 hours 15 minutes and 40 seconds because I didn't feel it at all that's how you know a movie is working on you if the runtime just went by your head like a breeze in the wind.

I just can't Praise this film enough and I'm really glad this film is being shown to kids in high school and Steven Spielberg has done a fantastic job as director for him to hold his emotions because he reportedly was having an bad time emotionally and even the composer John Williams broke down emotionally as well and also John Williams's Score just fantastic as always.

This has now become my favourite film Ever Made and is Very highly recommended to watch but I will warn you this is not a movie that you can have friends over and have a great time this is a film that needs to be taken seriously but well worth the watch.",9
3 January 2016,Simply an Awesome movie and a masterpiece..!,"Exceptional!! Schindler's list is perhaps the best and most heartbreaking depiction of the Holocaust ever, It's a dark and heart breaking tale of one man's journey to become a hero to the Jew's of today, Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler a greedy factory owner who hires Jew's to minimum wage work for him. Soon enough he has all the money in the world and is happy as can be. Or so it appears, as the film progress you see the demeanor and attitude of Schindler change dramatically when he watches the Jewish people get slaughtered like animals by the Nazi's, after that he sets his heart on the sole task if getting them out of the camps and into his country. Schindler's List is the proved example of human kindness and compassion, It's a movie that will make your heart break and make the spirit soar at his heroic feet. Schindler's List is one of the greatest films ever made and will continue to shock and amaze people for all time. I very highly recommend this movie!

Our class watched this in high school to prepare our characters for the Diary of Anne Frank. The film leaves you speechless. Breathe taking! Such a horrific story of fear and death. This bold narrative pulls at your emotions to reveal hope and compassion. Beautifully mastered. Honestly one of my all time favorites. I wish we could see more. I would love to work on a production as powerful as this one. John Williams' perfectly composed original musical score, compelling. Schindler's List is a film that everyone should see and appreciate to its fullest extent. Spielberg will remain an immortal filmmaker through the work he put into this film.

18 March 2006,Is The Holocaust really a suitable subject for a Hollywood movie?,"Back in the 1950s there was a shop near Brighton station that sold ""Surgical Rubberware"".Behind the murky plate-glass window lurked copies of ""The History of Torture"", ""The Kiss of the Whip"",""L'Erotisme au Cinema"" ""Health and Efficiency"" and,bizarrely ,next to a flyblown handwritten sign promising ""Trusses fitted here"",""The Scourge of the Swastika"". As a young man I could never work out why the clientele ,a cross section of grubby-mackintoshed bottom-feeders of all ages,would want to read what was presumably a serious study of Nazi atrocities written by a peer of the realm.Sadly,after a few years in the Met Police it became abundantly clear to me that a significant number of my fellow citizens had a prurient interest in Nazism and all its appalling consequences.This coincided with the reappearance of Sir Oswald Mosley and his reconstituted British Union of Fascists on the streets of the East End.Fortunately The Met dealt with these persons in a fairly uninhibited way,and one sunny Sunday morning in the summer of 1962,Mosley's rabble took a fearful hiding from a predominantly Jewish crowd in Ridley Road,Dalston,whilst we stood by admiringly.Among the crowd were many men with tattoos on the inside of their wrists:it was my introduction to the survivors of The Holocaust. Later they saw off Colin Jordan,the British Nazis' new Messiah in a bloody battle near Forest Gate station,and for the next ten years,the British Fascist movement went underground.It crawled back into the light,fuelled by ill-informed resentment against immigrant communities, and nowadays is busy at its evil work of setting the poor and vulnerable against the poor and vulnerable.Just when it was beginning to award itself a thin veneer of political respectability Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" was released and stopped it in its tracks. Generations to whom The Holocaust was as historic an event as The Battle of Hastings were confronted with horrific events that had occurred within their grandparents' lifetime. Central to the film is a towering performance from Mr Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler,but it is more than a showcase for virtuoso acting. It's a horrific reminder of a period in recent history when all the vilest parts of man's nature were allowed and even encouraged to flourish in a country less than two hours'flying time from London and don't let anybody kid you it couldn't happen again. However sober it might be I have a problem with ""Schindler's List"" inasmuch as my personal feeling is that The Holocaust is too horrific an event to be reduced to a ""Hollywood Movie"" status no matter how well intentioned.There are several harrowing documentairies on the subject which serve to instruct and inform. Turning it into a Big Time Movie with star names and marketing it as ""Entertainment"" risks rousing the interest of the same sick people who hung around the flyblown Brighton bookshop all those years ago and their appalling descendants.",7
18 February 2018,I love this film,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",9
27 August 2013,unforgettable movie,"just watched this beautiful masterpiece of Steven Spielberg again and as first time can't hold my emotions and tears ... the perfect story of humanity which is highly recommended to watch . If u have not seen this film yet I really envy you because its 3 hours of pure pleasure and excitement. This is kind of movie which makes u think about its problems next hours ,days and even weeks . No matter how materialistic u are , after seeing Shindler's list u realize that money is far not the most important thing in our life and that even one human saved is worth more than any treasure . I thinks its impossible to transmit all brightness of this film by writing or reading review ,so just go and watch this one!

24 December 1998,almost real,"I could not imagine somebody making movies in black and white in this very high-tech age.

But upon seeing the movie Schindler's List, in black and white, one could not distinguish the virtual from real. Spielberg has successfully made the film realistic.

Setting aside the theme (which is contrary to some political and social persuasion), the movie for me is a perfect 10!

7 May 2011,A top 10 movie of all time,"I first watched Schindler's List when I was in the eighth grade and I remember how my whole class, even the ""tough"" boys just cracked up. The movie made such an impact on all of us.

5 days ago, 5 years later, I saw the movie again and I felt the same way as last time. You can really feel the pain and the sadness throughout the whole movie.

I love that it's shoot in black and white(except from the little girl in the red jacket) it makes it a thousand times more realistic. Some people are disturbed by the fact that English is the main language in the movie, but for me it doesn't matter. The story it self is so breathtaking so you don't even have time to reflect that they are speaking English.

Summary: This is a movie everyone should see to really understand the Nazis impact and extermination of the Jews. You got to be prepared to be touched and moved. I still think about this movie every day. It's hard to forget. And I can not understand that there's people that tries to deny that it happened.",10
14 December 2015,One of the best movies of the past 30 years,"Heart wrenching, haunting, and beautifully mastered. This movie has passed all time tests and landed as a modern classic of cinema. It plays sublimely the life of Oskar Schindler. Furthermore, it presents the best acting of Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson. The music played by John Williams is without a doubt one of his best compositions. With violins from Iztak Perlman it is an impressive modern composition. The movie last considerably long. Yet the flow of the movie is intense and moves from action to action with all due moments of silence and quiet. This movie will haunt and enrage whilst at the same time drip in compassion and love. One of a kind.

3 October 2006,Excellent Movie,"Spilberg did a great job reacting the holocaust he made it seem so realistic it was in black and white but he made the main characters be in color like the little girl with the red dress the movie was so good i had to recommend it to all my family and friends. Th good part of the movie that is like the main parts is when Schindler lets some people go. After watching this movie you want to go back in time and help all the people that Hitler and schindler had killed. This was also a good educated movie to know what had happened to the people and yo cannot make fun because really it is sad also so you know what type of people the German people where back then

The atmosphere of the World War 2 and the whole dramatic and emotional situation is perfeclty portrayed, especially with the black and white filter through the whole thing, and with the perfect plot, acting and dialogues ""Schondler's List"" actually makes you realize how hard and tragic the story of the Jews in the World War 2 is. I absolutely adore the performance of the two main stars, Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson and even the other less important actors did a fantastic job. Simply the quality on it's highest.

The depth of the acting of all the actors involved is palpable, this movie meant as much to them, as it does to the audience.Truly heartbreaking, it moves you to tears. The very slight changes in strategy appearing with the main character are portrayed fantastically well. It is a masterpiece. Also, the score for this film is one of the most beautiful and melancholic . It has the power to transport you. This movie communicates with people's hearts, and that's exactly what it should do. Fantastic.

19 January 2022,The best movie I've ever seen,"The best movie I've ever seen about the oppression of the Jewish people during World War II. Spielberg's decision to make the film in black and white was excellent. Steven Spielberg is the greatest director who has made more than a dozen good films. But this particular film is the best, as it seems to me there is little that can compare with this film at all. The way all the pain and suffering that the Jewish people endured is conveyed to the viewer.

Let's move on to the story. The whole movie is set in Poland during World War II. The German businessman Oskar Schindler arrives in Krakow to set up a factory. With the help of his eloquence, Schindler quickly negotiates all the mishaps with the German military. Seeing the deplorable condition of the Jews, Oskar decides to invite them to his factory because they are willing to work for less. And so Schindler becomes richer and richer. His business becomes more and more profitable. The imprisonment of the Krakow Jews in a concentration camp is the beginning of Schindler's evolution. Oskar Schindler saved, during World War II, over 1200 Jews. Knowing that this is all based on real events, it makes you feel even more sorry for the Jews, who had to endure so much suffering and humiliation.

As for the cast, I was impressed by the acting of three actors at once. Liam Neeson, aka Oskar Schindler. Liam did a great job as Oskar. I did not like his character immediately. In the beginning, he was neutral about the appropriation of the Jews. But closer to the middle of the film, he realizes the complexity of the situation and realizes that he can save people's lives. And after that, he gives up almost all of his money to save as many people as he can. Ben Kingsley, aka Itzhaku Stern. Yitzhak was Oscar's accountant, and thanks to Yitzhak, so many lives were saved, both old people and children. Rafe Fiennes, aka Amon Goeth. This is one of my least favorite characters of all the movies I've seen, and there are over 2,000. Rafe did such a great job with his role as the villain. His character was hated by almost everyone when watching the movie, the way he is cruel to the Jews. It's just awful, all the things he did, I don't understand how a person is capable of acting like him.

The soundtrack in the film is gorgeous. I also want to highlight the strongest dialogues, which take you to heart. Steven has made a truly iconic film that is one of the best of his decade.



This is an excerpt from one of the last dialogues in the film, and it really gets to the heart, a special kudos to Liam Neeson for the wonderful acting, who gave it his all in every dialogue.

A great movie that runs for 3 hours, but that time passes unnoticed. For those of you who have been putting off seeing this movie, I suggest you watch this movie the first chance you get. I am sure you will enjoy it.

19 January 2022,I'll be check second,"Due to the abundance of domestic films about the Russian war, the viewer rarely thinks that foreigners also know how to make worthwhile films about sad technical events. Perhaps even 30 years after the release, Schindler's List will remain. I can't wait that many people start watching this film because of director Steven Spielberg, but watch it to the end for the sake of the story. In a good way, such a movie should be shown to teenagers at class hours dedicated to humanism and moral education. After all, insight can overtake even the state ""black"" soul, and this should always be strived for.

19 January 2022,Oscar Schindler,"The lead role of Liam Neeson (Oscar Schindler) is the best, of course. Played flawlessly. I would like to believe that he was not the only person who saved the Jews from death.

Some moments in the film are so memorable that it just breaks a tear:
a moment with a pretty girl with curls in a red coat;
the moment when teeth are dismantled for gold;
the moment when everyone is waiting for gas in the soul ...;
how children hide in the bottom of the toilet...
how mothers run after trucks with children;
terrible executions, often insane;


There were many more of these moments, but I remember these. This is a story and this film must be seen to know what it was, and how terrible it was and what these people experienced. How valuable life is and what it is worth ... immediately, your own life is assessed differently.",10
30 October 2006,Brilliantly Crafted,"Out of all the movies I've seen in my lifetime this is the best one I have come across.The black and white color gave the movie a sense of reality.It was as though i was back in the 1940's watching everything transpire. Steven Spielberg is a genius,he brought the harsh life the Jews had to face for several years during World War II.

Liam Neeson role as Oskar Schindler was heart warming,courageous,and executed with perfection.

Raplh Fiennes role as Goeth was pure magic!!,he provided a villain that will not be forgotten.

Loved the movie from start to finish.

15 February 2022,Very touching. We should never forget this part of history.,"I was very touched when I watched this movie. We should never forget this part of history.

It reminds me of a quote from the book, 'How The Specter of Communism Is Ruling Our World (2020)' by the Editorial Board of 'Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party' :

""The collapse of the communist regimes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe marked the end of a half-century-long Cold War between the capitalist and communist camps in the West and the East. At the time, many were optimistic, believing that communism had become a relic of the past.

The sad truth, however, is that a transmogrified communist ideology has taken hold and entrenched itself around the world. In China, North Korea, Cuba, and Vietnam, there are outright communist regimes; in Eastern European countries, communist ideology and customs still exert a significant influence; and in African and South American countries, socialism is practiced under the banner of democracy and republicanism. Then there are the nations of Western Europe and North America, which have become host to communist influences without people even realizing it.

Communism breeds war, famine, slaughter, and tyranny. These in themselves are terrifying enough, but the damage dealt by communism goes far beyond this. It has become increasingly clear that, unlike any other system in history, communism declares war on humanity itself - including human values and human dignity.""

This movie reminds people of the danger of communism.",10
31 May 2020,best,"The hero schindler's initial positioning is also quite boring, he must have been a businessman to make money from the war. But the human heart is good, he from the inner touch, to the later crazy transformation, all once again show his human kindness. In a sense, the film can be said to strike directly at the heart of the people, revealing the starting point of human nature and the meaning of life, and the hero in the film also successfully interpreted this point with practical actions, making a choice worthy of historical memory.

16 June 1999,"Very ""spielbergian"" movie - Steve at his usual...","Reading other comments I was surprised... Everybody calls it ""the best Holocaust movie (somethimes even the best movie) ever made. Well, I believed this statements. But when I watched the film to the end I understood that, let¬¥s be fair, that is Steven Spielberg, one of the most commercial directors of modern Hollywood, and everything he makes is considered to be brilliant - either it is ""Jurassic Park"", filled with plastic dinosaurs or black-and-white Holocaust film ""Schindler¬¥s List"", which is considered (I don¬¥t know, why) his masterpiese, and the best Holocaust movie ever made in HOLLYWOOD - remember that ""Schindler's List"" is a UNIVERSAL PICTURES AMBLIN ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTIONS. But ""Schindler's List"" is far not a masterpiece. It smells with Hollywood and has a happy end, oversentimental episoodes (In the end Schindler suddenly falls in tears and regrets he could not have saved more jews)... Although Spielberg in each interview keeps saying that he ""had to change his usual style"", but unfortunately he didn¬¥t succeed in this. By the way, the last five years Spielberg seems to be very interested in the tragic moments of every nation - maybe because it is a very politically correct and successful production. After ""Schindler's List"" he made ""Amistad"" a boring and spielbergian saga about black slaves. Then - ""Saving Private Ryan"", the movie, which topic ""touched"" Spielberg no more than the topic of ""Titanic"" touched James Cameron. No, Spielberg just wanted to tell us that he is still the greatest director in the world, and that he is still able to shoot patriotic and touching films about americans saving the world. No doubt we can expect him to do features about the sufferings Chinese, Russian or Serbian people in order to win more Oscars and earn more money. So, please, watch this movie more attentively and you will understand what am I talking about.",
20 February 2014,A movie everyone have to see before they die...,"I bet over here that no matter how hardcore a person can.....but you will cry at the end of this movie. 3 hours of Drama you can't even think of anything else while watching this master stroke by Stevem Spielberg...

Lism is like always ..no comments about the man...

At last you will find out many different side of a single human being in a very short life.

Ralph is still known for his one of the best performance throughout his life for this movie only.

Black and white screenplay gives a much better appearance to this amazing script.

24 February 2012,Humanity has no limits.... Phenomenal movie,"A close friend of mine had recommended this movie to me. For long I did not watch it thinking it was just another movie with a 'war' theme. When I eventually watched it, I was kicking myself that a movie buff like me took so long.

Schindler's list is based on the 'Holocaust' era where Jews were hated and brutally killed in Nazi regime. The movie begins with the relocation of Jews from the neighboring areas to Ghettos just after world war has commenced. In parallel, we see Oskar Schindler, a German businessman (and a womanizer) trying to cash in on opportunity to make profits. He hires an accountant Itzhak Stern and uses his skills to expand. During the course he also befriends SS Lieutenant Amon Goeth who is responsible for overseeing the Krakow Ghetto. During the course of Amon's governance we witness the brutal killings of Jews. Specially we get to see how the Nazis selected their Jewish work force (retaining skilled laborers and murdering old/unhealthy ones). This is the point where Schindler decides to splurge his fortune to save the Jews. The rest of the movie shows on how he goes about accomplishing this.

Performances are top notch. Liam Neeson as Schindler is natural and brilliant. The scene in the end where he makes a speech and eventually breaks down is touching. Amon Goeth as the ruthless Lieutenant is equally good. I was a little surprised that neither of them won an Academy for the efforts. The supporting cost is headed by the ever dependable Ben Kingsley.

Technically the movie scores on several grounds. Shooting the movie in B&W makes it chilling especially the scenes in Ghetto. Along with the (haunting) background score, some of the scenes stay in your mind forever.

Above all, the real star is the genius Steven Spielberg.

Towards the end of the movie, Ben Kingsley tells Schindler 'the pages with names is life'. That is what this movie is about. It is about Humanity and it has no boundaries.

***Whoever saves one life saves the world entire***",10
27 April 2011,This movie is my Roots,"Both of my entire families were killed by the Nazis. My mother who is now 88 years old is still alive. She saw her entire family murdered. This film is my roots. It shows just a taste of the reality that was the Holocaust. Mr. Spielberg applied his immense talents in this masterpiece and recognized his Jewish heritage, after establishing himself with other nice movies, but none of this importance. My mother was interviewed for the foundation he created after making this film. Her story has been documented along with many other in his Shoah project. This is a difficult movie for me to watch, but an essential one, for it is my heritage, my roots. I thank Mr. Spielberg for making it.

14 April 2017,Best American Holocaust movies,"The Holocaust is one of the most filmed events in world history, with films being made across the world. I have seen many excellent movies about the Third Reich made in Germany over the last 30 years which nail the feeling of fascism and make you feel a lot of emotions, but most American Third Reich films are really poor, try to make humor, or have ridiculous characters. Humor does not belong in a Holocaust movie. Schindler's List is the only American movie about the Third Reich I have ever seen which is at the same level as German films about the Third Reich. A must watch.

26 December 2017,Excellent Film,"The only reason people would give this movie a low review is because of their own discomfort for the subject. Whether its dislike for the people or to the simplest of movie violence. It was a 10 movie. You cant make a more cinematic film. Especially, on a most difficult subject matter. Where you have a 99% chance of failure. My blood only became U.S. citizens in 1946, that's after World War 2 and we were on the land since records can be kept. Only a pinch of us out of 100s of million only 500 years ago are left. Surreal I am a child of the idea of extermination.

23 December 2006,A masterpiece,"This movie could be the best one I've ever seen.Besides, it's my favourite.

Till this moment, I've watched it 5 times and still haven't got enough of it. It simply haunted my life. Since then I kept recommending it for everybody I know to see it and none of those who have seen it regretted buying or renting the DVD. They all admitted that it worths every penny.

Simply, it's a fable that teaches you valuable lessons in life. Once you've seen this movie and grasped its message your view to the concept of life and humanity will never be the same.

I've always heard and read about the horrors the Jews had experienced during the WW2 & about The Nazis' inhuman treatment and torture to them but I've never imagined the tragedy as this movie pictures it. It really cuts to the core of you and moves you. I cried and weeped for about half of the running time and for the rest I was utterly thrilled.

As a matter of fact, I believe that it's the peak of Steven Spielberg's work.

What firstly brought my attention to this movie is that it was ranked 9th in the American Film Institute list of the 100 greatest movies which made it the best movie in the 80s and 90s.

Now and after I've watched it, I think it should be ranked not less than 3rd (1st:Casablanca / 2nd:The Godfater).

Long story short, it's a must-see. And if you haven't watched it yet , then don't waste your money or time watching loads of silly romantic comedies of nowadays and start watching the classics.",10

22 June 2014,Schindler's List,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"".

It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",10
23 April 2007,"How this film has received so much praise, I may never know","""Schindler's List"" isn't by any means a bad film, but it's not particularly good either (a decent way of describing Spielberg's entire career). Some elements of the film are very good, even excellent, but it has issues that are too deep to be overcome, making it an overall mediocre work that certainly doesn't deserve the high praise it has gotten (much of which is because of Spielberg's treatment of the film itself--donating his salary to charity, having the film sent to high schools around the country, etc.).

The film's issues begin with its main character, who begins the film as a complex, interesting character who seems to possess a moral flexibility that would have been a great asset in such a changing society as his and then is reduced to a simple man with a conscience despite his surroundings. The transformation is unwelcome and not at all credible, since it seems to be precipitated by absolutely nothing (The holocaust has already begun around him, so that cannot be the precipitating event.) The change is made all the more ridiculous by the epilogue of Schindler's later life, which makes it clear that the first version of his character is more accurate. Liam Neeson performs very capably in the role, especially in the vastly more interesting opening scenes, but his performance is not enough to save such a ridiculous character arc.

There is also a terrible lack of focus in the film, as it spends such a large amount of time dealing with its villain, Amon Goeth, as to take away from Schindler's presence in the film. Goerth is also a more exciting character than the second Schindler and performed with such an incredible menace and dark intelligence by Ralph Feinnes that the viewer can easily long to see more of Goeth and less of Schindler, which is not a good thing for a film with such moral certainty.

Beyond these problems, there is the visual style of the film, which is a blatant rip-off of Alain Resnais's ""Night and Fog."" The black and white past with color present footage, intended to connect the past to the present, is clumsily done, as the subject of the holocaust's connection to the present is never once broached within the film. The colorization of the red swastika and girl's jacket also adds absolutely nothing to the film. It's pointless and smacks of Spielberg trying to prove his own depth.

However, ""Schindler's List"" does have its fine points. The film is still quite pretty to look at, including an incredibly beautiful, depressing image of Jewish graves as a Nazi road, and a number of other truly beautiful images that capture the sorrow of the Holocaust extraordinarily well. The acting is also truly excellent, highlighted by Ralph Feinnes in a tragically under-noticed turn as Amon Goerth. Finally, John Williams's score is hauntingly beautiful and has an understatement the film would have done well to mimic. These are cosmetic elements, perhaps, and they certainly don't make up for the film's major flaws, but they certainly improve the film from the train wreck it might otherwise have been.

Overall, ""Schindler's List"" is an overrated, average film. The performances and score are top-notch, but its message is not sent as vividly as it is by some other films about the same subject (most notably the aforementioned ""Night and Fog"") and its characterization of its protagonist leaves a lot to be desired. It's not a waste of time, but films such as ""Night and Fog,"" Sidney Lumet's ""The Pawnbroker,"" Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist,"" and Roberto Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful"" explore the Holocaust much more poignantly with far less fanfare.",5
16 August 2001,In Spielberg's defense...,"I don't see why people have to trash this movie. It's been called everything from ""boring"" (!) to ""ham-fisted and manipulative"". To be honest, I was too immersed in the story and the drama to care about Spielberg's techniques. The black and white didn't detract at all from the movie. In fact, many modern photographers choose to use black and white film because it brings out form, light and shadow. The red coat helped me recognize the little girl who otherwise would've been lost among all the other grey corpses. Schindler's List was no more manipulative than most other movies, certainly not for the ""loaded"" subject matter it was dealing with. The scene at the end with the survivors laying pebbles on the grave *was* unnecessary, but that's a pretty small fault for a three-hour-long movie.

To RipePeach: You said that Spielberg characterized Germans as just a bunch of self-interested, evil murderers. Since when was it required that all movies that deal with specific ethnic groups include a token ""good ambassador""? Would you rather have Speilberg bring the movie to a grinding halt in order to introduce a nice, pro-Semitic German character that had nothing to do with the story of Oskar Schindler? Read ""Hitler's Willing Executioners"" and face the facts. Most Germans during the Holocaust were anti-Semitic. While there was significant public outcry over the mistreatment and slaughter of Slavs and the retarded (I think the Nazis stopped the T-4 project as a result), very few people opposed the extermination of the Jews. They were hated almost universally. This isn't to single out Germans as uniquely vicious people, or to insult present-day Germans. Granted, had the long-standing social conditions been in place, the Holocaust could've happened anywhere, including my home country. But it happened in Germany in the 1940's, so deal with it. In short, Spielberg wasn't being prejudiced- he was just being honest.

To Edvard Nicholas: You didn't like the happy ending? This isn't fiction. Oskar Schindler was real and he saved the lives of more than a thousand Jews. Therefore, the happy ending was necessary. Why lie about the fate of the Schindler Jews and make the movie even more depressing?",
25 April 2014,Phenomenal Film,"Probably one of the best film ever made. Of course it's Steven Spielberg, but considering the actors portraying their characters most especially Liam Neeson as Oskar Shindler, he performed it excellently. The plot which happened in 1939 which started the World War II showed information to those who are not well versed with what really happened at that time.

As a 1980's baby, I never knew what life was with the Jews until I watched this film. It is more than an entertainment film for me. It is very informative and adds knowledge to the naive.

And I was very impress with the casting. the fact that Neeson auditioned for the film while we all know he's a good actor then and now.

Cinematography, wow I like the idea of Spielberg of making it documentary-like kind of film. He used black and white to make it feel like real documentary from the 1930's. It surely gave an edge of the film. Spielberg is a genius.

Overall, I love it.",9

The acting is just as fantastic, Liam neeson acting is superb as oskar schindler, The scene in this movie is very lifelike. A history was caught on screen! Since the Director was Steven spielberg. One of the best films ever, a must see. Flawless.

26 March 2007,Schindler's List,"I Like this movie because it explains what a true man is like. A man who will give up everything for others. At first I didn't know what the Holocaust wast or what it was like. So my dad decide to show me. As soon as I saw this film I cried so hard,I finally understood what it was like.I may not be a Jewish man ,but I know what it feels like. Hitler was a tyrant ,and thinking that it was there fault was wrong. Steven Spielberg point of view of showing us what Oskar Schindler really was the most brilliant idea.The cast he choose was brilliant. Liam Nelson was perfect for the role of Oskar Schindler ,and he should have won as Oscar for it.That is why I like the film. This is the best movie ever made.

21 January 2016,Steven Spielberg at his best,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",10
18 January 2016,Masterpiece,"An emotional and powerful masterpiece, shows great understanding of visual story telling, acting and subtle harmonic scores. Steven Spielberg's act is probably the best way to responded to such a story. A story that touching and that hard couldn't have been told and shown in any other beautiful way then through Liam Neesons's performance and Steven Spielberg's vision ( Of course without forgetting the crew and cast how helped in making this film). This film, this story is proved to show the result of artists and geniuses which worked together to tell the story of a man, Oskar Schindler who is probably the reasons why we are still here today!

20 September 2001,All I have to say is WOW!,"This movie has to be one of the most moving films I have ever seen. I have to admit that I was apprehensive about seeing it. I had heard that it was disturbing and very deep. I'm not much of a history person, but I would recommend this movie to anyone. Liam Neeson provides an unforgettable performance as Schindler. As you watch, you go through such a roller coaster of emotions. It is disturbing and graphic and I would not recommend that children under the age of 12 watch and even then with parental supervision. The end is the most touching part and I cried at Schindler's humble heroism. Great Film! Spielberg does it again!

11 January 2002,"good movie, but with problems","I enjoyed certain things about SL. The story is quite good. Technically, the movie is very good. The acting is fine.

But, seeing how this film stays near the top of the ""top 250"", I feel compelled to rain on the parade a bit. Forgive me if I use this forum to focus on what I *didn't* like about the movie:

The scene at the train station--remember? Where people were scrawling their names on their luggage, and loading it onto boxcars on another line, then the audience is let in on the fact that the system had no intention of reuniting them with their belongings?--set the tone for the representation of evil that was the holocaust. It appeared that the immensity of the tragedy would be conveyed in this movie by equally grand and hauntingly indirect scenarios like this. But then the movie settles into what I call the ""clean death"" of countless shots to the head. I'm not saying that they should have shown the knee deep typhus-dead in abandoned barracks, an actual gassing, etc., etc. But the power of that train station scene subsequently wasn't matched by what came after.

I also felt that the ""little girl in the pink coat"" was a victim ""for the rest of us""; a furtive hedging-of-the-bets which I have a funny, funny feeling might have been more-or-less foisted upon Spielburg by his producers. When we got tired of seeing Jews getting herded up and killed, the pink coat girl (who appeared to be a kind of goyim ""innocent bystander"") sort of ""freshened our palates."" And I think that's a poor substitute for more of the kind of effective and deeply moving stuff I alluded to above (the train station scene).

If you want your gut blown re the holocaust, watch Shoah.",
28 December 2015,Inspiring Movie,"This is such an inspiring movie, it makes me cry every time I watch it, would recommend to anyone who is interested in the past and learning about what had happened in Poland during the second world war. Yes it is in black and white but this just benefits the experience of the film more, it also includes death scenes some more disturbing than others,so be warned. Liam Nesson plays an extraordinary part in it too.

Schindler's List will always be Steven Spielberg's most finest, important film. It truly deserves the awards that it has received, including best picture and best director. The last scene is the most inspiring and is such an unforgettable scene. 9/10

13 June 2015,Superb acting by all cast and best directing by Spielberg; perhaps helped by the real Schidler's list survivors on-set helping with authenticity.,"This movie is made from a real story! The holocaust DID happen! NEVER FOGET.

Few films ever made get the distinct honor of being one of the best film ever made., and this is one. When I saw the film in a packed theatre in Burbank, CA, most everyone remained quite as the credits rolled at the end, but a few. When I composed myself enough to make it to the car, I balled and couldn't stop crying for some time.

I'm Jewish, but never knew much about my heritage and the holocaust. My grandfather escaped the Warsaw ghetto, but died shortly after I was born. My father, who was older than my mother, in part, grew up in a Japanese prison camp, and was stamped in Dutch, where he grew up. So when I saw all this come together and knew my relatives died in such horrible way, I realized what I lost and how I lost them, Regardless of heritage, this film must be seen by everyone so we can see man's horrific side. Sadly, I want to say so it will never happen gain, but it happening right now in North Korea. The tragedy continues.

Over all, this is an excellent film that teaches what can happen when hate mixes with power mixes with a country remaining silent!",10
15 December 2007,plzz everyone must watch it once,"Warning: My English is not that good.

I m a huge fan of Spielberg movies, but i avoided watching this and Saving Private Ryan for long. But now I say, this is the best movie I have ever watched.

The plot is known to all of us, I wont go into that. But watch it to feel the power of emotions. If u don't cry, u must be a dead person. For those who don't watch it thinking it will be boring, plzz give it a 30 mins try, i bet u will be hooked. So go and get the DVD now, otherwise u will be missing one of the greatest movie wondering what was in there.

29 October 2013,Definite must watch,"I watched this movie despite many years of avoiding it. I am still spellbound by this movie not only was it gut wrenchingly sad it was beautifully portrayed. Im glad I saw it it brings a whole new understanding to my grandfathers fight for freedom. I will forever refer to this movie as one of the greats. I feel it was a beautifully done film that will not only get you in the history books but make you realize that things that happen on the other side of the world shouldn't be ignored. I only hope this movie is still around when my children azre old enough to watch it so we don't forget those evil things that helped to shape our world as it is now. people should use this movie as an example of bullying, sadly thats what it was.

2 April 2003,A fundamentally dishonest movie,"Don't get me wrong, Shindler was a great man who did some amazing things in his efforts to save some Jews from certain death. I just wish Speilberg didn't feel the need to alter an already compelling story. For example, the at the end of the movie...Shindler left with a whole lot of money, which he could probably have used to save even more people, but elected not to. This should not in any way detract from what he did, but it, among other scenes, made the movie a fundamentally dishonest one.

18 April 2007,What a great movie!,"After seeing this movie I needed a few seconds to come back to the present. It's by far one of the best movies i have seen if not the very best! It illustrates very close to the truth everything that went on during the second world war to the Jew community in Poland. I, being a Jew my self, was deeply shaken by this movie. It's thanks to people like Schindler that i even exist. Mr. Spielberg did a fabulous job along with his crew. A great movie in the loving memory of the 6 million Jew lives taken during that horrible war... Although extremely shocking probably for most people, it is a fact of history, a horrible massacre, an awful regime and a sick mind behind it.

5 July 2020,Schindler's List,"In the film, Schindler doesn't start out as a hero. Why he ends up as a hero is not explained. Mr. Spielberg employs a small symbolic effect: the little girl in the red dress, whose conviction is reinforced every time Mr. Schindler looks at her. She symbolizes the innocent and fragile life, as well as the courage and power to defeat evil, and is the only color in the film.

24 June 2015,Powerful & Accurate to a Spine-Tingling Degree,"Schindler's List remains one of the most powerful movies that I have EVER seen. There isn't a 100% accurate-to-history track record when it come to some elements that may (or may not) help sell a movie. Schindler's List does is able to nearly eliminate this problem entirely, and the historical imagery along with no fear of exposing the truth make this an incredibly powerful film.

It's availability on Blu-Ray certainly ups the picture quality on the movie itself and provides additional tidbits to learn even more about the film. Schindler's List is also an obvious choice for anyone interested in checking out Hollywood's portrayal of such a brutal time.

Capable of bringing out our feelings; the movie shows in a very faithful way to where radicalism can lead a society and how fragile is our idea of safety. Moreover, the beautiful soundtrack combined with the black and white of the photography generates a very unique atmosphere.

I would strongly recommend these movie to everyone, because it is essential to us knowing the mistakes that have been done in the past to not committing again.

12 March 2008,Beautiful.,"Schindler's List is a masterpiece. No one but Steven Spielberg could so vividly and dramatically capture the essence of such a tragic time. While the film begins with an amusing and charming twist, Spielberg draws you into the reality of the events in a way that truly brings them to life. He strategically bases the film from the point of view of a man living a life of comfort and safety, not unlike that which we as Americans live and take for granted every day, and showing us the horror of the Jews' lives therein. To the point and yet very fluent, this film is sure to bring a tear to your eye, if it is given your full attention. The harsh reality of a seemingly forgotten past lingers still, and Steven Spielberg has brought the memory from the shadows.

5 November 2007,A masterpiece,"Without a doubt, one of Spieldberg's greatest movies. Breath taking & Mesmerizing. A work of art. It shows the nobility of a human being. In this film you will see compassion, mortality, discrimination etc... You will also see the power of one person. You will see that when one wishes to stop malevolence, that it is possible. You will leave with a sense of what Jews had to go through. The suffrage that this race had to encounter during this difficult times. What they (Jews) did in order to survive the termination of their race. You will have a glimpse of what Adolf Hitler tried to do the Jews. I sincerely recommend this movie. It's terrific.

24 February 2008,Schindler's list review,"A masterpiece. That is how I would describe Schindler's List in a few words. Schindler's List is based on the real life story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson). Of course when we think of a film based on a real life we usually think that it is just a ploy to gain people's attention, but this film really does bring real events back to us such as the horrors of the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz and the how people like Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) would indiscriminately kill men, women and children just because they are Jews. Steven Spielberg came at this film with the right respect and didn't even receive a salary to direct citing that it would be 'blood money'. He choose to make it as realistic as possible not leaving out a single crying child, a single drop of blood or a single horror anywhere. Many parts of this film are difficult to watch, but if they weren't then this film wouldn't be a masterpiece. Don't get me wrong though, this is not an action film but more of a thriller. To say that the music 'fits' into this film would be a crime. John Williams's scores don't fit the film but make the film. If you wanted to get an Oscar in a film you had made then all you would have to do is get Williams to do the music for you, it wouldn't matter how bad the film was his music would make it come to life. Also there is a mix of both diegetic and non-diegetic music like when the Krakow ghetto is being liquidated a sad monotonous Jewish song is being sang by children which is clearly non-diegetic as no singing could take place in the confusion and death of the ghetto and also shows what a horror the Nazis were committing. The music then stops for a while as the Nazis wait for the Jews in hiding to come out and as the shooting starts a piece of diegetic music also starts which is in total contradiction to what is happening as it is jolly and 'bouncy'. The piece of music is by Beethoven and is being played by a German soldier trying to escape the real world where all the death is happening. The direction is genius to say the least. This film shows just how good Spielberg can be when he wants to be. It creates a very dark subtle humour which messes with your emotions. Such as, going back to the liquidation scene, when the Nazis soldiers are searching for hidden Jews and they shine a light round the room and it reveals a cluster of them and they all raise their hands which brings a smile to your mouth until you realise in horror that those Jews would die and you had found it funny. He also builds expectations that make you think one thing is going to happen and then he makes another thing happen instead. An example of this is the day when Goeth tries to take Schindler's advice on power is when you have every right to kill but don't. The first thing that happens is that Goeth saddle is on the floor and you expect him to shot the guy looking after the horse but he doesn't. After he comes back from horse riding, the Jew who is supposed to be cleaning his bath reports that it couldn't be cleaned. Now you think he won't kill him because he's on a good day and at first the film goes along with that but then as the Jew is walking away a bullet hits the ground at his feet. This makes you think that he is going to kill him but then he misses again and you think he is just playing with him changing your emotions again, and the final bullet hits him in the back of the head killing him instantly. Fiennes plays Goeth beautifully here and in the rest of the film but in this particular scene he makes the warped personality come out extremely well in because Goeth had no reason to kill the Jew and had just 'pardoned' him and yet after he touches the mirror and his nail gets chipped which makes him kill the Jew. Spielberg also gets an excellent performance out of Liam Neeson portraying him as the bad guy in the beginning before bringing in Goeth who is a character so bad he makes anyone look good. This is Neeson's greatest performance by far. Spielberg also uses the popular genre of Neeson's characters as a mentor to great effect getting him to comfort the Jews with opaque realism and develop his own character into someone we can emphasize with and makes us think what we would do in the same situation. The script is an amazing piece of work. The plot doesn't lose a single second of interest in it's over 3 hour running time. This is a feat in itself but then it doesn't just keep your interest but holds itself in your memory forever. Whenever you see that it is being shown on TV you plan to watch it days before it's on and then make sure nothing will interrupt you in that entire time. Each time you watch it you find something you didn't notice before and you can never watch it to many times. The script paints the background of the Victoria Falls in a master piece and leaves the foreground for Spielberg to paint the butterfly. Perfection is not something that easily comes to humans and is something only really found in the night's sky, the largest rainforests and the deepest oceans. It eludes us like a frightened cat and speeds past us like a rocket. This film has not achieved perfection but as the spice train past by it grabbed a handful of perfect and is seasoned all over with it.",10
13 October 2012,Amazing piece of work...absolutely brilliant,"I had always heard this was a master piece but finally got a chance today to watch it. I am totally moved, shocked and over whelmed with tears in my eyes. An absolutely brilliant movie,and a definite must watch. Great job done by all the actors, especially the Jew and their kids. I was totally choked when I saw the holocaust scenes. I was saddened by the cruel acts, at the same time feeling happy for the ones who were a part of the Schindler's list. I would say, I am indebted to Spielberg for life, for having made a movie which shall remain in our hearts, minds and souls forever, continuously reminding us to do good, and there is never enough for doing good.

12 September 2014,Schindler's List,"The Film which's plot is Hitler's Germany exhibits very well the tortures on Jews. The film locks audience to screen which's plot is played by Oskar Schindler. Oskar Schindler who spends too much money and effort to become a rich business man succeeds. At these times hate for Jews grows. Jews exile from some districts. ƒ∞n a short time thousands of Jewish people were killed and thousands lose their homes and children. German officers took those children to educate them like Germans. Oskar Schindler was letting Jews to work in his factory. He was spending his power - who gained this power with his money from high degree people - to save Jews. At last Germans understands Oskar Schindler's workings for Jewish people and he has to escape from his country.

Watch this film and if you like these type of films I can suggest you The Pianist and La Vita e Bella.

1 December 2014,A must watch.,"Thoughtful, perfectly executed and respectful to the subject matter. Spielberg is directing from the heart here and delivers his most accomplished film. Schindlers List is punctuated by exceptional performances all round from an ensemble cast including career best performances from Neeson, Kingsley and Fiennes. The latter is on particularly fine form as the unremittingly evil Camp Commandant Amon Goeth. A powerfully important film - Spielberg's camera never flinches away from the horrors unfolding in front of our eyes. But it is never gratuitous. Polish Director of Photography Janusz Kaminski delivers beautiful and haunting black and white visuals which will stay with you long after the film is over.

The lives lost during that dark period of time or the people who fought. To save the oppressed at the risk of there own lives.

Schindler's List gives us insight into the terrible time of World War two, but gives us hope that people were fighting to end suffering from within the war machine.

The actors portraying the characters did an amazing job. Showing us the emotions surrounding this terrible time. I applaud the entire cast and crew for there heartfelt emotions that went into putting this movie out there for all of us to see.

Lost but never forgotten.

18 October 2019,General review of Spielberg's personal art film (4k disc release),"This is no doubt one of the most important movies of the last 30 years. It was an intense passion project of director steven spielberg. Based on true, horrible, horrible events in poland from WWII, we are taken through one man's journey from being a wartime profiteer to that of a compassionate saviour, rescuing many Jews from peril. Shot in glorious black and white film by dop janusz kaminski, the film tonality acts as a truthful portal into the brutal times of German nazi occupation and the goings on in the horrific work and death camps this is a film that proved that spielberg was and is a true masterful artist and auteur. The arthouse editing tells the story on a thread that also contains small bits of humor. ( One of the best scenes in the film and in perhaps modern cinema is the intro to character amon goethe). The violence is so brutal that you can subconsciously see red in the almost black blood. The 4k transfer, supervised by spielberg, is crisp, modern yet retains a theatrical film screening look and feel.

16 July 2008,Schindler's List is a Masterpiece,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"".

22 October 2013,Marvelously crafted - would be a big mistake not to see it!,"Awesome or superb or fantastic would be just so mere words for this movie, Schindler's List, directed and produced by Steven Spielberg and screenplay by Steven Zaillia. And Liam Neeson proves his worth with this movie. The different incidents of torturing the Jews and the change of Oscar Schindler from a greedy, profit-seeking businessman to a kind person in due course of time is what's shown in this movie. And specially the last part of the movie, when Oscar is given the letter and then the ring and then Itzhak Stern says ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire"" can make anyone have an outburst of tears. The whole movie, though a bit lengthy, proves more than worth watching. Just one of the very best movies ever made and will be seen and loved by true movie lovers in the future days to come.

12 December 2008,"""Whoever saves one Life, saves the World Entire ""","It really had a very deep effect on me. The value of Life I understood.

I had heard about this movie very long time and missed the opportunity to watch it a couple of times. So, I bought this movie and gave it a chance. As many have said in their comments, Schindler's List leaves you speechless. The history of mankind can't be re-produced better than this. Hats of to Spielberg. . . .

I have not heard about Oskar Schindler before this movie. So, from the beginning till the interval I was just thinking about a profit making business during the World War II period, and I was wondering what is so good about this movie to give it 7 Oscars. But, as usual I was totally wrong in my judgement. The ending was really touching. Liam Neeson did a wonderful job. ""I could have got more"" . . . scene, really brings the movie to its best.

The movie has become one of my favorite and very close to heart. This comment I am writing after watching the movie for 15th time.

I Thank Steven Spielberg for giving Hollywood such a wonderful cinema.

And I wish people would change their perspective about the value of a Human Life.",10

30 December 2014,The man who saved many,"When I was in grade 10 we gad to watch this in English class. I heard the name and thought it was going to be lame, I was wrong. Even though this movie is black and white it has character and heart. This movie is by far one of my favourite movies ever! It made me realize even though all the hate and suffering in the world there are good people who will do good things, the movie does not go away from the bad that happened, it wants you to know how bad it was for Jewish people. This is based on a real man back in WWII and I one day want to see his grave and pay my respects to an incredible man. If you have not seen this movie I would highly recommend it to anyone!

7 January 2015,War vs. Humanity,"This movie explains the most i.e. Humanity expects something in real sense. Only words or showing emotions are not enough. one has to give one,s 100% to save humanity. This is shown in this movie. How a person had given in a war situation. This is the example for peoples who thinks to prefer the War over and above anything in the World. The script, story , visuals, scenes are looking real and heart taking. This is the best movies ever I have seen in War category. Thanks all Actors, Producer and Director. Story of a real person who became unlikely humanitarian amid the barbaric Nazi reign and managed to save about 1100 Human from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp, it is a testament for the good in all of us.

2 May 2009,"Powerful, dark, and beautiful mixed in a pool of madness and hope.","Steven Spielberg is one of my favorite directors. His films are passionate, have adventure, style, and all of his films have a gifted story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. For example, films such as - Jaws, Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, Close Encounters of the Third Kind - they are all classics and everyone has just about seen them. And with such talents as his, Schindler's List is now my favorite movie. With so many graphic scenes and so much horror, Schindler's List moves you unlike any other film you have ever seen. For example, the scene where the kids think they are going somewhere fun, only to be walking to their deaths, scenes like that move you, and they are all throughout the film. It's visually stunning as in terms of the Holocaust and is one movie everyone must see to understand the true horrific nature of the Holocaust. The movie does not show Adolf Hitler one time, which kind of surprised me, but it does follow an unwealthy business man, Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who asks Jews to work for him during the depression in Germany. He treats them nice, because he does not know what is actually happening to the Jews. Once he sees numerous murders with his girlfriend on horseback, he hates the idea of it, but he claims there is nothing he can do. When he is convinced and he hears the ""worst"" cases of what happens to Jews that are in Concentration Camps, he makes it his mission to make a list and have them all work for him, so he can at least save some people. This movie is truly touching, including the scene where the kids are waving bye on the bus, and of course the shower scene where you think they are all going to die, that really surprised me and I nearly cried when they were about to die and then the showers turned on, and they realized where they really were. This movie is truly amazing, and it did win best picture for the Academy Awards, which I am pleased with. I am so satisfied with Spielberg's hard work with this film and his other successful films. Spielberg is truly a genius, and this film shows it.",10
13 July 2009,Consequential Choice,"Everyday people make selfish choices that impact the world around them. In rare cases, random acts of selfishness end up making a positive difference. Steven Spielberg's Oscar winning movie ""Schindler's List"" uses the true story of Oskar Schindler to exemplify just that. Brilliantly, Spielberg captures the human condition in a story which is sure to win our hearts, and make us reflect the impact simple choices make in the world.

Throughout the movie, Spielberg eloquently evokes the audience to ponder the costs of human life, and the questions that arise as a result. At exactly what point does money not matter anymore? How much suffering should people endure before enough is enough? And is it possible to overcome something as horrific as reducing the value of someone's life to the degree the Holocaust did?

Set in World War II, Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) opens a factory to cash in on the cheap slave labor of the Jewish people. Enlisting the help of a Jewish accountant, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), Schindler procures concentration camp prisoners to work for him in his factory, at little to no cost to his business. Stern begins to save his family and friends from the horrors of Nazi Concentration Camps because of Schindler's initial blindness by prospective money. As his work force rises, Schindler becomes extremely wealthy on the backs of his Jewish workers. Eventually, Schindler cannot ignore the horrors of the Holocaust, causing his cheap price of slave labor to no longer exceed the cost of Jewish lives. Thus, Schindler creates a list of prisoners to protect from the gas chambers, and convinces Nazi soldiers to keep those people alive. But is it too late?

Neeson's portrayal of Oskar Schindler could not be any better. Neeson strikes the perfect balance between his disinterest and profiteering at the beginning with his compassion and humility at the end. He engages the audience so effortlessly; it is as if we are looking into his mind. Neeson flawlessly exemplifies how simple choices can affect the world around us.",8
8 March 2015,Something to shake up your day!,"Over the last month I've experienced the wonders and marvels of IMDb top 250, but sometimes movies keep surprising me.

Sometimes real gems are hidden in plain sight, for I had heard numerous rumors about the movie, thinking it would be good but never felt the urge to really watch it myself and oh boy, was I wrong.

Seldom has a 3 hour long movie kept me interested from minute one till the very last second. Steven Spielberg pushes you from the first frames down a black and white roller-coaster of emotions, feeling joy at one turn, shedding tears at the next.

The story is a touching one, keeping close to reality, with no fluffy Hollywood magic in the mix. It shows laughter, pain, terror, joy, sadness and a lot of faces.

Every actor in this movie, from the smallest background player to Liam Neeson himself create such a strong atmosphere,close to the brilliancy of real film noir.

My recommendation, grab some popcorn, grab some drinks, get cozy and have a three hours well spent with charming and tear bringing picture, a real masterpiece.",9
18 August 2003,Spielberg's best masterpiece,"This movie is definitely my favorite one.

The movie

It is shot in a very realistic setting and makes the viewer believe that he/she is really co-existing in the movie. I am glad that it is shot in black/white instead of color. This adds a more dark and pessimistic tone, like it was in those days. However, there is one color added in the ghetto liquidation scene. The red coat of the little girl. This color adds to the sad situation the girl is in.

The story

The story is very unique and original: A German businessman is saving the lives of Jews. It is maybe not like it really happened. But without that background info the viewer still gets a realistic view of that period of time. The end of the movie is very sad when Schindler has to leave the Jews.

The music

John Williams made a fantastic soundtrack for this movie. I bought the soundtrack of course and enjoy listening to it. My favorite is the piano reprise.

I certainly recommend this movie to anyone who still hasn't seen it.",
14 February 2015,amazing movie,"I thought this movie was going to be slow and boring... instead I ended up giving it a 10 hands down! This movie had tons of emotion and each character did a phenomenal job. I would say it was a tad slow in the beginning but it's the only way they were able to create the story build up so I looked past that. No movie has ever really grabbed my heart like this one. The way it was produced allows you to grow with the characters and feel what they feel. I was also shocked when Liam Neeson was in this! I thought this was a really old movie and was positive it was a look-a-like or a relative but I was wrong! He is one of my favorite actors so it made the movie THAT much better. Overall a classic, excellent movie and a MUST SEE!!!

31 March 2015,A Tug At The Heart,"Spielberg has oft been criticised for sugary and formulaic Movies-this is no different except it's an offering for adults.

Yes,its overlong and boring in parts..in fact it doesn't come to life until the appearance of Mr Fiennes as the psychotic camp commandant.

But from then,its a superb film and the end scene breaks hearts and lives in your memory forever.

The haunting musical score,especially the lead tune played on the violin fits perfectly.

Watch this and forget authenticity,the real Schindler was nothing like Neeson's portrayal.

8 March 2008,Contains some errors of fact but Excellent film,"Based on the life of Notorious Nazi Party Manufacturer who uses Jewish slave labour in his factory in Krakow. Spielberg's visual accounts of the atrocities committed by Nazi's on the Jews is factual but restricted as most were too horrific to show the general public. It is a well known fact that the wealthy Jews bought their way into extended ""Freedom"" by paying big bribes to actually work in Schindler's factory rather than being shipped off to extermination camps. It is also debatable as to how long the 1100 Jews Oscar Schindler ""saved"" would have lasted as Jews were often worked as slaves until death after Hitler's ""Final Solution"" was declared.

There are more profound stories about German Officer's who turned against their own when witnessing the atrocities by their fellow Germans but the overwhelming fact remains that it is largest and most efficiently executed act of genocide in Human History committed by one Race over a particular race and religion. The Nazi's murdered six million Jews of the six and half million in Europe and of the 275,000 survivors 250,00 had died by 1970. This represented two thirds of all Jews in the world at the time.

A great classic of a film with excellent performances by Ben Kingsley, Liam Neeson and Larry Fiennes. It was a huge international box office success but didn't too well in Australia.",10
29 January 2003,The Greatest American Film Ever Made.,"This movie was made to win Best Picture, to deny it that would be blasphemy. Is it my favorite movie of all time? No it is not (only because this isn't the kind of film you watch every week to enjoy), but it is the greatest piece of film-making I have ever seen. Every human should see this film; they should know what transpired in the Holocaust, and they should reflect.

A masterpiece through and through.

1 November 2002,One of Spielberg's best,"I didn't expect much before I saw this film, but when I did, I was blown away by what I saw. Everything about this film was excellent. Based on the book Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally, this film succeeds in every area. The performances by the lead actors which include Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are top notch and as ever the directing by Steven Spielberg is wonderful. This has to be one of the best films Spielbreg has directed (and he has directed quite a few decent ones). What I thought worked very well on this film was using black and white. When Neeson's character was watching the little girl in the red dress (which was in colour), you could really tell that that was what he was focusing on. Now I'm not one who normally breaks down when watching a movie but I was close when watching this. The horror and cruelty that those Jews had to undertake was unbelievable. I have to say Spielberg is a genius when it comes to directing films. Before this film in the very same year he released Jurassic Park, another brilliant film and all the rewards he took home in 1993 he deserved.

2 July 2013,best movie must watch,""" I....pardon you.""

These words spoken by Amon Goethe (Ralph Fiennes) during the film can be aptly used to signify the themes of this film: power and forgiveness.

I am part of the post war generation who has been lucky enough not to experience any major war. And after watching this film, I have deep respect and feelings for those who suffered during these times, be it the Holocaust or the Nam war. This film was just waiting to be made and I'm glad it was the right man who dared to take up the challenge. Any other person would not have done it justice.

The film focuses on how a German named Oskar Schindler saved the lives of thousands of Jews by employing them to work in his factory during WWII. However, I feel the film's primary aim is not to show us Schindler's kindness but the horrors of war. There are some of the most true and graphic scenes here ever captured on celluloid. People being shot for no particular reason, hiding in fear, stripped and gased, abused......so much so that viewers watching it for the 1st time will be deeply affected. We have never got to see this ""flip side"" of the war in many Hollywood productions which only focuses on action and their unrealistic ""gung-ho"" heroes. ( Another excellent film would be ""Saving Pte Ryan"" by Spielberg again ) War and its horrors are finally and faithfully recreated for the audience.

Like the film Raging Bull, its shot beautifully in black and white to reflect the era and tone of the film. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are excellent, esp the latter for his frightening portrayal of Amon Goethe. The scene where they discuss about power is a classic and the subsequent one where Amon 'pardons' a young jew remains as one of my many favs!

awesome movie must watch available in Hindi",10
21 July 2013,Great Film,"Absolutely Great film. Very moving and definitely a must see. Shot in black and white, with the odd carefully chosen touches in colour, the horror of the holocaust is laid bare and speaks for itself. The documentary style allows Spielberg to deliver his message without preaching. The clever use of light and shade also makes it visually stunning. When Oskar Schindler visits a night club, he looks like a 1930s movie star as his cigarette smoke spirals above his head, his eyes hidden in the shade.

It is the story of German businessman Oskar Schindler which captivates right to the end. He is transformed from physically imposing, charismatic philanderer to the humbled man, wishing he had saved more lives.

You watch nervously as he tries to save over a thousand Jews from almost certain death in concentration camps by getting them to work in his factory. He bribes officials and befriends Nazis including evil camp commandant, Goeth, played brilliantly by Ralph Fiennes.

Spielberg has cleverly juxtaposed Goeth and Schindler as two sides of the same coin. They both love the finer things in life, easily swayed by money and women. Playing on this, Schindler tries to show his contemporary that power can be better served by sparing people's lives rather than taking them. It is an idea that Goeth acknowledges, but is destined not to adhere to for long.

The film finishes on a powerful note in present day with the real Schindler survivors and their descendants visiting his grave. It is the final reminder that this is a true story of one man's bravery and that in ""saving one life, you save the entire world"".",8

6 June 2014,One of the best historical films,"Schindler's List (1993) is one of Spielberg's most creative, and dramatic films ever, and one of the most powerful films ever released. Everyone should watch it and experience the historical true event. Whoever has not seen this film is definitely missing out.

Liam Neeson fit the leading role perfectly, making the film entirely believable. You truly experience the darkness, and the light in this moment of persecution in our history. There are very few films this good about Jewish persecution. Another must watch film similar to this one is the The Pianist (2002).

Another reason to watch this film is because history repeats itself. Persecution is still happening today.

28 July 2013,people change for the better,"A great movie but really sad at the same time encouraging you to know the worst that man can do, man himself can change.

The story of a German who was stripping his entire fortune to help people who were very different to that, but showing that people can change.

And leaving the phrase known worldwide and for eternity; HE WHO SAVES A LIFE, SAVES THE WORLD.

Maybe in my opinion, the saddest and dramatic in all that you see, is the part where Oscar Schindler sees a little girl in pink dress after hiding for her dead in the pile of corpses that the Nazis are gathering, that really part of the heart to anyone.

11 November 2015,One of Film's Greatest Masterpieces,"This film is for anyone who says that Steven Spielberg's fame is mostly hype. This journey of emotionally charged storytelling is a cinematic masterpiece that has moved many audiences around the world. The acting is absolutely fantastic with a real dynamic that moves the audience in a way that is simply profound. An already emotional point in history, World War II is portrayed in a unique light from a very different perspective. I honestly do not believe that the film would have been as profound if they had chosen a different, more orthodox, subject in WWII to focus on. It isn't just the story or the concept that makes this movie so amazing; it's the way the story is told.This is why Steven Spielberg is so lauded. Schindler's list is definitely a masterpiece that shows how films have the potential to be one of the greatest art forms ever conceived by man.

9 September 2013,Exceptional and heart wrenching. They're are no words to describe how poignant this film is,"Well its the first time i've ever watched this movie and it was worth the wait! My review based on the fact that its a true story, then the movie is very sad and an emotional story that is depicted brilliantly through Spielburgs fantastic direction and through Neesons and Fiennes fantastic performances, also everyone that acted in this movie were brilliant! This movie displays a very moving, inspirational and touching story of the horrors the Jews had to go through during the war and shows the wondering and truly amazing individuals quest to trying to save as many Jews as possible. You watch this movie and you won't control yourself enough to not start crying.

Spielburg did a fantastic job of this movie and so thoroughly deserving of the 10 nominations and 7 awards that this movie received! I loved the way it was in black and white and that near the beginning of the movie your introduced; or Spielberg draws your attention to one little girl in particular who is wearing a red coat the only colour within the movie, i guess its a way of making you ore aware of that little girl so that through the movie your wondering what happened to her which you do find out! A truly lovely movie.my god what a phenomenal film.",10
12 February 2014,Mindblowing,"I just watched this movie recently, after postponing it for years and years. 3 1/2 hours or so just seemed to daunting.

I am glad I did finally watch it with my roommate. We both thought it was the best film by Steven Spielberg by far and easily one of the best movies ever made.

All the performances were top notch and it tells an important part of our history which many people do not even know about. It is brutal, it shows people getting executed, huge piles of bodies being burnt and much much more. It made me as well as my roommate tear up several times and it became harder and harder to hold the tears back as we both would have sobbed without being able to stop.

The end is also very emotional when Liam Neeson's character, Schindler, realizes he could have saved many more lives if he had not spent so much of his money. The film ends with the actual survivors visiting Oskar Schindler's grave and paying tribute to his unforgettable achievements once again.

Unfortunately I can only give this masterpiece only 10 out of 10 points. There are not enough stars to give to this movie.",10
2 November 2015,A movie you don't forget easily,"Hello everybody ! I'm going to write about a film called "" La liste de Schindler "" and I advise you to watch this deeply moving film! It's a real story about the genocide of the Jews. This documentary is interesting and easy to understand for people who don't know a lot about the second world war. Furthermore , actors are stunning. The leading role is played by Liam Neeson ( one of my favourite actors after Tom hanks ). I think it's not easy to act this role for him because it's such a bad and sad story but he really succeed it. This movie is for me a life lesson to remember... You have to watch it if you don't already have done it. See you soon !

Perhaps Steven Spielberg's ultimate work, it is a cinema lesson - it shows the horror and humanity behind the holocaust, rarely falling into the slushy and illuminating (in black and white) a story that should shame every human being. Indispensable.

23 September 2013,Excellent! Re-watch value is enormous!,"This is an amazing movie! It shows the hardship of the Jewish people during the holocaust. The movie shows the real brutality of the Nazi leaders and soldiers. Being in black and white it adds emotion to the movie. No one better than Liam Neeson could have acted the part of Oskar Schindler! Schindler's list is such a good movie I could easily watch it over and over. The only downside is it would have been interesting to see the movie in color but I do understand the reason why the movie is what it is. If you have not watched this movie and you are reading this review, you must watch it right away! This is also a good movie that would be good to show to teenagers in high school, to educate them about the holocaust.

5 December 2014,Schindler's List,"Schindler's List is a 1993 American epic historical drama film directed and co-produced by Steven Spielberg and scripted by Steven Zaillian. It is based on the novel Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally, an Australian novelist. The film is based on the life of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Schutzstaffel (SS) officer Amon Goeth, and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern.

Ideas for a film about the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the Schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission to tell the story of Schindler. Spielberg became interested in the story when executive Sid Sheinberg sent him a book review of Schindler's Ark. Universal Studios bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself.

Principal photography took place in Krak√≥w, Poland, over the course of 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot the film in black and white and approached it as a documentary. Cinematographer Janusz Kami≈Ñski wanted to give the film a sense of timelessness. John Williams composed the score, and violinist Itzhak Perlman performs the film's main theme.

Schindler's List premiered on November 30, 1993, in Washington, D.C. and it was released on December 15, 1993, in the United States. Often listed among the greatest films ever made,[4][5][6] it was also a box office success, earning $321.2 million worldwide on a $22 million budget. It was the recipient of seven Academy Awards (out of twelve nominations), including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score, as well as numerous other awards (including seven BAFTAs and three Golden Globes). In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked the film 8th on its list of the 100 best American films of all time. The Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2004.",9

29 December 2015,Cult Movie,"You should definitely give this movie a go. Plot based on a true story, on the eponymous book written by Thomas K. The movie is ""dynamic"". Every moment is a rough true; every moment is magical in its way. Spielberg's decision to do black and white movie caused mixed reactions. To me personally, it is a good choice. That is an effect which takes viewers into the time and the plot of the movie. This movie definitely goes to my ""Top 200"" list. I repeat, definitely watch this movie. It has a lot of cultural weight.

Thank you for taking the time to read my review! I'm new at this, so don't be too rough on me. I'm looking forward to another review!

1 August 2003,One one of the greatest recent movie masterpieces.,"My all time favorite movie, one of Spielberg's finest. A masterpiece. This is a movie about a little known hero who saved thousands of Jews during the Holocaust by letting them go to work in his factory. The movie starts with a small color scene with a Jewish family chanting in Hebrew, and the rest of the movie is in black and white. Liam Neeson plays the main character, Oskar Schindler. He does quite well for such a dramatic role. The story is meaningful and touching, and of course based on real events, which gives it an amount of depth that other movies just can't equal. The sheer seriousness of the movie leaves many who see the movie slightly altered. You cannot watch this movie without it changing your life, in at least some way, however small a way it may be. Winner of the 1993 Best Picture Academy Award, and it really, really deserves it.

6 April 2003,The Importance of this Special Film In Relation to History,"I would like to make my feelings known for the first time ever on the internet about one of my favorite films. I do not think that Schindler's List is the greatest film of all time (although I am absolutely delighted that it is rated at #4 on the IMDb list and was #9 on the AFI list of the greatest films ever in the last century) but it is certainly one of the top three greatest war films of all time. It was more than poetic justice that Steven Spielberg was finally vindicated when he was named as the Best Director of 1993 and this film the very best of that year. What made it special for me personally (since I am an Anglophile) was that the top four acting roles went to Brits: Liam Neeson as Oscar Schindler; Ralph Fiennes as Goeth; Ben Kingsley as Stern; and Caroline Goodall as Emilie Schindler. The fact that it was filmed in black and white with stunningly effective cinematography enhanced the film's uniqueness although it was obviously an Oscar bid by Spielberg, who had agonized over whether to have the project helmed by Roman Polanski before he himself took on the burden. (How ironic that only recently Polanski was justly honored for his great work for directing The Pianist, which I think is the best film since Titanic). I can understand why there is a continual debate about the significance of this film, but it cannot be denied that it is a necessary work of art and a very valuable history lesson, particularly now that we are once again a nation at war with anti-Semitic totalitarianism. I support anyone's right to free speech, but I am truly appalled that many Americans want to deny that there was even a Holocaust, or wish to forget what happened in the past, and find personal satisfaction in condemning this movie as overrated or mere Jewish propaganda to downplay any other horrific crimes committed by other nations in times of war throughout history. I was not at all surprised when Titanic became such a huge hit (the biggest in fact since Gone With The Wind) that even schoolchildren began doing book reports on the subject and the entire movie-going planet seemed to erupt in Titanicmania. Common sense will tell anyone willing to take the time to think about it that the Holocaust was the Titanic at least five thousand times over, and to be honest, I would rather drown in freezing ocean water two miles deep in the dead of night than face death in the gas chambers of Auschwitz. I still think it was ridiculous that James Cameron asked for a moment of silence for the victims of history's most celebrated shipwreck at the end of his Oscar acceptance speech, when Steven Spielberg merely (and politely) asked that the nation's schoolteachers ""please teach this in your schools"" when he was so honored for making a film about the most ghastly crimes of the millennium. There is a huge difference between escapist entertainment and serious enlightenment when it comes to movie making. Just ask Steven Spielberg, who has also directed some of the biggest blockbusters ever made. His heart's desire is clearly the driving force behind all of his films; Schindler's List most of all.",9
25 April 2017,"Deep, true, moving. As any film should always be.","This classical drama is one of my favorites for one reason. Sometimes there is a great script and bad directing. Sometimes the cast is fantastic, but story is weak. And sometimes every element in movie making is amazing and yet the film comes out and deserves 3 out of 10. Why? Its a mystery. No one can possibly answer that, including Mr. Spielberg, who's best movie is Schinlder's list. And if we don't teach our kids history and about mistakes made by Allies not stopping Nazis when they just started to exist, and about horrible crimes during the most viscous war of all times, history may happen again. My only suggestion to this movie makers would be: may be Red army depicted in a form of a drunk Cossack on a horse at the very end of the movie announcing to remaining concentration camp prisoners that they are ""free now"" should have been different from what you showed. After all 9 out of 10 Nazi soldiers were killed by that same Red army. And Soviets broke German armies spinal cord loosing 27 million soldiers and civilians. May be they deserve a better looking character.

14 September 2003,"See it for the plot, stay for the Fiennes [SPOILERS]","This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",10
3 September 2003,Second Splash of color.,"Myself and my wife have started to go through the top 250 and watch everything that we haven't seen. She had never seen Schindler's List before and I have watched it many times. It surprises me that even ten years later this masterpiece still moves me the way it does.

I was just reading some of the other comments and many of them are mistaken. They are saying that other than the opening scene there is only the one piece of color (the red coat of the little girl). This is not true. There is a second scene. Very near the end of the movie in the Schindler reminds the Rabi about the Sabbath, the very next scene there is a small group of people celebrating the Sabbath, they light 2 candles, the flame of the candles are in color as well. It's very subtle but it's there. This splash of color is as important as the little girl. I can only assume that this is the first time in a very long time that they were allowed to express their beliefs and the flame is a symbol of the light in there lives and the new hope that they were given.

I just wanted to bring this little fact to light. It's a scene with great significance and it shouldn't be over looked.",
27 October 2013,Beautiful and moving,"I love Steven Spielberg's films in general and, personally, I think that ""Schindler's list"" is maybe one of his best!

In my opinion, it is one of the most beautiful and moving films over the Second World War. The fact that the story is true makes it even more gripping. As it was filmed in black and white, the authenticity is built up. Moreover, Liam Neeson, who is one of my favorite actors and who, I think, is very talented, express the ambiguity of the character very well.

So, although it is a very sad movie, I really advice to watch it to everyone who didn't do it yet.

21 December 1998,Masterpiece,"I guess I was lucky in that I knew nothing about the movie before I first saw it (an accident too involved to explain here!). I was therefore not affected by the usual ""Speilberg masterpiece"" hyperbole that seemed to attach itself to any review. Subsequent viewings have however confirmed that this is in fact a Masterpiece in the truest sense of the word.Take out the ""quirky"" black & white photography, which I actually found to be a bit of a wank, (the jews and nazis experienced this all in real colour not in mono in a sterile cinema), the feel and strength of the photography made me weep... I was there, I was a victim. That probably sounds very pretentious from a white, middle class, Catholic Australian, but if a movie can move me the way this did, it must have something going for it. I have seen this movie 4 times now and although the shock value has been diminished somewhat, the message remains... ignorance is deadly! His best work by far.. including the very, very over-rated ""pseudo horror"" flick Saving Private Ryan.

10 July 2003,A tear-jerking reality film,"Ever since I found out about the persecution of Jews by Hitler, I have felt very strongly about the Holocaust and when I discovered we were going to be watching Schindler's List in my History class (I am in Year 9), I thought it would be very interesting. It was, and all the way through, it felt so real; I know it is a true story, but it doesn't automatically make it seem real; but this film was almost too real; how can people have ever done this? I actually cried at a lot of points, and this is because the film is so well made; Steven Spielburg has excelled himself. You see this film almost as though you were one of the Jews that Schindler saved.

This is one of the best films I have ever seen; and it really touched me; I recommend it to anyone.

26 January 2001,One of the best movies ever made!,"Watching this movie is just three hours of full excitement. I personally have seen it several times and I am sure I will enjoy it again. Especially Ralph Fiennes did an excellent job playing the role of Amon G√∂th. It certainly was not easy to play this psychopath. I also like the fact that this movie crosses out, that they were also ""good"" Germans during the Nazi time. All what Oskar Schindler did at the very beginning was for his very own benefit. So it is quite amazing how he turned to be such a caring and helpful person. And the part of Itzhak Stern is also just great! First he played along with Schindler's plan because this brought him to the position to help his fellow people. He did not like Schindler at all, he even refused to have a drink with him. But step by step he realized how Schindler's character really was. And near the end, when Schindler offered to have a drink with him at the end of the war, he preferred to have one straight away. In my opinion watching this movie is just a MUST!!

12 December 2011,Moving film about human life and how less it is valued,"Firstly, it must be said that Ralph Fiennes is absolutely stunning as the ruthless and cruel Goeth; it is without doubt the finest performance by an actor that I have ever seen. How he did not win an Oscar for this film is beyond me and probably beyond others.

Liam Neeson also delivers a great performance as a man who lives only for wealth and money but then changes slowly into a man of principle who begins to feel empathy and sadness towards the Jews after witnessing their persecution.

This film depicts the atrocities of man and how it considers power to outweigh the sanctity of life. Only after watching this film will one realise that suffering and destruction are a reflection of reality; how men committed unspeakable acts on behalf of their superiors and how those same men were then led to fight for a purpose which was non- existent. It must be emphasised that this will never change.

11 October 2006,"A very powerful, authentic film, but like all successful films, has its flaws.","Schindler's List has been hailed as Steven Spielberg's best ever film, and is #6 on IMDb's top 250. It won loads of awards, including seven Academy Awards. Despite the fact that it is not quite an epic with its relatively low budget, it justifies its existence with great acting, directing, a very well-written script, rich characters, and authenticity that no other film has yet equalled. But unfortunately, it is marred with a slow pace, some pointless scenes, extremely unnecessary sex scenes and nudity and the lack of any real originality in the acting. No acting awards were won, but the most memorable performance was hammered home by Ralph Fiennes, who played Amon Goeth. His real villainy and spite made the film even colder. This film not only hammered home the true horrors of Nazi regime, it also shows that there are good people in even the most villainous clans, and those good people end up being remembered for what they did.

This is not a gory action flick like ""Saving Private Ryan"" - there are only a few shootings in the whole three hours. But there is lots of blood when there is a death, and the complete unfairness of the killings make this film even more shocking and powerful. But the main problem of this film is that none of the characters really change. Goeth does learn a lesson from Schindler, who gives some wise words, but he is still a Nazi through and through. Schindler does get some inspiration on and off, but he never really deteriorates, and Liam Neeson really does not own the role 100%. The last minutes of black and white are reminiscent of many Western films (you see my point - man rides into a village on horseback to liberate people, a huge crowd of people come over the horizon of a desert), and John Williams' score is not used enough. However, Mr. Williams actually put some care and thought into his music, unlike in the Jurassic Park score of the same year, which was just full-on Hollywood ham. On the whole, all of the characters in Schindler's List do deliver good performances, unlike ""Aeon Flux"" in which every character was flat and dull.

To mouth off about Schindler's List is wrong - there is nothing duff about this film, and every second comes from the heart. Though it isn't gripping, it will fascinate, and will take you back 60 years with ease. However, it is not quite perfect, and perhaps a teensy bit overrated. I may need to watch it again. But on the whole, Schindler's List engaged, and worked perfectly as a film. However, I am still more with ""Saving Private Ryan"" as Spielberg's best war film. But may I make this clear - this is the most authentic film ever made, and must be seen. A stunning job! 9/10",9

21 October 2007,A daily comment from Midget Emma: Schindler's List (1993),"A movie that everyone must see.

This movie had me thinking about it for a long time after it was finished. You can't help but feel for the Jews and the way they were treated just makes you feel sick.

Every actor in this movie done a great job. There is lots of violence in this movie that shocks and sickens most and believe me they don't hold back. This movie tells the story of Oskar Schindler, a German who see's what is happening to the Jews and try's to save them. Spielberg done a very good job. This movie is like a history lesson.

I recommend it to every person on the planet.

8 March 2004,One of My Favorite Movies,"I am a history major specializing in World War II history; particularly the Holocaust. I have never been more moved by a movie before. The events that occur throughout the movie is very authentic and I'm going to give Spielberg another nod for making such a masterpiece. I am absolutely elated that it is now out on DVD. I am quite positive that I will someday use this movie to supplement teaching my own classes someday. Oskar Schindler was an amazing man, and I feel that Spielberg chose the right man in Liam Neeson to play the part. Liam Neeson delivers a crucial intensity to the role, and draws the viewer into his world. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone regardless of how depressing the subject matter is. It is a must-see, so go out and watch it!

21 December 2018,Graphic and touching Drama about Schindler's role during the Holocaust,"This is a black and white movie which takes you back in time to old eastern Germany (now Poland) 1941 onwards.

Most scenes look very real since the props and clothes were exceptionally well chosen and the actual locations are shown. Executions look really descriptive.

Liam Neeson as Schindler, I am unsteady if he was THE perfect choice, but I can support the decision since both are about 6'4"" tall plus Neeson is charmable and a great character actor. I don't have any doubts about choices made for the rest of the cast. Every remaining role fits 100% perfectly well.

You can argue about the accuracy of some smaller events in this movie since it is based on a fictional novel which is based on the actual history, but it's certain, the movie makes you want to know more about the happenings and as a story of it's own it makes sense and has great value.

I always kind of dodged watching the movie, I thought I'd know what would happen and it would be a very dry movie, but now I feel more educated about the time and I feel emotionally more touched.",9

26 July 2020,The Least Enjoyable Masterpiece of All Time,"Schindler's List has a narrative that centers around the Holocaust and Oskar Schindler's story. This Movie is more haunting than any slasher horror movie for many reasons. For one, the music is somber and builds up utter hopelessness or dread, depending on what fits the scene. The Second reason is that this has a real world basis and there are millions of people who actually died in our world, only a fraction of the horror can be shown through a movie, but there's no film that does it better. The third reason is that there is nothing special about the villains of this movie, they were real people with no special gifts, they just had their rage controlled by a Mad Man who directed their rage to kill millions of people through war and genocide. The Nazis are normal people, which fills you with much more dread than anything else. Schindler's List is an absolute masterpiece but I can only recommend someone watches this once, I hated watching this movie.

It has the same issue as ""Apocalypse Now"", it is too damn long. In the middle, I simply had to give up. However, a few hours later I decided to finish it and, of course, I was amazed. Movies that can nail you to the screen without even blinking for over three hours are extremely rare, and this one, same as ""Apocalypse"", is not one of them. Because it is stretched too much and only because of that, I cannot give it more than 8/10. If it stayed under two hours it could be pure 10/10.

The film is timeless.

25 November 2018,Film Liquet on Schindler's List,"Let me start off by saying that Schindler's List is a very heavy film to watch. It is not meant for everyone and not every member of the audience will able to appreciate it. The gut-wrenching, horrifying scenes that represent the real events happening during the Second World War in Krakow, Poland, are hard to watch. The film being three hours long, tests your patience and ability to put up with the inhumane events on screen. The film is about a businessman Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), who arrives in Krakow in 1930, ready to make his fortune from the new World War. After joining the Nazi party for political immunity, he re-opens an old factory, using Jewish workers, as they are cheaper than any other person at the time. When the SS begins exterminating Jewish people in the ghetto, Schindler tries to save his workers, in order to protect the operation of his factory and what starts as a selfish reason becomes a noble cause to save innocent lives. The film is in black and white, however the opening sequence for some reason is in colour. The film's events are very realistically shown, up to the point where it becomes infuriating and sickening to watch the tragedy unfold. The human emotion portrayed by the actors is too believable, it physically brings you to the place of the events and shows us the horror that the Jewish people experienced during the horrific events. This is the sole focus of the film.",9
25 August 2005,Brilliant!,"I just saw the film for the very first time today (25/8-05) and i regret that i have never seen it before. This is one of the most brilliant films i have ever seen, it shows true emotions from the actors (Who plays awesome). Schindler's List has just been added to my personal top 10 list! If you have not seen this, DO IT! Schindler is a person i would have liked to know! He saved all these people but still he wanted to save more. A pure heart of gold!! I love this film, it gives a good glint of how awful i must have been to be a Jew in that war, god rest the souls of every single one of them! A thing i don't get though, is how the Germans could lie about killing all of these people.

13 September 2004,A true masterpiece,"When I first saw this movie, I was only a 8 years old boy I knew i was something special but I didn't quite understand it since I was only a kid.Later I saw the movie and i realized that Schindler's List was true masterpiece.

The movie is touching and beautiful, the direction is fantastic (Steven Spielberg is movie wizard) the acting is great.I specially admire Ralph Fiennes role.Ben Kingsley also very good.

Many people don't like black and white pictures and I'm not a big fan either but it gives a sense of realism impossible to capture in color movies.This is of course a movie that will survive the test of time and shows in very realistic what the Holocaust was.

Spielberg has surprised us with movies like Saving Private Ryan and Jurassic Park, but I think he will never make a movie so brilliant as this one.

31 May 2007,One of the greats..,"""Schindler's List"" (1994)

Schindler's List is an Academy Award, Golden Globe, BAFTA and Grammy winning 1993 movie based on the book Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally. Adapted by Steven Zaillian and directed by Steven Spielberg, it relates the tale of Oskar Schindler, a Sudeten-German Catholic businessman who was instrumental in saving the lives of over one thousand Polish Jews during the Holocaust. The title refers to a list of the names of 1,100 Jews whom Schindler hired to work in his factory and kept from being sent to concentration camps, and falling victim to Nazi officer Amon G√∂th, a sociopath who perceives Jews as ''vermin''.

Whilst Steven Spielberg's breathtakingly superb masterwork Schindler's List contains a vast amount of stunning shots, the one that sticks in my mind the most is found about half the way through the picture, an image of Amon G√∂th and Oskar Schindler sitting atop a balcony over G√∂th's concentration camp. The shot captures the most prolific of contrasts contained in the film. Firstly, a man so sadistic we instinctively see him as a human embodiment of 'evil'. Then on the other side of the frame is a man caught between two extremes, gradually discovering who he is and the power of the individual. Usually of course, we don't have such roles, just simply 'the good' and 'the bad'. Although this is not this case here, as we are given characters built up imaginatively and yet realistically and as a result remain incredibly deep and complex personas throughout. The majestic depiction of power in this image is so significant that the viewer can sense the stench of sovereignty coming off these people- but the mastery of the two men differ drastically. We have one who relishes in the rewards of his immorality and the scale of his power and influence. And then we have our protagonist, if you can call him that at this point in the film, at war with his own conscience, giving us the centrepiece and motivation for one of the most exquisitely told tales in the history of cinema. A superb piece, which presents massacres as real events, not figures, and portrays a complete moral transition subtly and believably, as opposed to clich√© smiles and corny montages.

Schindler's List works primarily on obvious aspects; it's ability to capture the Holocaust on a grand, monumental scale, it's glorious character study and it's staggering cinematography. But this you all know, or can decipher within your first viewing. This isn't to say these traits aren't spectacular, but we find several examples of greatness, such as the passionate directorial effort, the historical accuracy, the career-highlighting performances, the light- hearted comedic moments, the Schindler/Stern relationship and the film's emotionally stirring closing sequence, to name a few. At one point we are shown the interior of a Krak√≥w church, which artistically transcends beauty- and yet, within seconds, we are shown the shady deals of crooks and hustlers in the rows of seats below, contrasting wonderfully. Another example is present in a a foggy shot of the Jewish ghettos, a visually stunning image, contrasted immediately by gunshots and killings. It is as if the literal contradictions mirror Schindler's moral conflict.

Schindler's character is, in a sense, the centre and heart of the movie. He is an example of good will, hope and ultimately help in a helpless situation. Despite this, Schindler is a womaniser, a gambler, greedy and out for himself- he isn't a leader, an idol or a superhero. He is a businessman. Midway through, a spot of colour is dashed onto the pallet, as a young girl sports a red coat, standing out immaculately over the black and white background. Does this mark Schindler's change of heart, his transcend to goodness, his epiphany? Of course not, such an occurrence wouldn't generate a total change of belief so suddenly. The image marks a realisation Schindler has about the horrors going on around him, perhaps even tapping into his conscience, but it is much later in the film that he actually acts on this in total selflessness. The motivation behind Schindler's decision is gradual, he is not a hero, nor does he wish to glorify his position as a saviour. He just truly wishes to help people, something portrayed in total realism, making it even more heart-warming. Such a pure character development creates not just a good film, but a powerful example of cinematic brilliance.

The film is shown on an epic scale, and admirably remains intimate and touching simultaneously. It is beautiful yet harrowing, heart-warming yet heart-wrenching, inspiring yet dismaying and all the way through displaying excellence. Schindler's List is undoubtedly a contemporary classic, and rightly so. It's ability to take us into the heart of darkness and capture the essence of hope is simply breathtaking. Whether granting lives or taking them away, brilliance is present in every shot. 10/10",10

14 December 2021,Could have been better,"You certainly can't say that this is a bad film. It is simply too well crafted for that, most of the actors are excellently cast and Spielberg is too clever a fox to miss the chance to present a hot Oscar contender here in overlength, to get away from the image of the eternal big kid and to present a serious topic in an appropriately serious manner. First of all, I don't ask myself who this Oskar Schindler really was, because a film is a film and not a documentary. For me, Liam Neeson doesn't really manage to give this character more than one or two dimensions, his closing monologue is almost embarrassing and unpleasant, because next to such greats as Ralph Fiennes or Ben Kingsley, who both do an excellent job here, Neeson takes a bath. Why was he cast is the first question I asked myself in the first hour of the film. The second question came right after that and was confirmed throughout the film. Why is the world so consistently and at the same time superficially divided into two camps in ""Schindler's List""? Here the sadistic Germans, portrayed in relentless consistency as maniacs and desperate by Ralph Fiennes, then there the Jews, all lovable people, clearly, without exception. Schindler's List is not a pedagogical film, why doesn't Spielberg allow us to see the dark sides as well as the bright spots on both sides? Schindler is a kind of border crosser, but Neeson is unable to credibly transform the cynical businessman into a philanthropist. Add to that the length of the film, which got on my nerves a bit, because constant headshots and pseudo-documentary long scenes don't give me any more information than that I find the Nazis and their actions completely repugnant anyway. One shot is enough for that, I don't need 100. And the final sequence with a crying Schindler is just embarrassing for me. Nevertheless, I scored 7 full points, because I really can't complain about the craftsmanship here. A tighter and bolder script might have worked wonders.",7

This movie was a ""start"" for me to watching WW2 movies that i can. And IMDb helps me a lot to find this movies and get information about it. The vote-score tells everything, i wish more movies to ""get out"" like this and i love movies from Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson was a very god choice for actor in this movie. I recommmending to watch other movies from Steven Spielberg. And for end, like i said early, 10/10 excellent movie and acting.

3 December 2019,Their thought blocked,"1. If you first heard that a movie going to be shown for World War II , Holocaust , genocide of Jews in Europe, you may not give it a highest priority list for you popular films and that may not attract many of the audience specially the younger generation but Schindler's List and the name Steven Speilberg , who himself , have a great brand value surely will attract a lot of them and the way the film is being made , the way of story telling , will get you into the story and grow an interest within yourself to know more about it , the Holocaust, the Nazi, the German tortures , occupation of Poland, tremendous harsh reality faced by Polish Jews. A 3 hour plus film , but we may not able to get yourself out of the story. Story of an unsuccessful Businessman , Schindler , who moved to Poland for using the War as an opportunity to do business with Nazi Govt. but somehow it turns into a situation where , he used this as a tool to save Jews, who was working for his factory ,was not in the massacre list due to their capability of producing products for German Army. And when Schindler realizes that it can save a Jews life , he start recruiting as much jews as possible to save them from Nazi atrocity. For that he even bribed German Generals and put his life and reputation also in risk on the eye of Nazi Govt. Those 1100 Jews were the survivors at the end of the war. WE can see in the film , when a Soviet Army soilder , met them , the survivors, then the Chief Accountant of Schindler , who was an integral part of his business asked that soldier that if there still any Jews alive in Poland ? That also depicts how important was the work of Schindler was to save those 1100 jews , who can be easily another direct war victim of the Holocaust. 2. A strong German character who was the chief of a military team , also helped us to understand the psychological state of that time German Soldiers and the Jews who worked under them. A maid was working under that general but she was always afraid about what to say, as there is also no set of rules for a Jew to know what to do best them, as the level of their hatred was so deep that a Jew maid also have no answer to any question, no answer was enough to answer the Germans. Their thought blocked , they become victim of immense hatred produced by Nazi Govt. and racism that made them blind. The conversation between the Schindler and that maid depicted clearly that thought differences almost accurately.",10
7 October 2004,respect,"i would like to make a comment on the last review. it's true that this movie has some kind of fiction. every movie has more or less fiction in it. but the SS definitely did the terrible things as shown in this movie. besides that i think it's a bit of no respect to the survivors of the holocaust and the camps to say that the movie is a comedy. i don't know if you've ever been to europe and visited one of those camps but it takes you're breath away. it's awful. My review on this movie is that it shows the holocaust in a way that everybody who sees it feels like being in one of those camps. i really think this movie is on of the greatest of all time, not the best but it shows to broad public the horror of World War 2.

5 February 2019,Focused on the wrong things,"This is a film that is made by a filmmaker at the height of his powers. The dramatization of the Holocaust is some of the most intense footage ever made. In so far as the end goal was to get the viewer to experience even a small part of horrors European Jews experienced the film succeeds wonderfully.

But the film's focus is critically off in two ways. Schindler's story of moving from an amoral capitalist to a humanitarian saver is compelling but it is not what the Holocaust was. It was genocide, murder and pointless brutality. There's no good reason to tell Schindler's story as the central point. It was and is an anomaly. This problem is really brought home with the fake out sequence in the Auschwitz showers/gas chamber. Most people who entered that space were murdered. It is almost as if Spielberg cannot bring himself to display the actual horrors of genocide directly. To tell only the story of Schindler's List is fundamentally misleading.

Second, I don't understand why Stern isn't the protagonist or why Schindler is. To frame the Holocaust through the eyes of a German gentile is gross. Schindler, for all his goodness, was not the target of the genocide. Moreover, certain beats in Schindler's story trivialize the Holocaust if treated as the focal point. The famous sequence of the young girl in the red coat is the moment Schindler changes. It is when he first sees the humanity of Jewish people. But that isn't what matters. What matters is the mass murder that is occurring. If the film made Stern the protagonist this problem would be greatly lessened.

This is a film with messed up priorities.",6
17 July 2001,Schmaltzy,"No knock on the story just the story telling. You hear John Williams cue up and might as well prep that hanky. I really wish Spielberg would maintain his distance from ""deep"" subject matter. Popular yes, but no auteur is he.

25 July 2006,An unbelievable journey into the world's darkest nightmares,"The haunting complexity of this evident masterpiece can only have been so brilliantly delivered by a true master of cinema. Spielberg hurls the audience to a time of horror throughout the world, but who is terrorized to the highest degree is Jewish population of Germany. Fiennes' performance was nothing short of genius and was more than qualified for an Oscar. Through this work of cinematic art I have seen what I believe is the motion picture masterpiece not only of the 1990's but of the late 20th century. I still to this day continued my conquest to discover a man more devoted to ideal so powerful and so monumental as Spielberg.

5 August 2004,"""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire""","Those words, mean everything. This film, is Spielberg at the top of his game. I remember seeing it, and was completely floored. I have never cried at a movie, but I came close with this one. I don't think it is close to a war doc. But more of just one of the truest movies ever made. They didn't edit out death, they let people know, this is what happened, this is mankind at it's worst. The directing, the acting, the cinematography, the music, and everything puts this film at the top. It's hard to think it was made in 1993, because AFI's top 100 movies, put this at 9. Now important movies, are the ones who broke barriers, and ones other films follow. This was made in the 90's, and it is still that important. Steven Spielberg showed everyone, (including the Oscars) why he is one of the greatest directors of all time. I watch this movie a lot, but not just for the story. If you watch this movie from a different aspect (writing, directing, acting, etc.) every time, you wont get bored. Because each aspect can blow you away. Definitely one of the greatest films EVER made.

20 April 1999,By no means perfect,"This grandiose opus Spielberg directed to cement his name as a ""serious"" filmmaker, stands in a very dubious position : its very subject is so sacred and untouchable to the civilized world (including film critics), that questioning the film's integrity as of late has been almost equated to denying the Holocaust itself. The truth, however is bitter: ""Schindler's List"" is far from perfect. Spielberg, previously known for his family-oriented, gawking adventure yarns that usually were as far away from tangible reality as possible, indeed has surprised everyone with the heartwrenching brutality of the Jewish victims' suffering, which he vividly depicts. The most powerful scenes in the film work on a purely instinctive level: they're silent and do not involve familiar individuals, they play almost like some perversely voyeuristic yet priceless footage of Nazi atrocities. The wisely chosen, eloquent black and white cinematography is a definite highlight. Everything else, for the most part, has Spielberg at his old game: he was always best at spectacle, and worst at character development. A dozen or so Jews are singled out as ""types"", and are traced throughout the film. In over three hours, we learn absolutely nothing about them, they're merely sheep to be saved by Schindler. The man himself is provided with almost no real explanation for his change from an opportunistic slaveowner to a righteous saint-like figure. In the last ten minutes, he simply steps out of character and lapses into a stagy farewell; seductively tearjerking, but completely out of place in a movie that aspires to an authentic representation of the Holocaust. The only character that even begins to approach three-dimensionality is the local Nazi henchman , (Ralph Fineness), one of the most interesting portrayals of a villain in recent cinema. Despite its considerable problems, ""Schinler's list"" is still widely used to introduce the new, unsophisticated audience to the mid-twentieth century horrors: whether or not is should be, remains open to debate.",8
22 May 2005,A true Account,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

The only thing that I can not understand is why this film is not at number 1 on the IMDb chart of ""250 greatest films"". Not only was this film monumental in many ways, this film was the first that I have ever seen that has been life-altering on my perspective of the horrors of the Holocaust. If you have not seen this film, see it, now. Steven Spielberg could have made ""Battlefield Earth"" and I still would have had a great amount of respect for him.

6 January 2017,"A moving, sensitive classic","A moving, timeless classic that has been so sensitively done for the real victims of the war. A brilliant cast that is led by Liam Neeson. This was the first film I saw him in and he grabbed my attention immensely. I couldn't possibly think of anyone else who could play his role. The film takes you on a roller-coaster of emotion and despite being a long film, I found myself to be totally absorbed and invested in it from start to finish. I found that I that I really started to care about the characters and the poignant decision o the director to keep the little girl in colour is so powerful and heart breaking. I highly recommend this film as a real insight in to the horrors of this war and the hell people had to go through just to survive for their religion.

20 August 2006,"A Movie To Cherish, For Ever","I could'not have better chosen to watch this movie at this time, at such a global scenario. Schindler's List will be a movie that will unshakably remain on my list of most favorite movies, of all time. It makes the viewer think so much deeply about the horrors of Holocaust and the poignant symbolism associated with almost every frame makes you sob silently. It reminds you that for every Adolf Hitler, Osama bin Laden, George W. Bush and Idi Amin, there was Oskar Schindler, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King and Mother Teresa. I loved this amazing movie because the sooner people realize the futility of war and murder, the sooner we can make this world a better place to live in. It is painful to see people fighting and killing each other for land, oil, votes and power. Finally, I would say that Mr. Spielberg and his talented team deserve all the adulation they have received for their excellence.

12 July 2020,"Thank you Leopold ""Poldek"" Pfefferberg, Thomas Keneally, Steven Spielberg, and Schindler; earned those 7/11 Oscars but deserved 10/11 Oscars honestly; amazing","Pfefferberg: ""Schindler gave me my life, and I tried to give him immortality.""

It's on Netflix right now, so I thought why not watch this amazing movie, again, for the 3rd time.

Oskar Schindler - the antihero who became a hero.

Leopold ""Poldek"" Pfefferberg - found and convinced the writer and the filmmaker.

Thomas Keneally - the writer who told Schindler's story.

Steven Spielberg - the filmmaker who made the movie.

This movie should have also won best actor, best supporting actor, best costume design, and best makeup/hairstyling. Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes did a fine job as the main characters.

This movie transports you to the holocaust for 3 hours and 8 minutes and it is simply a nearly-perfect film that I will definitely be re-watching over and over in the future. It is that good of a movie.

The idea of filming this movie in black and white is just brilliant! and, of course, the colour details all across the movie to focus the public attention, is just one of the small things that makes Steven Spielberg one of the most remarkable directors of all the 7th art history. I must disagree of those who voted The godfather as the best movie ever... and the lord of the ring: the return of the king the 3rd best! Its a great movie, i agree! But better than these, better than Casablanca, better than one flew over cuckoo's nest, better than silence of the lambs? just to name a few. Schindler's list should be the number one, that, for me is clear!

21 January 2001,Poignant and captivating,"Schindler's List deals with the horror of the Holocaust and the kindhearted Schindler who helps the Jews by ironically forced labor. After the liberation of the Jews, Schindler is considered a war criminal because he profited from using forced labor. The movie is deeply compelling and for the most time of the movie, I always found myself at loss for words.

The movie is very graphic and it helps people to visualize the brutality and cruelty of the Third Reich. Slowly but surely, the National Socialist, simply called, the Nazis worked their way up. Winning the trust and loyalty of the Jews in neighborhoods then, betraying all the good things that the Jews have done to them.

In the movie and from history, the Aryan race, the pure whites, is considered to be superior to everyone else. In truth, there is no superior race that exists and if there is it is only the human race. The group where we all belong, a group like no other.

4 February 2005,Perfect,"What a movie?I always taught that my favorite movie will forever be THE GODFATHER I guess i was mistaken.When I began seeing the movie i said to myself that this is going to be another World War II same old movie but after two ours I was amazed by the realism and by the way Spielberg puts his mark on the dramatic side of this masterpiece.After I saw the movie i could not sleep all night thinking at those people who suffered and I realised that not even a documentary with real facts ca present a more realistic story than Schindler s List did.The actors played their role in the most extraordinary and superb way possible. Liam Nesson revealed the commercial character of Schindler with and amazing attraction towards the role itself.Ralph Fiennes played the mad SS little boy,destroyed by the German doctrine and without any knowledge of kindness and love.The way he was shooting those people reminds me of a little child playing with toys. Ben Kingsley interpreted the workaholic man, skillful and well trained as an accounten Stern represents the image of victory.Ambition and determination all mixed to provide us with a character powerful and independent even in that awful period.And let s not forget the genius behind all, the mastermind of this unforgettable masterpiece Steven Spielberg,only him and him only can provide us with such an stunning movie .All and all put together without any further comments Schindler s List remains the only movie that i could never critique because its simply PERFECT",10
7 June 2018,The Accidental Hero Playboy,"No one argues about the ingenuity of Steven Spielberg , if you first saw this film in the 90s, it is guaranteed you probably left the cinema in tears. It is brilliantly dramatized and shot , the actors shine , no doubt. However , some months later I read a lengthy article from Schindler's widow contradicting the veracity of Spielberg's film version of the events and then Spielberg even being interviewed admitting that he felt ashamed not having done more research hence my changed perspective about the film. As to what extent can we stretch the viewer's imagination to elicit empathy considering that this is a reboot of a film released ten years earlier. Ben Kingsley can take any role with his versatility so his underacting as the accountant deserves more accolade. Ralph Fiennes as the brutal officer is theatrical and Liam Neeson pulls off a surprise as Schindler.

27 February 2014,An Amazing view on a good man in the evil ranks,"This film is an amazing representation of what Shindler did for a small percentage of the Jewish population. Some would not like this film due to the fact that it is black and white for the majority of the film. There is one point where there is colour among the black, white and grey which is a very heart wrenching scene (im not going to spoil it). Although sometimes it seems that the film drags on it makes a statement that will never be forgotten and will possibly make you love one Nazi who tried to do the best for the hunted. Even though this film is 20 years old it still remains my favourite even though I did watch it in 9th grade and it almost seems much to graphic for that age but I am very glad that I did watch it. This is a very amazing film that should be watched by everyone.

7 March 2014,Wow,"Steven Spielberg has made his own Holocaust museum. In Schindler's List (Universal), an adaptation by Steven Zaillian of Thomas Keneally's book, Spielberg has created a 184-minute account of the fate of Krak√≥w's Jews under the German occupation, centered on the German businessman and bon vivant, Oskar Schindler, who devised a ruse to save 1,100 Jews from the Auschwitz ovens. A closing note tells us that in Poland today there are fewer than 4,000 Jews but in the world there are 6,000 ""Schindler Jews,"" survivors and descendants.

For this film Spielberg has done the best directing of his career. Much of his previous work has been clever and some of it better than that, but Schindler's List is masterly. He has, with appropriate restraint, shot it in black and white (except for two closing sequences in color). Janusz Kaminski's superb cinematography uses shadows like prosody‚Äî illuminates with shadows. Michael Kahn has edited with intensity and line, never breathless, always fast. (One demurral: the inter cutting between a Jewish wedding in a camp, a wild German officers' party and a German officer's boudoir romp is heavy.) John Williams has arranged a score, with Itzhak Perlman doing violin solos, that for the most part is quiet: Jewish melodies on woodwinds or a small children's chorus under scenes of inhumanity.

25 May 2008,the Holocaust in three conveniant acts,"I know that the IMDb rating is 8.8, that this film won academy award for best picture (which means very little), that it was one of the earliest features to take an in depth, insider look at the Holocaust, that this film is nearly critic-proof because of its sensitive subject matter, but, if you take a look at who directed it and how the film comes across, wouldn't a person feel just a little offended?

1. Steven Spielberg made no attempt at separating his ""serious"", ""grown up"" film from this ""entertainments."" The Nazis in 'Schindler's List' are like the Nazis in the Indiana Jones movies

2. For such a harrowing subject, he uses some fantastic showmanship. The cinematography is a wonder, a joy to look at. There's even a tantalizing nipple shot, seriously, in a movie that's supposed to seriously look at the Holocaust?

3. The cruel joke/ thriller element to the old man who is nearly executed but is saved by the sheer chance that a gun jams twice! The scene had the same potential to keep an audience on its seat as say, an actual thriller!

4. The overly simplistic view of the Nazis as completely evil. This one I can understand. I wouldn't expect any Jewish person to even attempt to see Nazis as nothing more than aberrations of humanity.

5. An incredibly manipulative collection of closing scenes; first the ""I could have done more"" speech that Schindler gives as he's inundated by those he saved is tailor made for emotional assault, as he's praised like a strangely Christ-like figure.

6. Final shot of the actual Schindler Jews paying tribute to his grave. What about the other six million?

7. And finally, the worst of the worst - the girl in the red coat. In order to fully grasp that the Holocaust is bad, really bad - because otherwise Jews and gentile alike would not be able to grasp this - he displays a girl in a washed out red coat and then shows her red coat on a cart of dead bodies. If that isn't cheap, exploitation, then honestly tell me what is.

In the end the movie is typically well made - excellent cinematography, seamless editing, strong acting, entertainingly fast paced - in other words a Hollywood movie. Should that be the definitive way to represent the Hollocaust?",4

7 March 2014,A movie you must have seen.,"Schindlers list is without question the most impressive movie i've ever seen. It shows a realistic and harsh reality of WWII and is based on a true story, what makes it even more impressive.

I think that every human being should see this film. I couldn't watch it without crying more than once and it will occupy your thoughts for days.

The way the movie is filmed is fantastic and the actors really know how to capture very complex emotions. The movie feels real and sucks you into the story. It isn't boring for a moment. One of the best movies i've ever seen!

What would I do? Would I save people or just get my money and disappear? I HATE BLACK AND WHITE MOVIES (for this reason alone I have never watched any of Charlie Chaplin's movies), but I completely forgot that movie was not in color from the first minute. Liam Nissan was great and 3 hours went by fast.

23 August 2014,Spielberg's Greatest Work,"What can be said other than that one word...powerful.

Stephen Spielberg has done what others have tried before, but failed. He has brought the horrors of the holocaust to the masses.

I just watched this again for the first time in ten years or however long it's been. Not only is it relevant, but it's hard hitting and difficult to pull your eyes away from.

Fiennes, Neeson and Kingsley - how often do you get that group of actors? I urge everyone, no matter how young or how old to watch this. Though it's painful, it's a necessary reminder of what happened.

This is an excellent film in every way.

17 December 2005,Greatly Overrated Movie,"I admit: an important topic.

I admit: a pretty movie

I admit: an expensive movie

I admit: good acting

But I believe this topic is too important to be handled this way. Using standard Hollywood style: top actors, lots of stereotyping and a bit ""romantic"" attitude - we know nothing after this movie.

So - it's a good film. But it's unrealistic - and not at all important. If this is the way we process the worst crime in history, then we are not ready yet for the future.",7
27 October 2020,"It's 2020, and I've seen Schindler's List for the first time.","Being 33 years of age, I will admit this is my first review of any movie. I would not consider myself a movie fanatic, although I have seen many movies. Nor would I consider myself anything close to a critic, as I know little about cinematography. I've never felt compelled to write about any movie until now.

I ""stumbled"" across Schindler's List scrolling through Netflix one day. It sat on the back of my watch list for many weeks as I was not so eager to watch it. I considered black and white films as dull and have only heard of the titles name once before. My wife dislikes war movies and documentaries, but I have a strong passion for anything WW2. Even then, It was only a movie I may get around to watching.

The wife took a bath one day and the kids were at peace. So decided give watch.Having no pre conceived notions about this film, I am truly blown away I have waited so long to witness such a masterpiece.

The movie had me captivated for every last second, and in tears at the end. Even the following days after I was consumed by thoughts about this film. The 3+ hours felt like it was not long enough. Immediately afterwards, I had the desire to rewatch it and take in all the details I may have overlooked.

Still trying to convince the wife to watch it, but by far it is the best movie I have ever seen.",10
25 February 2014,Good but certainly not one of the greatest movies of all time.,"I am well aware of the hype surrounding this film but up until now I just never had watched it. Now many people will call me crazy when I say this but I just found it to be a good movie but certainly not one of the greatest films of all time.

While the film had a sense of heightened emotion my heart did not ache for the victims portrayed. Don't get me wrong it disgusts me what happened and upon seeing other movies on the subject matter and visiting concentration camps personally nothing disgusts me more but I just couldn't relate to the victims in Schindler's List. Maybe it was because there was no individual character to feel for but instead these crimes were being committed against nameless faces.

Also some of the scenes came off as slightly comical (whether they mean't to do that or not) but it made it hard to take this movie seriously. Maybe my expectations were too high, especially for a movie made in the early nineties, but if you are going to claim it is one of the greatest movies of all time then it better be able to back up that claim.",7

5 August 2002,Manipulative drivel from the worlds most celebrated 'child' film-maker,"Spielbergs renditions of the same film over and over again with the usual disallusioned protagonist caught up in backdrop of supposedly threatening results. Spielberg is a quick study and there's no doubt about it: He is a child, depicting stories that clearly immitate life(well his anyway) and this 'magnificant film' proclaimed so boldly by the masses represents nothing but( as a noted critic said on its initial release) Indiana Jones in Krakow. And thats not all ,despite about three hours of over-elaborate,one-dimensional,black and white(screenplay and cinematography) sentimentality that smacks of indulgance( oh i didnt know what behold the jews in WW2!) We have to endure a shameless ending of direct manipulation. Did well at the box-office (and the oscars, who seem content in handing awards to dire rubbish,Forrest Gump,Braveheart and Titanic to name a few) largely thanks to spielbergs bucket load of adoring fans who idolize the boy out of all proportion.

21 February 2021,Spielberg's best film by far.,"He has made some great classics, but in terms of filmmaking, story, heart, pure emotion and craftsmanship, this is by his best film. Every scene is filled with depth and rather than just regular plot points, it gives you building blocks for characters and relationships, the foundation for a great movie.

These days most films are overly plot driven and worse, action driven fueled by special effects and Hollywood formula.

Schindler's List is none of that. Based on a true story it follows Oskar as he matures from a businessman to a national hero.

Lots of great scenes and sequences that don't have music to manipulate how you should feel. I actually wish the whole movie was without music, because it would have been even more real. You can tell the difference between the scenes without music and the ones with. There is much more of a documentary feel to the ones without it.

The best part is Schindler's List doesn't sugarcoat anything. It shows the brutal nature of the events without censorship. The even better part is it showed everyone as complicated people and not as the standard Hollywood black and white characters.

I've seen it 5-6 times now and it gets better each time. I even discover new things every viewing.

I wish Spielberg made more films like this instead of his later duds. A must see.",10

12 September 2014,One of the best movies ever seen. It's a must see.,"I'm love watching movies that depict my slavery roots because it teaches me to never forget and always be grateful. But to watch movies based on other cultures, religion and freedom brings about a change in how I view society as a whole. You never know what people have gone through, and you'll never know the base of why they are who they are unless you go back. This movie touches on lives that were and will be forever changed even those generations that come after them. You don't have to be born back in that time or even of that race to understand being a slave to things, whether it's people, your job, bullying or anything that takes you out of your free will. This movie will leave you an emotional wreck, but yet grateful to be living in this day and time. Everyone should see this movie. I loved it.

The characters come alive, the relationships evolve and devolve, the manner in which the holocaust is depicted, from the sometimes beautiful, sometimes grotesque nudity to the extremely honest and direct depiction of the holocaust is done with a fearless tastefulness that will stay with me for the rest of my life. The greatest experience of art I've ever had. Quite simply, this is a masterpiece that rivals the likes of Beethoven and Shakespeare, if you haven't seen this movie you have yet to experience a piece of the genius humankind are capable of. Thank you Steven Spielberg for giving this film your soul.

I give this film infinity/10! It just doesn't get any better!

30 September 2014,Amazing!,"One of the most moving and captivating films I have ever seen, I would recommend it to anyone! It shows us a side to World War two and the holocaust that is completely unique, due to the fact that it is based upon a true story. The film grasps your attention from start to finish, despite being in black and white and it being a lengthy film. Liam Neeson once again shows us how good he really is, portraying the character of Mr Schindler. The movie is centred around the life of Oskar Schindler, he is a German businessman, who becomes famous due to the fact that he saved the more than a thousand Jewish people during the Holocaust. He did this by giving them work in his factories, making them important to the war effort. Overall. I would say that it is one of the best films ever made, and it is something that I shall continue to watch over and over again.

7 October 2014,Great Movie,"Schindler's List blends the abject horror of the Holocaust with Steven Spielberg's signature tender humanism to create the director's dramatic masterpiece.Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Thomas Keneally's novel based on the role of Oscar Schindler during the holocaust was very much his cinematic coming of age. Many have criticized Schindler as a profiteer and coward for not taking up arms against the Nazis. He was not a soldier and if he had done, at best he may have killed a handful of inconsequential German troops before dying a ""hero's death"". And every man, woman and child who worked in his factory would have been murdered. Spielberg does not shy away from the fact that he was not a saint, showing him to be a womanizer and hedonistic opportunist but when he was faced with the human tragedy of his environment he acted; a reaction that was all too rare at the time. In fact Spielberg draws parallels between Schindler and Goeth, his counterpart in the military work-camp but whereas the industrialist was a man of compassion, Goeth was the embodiment of the Nazi party; a cold, cruel and ruthless man who acted without conscience or mercy. It's true that the film is guilty of button pushing, but it is the manipulation of a master story teller; the highlighting of the girl in the red coat in particular is obviously Spielberg's way around the old adage of ""one death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic."" Putting a human face on an individual tragedy is the only way it is possible to process horror on such an unimaginable scale. Beautifully shot and expertly played, Schindler's List is a remarkable and moving film that will no doubt be part of a larger monument to an atrocity that must be remembered to ensure that it is never, ever repeated.",9
2 February 2022,"Brutal, Graphic, Moving","Spielberg's dramatic 200 minute-long holocaust film is enough to leave anybody with a soul in tears by the end. Filmed in Auschwitz, Poland, accompanied with an incredible script straight from the book about the true story of Oskar Schindler; this film keeps your attention from the second it begins to after it's over with. As it should be, this film is very very violent and shows the truly horrific torture that the Jewish people faced in Auschwitz during that time.

Oskar Schindler started as a selfish businessman, seeking only to make money, but later found a cause behind his means.

Only a man who's done nothing would state his accomplishments, but a righteous man will always claim he didn't do enough, and this film is the driving proof to that. Cinematography is phenomenal and the acting perhaps even better. This is certainly a movie every person needs to see.

10/10.",10
9 June 2005,The actual list,"OK - so the film was good - but its unrealistic the way that Schindler remembered 1100 peoples names by heart :s

taking into account that the factory workers were employed on the spot - and unlike today where employers may remember your names from the interviews - Schindler managed to remember all their names by casually walking through his factory a couple of times, and sometimes saying hello to them.....

but overall i thought the film was good.....but not as good as 'la vita e bella' which is a CLASSIC.....(and it has less unnecessary nudity, and overall delivers the same ideology, but in a much more sympathetic and heart-crunching way)

It is not just a movie that tells a story, it teaches history.

For me it is one of the best examples for humanity and courage in a time when tyranny and barbarity reigned Europe.

28 July 2002,The greatest movie of all time.,"The greatest and most important film ever made. The acting is superb with 3 tour de force performances from Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley.

It still remains as the academy's greatest disgrace that Neeson and Fiennes did not pick up the Oscar for their performances.

Spielberg delivers the undeliverable with a technical masterpiece. The film is restrained considering the subject matter and the directors involvement in the history. He could have gone for gross out but the horrors are all the more shocking for his restraint.

The scene with Oskar Schindler walking into the street to find flakes falling from the sky like snow and Amon Goeth standing by the mountain of human bodies remains the greatest and most powerful scene in movie history.

The film deserves all the awards and plaudits and is now shown to 15 year old schoolchildren in the school curiculum in England.

11 December 2002,A Masterpiece of our Time,"After many a year producing films of high entertainment, but lesser intellectual class, Steven Spielberg finally created a true masterpiece of our time. Consistently overlooked for Oscars for his previous films, the Academy had no choice but to pour glittering praise over this cinematic adaptation of Thomas Keneally's best-selling book.

I will not go into the details of the story as this should be imprinted into the mind by the images of the film itself. Rather, I would like to make special commentary on the direction of Spielberg, the screenplay of Steven Zaillian and the excellent cinematography by Janusz Kaminski. The controversial decision to film in black and white must also be specially commended, as it adds to the atmosphere of the film greatly.

The thing which sets the film apart from any I have seen before or since, however, is in the quality of acting. In parts, you lose the fact that it is ONLY a film, and not a live-action documentary. Of particular note is the exceptional British acting trio of Liam Neeson (Oskar Schindler), Ben Kingsley (Itzakh Stern) and Ralph Fiennes (Untersturmfuhrer Amon Goeth). Although the performances by the first two were magnificent, I do not believe I have ever seen an acting performance to rival that of Fiennes in his role as the Komandant.

It is all the more remarkable considering that this was his first role in a major film, having being plucked out of relative obscurity by Spielberg having seen his performance in the television movie ""A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia"" the previous year. It was an absolute travesty that none of these acting performances were rewarded with an Academy Award, showing the Oscars for the shambles that they really are.

I would like to end by making the point that I have never been left so astounded by any film as Schindler's List. Some may say that it is part of the propaganda machine that Spielberg has also used in other films, such as Saving Private Ryan, and there may be some truth to this. However the simple truth is that this film depicts life during the holocaust as closely as we could imagine it sixty years on. Humanity would learn a great deal if our young were taught about the mistakes of the past, and films such as this should be a part of the educational curriculum in every country in the world (as is the case in countries such as Great Britain and New Zealand, where Schindler's List is a mandatory part of every 15 year old's history lessons).

Finally, if I were to find one fault with the film, it would be the final credit of the film - ""Dedicated to the six million Jews who died in the holocaust"". Spielberg seems to have conveniently forgotten the five million gypsies, physically handicapped, mentally handicapped etc. who were also murdered by Hitler's death squads. I believe the film should be dedicated to these people also, truly reflecting the thankfulness we should all have for a world in which Nazism did not prevail.",10
27 July 2007,Extraordinary pictures - not so great script,"It is quite an intriguing thing how people react to this movie, judging by IMDb comments: either they label it ""masterpiece"" or ""a sappy, manipulative banalization of the Holocaust"". Either 1 or 10 score. I can't understand it. To me, Schindler's List has both merits and flaws. It is a technically perfect film, for example. I think no director can beat Spielberg on that. He is able to film such an overwhelming, astonishing scene as the Warsaw Ghetto raid and simply...well, simply make you buy it. He can offer you a conventional scene, like that Jewish fugitive trying to deceive his Nazi chasers, and provide you a glimpse of his terror so intense that you can even feel it. No other director that I am aware of is able to take advantage of modern technology in a way even remotely close to Spielberg. No one else has the power to offer us wonders, to leave you speechless, to make the unbelievable believable. He did it in Schindler's List, then in Prince of Egypt, then in Private Ryan (perhaps the most amazing visual experience in my life). Even Munich shrinks your guts in the shooting scenes.

Unfortunately for Spielberg, though, there is more in movies than technical ability. The man has a knack for sappiness, for easy morals. Now come on, a movie about the Holocaust, focusing on the Jews? Yet one more mouthful of the same porridge that we have been spoon-fed for decades? And then ""La Amistad"", a film intended to teach that slavery is wrong? Private Ryan, which focuses on how heroic American soldiers were during WWII, support our troops and honor the vets? Not exactly controversial matters, I am afraid. To make things worse, Spielberg doesn't make the least attempt to blur the simplistic premise. His Germans are devils, his victims (Jews, black slaves) are pure, noble and innocent all along and without exception. And critics are right: he is too sentimental, too sappy. It grows just awkward, in some extreme cases (I have in mind a couple scenes from Private Ryan, right now).

And then there is the annoying (to me, at least) political undertones of his films. In Schindler's list, for example, the final scene is very revealing. The Jews escape the factory and meet a Soviet soldier. ""What can we do"" ""If I were you, I wouldn't go East. They don't like you there. Neither I would go west"". Next scene: we see all the survivors in modern Israel. Get it? Israel is the shelter of Jews against the intolerance of...well, of everyone else, East and West alike. It would be enough to show that some Jews became traitors and betrayed his ilk, it would suffice to show that many interns (millions) in the camps were not Jews, it would make the film much more complex and deeper if we were offered some hint that, well, camps were run in a good measure by the interns themselves, the Kapos, who could be as ruthless as the SS. In fact, we are not even allowed to understand that the 30s and 40s were a time of strong political commitment and that many of those Jews were Socialists or Communists, and that they often created support nets inside the very camps. Does Mr. Spielberg fear we would fail to sympathized with the victims if we understood that they were three-dimensional human beings? Does he really regard his viewers THAT dumb?",7

27 June 2005,"Schindler's List, from a student's point of view","'Schindler's List' is a true account of how Oskar Schindler, a Czech factory owner, saved over 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust. The film is based around his story, but also includes other occurrences such as ones relating to Amon Girth, concentration camps, extermination camps, gas chambers, ghettos, the War etc. As a student, watching this film helped me to gain more of an understanding of the Holocaust and what happened during that horrible time. It captured a side of the story in a more real way than out of a textbook, it showed me the human side, the emotions and fear that can't be described in words. In a surprising way, I enjoyed watching the film, even though it upset me at points. The Holocaust is an event that no human should ever avoid, and as horrifying as it is, I don't regret watching this real-life tale. I think people could call 'Schindler's List' many things, but no one could ever call it boring. I found it really interesting, and I think it's a film everyone should see and learn from.

1 August 2005,"""The list is good, the list is life...""","""It always begins in darkness until the first light illuminates a hidden fragment of memory"" -The Fiftieth Gate

A beautifully presented movie about memories of people in the darkest hour of human history. It shows the cruelty, suffering and discriminations the Jews suffered which only memory can tell.

The use of black and white film technique shows it is a time of no hope, nor happiness. It makes the film appear more authentic. The film informs,clarify, increases understanding and creates empathy with those that have experienced it.

10 September 2021,It's really dificult for me to review a movie.,"I think the last movie I reviewed here (and probably the only one) was My Bloody Valentine, a complete trash movie with Jensen Ackles. I love the actor, but the movie was crap. But whatever. I just review when I get too suprised in a good or bad way. I think that the last movie that impacted me this much, even if it's not one of the best movies about war ever, was The Pianist. And Schindler's List surpassed that.

I might be exaggerating giving a 10 for it, but I can say this with 100% sure: Schindler's List was the best movie about war I've ever seen in my entire life.

11 September 2021,Remarkable,"When the aliens arrive and ask to see the single most important, powerful and masterful film humans have ever created, this would be what we show them. An unfathomable evil devastatingly exhibits mankind at its absolute worst but is contrasted by such a force of good, delivered by a man that does not even recognize it as such, forces us to stare at the truth of this war. That is to say, Schindler viewed what he did not as an act of kindness, but as an act of necessity. He viewed as the least he could do and yet, despite his anguish, he triumphed. Never had a film portrayed one story so vividly that you think ""this is the entire war,"" and ""This war was between Oskar Schindler and Nazi Germany.""

24 March 2000,Hard to Watch,"There are two reasons that I didn't like Schindler's List: One was that even though Oskar Schindler saved the lives of so many Jews, and others that the Nazis were preparing for the gas chambers, he decided who lived and who died just like they did. The other reason, is that I personally have an aversion to movies about the holocaust, because it makes me so mad, that every time I see it, whether it's from genuine stock footage, or staged for movie sets, like this one, I feel like barging into the screen like John Rambo, and shooting every brownshirt in sight, which is the same feeling I get when I see TV news footage of the more recent Serbian Holocaust against non-Serbs in the former Yugoslavia. I know that wasn't the point of the film, but these facts still bother me.

After the world finally learned how bad Nazi Germany was, we all promised that we'd never let anything like this happen again. Unfortunately, it already has happened more than several times on six continents, and continues in some countries to this day.

The last scene, when the viewer realizes that we are talking about a real person, touched me very much. The director did not make the film unambiguous, he very subtly showed the way from a heartless industrialist to a savior of human people. And when we watch the film, we understand why Schindler changed and started helping his employees. I recommend watching the movie to everyone. This is a cult film about war and man.

2 September 2020,By Far The Very Best Movie I've Ever Seen,"I can't believe this movie only ranks 6th overall for best ranked movies. The Dark Knight, Godfather and Shawshank Redemption were ranked higher. Wow. I don't really know what to do with that. The Dark Knight? A frickin Batman Movie!! Gotham City ? LoL. Shawshank Redemption? Ok, that one should fall somewhere in the top 20. But #1? Whatever...I digress in disgust and bewilderment.

The topic at hand:

Schindler's List is a movie that cannot be improved upon. I never say that about a movie. This movie has the hand of God all over it. It matters not what Spielberg's faith is or how strong his faith is. God will use who He will use. This movie is a blessing.

This movie is also the hardest movie I've ever watched. It tells a story that needed to be told unsparingly and without omission of important often gory details. You don't short change this topic.

This movie will crack your heart in half. Never seen a movie that hurt so bad. But that's the Holocaust. Dialing back the horrors of the Holocaust in a movie portraying the Holocaust is the telling of a lie by omission of the entire historical truth. Spielberg told no lies. He allowed the truth to unfold freely.

This movie's historical accuracy is refreshing. This is Spielberg's very best work.

The period details are an indication of the thought, effort and professionalism that went into this movie. The screenplay is at the very least genius.

The casting could not be improved upon. Liam Neeson was phenomenal, as was Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes. Even the B actors deserved awards for their acting in this movie! At least a dozen of them.

The historical portrayal in this movie was so rich you become transported back in time as this movie unfolds and draws you in. Very few movies that render historical accounts as a central theme are able to accomplish this. Again, this attests to the screenplay.

I can think of no better account of the Holocaust than this movie. This includes any of the reading material I've been exposed to, museums I've visited, college courses I've taken pertaining to this profoundly heavy subject. I've been to the Holocaust Museum in DC, I've read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. This movie is a bit more.

Many movies strive to convey a moral message. Too many do this on false premises, with a bias intertwined, slaved to a political narrative all too often adopted by an acutely immoral Hollywood. This movie has neither the time nor the place for that nonsense. This movie beautifully displays the true good in some people right alongside the horrid wickedness of others. This movie is about humanity and the lack of humanity. You will weep watching this movie! Let the tears flow! They are deserved! Each of us carries within us at least a little bit of inhumanity in us. This movie shows us the great risk and passion one man actually put forth in an endeavor to defeat some of the worst inhumanity of modern times. I only wish they'd make a similar movie about Stalins Massacares and those of Mao.

Wish there was an eleventh star. This movie earns it without breaking a sweat.",10
16 February 2022,Must Watch,"Whenever you see the aggravation that every one of the guiltless individuals were going through, the main thing you can do is cry. The genuine objective of all Holocaust films is to cause you to feel miserable, and Schindler's List did that to me.

14 September 2015,My first Review,"Hello IMDb One of the most moving and captivating films I have ever seen, I would recommend it to anyone! It shows us a side to World War two and the holocaust that is completely unique, due to the fact that it is based upon a true story. The film grasps your attention from start to finish, despite being in black and white and it being a lengthy film. Liam Neeson once again shows us how good he really is, portraying the character of Mr Schindler. The movie is centered around the life of Oskar Schindler, he is a German businessman, who becomes famous due to the fact that he saved the more than a thousand Jewish people during the Holocaust. He did this by giving them work in his factories, making them important to the war effort. Overall. I would say that it is one of the best films ever made, and it is something that I shall continue to watch over and over again.

Have fun with the movie alex_der_bert

14 December 2018,Spielberg's Best Film and an Overall Cinematic Masterpiece,"""Those who save one life, saves the entire world.""

I made my film professor laugh when I told him that I would be celebrating the end of Finals Week with the fifteenth anniversary of Schindler's List. I had never seen the film before, so I didn't understand the laughter. After three hours and fifteen minutes, a face dripping with tears, and my body shaken, I now understand what my professor was talking about. I thought finals were depressing already!

Regardless, Schindler's List is the definitive film that people should look to for a true story about the Jewish persecution throughout Europe during World War 2. The Holocaust was perfectly emulated here, perhaps a little too perfect. As you get uncomfortably transported to the 1940s, you follow the workings of Oskar Schindler, a Nazi officer who decides to start a pot-making factory during the war. Because he is a cheapskate, he decides to use the Jews as cheap labor to run his factory, only to slowly gain a heart throughout the course of the film, as he discovers the real persecution his workers are going through.

The film's narrative is, without a doubt, my favorite thing about it. I love the redemption of Oskar Schindler. Whether it is our history books, other films, or through stories, the Nazis are always labeled as heartless soldiers who killed anybody they didn't like on sight. Those labels are 99% correct, I am sure, but the story of Schindler made me realize that even the most evil people, can find a heart. Liam Neeson nailed the performance of Schindler, and he is currently my favorite character in a film right now. I will never forget his performance, especially at the end of the film. He is such a well-written character and is wonderfully acted.

I also must give credit Ralph Fiennes, who gave an incredibly realistic portrayal of the stereotypical evil SS officer. And if the Nazi stereotype is a thing, I think it all derives from Fiennes' acting in this film, because he is definitely the grandaddy of all Nazis. He does a terrific, yet terrifying, job here. Fiennes' character is so interesting because he is so neurotic and insane, yet he is very eloquent and well-composed at times. His hatred for Jews is insane, but you still love him for some reason, because deep down, he is still Ralph Fiennes.

Ben Kingsley, who I didn't realize was in this film until I got past the accent, does a fantastic job here as well. This dude can legitimately play any race if he wanted to. He is so fantastic.

As for the rest of the film, the score by John Williams is extremely depressing. I cannot stop listening to the Main Theme, It breaks my heart. The black and white cinematography is so gorgeous. And just when you think you are used to it, the little girl in red comes out, and it makes your jaw drop. The acting was so solid, even with all of the background characters. I will never forget the scenes where the Jews had to be stripped naked, run around all across the yard, all to see if they were healthy. Every person looked really unhealthy, malnourished, extremely skinny, and honestly kind of dead, which added to the realism of the film. It was so hard to watch.

Also, a film finally got gunshots to the head right. Watching the Jews get executed was incredibly difficult to sit through, but with the added realism of the blood gushing out, it really makes the audience feel for what happened to all of these Jewish people.

I especially loved how the ending of the film played homage to the real-life survivors of the Holocaust, and it is said realizing that since this is the fifteenth anniversary of the film, none of those survivors are still alive. But it all still broke my heart.

Anyways, despite my absolutely love for the film, I have two nitpicks: First, despite how great the characters and narrative was, I almost wish the film was completely in Polish and German. However, the film was almost entirely in English, which took away from the realism just a tad. Spielberg said that ""I wanted people to watch the images, not read the subtitles."" I completely disagree with that statement entirely, because I watch subtitles with every film, including English ones, and it makes me appreciate the story even more. So boo! And secondly, some characters were introduced in the beginning that were never really brought up again, like the one guy at the church.

But who really cares? Schindler's List is ultimately a masterpiece.

PS: Three hours and fifteen minutes has never flown by so fast.",
22 November 2022,Tears running down from my eyes.,"One of the better adjectives to use to describe this movie is ""chilling."" This is not a horror film; rather, it is a picture of the Holocaust's industrialised murder and the self-indulgent German businessman who ended up playing an unexpected hero.

Here, Spielberg pays meticulous attention to historical detail, including dates, names of people and places, as well as horrifyingly high rates of poverty and brutality.

The Jews are only evil undermensch (sub-human) criminals who must be exterminated from all of Europe in the eyes of the occupying Germans.

Schindler, who is always resourceful, wins lucrative contracts to provide the German army with enamel cookware for use in field kitchens by making friends with military authorities. Then he locates and convinces Jewish investors to purchase the factory.

11 March 2023,"One of the greatest films, I have ever watched.","Schindler's list is a 1993 American movie based on the real story that occurred during Nazi Occupation of Poland in WW2. It was directed and produced by Steven Spielberg and written by Steven Zaillian. The movie is about the German Industrialist, Oskar Schindler, who saved over a thousand of the Polish-Jewish people from Holocaust by employing them in his factory and the crime committed by the Waffen SS officer, Amon Leopold G√∂th, at the Krak√≥w-Plasz√≥w concentration camp, Poland.

One of the most impressive things about this movie is how it can make you understand the feeling of what is going on during that time. Moreover, it is even more interesting that this movie tells the story not only from the Jewish perspective but also from the German perspective. However, this film was display in the black and white (except for the little girl in the red dress). In my opinion, the film would be more interesting if it was displayed in color. So, the audience would be able to see the real color of each stuff during the time of the war.

After all, I would say this film is really worth watching. It's not only very well telling you the real story, but also letting you understand the feeling of both side during the war as well as showing you some interesting culture of a particular group of the people in the film.",10

13 April 2001,Powerfully disturbing film with lack of credibility/unnecessary storyline of Oskar Schindler,"No doubt a powerful and disturbing film about THE MOST tragic time in humanity, and it broke my heart to see all the mistreatment and the carelessness/complete disregard for human life. I can't help wonder, though, if the story is really credible. Why would a German businessman risk his life and undergo bankruptcy to save people that his very people were against? If this story really is true, I doubt he did so out of the kindness of his heart, but more for reputation-boosting. I expected a lot from this film, after all, it outlines something horrifying and truly a tragedy, but I couldn't help thinking that this film undermined the sensitivity of this subject by including a greedy, selfish, profiteering, womanizing German businessman in the story. I think that if you really want to learn more about the Holocaust, it should not be through films such as this, but through actual real-life documentaries that include no ""other"" unnecessary characters/stories, but truly tell the real pain, the real hurt and loss of the Jewish people who were treated so badly just because they believed differently from others. Regardless, there were some truly powerful moments in the film: The pictures of the starving prisoners who were forced to strip and be inspected by Nazi doctors, who would determine whether they could work or whether they should be killed. The little girl in the bright red dress, the only color, the only sunshine, in an otherwise gray, dark period of time, the very essence of innocence, and her symbolism later in the film when her lifeless body is wheelbarrowed over to the ever-growing pile of dead bodies that were to be incinerated. When Amon Goeth's young Jewish maid asks Oskar Schindler why he shot an elderly woman who was just passing by, bothering no one, looking at no one; his reply: because she meant nothing to him, she was just one of those people who neither bothered nor pleased him, just that she was just a random person with no meaning to him, was the reason why he so cruelly took a life so easily.

I do think this film is worth watching, no doubt, but please don't automatically assume you know everything about the Holocaust because you watched this film; this film portrayed life less harshly than life for the imprisoned actually was. Please watch documentaries on the Holocaust, research more through books and legitimate media, if you want the true facts.",7
19 September 2023,A Profoundly Emotional Journey,"Schindler's List is an emotional tour de force that brought tears to my eyes. This cinematic masterpiece, directed by Steven Spielberg, tells the true story of Oskar Schindler's remarkable mission to save Jewish lives during the Holocaust. Watching this film is a gut-wrenching experience, filled with moments of heartbreak and hope that left me in tears. The black-and-white cinematography, coupled with outstanding performances by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes, creates an authentic and haunting atmosphere. Schindler's List is a must-watch for its ability to evoke deep emotions and remind us of the enduring power of compassion amid humanity's darkest hours.

The story line is incomparable, the black and white effect made it so real!... very emotional and sad. A master piece. Outstanding performances. Great direction! Beautifully shot. Very few stories can get so deep inside one's soul. It feels as a documentary. Makes you see humanity in a different way, wishing something like the Holocaust never happened and that we never have to face anything similar again. The story is narrated beautifully, although it;s a very long movie, it never cease to get you engaged. Steven Spielberg showed how a masterpiece is made, very few movies will ever have the power Schindler's List had.

18 October 2016,Fantastic Depiction,"Usually when I see a modern film that is shot entirely in black and white I roll my eyes because the intended effect is usually far from the level of serious that I actually perceive. This is not one of those films. The black and white is perfect for the subject matter and REALLY adds to the story in ways unknown to someone who hasn't seen the film. The amount of hatred and malice displayed in this film puts one in an uncomfortable state that easily shows how serious the subject matter is. Albeit the Holocaust was no laughing matter, however if you are one who knows nothing about the history of WWII, coming into this movie will definitely open your eyes. It was once said that ""When Steven Spielberg first showed John Williams a cut of the film, Williams was so moved he had to take a walk outside for several minutes to collect himself"". I felt exactly the same way. I had plans to get some at-home work done after watching this movie, but was put at a standstill for so long after seeing it that I ended up being 30 minutes behind schedule. This is not a bad thing. If you have not seen this movie, it is an absolute requirement.

I had read a lot about it on Wikipedia and IMDb but nothing could have prepared me for the sheer horror I witnessed on my TV. Schindler's List is not a movie. It's a true, enduring film. I made the mistake of first watching it solely as a film and not for what it truly stood for. Schindler's List is something everyone should witness, because that is all you can be when you watch the film: A witness. Steven Spielberg's brilliance and perseverance gives the world the final truth in film of the Holocaust. The masterpiece creates an epic yet eye-opening view for me into the Holocaust.

I love this film, and I cant wait to go back to it when I am ready to face the horror of 1939-1945. Steven Spielberg deserves a thank you from the world, for giving us the terror, horror, inhumanity, and final truth of the story of Schindler's List. Watch it when you know you're ready, because even then, the truth will make you doubt if you can press onward through the three hour film. Thank You Steven Spielberg.

9 May 2016,Schindler's List,"Oskar Schindler was a German member of the Nazi party who saved the lives of over one thousand Jews during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. In 1993, Steven Spielberg believed Oskar Schindler's was a story that needed to be told, directing that year's Best Picture Academy Award winning film. Casting Liam Neeson in the titular role with Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes in strong supporting roles, Oskar Schindler's courageous story was brought to life. The story of an unlikely hero proves the point that even the most individual of lives can be turned to a life lived for the masses.

Oskar Schindler was not who you would typically think of as a hero. He was a drinker, a womanizer, and a frequent gambler who had one goal in mind of becoming a millionaire. Liam Neeson illustrates the many flaws of Oskar wonderfully through his many scenes drinking, gambling, and philandering against his wife in the first half of the film. The Holocaust gives Schindler a golden opportunity to realize his dreams of riches. Schindler begins to employ vulnerable Jews as laborers in his factories, saving them from certain exile and saving him immense amounts in labor costs. Gradually over time, he becomes deeply affected by the treatment of the Jews, especially that of his accountant and partner of sorts, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley). Schindler then starts going to great lengths to protect as many Jews as he can, even convincing the German high command to allow him to build another factory and employ more Jews. Schindler even puts himself at risk by going head to head with Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) S.S. Officer in command of Krak√≥w-P≈Çasz√≥w concentration camp. Even when one camp is closed, Schindler arranges for ""his"" Jews to be transplanted in another factory. When the train carrying truckloads of Jewish women is deferred to Auschwitz, Schindler races the train down to have them freed using funds from the massive riches he has amassed. By the war's, and the film's conclusion, we see that Schindler has lost all of his wealth in the attempt to save as many Jews as he could from persecution; being responsible for saving the lives of 1,200 people.

Many film devices were used exceptionally well throughout this film which is no doubt due to Steven Spielberg's skill as a director. The film starts out in color, then fades to black and white only to be illuminated in color at its conclusion (and who could forget that red coat scene). This was a marvelous way to illustrate the lives of the millions of Jews affected by the Holocaust to the grim reality they faced once it started (black and white) to the realities they could experience after the persecution ended (return to color). The film could not have told the grim tale it told in color and the fade to black and white was one of the brilliant decisions Spielberg made in this film. The title cards used throughout the first quarter of the movie was a wonderful use to keep the audience engaged and learn further details about the characters involved. The most powerful aspect of this movie has to be its use of sound. I have never watched a movie that used sound so well in a film, especially diegetic sound. The sound is the easiest way to pull an audience into a film and to set the mood of the story, Spielberg, however, uses sound in inventive ways to produce realism by really immersing the film into the 1940's. The film closes with a powerful scene in which we see, in present-day the many descendants of the people saved by Schindler's list, reiterating the powerful reminder of the origins of dangerous political power, especially needed in today's election cycle.",5

24 June 2002,It may be the most important film you'll ever see...,"The movies should inspire, and provide a view of things the way they ought to be. Schindler is both. This is probably the most difficult movie you will ever watch. The liquidation of the ghetto, for instance, or the shower scene, are among the most heartbreaking images ever filmed. Yet this movie might cause you to rethink the meaning of egoism when you see it manifested in this enigmatic man.

29 March 2021,"Schindler's List is a fairly amazing film and, to my surprise, it truly deserves every bit of praise it gets.","I had only seen Spielberg's not depressing movies before this, so one thing about Schindler's List which truly caught me off guard is how well it depicts violence. This isn't a particularly graphic film in any way, but any minor showcase of violence here is still very well executed, without any close ups or annoying music queues. The violence is captured in a way which isn't gratuitous but still manages to properly present the stakes in the plot, as it knows when it's more effective to show something, and when it's more effective not to show something.

I also didn't expect this to be anywhere near as visually striking as it is, because the cinematography here is really great, with some very well coordinated long takes. The contrast between slow and fast editing is incredibly purposeful, and I'm also genuinely shocked to say that the black and white presentation of this movie actually works, and doesn't come off as an annoying gimmick. The production value is phenomenal too, and although this might seem like a strange thing to mention, I really love the staging here; the way the characters are placed in the frame and the way they move around it is very well thought out. The one minor issue I do have with this films presentation however is the volume of background sounds during a lot of moments. I know it doesn't matter or anything, but I do seriously find it difficult to get immersed in a scene when the characters are talking at a normal volume in a church when everyone else is singing. In real life the entire choir would look at you and tell you to shut up, and if Spielberg just told the actors to whisper I would find that scene way easier to take seriously. It's a tiny detail, but it's also just so easy to fix that I really wanted to mention it.

Now I'm not going to deny that this is a 'normie' movie, as it's a film which basically anyone can enjoy, but I still never felt like the script was dumbing itself down just to be more easily accessible. No character comes off as too oversimplified, and nothing is so black and white that it seems melodramatic. The protagonist here may have a somewhat predictable arc, but what matters to me is the presentation, and although the presentation isn't completely flawless, as there are a few cheesy moments, it's still absolutely fantastic. Because even though Schindler's arc goes the way we expect it to, and hits all the beats we expect it to, I would still consider him to be a fantastic protagonist, because every beat his character hits doesn't come off as forced, and still feels like a natural progression for him as a person.

Schindler's List tackles multiple story lines with a runtime of three hours and seventeen minutes, and I still never found it messy in the slightest. The dialogue couldn't be any more engaging, and the performances couldn't be any more compelling. And although yes, it does end in a monologue to show off the actors abilities with sad music to make the audience cry, it's just so well developed and so well earned that it never comes close to being forced or sappy.

Overall, I wouldn't consider Schindler's List to be the sixth best film of all time (like on IMDB), but it's still amazing, and definitely worth watching, if you haven't seen it already.",10
24 September 2005,Wow..all must see film,"All aspects, even the smallest, of this movie drift the viewer further into feeling the sorrow of the events during WWII. The music really sinks in and the viewer tends to really think about how bad it must have been and wonder if he or she, if put in the same position, will act the same way or not. This movie is very accurate as well: in depicting Schindler's personality and the names and numbers of people saved and so forth. I think everyone should watch this movie for it will make a person re-evaluate things they complain about and things of that matter and those problems may seem really childish compared to what someone can withstand without any complaint at all and with more pain.

20 September 2022,Incomparable and One of a kind !,"Probably the Greatest,Yes I mean the Greatest Movie Ever made,there can be no comparisons. Everything from Casting to Screenplay and from Acting to The Background Score is astonishingly top notch ! The Cast is Evidently perfect with Oscar level performances of Ralph Fiennes and The amazing Liam Neeson.

Steven Spielberg just takes us into the darker side of the second world war by keeping the movie in black and white format showing us the events of the Darkest Disaster in man made human history, The Holocaust.

The cinematography is marvelous with pitch perfect background music and Amazingly shot Scenes Hats off !

The one who saves t.

17 October 2017,"I do not like the film, UNFORTUNATELY","This will probably shock many people but a movie that has never really been done for me is one of us love Spielberg allegedly best movies namely Schindler's list. Schindler's list is really a movie the upload has not triggered at me has Lust tell me that I have already told you that the most important thing about a movie for me is that he touched you somehow emotionally or that has her something says there were a lot of bad movies I've seen there were a lot of unnecessary films I saw and also a lot of boring Movies to Aldi in I could say something because they have triggered something in me and even boredom disgust to vote these are all feelings but if the film does nothing triggers with me then this is just the biggest you can send a movie can do if I have two Hours sitting close not feeling this is just sad. I prefer a bad movie that bores me offended and offended as a movie that is simply empty and does not taste good. What does the girl do the list? Well, I've seen a lot of second world war films watching metal messages is all possible perspectives and a possible feelings though Gin the list the only one of not one of these feelings drive even boredom anger or grief and I find a pity because I want this movie really really made great great music he is super filmed and so and I can not say to you actors what not even a thousand times was said, unfortunately, this is really the only movie that is just not for me and I was really shocked that that was the case. I always say that the miserable is the worst movie he has seen you or find one that I hate the most Varel who just pushed the wrong buttons with me, however, Steven Spielberg Schindler's list has absolutely no button pressed with me. So I'm sorry to say that I find this is really a pity because the food was very big and important film of the since was made but I do not find the film tasteless tasteless but I simply do not taste anything.",

17 July 2023,You're missing the point,"Been scrolling through some negative reviews saying it's slow, boring and lacking in entertainment. It's not meant to be entertaining, it's meant to be an eye opener. To those of you claiming this never happened and that it was nowhear near this horrible in real life you're absolutely right, it was even worse!! Certain things can't be recreated. Stories based on real events are often exaggerated but no this one, far from it.

It's hard to believe that the creator of E. T and Jurassic Park could make something like this. Shows how flexible Spielberg is as a director. From an emotional standpoint this movie is downright heart-wrenching.. It was not an easy watch but I still recommend everyone sees it once, but only once.. This is not the type of movie you wanna see twice.

From a cinematic standpoint this is a masterpiece like no other. Couldn't find a single weak link in the acting and the camerawork was flawless. The score by John Williams perfectly captures the mood. Liam Neeson will be remembered for his portrayal of Oskar Schindler and history will never forget these events.

Although the scene where Schindler breaks down crying never happened in real life, I'm sure that's how he felt deep inside and if there truly is a heaven, that's where his soul is resting. Of that I am certain!",10

17 December 2016,Great movie,"This is the best war film about the Holocaust I have ever seen. Steven Spielberg makes one of his greatest movies of all time. This movie really did feel realistic and everything seemed true. After reading the real Wikipedia page on Schindler, I can say that most of what happened in the movie was true. Obviously, certain events that happened in reality were not included, and some of the things that happened in the movie did not happen in reality. One of the things that I didn't like about the movie was how everything was black and white, and there was only color for a few seconds in the beginning and end. Also, throughout the movie, it was hard to pickup what the actors were trying to say. Overall, I really did enjoy this movie, it presented the historical facts really well.

6 March 2022,"Pretty boring, unfortunately.","The true story is most certainly admirable and honorable and it's great this film was made to share that. However, this film drags on pretty slow and in the end I ultimately felt nothing. That's not to say this film doesn't have moments that are absolutely gut wrenching, disturbing, and haunting. But, as a whole, this movie didn't have as much an impact as I thought. Also, I could have done without the black and white film gimmick. Like why? Oh! I know why. Because this is a serious motion picture and Spielberg has to convey that in his infantile way. Great film score, even though it's depressing as hell to hear. All in all, worth the watch once.

6 December 2005,Most moving film I have ever seen,"A lot has been written about this film over the years, but I wanted to add my own personal experience.

I went to the Cinema with 2 friends to see this, and I have never known an audience with such respect for a film, or an atmosphere like it. The emotional impact of this film was evident to all in the audience and no-one spoke at all through the performance or, indeed, after it as we were leaving.

My friends and I walked in silence to the car, and drove for about 10 minutes before the silence was broken when I came to a Pub and suggested that we had a pint. We then discussed the film and the emotional impact over a drink. This experience has stayed with me since, and I have never had the same response to another film.

Not a review, but I was wondering whether others might have been affected by the film in the same way.

Thamks for reading this.",10
27 October 2007,An unbelievable accomplishment!,"Quite simply, I believe this is the best movie ever made, frame for frame. Spielberg has done such an incredible directing job, and the writing and acting are so exemplary that by the time the movie is about one-third over you're convinced that you're watching a real-life documentary.

I saw Schindler's List at a wide screen theater that seats almost 1,000 viewers, and about midway through the movie I looked around. Literally 100% of the viewers were sitting there with their mouths wide open, and that every now and then I checked for this, and it never changed.

Despite the length of the movie, the audience remains spell-bound, and to me this incredible production absolutely merits that. To bring this horrific time in world history to the movie screen in such a powerful and emotionally engaging way is just a staggering accomplishment, and one can only hope that school systems will continue to make it mandatory viewing for their students.

If any movie is a ""CAN'T MISS,"" this is it!

My only question is: how can 5,741 IMDb readers POSSIBLY give this a rating of ""1""?",10

17 April 2006,Its nearly my favorite film,"I felt sad after I had seen this film. I think who make fun of Jew, is an idiot. Or how would you feel like in a gas chamber. Its not funny if you smother in a gas chamber. I think these people had not earn the Oscar in vain as best Art Direction Set Decoration: Allan Starski, Ewa Braun best Cinematography: Janusz Kaminski best Director: Steven Spielberg best Film Editing: Michael Kahn best Music, Original Score: John Williams best Picture: Gerald R. Molen,Branko Lustig best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium Steven Zaillian So I think I had all Oscars winner writing down.

9 November 2002,Its not too sentimental.,"A little sentimentality can go along way in a film such as Schindlers List as your emotions are easily strung by Speilberg's choose of colliding the inhumane realism of nazi brutality with the heroic actions of one man that was the savior of thousands. These extreme and true contrasts of events magnifies the emotional anguish for which the viewer is to absorb which was probally Speilberg's intention. Thus creating a Superb film that effects every person that views it in their own personal way.

17 August 2020,One of the best movies on the Holocaust & Positive Sides,"The portrayal of the characters in the film is brilliant and is etched on my mind. It surely stands as a monumental piece of cinema and the screenplay is indeed a magnificent accomplishment.

The character of Oskar Schindler as a greedy German businessman and his transformation as he becomes a humanitarian while experiencing the effects of the unleash of terror of Nazi reign which compells him to turn his factory into a refuge for Jews. To have saved 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp is in itself one of the greatest real life accomplishments, which we can experience very closely.

The brilliance of Steven Spielberg directing the movie clearly makes people realize the real life experience of horrors that the Jews went through during the Holocaust. It is indeed a masterpiece. The use of black and white makes it special.",9
10 July 2020,A lovely film,"Beautiful and moving imagery. Liam Neeson is powerful and engaging. And a very great performance from Ralph Fiennes, showing his impressive range as an actor (here as a sinister figure).

19 April 2022,Ten more people we could have saved in return of this car.,"One of the must watch movie again. Will melt your heart.

Great work by #stevenspielberg , he did justice to present Schindler and his transformation from an opportunistic businessman to an extraordinary human being, saviour of Jewish from Holocaust.

Every scene their sequencing is perfect. Black and white cinematography was apt to take you to that era. You can feel the pain of people. You can understand each and every character and what they are going through, their thoughts.

Scenes like Schindler sees the red dress young girl from far running from lan to lan saving her life .In black and while film she in her red dress is seen clearly. Schindler watches her from far when the killings are happening to see what is happening to her. He unknowingly makes a connection with her seeing her running safe. And after few scenes Schindler sees red dressed girls dead body. Just imagine how much thoughtful the scene was planned as it did moved the audience.

Schindler was such a changed man that at end he was left with the thought that what he did for people was not enough . He saved thousands of people from Holocaust in return of all his wealth but at end felt could have saved few more with the car he had etc.

""ten more people , why did I keep this car. This pin , two people or one person.""",9
12 January 2017,Ben Kingsley's performance was outstanding,"almost twenty five years since its release, and this movie has stayed in the top ten of every 'best' movie listing on the net. the acting is impeccable, camera-work is unsurpassable. casting was perfect, when i try to imagine any other actors in the roles, the movie just falls apart. Ben Kingsley as Itzhak stern, is a powerful and insightful character played with great humility and awareness. the actors experience of character acting makes this role a plausible, sympathetic role which he will forever own. coupling liam neeson and ralph fiennes, whom i consider less experienced actors of the day, worked supremely well, but led to the odd concept of a lesser actor being in the lead role and supported by a far more experienced and able actor, yet it worked perfectly.

17 October 2000,Enlightening,"I first saw this movie in the theater. After it was over, not a sound could be heard. It took a long time before the people even moved from their seats. Personally, I decided that some of the people that I knew, who did not show an interest in the movie, much less the holocaust, were going to see this movie. I am happy to say that everyone who I showed this movie to was moved and learned a lot. I know that some of the facts in the movie were not 100% accurate. Never the less, my friends and family grew, as compassionate human beings, after watching this film.

26 July 2020,A timeless showstopper,"Schindler's list is powerful because it is real. It's never overly righteous, even in a film that essentially details the holocaust. It's real and raw and shows the character of the man behind it all. I didn't mind the art direction of the film although I'm not sure the black and white film added as much as one would think. The pacing is crisp and doesn't feel slow even in a 3+ hour film. Character development is the name of the game here and Spielberg does everything right in making the character of Schindler. There are some truly dramatic moments that you would not get a documentary of he same scenes.

This is a wonderful, wonderful film. It is timeless and powerful. There are many scenes that are simply unforgettable due to the brutal nature of the film. This film deserves all the praise that it has received.

I will start from the dialogs. This movie had long dialogs. I've seen movies with long dialogs which I've enjoyed every sentence of it, but the dialogs of this film were just plain boring! Even IF we accept that the dialogs were meaningful, this doesn't cover the serious lack of enthusiasm in the dialogs!!! no excitement whatsoever in their speeches!!! This movie failed to make me care what was gonna happen next. And finally, though it may be appealing to some, I can't come to finding any interest in the Idea of making a black and white movie in the 90s!! I know many people may disagree with what I said, but with the reasons I have given, I believe it's not unwise that I expect at least a fraction of the crowd to agree with me; therefore it's just unbelievable seeing an average of 8.9!!!

4 June 2020,100 words review,"Based on a novel of same name, this movie tells the story of Oskar Schindler, who used to get cheap labor from the Jews for his factory. Starting as a opportunistic businessman, he transforms into a hero, when he becomes concerned about his workforce specially after witnessing their persecution.

This movie is a masterpiece of Steven Spielberg. He kept it in black-and-white format to make it more relatable of the era of the movie. Based on German Holocausts , this movie will surely bring tears in viewing but after a while, you will appreciate the story telling ability of the director.

Trivia It is a non-fiction movie, which describes actual people and places, with fictional events and reconstructed dialogue where exact details were unknown. Nominated for 12 oscars, this movie won 7 including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography. Quotes Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire. Power is when we have every justification to kill, and we don't. Stern, if this factory ever produces a shell that can actually be fired, I'll be very unhappy.",10
13 September 2021,Didn't want to Rate it Lower to be Edgy but It's Far from the Greatest Movie of all Time,"I see why Seinfeld decided to make out in the theater instead of paying close attention to this movie. It's way too long, sometimes boring, and visually confusing.

Of course, the subject matter here is about one of the most important events in human history, yet I think it's a big flaw to give a piece of art high marks just because it deals with an important topic. It must also be judged on its artistic value.

This is basically two stories in one. On the one hand we have a sadistic military commander who's rude, crude, emotionally unstable, and bloodthirsty. This part is like an exploitation movie - calculated to shock the audience. However, given that these scenes are most likely close to the truth of an actual situation, it's appropriate.

The other part concerns the evolution of the character of Schindler from a practical businessman to a humanitarian who gives up all of his fortune for the sake of the Jews in the film. It's a beautiful story, and the ending is touching, but the evolution is, in my opinion, a little too subtle. I don't feel Schindler fundamentally displayed any big change throughout the film. Seems like he was always a rather decent guy.

The use of music throughout is a unique and brilliant touch. The whole thing seems to move in sync with a rhythm.

That being said, this film is way too long and some parts are boring. The first third, especially rolls along at a snail's pace.

Also filming this movie in a tenebrous black and white just to use the girl in the red sweater as a symbol was not only vulgar symbolism cramming, but made the movie hard to watch. Also why did they cast Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes in the leading roles? They look like twins. I sometimes wondered why Schindler was committing all of the atrocities only to discover that it was actually a different character. Along with the darkness, made it harder to watch.

It's a good movie from a technical standpoint. Creative, impactful, and well-directed, but I wouldn't blame you if you made out while it was playing in the theater.

Honourable Mentions: Jurassic Park (1993). Short, fast-paced, good effects, IN COLOR... In my opinion, Spielberg's best work.",6

11 February 2019,You won't find a better film,"This is the most important story told on film. It's visually stunning, heartbreaking and graphic with some of the most horrible characters shown in movies. I wouldn't call it my favourite movie because something on this topic shouldn't be considered a favourite. Nor can you watch it all the time because it's so depressing. But without peer it is the greatest movie ever made.

25 August 2018,It could have been amazing but it's just oscar bait.,"What I really dislike about this movie is that it I think I was really mislead about what it was. Whether the movie itself, its marketing or just word of mouth is to blame I can't say.

I believed it was meant to be the story of Oskar Schindler saving some Jews. Which I was fine to see. But what I got instead was some candid exhibition of the holocaust with the Schindler plot kind of tacked on for good measure. I can agree that we should have a really well-made holocaust movie out there but it's the duplicity of the picture that sits unwell with me. The scenes are disconnected and episodic which would have been appropriate if only it could have been established that this experience was the focus of the movie but since there is a pretence of a linear plot that we only get glimpses of they just feel like filler. I barely remember how this thing of saving anyone developed or how he did it. It was really just a marketing gimmick and is in its own right really not that interesting beyond its premise.

Maybe if it had been some kind of hybrid of ""Shoah"" with ""Waltz with Bashir"" it really could have been something; with real people relaying their experiences which were then dramatized. But because of the way these episodes are contextualized, they just seem pornographic in the sense it is more about a sadomasochistic voyeurism on this example of genocide, relying way too much on its production values and the gruesomeness of what it is showing so to me it is basically just a slasher than rips off reality. At least ""Friday the Thirteenth"" tried to be original.

Another design flaw is the film's desperation to show you things to make you recoil. Once you establish crimes against humanity to be on the stakes, the endless parade of candid shootings just seem redundant. It doesn't matter how bluntly they the lady gets shot, the apathy to human lives already blatantly obvious. It's just ""what's going to happen? Oh? Another person got shot? Shocking..."" This candour is also jarringly contrastive to strangely lyrical dialogues and monologues that make it very unclear what tone the movie really wants.

Powerful moments asides, it's a very sugary experience, and the horror of its subject matter does not excuse the handling. As you can tell from the cover art used on this website. I respect the use of black and white, it's very appropriate and usually the colour against black and white thing would greatly appeal to me, but it focuses on a little girl which is just pandering. The same kind of physiognomy that Nazi Propaganda used. Maybe I'm slow but the point that it was to personalize the impersonal nature of mass killings was lost on me. Perhaps most insultingly of all, the movie, despite how keenly it fetishizes holocaust imagery, doesn't give any kind of reflection on why the holocaust happened. No one is entirely sure but there is surely something to say about it. It's happy to talk about why people went along with it, but the mentalities of the axis peoples are lacking. That these people don't have more of a presence is a big hole in this movie.

Also, it's in English, which costs it a whole point out of ten from me. It should be in German. I am not German.

As snooty as this must sound, I am inclined to think that this movie was a case of people really falling for a sentimental, well produced collage of an historical even we all like to hold in mind but not really think too carefully about that compromised the art (and the very story it was supposed to tell) for artsiness.",3
1 September 2023,"A horrible, beautiful, essential film","When Steven Spielberg created Schindler's List, he made a film that is horrible, yet beautiful. It's impossible to look away at the atrocities happening on the screen, but what makes it even more awful is knowing these things happened in the real world. This is not a film that I can watch on a regular basis because it breaks my heart, weighs me down, and haunts me after every viewing. Each actor's performance, along with the carefully crafted filmmaking seems to be done with a sense of reverence to the real-life events. Schindler's List is an essential film. Everyone should watch it at least once.

30 March 2006,Wow...powerful,"I seen this movie...

It made you open your eyes. For once, torture CAN happen. If someone says they were going to kill someone, serious or not, they should of paid attention to Hitler.

But anyway...

I advise seeing this movie, only if you can gut shootings and also can accept the fact that we may never know what really gone on in the holocaust.

Life can go on... Life can go on with knowing what has happened to these people. For something being black and white...this is a really powerful movie. Forget the football players and other ""heroes"" in the world...These people, who survive...are heroes...for not ditching their faith.",9

28 September 2020,Its quite a story,"I didn't overly enjoy Schindler's List but I recognise it is an amazing story.

It is a true story that should be celebrated for the actions carried out during the most horrific of times.

A very different film from Spielberg who tends to tell more cartoonish fare.

As I said I didn't enjoy the movie that much but I applaud the film makers for highlighting such significant moments for us to learn from and to recognise for the stunning courage of people like Oskar Schindler.

10 January 2023,Schindler's List - A Classic Film of the Holocaust,"If you want to get a good feel for what it was like to be a Jew during the Holocaust, you will get a pretty good idea from watching this film. It examines not only the Holocaust itself, but the various schemes that had to be employed merely to survive from day to day during the reign of terror of the Nazis. One of the most clever schemes was one devised by Mr. Schindler, a man in charge of various projects near and around the death camp. He comes up with a scheme where he employs hundreds of death camp occupants, thus preventing them from being subject to the various dangers of the camp. Even though this bloated list is far above what he really needs, it helps some of the desperate prisoners from being liquidated. It is a very incisive film.

15 September 2007,Overrated but still worth watching,"Spielberg tends to get a bit overly cheesy in his films and this one is a prime example. Obviously the subject matter is intense and there are a lot of good qualities to the film but the ending was the part that really wrecked it for me and made me roll my eyes back in my head. Another example of an overly cheesed out ending that wrecked an otherwise great film was in Spielberg's 2001 film AI. I thought that was an excellent movie all the way up to the end when it just kept dragging on and on and got totally ridiculous. I don't think the ending on Schindler's List as bad as AI but it was still too much icing and not enough cake.

29 March 2019,Beyond Hollywood commercialism,"Unbelievable, but I've only just seen this film on Netflix for the first time. Wow! Never mind the Oscars and the hype and the PC holocaust themes. This is a piece of cinema that stands very very very tall all on its own cinematic parameters. Great script, acting superb all round, human themes moving and shattering, all the more because they're directed with understatement. I tried to get my eyes to stop streaming tears, to no avail. And the cinematography and the framing of every single scene is just impeccable, a masterclass of how it's supposed to be done. Citizen Kane, eat your heart out. It's so easy to laugh at some of Spielberg's other stuff, but this is just beyond reproach. His authentic heart just beats beautifully here. Bravo all round. Can't wait to see it again.

1 February 2021,"In a career with at least several masterpieces, this stands as Spielberg's best","Took me a good 10 years to revisit this, but I'm glad I did.

As fantastic as it is, it's not the kind of movie that's an easy rewatch, for obvious and very intentional reasons.

That being said, it is a gripping and incredibly well-paced movie. Calling it ""entertaining"" isn't accurate, as such a word might sound flippant when used to describe a movie with this kind of subject matter... but it is expertly paced and flows incredibly well, ensuring that the 195-minute runtime is more than warranted. There's a heavy use of titles- that might be the only noticeable shortcut it takes when helping the audience keep track of what's going on, what year it is, and what location the film is showing. Given that it's based on a real story, I think it's an acceptable strategy for contextualising the narrative that detracts very little.

Besides the expert writing and editing that ensures the film is engaging and well-paced, it's also worth nothing that it features three incredible performances from its leads (Liam Neeson has never come close to giving such a great performance again, Ralph Fiennes plays a genuinely terrifying and cold-blooded antagonist with disturbing effectiveness, and Ben Kingsley is amazing in a more understated performance- his acting was something I didn't appreciate as much on my first watch). The music is also amazing, with John Williams delivering another phenomenal score that is impossible to forget, and Spielberg's direction is impeccable, too. There are too many fantastic shots to note in one review, and the handheld camerawork here for some of the more intense sequences is - I would argue - even more effective than the much more famous use of handheld cameras in his other highly acclaimed war film, Saving Private Ryan.

There does persist an argument that Schindler's List is overly sentimental in some regards, considering its subject matter. I wouldn't disagree or argue with anyone who thought so, but would only say that from my perspective, and perhaps limited understanding, it feels genuine and accurately depicts the horrors of the Holocaust to an extent that I don't think it feels disrespectful. The scenes that aim to be horrific are absolutely horrifying. The last few scenes, however, are tearjerkers- Spielberg does want to highlight an act of good that occurred in a period of despair and evil. It's the approach he chose to make, and at the end of it, I didn't personally feel it undermined the horror he also chose to portray. I think if a filmmaker wants to do both and has the skill to pull it off, that's okay. Spielberg clearly has the skill to, in my opinion, and his Jewish heritage means I'd like to think he wouldn't have done the film in this manner unless he knew that it was respectful, and true enough to the real experience of those who lived through and suffered at that time in history. There were certainly still some survivors of the Holocaust alive in 1993, after all.

The issue of sentimentality aside (which is certainly not a problem for all viewers, it seems), Schindler's List is a technical marvel, and a rare 3+ hour epic that doesn't feel its length and more than justifies its running time. Visually it's amazing, the writing, acting, editing, and music are all phenomenal, and there are sequences of such immense power contained within that are impossible to forget (I was surprised by how much I'd actually remembered from that first viewing, even though it was about a decade ago).

It stands as probably Spielberg's best film, and the fact he released this the same year as maybe his 2nd or 3rd best film - Jurassic Park - more than cements him as one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, in all honesty.",10
8 January 2017,Topper,"The acting is brilliant, every actor does an amazing job. Liam Neeson as Schindler is incredible, no doubt about it. He should of won an Oscar for Best Actor. Ralph Fiennes is the one, who truly is the best actor in the film. He plays his antagonist role as Amon Goeth, so well that it is a travesty, he didn't win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.

I'm happy though, that the Academy chose this film for Best Picture, it was one of the best decisions they ever made. Because if this film wasn't considered Best Picture by the Academy, I don't know which film would be, expect maybe for The Godfather.

Steven Spielberg certainly deserved an Oscar for Best Director. It was a smart idea for Steven Spielberg to make this film in black-white because it made the movie more bleak, emotional, hopelessness. But you see small patches of color -- A candle and a child's coat bringing the evilness of the tragedy into a agonizing focus.

There's no doubt about it, this film will be a classic in decades, even hundreds of years to come in cinema. This film is without a doubt, the Best film that Spielberg has ever made. With many other Steven Spielberg's classics like Jurassic Park,Jaws,E.T, Raider of the Lost Ark, Saving Private Ryan, etc. Schindler's List will always be Steven Spielberg's most finest, important film. He blends his humanism to the tragic horror of the Holocaust to create an emotional masterpiece.

10/10 Absolutely Recommended!",10
1 May 2021,Masterpiece,"Realistically this is a film most people will only ever watch once. It's incredibly powerful and distressing. It's not a film you enjoy, more one that you experience.

I've seen this twice. Once when it was released and then 27 years later. That's how long it took me to draw the courage to re-watch it.

The first time I watched it the entire cinema was silent throughout and not a single person moved when the credits rolled at the end. In fact, many people sat there in tears until the credits had ended, motionless in utter silence not wanting to be the first person to get up and leave for fear of being seen as unfeeling.

The second time I watched it was very recently and as I now have 3 children, particular parts of it were gut wrenchingly miserable to watch, as a father.

No matter who you are or where you are from, you need to see this film at least once in your life. Despite its age, it stands as a timeless masterpiece of cinema.",10
22 July 2021,Morally heavy,"This film is as beautiful as it is morally heavy, that is really very much, but in any case it is very willing to watch even if it lasts an eternity and in some places it can be considered a little boring as well as generally extremely heavy to be supported morally, and for this reason it is a good film that it exactly transmits the message it wants to convey.

1 December 2021,Spielberg Proves He Could Be Taken Seriously,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.

13 August 1999,Black and White- yet no Grey.,"I'm going to have to agree with a previous comment that 'people only liked this because it was seen as unwise' to objectively comment. This was a 'cause movie'- and as such is no better, or no worse, than the others. Like 'Amistad' that followed it, it's plodding, pretentious and badly shot. The black and white cinematography lends nothing to it except the illusion of reality; which it isn't: it's a film. It's a story. Not a documentary. It's a constructed series of events, with 'characters' and a 'narrative' and a 'script'. The fact that the holocaust-survivors laud it as 'how it was' is the ultimate expression of its failure. The novel left you thankful that you weren't there, but never once made you feel like you were. Spielberg's film tricks you into imagining that it shows how terrible the holocaust was- it doesn't. And can't.

Many have stated that they 'understand' the events of Hitler's Germany through the movie. By giving them this false 'understanding'; Spielberg has cheapened it, and made it more comfortable than it should be. Subjectively, for many, this grants them leave to display false, *constructed*, grief for something that no amount of 'grieving' can in any way come to terms with.

As a film; a piece of fictionalised narrative, it suffers from hammy performances... most obviously the ridiculous Ralph Fiennes with his sitcom nazi- a safe, comfortable idea; neatly slotting him into the 'bad guys' package that drama utilises, but 'real life' finds no easy place for.

A film shot in black and white that regrettably uses these absolutes in its storytelling. An effective parable? Perhaps. But a worrying one.

18 February 2023,"Spielberg highlights that the feeling, sweetness and love of the world had to hide in the face of one of the greatest atrocities committed in the history of human civilization","""Schindler's List"" is a milestone, both for Spielberg's career and for modern cinema itself. Just the audacity of making a war epic lasting more than three hours and in black and white (there are few exceptions in color, basically the first and last scenes) already draws attention, but it goes beyond. The saga of the businessman of Polish origin who saw in the imminent conflict the opportunity to get rich without much effort, just taking advantage of the almost irrational hatred of the Germans for the Jews, and through this involvement discovered a way to save more than a thousand lives from certain death, has all the elements of a legitimate modern fairy tale: ambition, madness, violence, redemption, hope, victory. And if romance is lacking, we can stick to two points of view: the relationship between Schindler and his wife, Emilie, and how much she matures as a reflection of the protagonist's own change, or his involvement with his two antipodes - the Jew Itzhak Stern and the German Amon Goeth. One is intelligence, discretion and insight. The other is brute force, savagery and insanity. And Schindler seems lost between the two extremes, in a balance that he will not be able to maintain for long.

Oskar Schindler leaves his small town in the Polish countryside determined to make it in life. It's the middle of the 1930s in Germany, and there's little to do for those of Aryan origin. He ends up affiliated with the Nazi Party and, once close to the military that took over the government, he becomes an important ally. But he has no ethical or ethnic interests. His goal is to go after fame and fortune, regardless of how he achieves it. With that in mind, he manages to create a factory from scratch, using Jewish labor - the cheapest possible at that time - under the Nazis' assertion. Gradually, however, he realizes that his venture has also become a shelter, a point of refuge for the persecuted trying to escape from concentration camps and gas chambers. He who at the beginning was just a profiteer wanting to take advantage of a situation that was particularly favorable to him, little by little turns his actions into a libel in the name of life.

During this process, Schindler will encounter two important men standing in his way. Itzhak (Ben Kingsley) is an accountant who sees in that opportunity more than the chance of a good deal, but the perfect occasion to save his skin - and that of so many others as possible. He is appointed by the businessman to manage the business, and under his disguised consent, he uses this expedient to shelter acquaintances in despair. He is the true mind behind the great mission that bears Schindler's name. But for that, he also had to deal with the inflated ego and psychotic mind of the Nazi commander Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), a man consumed by his own dementia and contempt for others, who ends up flattered by his new friend's smooth talk and ends up letting himself be manipulated, finding himself in control of something that was really just a game for his suspicious friend. The way the protagonist deals with one or the other reveals a lot of the plot and what the film has to say about this incredible episode.

Anyone who knows the basics of history knows that the Nazis were defeated in World War II and, as the synopsis itself shows, you will realize that Oskar Schindler saved several Jews from the holocaust. So, given the success of the protagonist and the German defeat in the war, why does Schindler's List become melancholy? The answer is: Spielberg turns his story into a representation of all the suffering that the Jews had in that period. No wonder, the first scene of the feature, still in color, features a small group of Jews, who are not part of the plot, praying. There, the director makes it clear how he intends not only to address character arcs, but of an entire people. Therefore, it is necessary to highlight the excellent script written by Steven Zaillian, accurately punctuating all phases passed by Jews in the war. At the beginning, the group only suffers from humiliation and mandatory identification; then they are looted and driven from their homes; in the end, they agonize with slave labor and the holocaust. All of this is presented in detail by the script, with the right to long sequences, such as the SS soldiers invading the Jewish ghetto, making us witness the calamities that occurred with those people.

Zaillian's script also contributes to the public's immersion by presenting small blocks among the prisoners, whether men or women. That is, in addition to being interested in the protagonists, the film also highlights the drama of the powerless in the plot, further enhancing the drama. Incidentally, the screenwriter opts for the strategy of placing clues and rewards, presenting information to rescue them in the future, such as the moment when a Jewish woman tells her colleagues how a gas chamber works and, in the third act, they all almost go through it in Auschwitz, resulting in an extremely well-constructed script.

However, Schindler's List is not Steven Spielberg's masterpiece just for representing the horrors of war, the film has extremely well-built arcs. At the beginning, Oskar Schindler is presented as an elegant and nice man, but greedy. His initial motivations are purely financial, that is, like any other aspiring big businessman, the character seeks to exploit cheap labor to generate wealth. It is even admirable that the script does not place Oskar in a messianic position, presenting his womanizing side and individualistic goals to, only later, highlight his transformation initiated by the atrocities he sees. Incidentally, if there is an ethical guide to the feature, that someone is Stern, changing from a shy man to a guy who risks himself for others. Goth, on the other hand, not only represents the evil of the Nazis, but is also a clearly psychologically disturbed character, who seems unable to get rid of his own sadism, highlighting the type of people who commanded such a cruel regime.

These character arcs convince not only because of the excellent writing, but also because the cast is inspired. Liam Neeson highlights Schindler's change convincingly, building a roguish and attractive protagonist from the beginning, but changing the use of this ability over time, going from individualism to altruism, changes in feelings perfectly represented. Ben Kingsley, on the other hand, brings an intimate interpretation, composing Stern as a man who keeps much more than he externalizes. Finally, Ralph Fiennes, still at the beginning of his career, shows his gift for playing villains, transforming Amon Goth into a disgusting being, with a strange posture and frighteningly cruel.

Spielberg's courage in throwing the audience into that context is admirable, adopting the camera in hand at times and a slightly documentary language. By putting the viewer in the role of Nazi prisoners, the director makes us feel all the pain of those characters. Even here, Spielberg shows why he was called a master of suspense in ""Jaws"", building scenes that are simply agonizing, such as the one that brings Goth failing to shoot an elderly man, highlighting the excellent sound design that increases the noise of the weapon to enhance the tension of the scene. The director had a brilliant choice in adopting black and white in his film, showing how there is no color in an extremely cruel period, creating a melancholy and heavy atmosphere. Despite this, the photography is not limited by the absence of colors, on the contrary, the lighting work is impeccable in showing the essence of each character, such as, for example, keeping Schindler's eyes often lit or covering the faces of the Nazis with shadows. The framings remain open in the concentration camps to highlight the scale of the imprisoned Jews, while the close-ups are saved for more dramatic parts, inviting us to delve into the characters in their most vulnerable moments. Furthermore, the director is perfect when interspersing darkness, such as the arrival of the prisoner train at Auschwitz, with lighter parts, such as the fa√ßade of Oskar's factory, making the tone of each location evident.

Aware that the public expects light moments from the director, Spielberg even presents romanticized scenes, such as the moment when a disabled man thanks Schindler for his job, but, shortly after, subverts our expectations, showing the murder of the elderly man. With that, the director makes it clear that that film is not what we expected and that any sign of feeling present there can be eliminated with Nazi oppression. Another striking moment of subversion of expectations is when Oskar talks to Goth so that he is not an executioner and, when it seems that the Nazi will forgive everyone, he gives up on the idea and murders a teenager behind his back, shocking by his total lack of empathy.

And if we feel the terror experienced by the Jews in the war firsthand, it is also because Spielberg does not hesitate to represent the violence of the concentration camps and the sadism of the German soldiers. For the first time in his career, the director set aside the romantic vision to adopt realism, so we are faced with murders of children, homicides for pure pleasure and even burning bodies, evidencing the Nazi horror. Even when the director does not adopt violence, he impresses by creating psychologically disturbing sequences, such as, for example, Goth's harassment of his maid or the women's bath in Auschwitz (this, the most inspired moment of Spielberg's career). Furthermore, thanks to the impressive art direction, make-up and costumes, everything seen there convinces and conveys realism, creating a real impact on the public.

Spielberg highlights that the feeling, sweetness and love of the world had to hide in the face of one of the greatest atrocities committed in the history of human civilization.",10
17 June 2000,Frighteningly realistic,"Schindler`s List is an over 3 hour long drama in black/white. This in itself is more than enough to put off younger viewers from watching this film. The movie is about Oskar Schindler who came to Poland as a business man, and ended up saving 1100 Jews from extermination. The fact that the movie is filmed in black and white is quite a masterstroke from Steven Spielberg. This means that the movie looks like an old documentary, instead of a feature-film from Hollywood. The movie is packed with emotions and shows who war brings out the cruelty in all people. Being able to understand the German language, I was delighted to see that small-talk between the soldiers were in genuine German and not English. The scenes from the concentration-camps(KZ-LAGER)are really scary and nasty, but very realistic. Prepare yourself to watch the cruelties of the Nazis in a way that you won`t see in other feature-films, only in documentaries. 10/10

28 July 2021,A haunting Spielberg-masterpiece,"This movie is once again an attestment to the many sides of Steven Spielberg. He has captures generations of young people with movies like Indiana Jones, E. T. or Ready Player One. But he's also very capable in the drama department, as this acclaimed picture proves.

Shot in black and white in order to make it artistically resemble the classics, it sort of has a noir-feeling surrounding it, especially the first act of the movie - giving one of the best character introductions ever and letting Liam Neeson show of his acting range.

The movie is overall both very disturbing, yet very important. It tells a great story of an impressive man, whilst simultaneously putting us right in the centre of the holocaust like nowhere before. It doesn't shy away from the horrors or the messages of responsibility towards our fellow men that many sadly choose to ignore during these sorts of events.

Overall, it is a masterpiece by every sense of the word and a great insight into both the holocaust and Oscar Schindler's life.",10

11 August 2020,"Great Art Work, Beautifully Pictursied and Heart-to-heart","The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.

Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.

I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people.""",10

16 November 2020,"A haunting, heartbreaking but brilliant film","The film's slow at first, but after it pick up the pace, there was no slowing down, the stunning black and white cinematography creates a chilling viewpoint of the horrors of the holocaust, the distinction of the girl in the red dress, which was one of the turning point for Schindler was brilliant. The background score was gripping. Liam Neeson and Finnes were wonderful, both delivering passionate contrasting roles as a sympathetic industrialist and a brutal SS officer respectively. Steven Spielberg was at his best, the direction was brilliant and as was the writing.

There were many heart-touching moments in the film especially the ending scene, where Liam breaks down and saying he could have done more, it was very emotional. The moral message of the film is powerful. A movie worthy of applause.

2 February 2019,The best one of Spielberg,"After many years I watched it again. This story about Jewish people who were forced to work for the Nazis in Schindler's factory is based on true events. It's told very carefully and shows many aspects on the human side. It was never boring and the sceneries were really well done. The main actors Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley delivered an outstanding performance. I didn't like therefore the black and white color. A must see for all. 10/10.

11 August 2021,A Tragic Hidden Gem with an Outstanding Message,"This realistic black-and-white portrayal of the horrors of the Holocaust is so disturbing, lifelike, heartbreaking and painful that you won't stand to witness it again, but can agree it owns unique significance. Seriously, Steven Spielberg has mastered depicting the pure evil of concentration camps in just about every single manner.

This historical war-related drama never shies away from brutal violence and horrific imagery, but also demonstrates that all it takes is one. It just takes one to make a massive and an extremely impactful difference. Schindler's List is an amazing masterpiece that deserves its honour for several reasons other than just expertly-directing and astonishing performances. Stop there, severe thanks to Liam Neeson's amazing performance representing an impatient war profiteer to a sincere hero.

Why Schindler's List is so important and should certainly be seen by everyone is because of the whole depiction itself. Despite a 3-hour runtime, teens and adults will be strongly moved by the terror of concentration camps and the dread of the Auschwitz. The black-and-white fashion surprisingly increases the level of reality, accompanied by painfully graphic detail to reach the brim. Seriously, an amazing masterpiece! A truthful must-watch! There's just some slowness prior to the the beginning of the shattering.",8

30 April 2020,Top Film for Its Time but So Much Left to Be Told,"This 1993 American semi-biographical film about Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories. Directed by Steven Spielberg and based on a novel Thomas Keneally, it stars Liam Neeson as Schindler and was filmed in part in Krakow, Poland. In its time this was heralded as a breakthrough film, but since the fall of the fall of communism, so much more has come to light about heroism and collaboration that this film no longer has the impact it had upon release.

29 June 1999,path of least resistance,"Steven Spielberg used to entertain us; now he educates us as if he were entertaining, and his films are leaden with their messages: slavery is bad, the Holocaust was bad, D-day was bloody. He keeps taking the path of least resistance. He used to charm us with his imagination; in ""Schindler's List"" he abandons imagination for the sake of repellent explicitness. It left me longing for the days of ""Forbidden Games."" Meanwhile, having succeeded in dumbing down American moviemaking-as-entertainment in the 80s to the level of ""The Goonies"" and ""Batteries Not Included,"" he proceeds to dumb down the Holocaust with the introduction of fake art-house effects and fairy tale symbolism. In interviews following the film's release he said that the making of the film had so opened his eyes to the horrors of the Holocaust that he regretted having used the Nazis as villains in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""; apparently he literally needs a picture drawn for him -- a moving one -- and assumes that we do, too. It made me wonder if he would go back to ""Raiders"" if he could and digitize all the fun away.

The story, screenplay, acting, storytelling, direction.. everything was strong. You will not be able to find a single mistake.

This movie is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. The climax scene (final farewell scene) was emotional for me.

This movie should be watched by everyone. This is a true masterpiece.

Near the middle of the movie I gave up trying to hold in my tears and had to struggle to at least make my sobs inaudible. It was heart-wrenching on so many levels. Namely the unspeakable horrors that were commited against the Jews. But also, the inner struggle of a man having to come to terms with his own morality.

25 April 2019,Fifty Fifty,"This movie is half good, half bad. Since I like newer movies, and don't know how people lived before, and don't like old times, that would be major reason why it is bad. There is lack of technology, colors, all the new stuff we got used to. If you are watching this because of Taken and Liam Neeson, I will tell you, it's worse than that, but not the worst. The good half part of this movie is good actor Liam Neeson, good effort to make it real (so many people and so much effort to make it look real). My advice is to watch this only if you like Liam Neeson (because of Taken) or if you like this genre. You won't be disappointed, even when much younger, Liam still looks like in Taken. And I prefer his role in action, thriller, mystery movies. Good movie for people especially teachers who like history, drama, biography, documentary. This movie's main topics are history, war, jews, world war, and evil.

29 July 2021,Artistically cruel,"Spielberg said in an interview that he 'felt very strongly that the sequence had to be almost unwatchable' about ghetto liquidation scenes. He achieved his goal for sure. 'Schindler's List' is so uncomfortable to watch from the start to the end. Crime against humanity is conducted in a very inhumane way and the movie displays what happened without a filter. Amon hunting human beings for fun, elders running naked in front of all people for medical check-up, and separating children from their parents, and etc. Too painful to watch.

Juxtaposition of what happens to Jews and what officers are doing increases the effect of the cruelty. When Jews are naked in front of people and forced to run for the medical check-up, Spielberg places SS officers casually talking and laughing, not even giving a glance at what is happening. In the ghetto liquidation sequence, what we see is callous mass murder, but officers drink cognac with the ghetto as a background. Grand classic orchestra is playing with thunder-like gunshots, and lighting of the gunshots sparkles in the windows like photoflash, recreating the party gatherings of German officers in the beginning. When Amon is shooting and man-hunting just for fun without any remorse, he is shirtless showing off fat stomach and his partner is shirtless lying on the bed, not surprised at all, maintaining her coolness. Two are as lazy as they can be while Jew's life is hanging on Amon's arbitrary mind. By contrasting the very opposite, the audience once again feels this inhumanity of Nazi regime deeply.

'Schindler's List' is a black-and-white movie, so it feels timeless, which I think is appropriate for documenting history. There are only two scenes that show color: the girl in the red coat and the candle for Jews' religious assembly. Both cases signify hope, a hope that people will survive, that there will be a helping hand like Schindler's, and that this hell will be over soon. On the contrary, gas and smoke indicate ominous happenings such as gas chamber and train smoke, serving as repeated indicators.

'Schindler's List' is, in my opinion, the best direction of Spielberg. Direction-wise, he gave meaning and messages in every single scene. They are not too evident but very subtle and delicate. The purpose is to show both Schindler's life and the inhumanity of Holocaust, and he achieved both. Going back and forth between one's personal journey & growth and social situation smoothly is hard, and if it is not naturally done, the whole movie can collapse. However, Spielberg manages to develop both sides to the level of perfection.",8
26 December 2020,Life Is Not in Black & White,"Schindler's List does indeed have many positive things going for it: great acting, beautiful cinematography, solid pacing, and a wonderfully emotive score by John Williams. The story is good and one that needed telling, and one that often times moved me. My only reservation is the somewhat one-dimensional characterizations. Everyone is the clearly drawn as either very good or very bad, black and white, this doesn't leave the viewer with much room to think and consider when everything is fed to us. Despite this shortcoming Schindler's List is one to see.

12 December 2020,Masterful....,"This is a rare movie which genuinely made me feel sad, happy, anxious and horrified in one afternoon, I can't think of an able counterpart... Late Mr. Ebert told in his review that Fiennes plays it too demented, as if the whole Nazi movement could be simply branded as evil- I disagree, it's subtle nuances in Fiennes's performance that show you how complex these characters really were.Cold, psychotic, resolute on the outside and torn apart with his lust for Jewish girl and the hardwired need to hate her people... It's incredible just how he pulls it off; In my opinion he made the movie, it wouldn't have worked with some other random actor.And not to say that I'm trying to justify Nazi movement, on the contrary, I'm only saying these people need to be understood and their actions put in a greater context, maybe Amon is a bad example, but a lot of those foot soldiers were just following orders. We can't just tag them as evil, as that's not enough, don't forget- they were able to seduce a complete nation, you can't do that just by playing evil, other factors come into play.It is exhausting movie to sit through, but in a good way, I would urge everyone ,as I have my complete family, to watch this milestone in cinema, such is its cultural impact... Only by watching this film and then dissecting it, can we truly appreciate its message- we are not born evil, we become evil when we fall under someone's spell and who intricately covers our eyes, by blaming everything that is wrong with our world, onto someone who is an easy target and can't defend for themselves... Only by including this film into mandatory school viewing can we only prevent that horrible event from happening ever again. People must understand, it's the only way to go about it...",9

11 September 2000,let's correct the image of the evil german nazi?!,"Cinematographically perfect, deeply moving, tragic, horrifying -- and yet I give the movie an F.

The movie depicts a German nazi who slowly becomes aware of the criminal nature of national socialism and from that moment on tries to save the lives of Jews by hiring them for his alleged mat√©riel factory.

Now, the point is, the film premiered at a time when the majority political as well as public opinion in Germany agreed (it still does, and more than ever!) that there should be a close to the debate about ""this darkest epoch in German history"". I have the disagreeable feeling that in Germany - maybe elsewhere, too - the message of movie is: ""Yes, there *were* Germans opposing nazism, but now lets no longer talk about this topic. Period.""

However, as long as the causes for fascist thought persist, history has got to be told!

Spielberg does tell an impressing story, but unfortunately the wrong one; which is not to say that Schindler didn't take the right decision, rather that it would have been wiser to make a movie about a non-nazi antifascist.",1

21 November 2020,An emotional and touching film 8/10,"""Schindler's List"" is a powerful and touching film. To many who may agree is Spielberg's greatest creation and at the same time his most hardest. It is powerful with its story, characters and cinematography. It is also touching cause of it's hard scenes and emotions that are shown. This movie may not be easy for anyone to simply watch and understand. Besides many films about the holocaust have been made before, ""Schindler's List"" is an exception cause of its beauty and how stunning it is. The holocaust is not a simple subject to either discuss or show in cinema, even Spielberg was criticized for making such a film because it was totally different from what he used to make. But Spielberg wanted to make a statement. In the next decades maybe all the holocaust survivors will pass away and it is our duty as a society to keep telling their stories and remembering what happened. Spielberg knew that this tragic event must be remembered for decades after all survivors have passed. It is essential for humanity to learn from these mistakes and tragic events for years to come, in order for them to never accure again. I loved the use of black and white during the entire film, only at the end when the sequence is all colored I felt touched by the emotion and closure to the story of the ""Schindler Jews"". The little girl during the movie with the red coat is also a powerful moment cause of how visible the girl is during the scene and yet doesn't seem to be hurt nor killed. Until later on it is seen she is killed. Overall this is a must watch movie, an essential one for all those who heard of the holocaust and in general for everyone to watch. As I said earlier, as a society it is our duty to learn from this event and to be sure it will never happen again.",8

22 January 2009,A notable achievement despite some unnecessary melodrama towards the end,"Schindler's List is a notable achievement for Spielberg. Here he presents a harrowing account of the horrors suffered by the Jews in World War II, along with a generally uplifting story of hope. All three major performances (Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes) are solid, specially Fiennes, who is impressive as an evil Nazi. The film is careful to present him as a fully formed character rather than a caricature. The clearance of the Jews from the Warsaw ghetto is shown in unsparing detail and without a trace of sentiment. Alas, Spielberg slips up in the end with a fake-sounding speech from Oskar Schindler melodramatically lamenting his inability to do more. Still strongly recommended.

Overall 9/10

17 June 2022,This film is perhaps Spielberg's greatest accomplishment.,"It offers a sobering perspective on the events of the Holocaust, and though it may not be appropriate for some younger audiences, it is a must-see film for anyone who wishes to understand this period in history.

What's interesting about this movie is that a part from the language, you can tell that Hollywood still has it as a piece of history of WWII. It's been over 20 years since this movie was first released, and there are still details about the Holocaust that isn't widely known for many people today. The story had a great concept, and I think it was put together pretty well despite being based on the real events.

29 August 2011,I didn't like it but a lot of people do,"This movie was not good at all in my mind. First avole it was directed by Steven Spielberg who usually directs amazing movies. This however I found it very boring. It was shot in black and white and stars Liam Neesan. I truly hate both of those things.

This movie is about the nazi holocaust and concentraction camps. It tell the true story of Oskar Schindler (Neesan) who is a member of the Nazi party, however disagrees about what the Nazis are doing to the jews. He uses his money and his power to save jew lives.

I know it sounds good but it really isn't. Liam Neesan cant act in my opinion and black and white loses a lot of the effect which is ironic because they made it black and white for the effect. I just found this movie boring it didn't even have any intense scenes. Skip this one movie goers

19 November 2022,3 Hours of Emotion,"I'm going to try and keep this short but to start of, Liam Neeson's acting the word flawless springs to mind. He is easily the star of the film ""Schindlers List"". His emotions especially towards the end being able to go to a broken man sent tears going down my face as much as he had tears going down his, I think the last time I have cried this hard at a film was Forrest Gump.

Going to give a shout out to John Williams for the music for this film especially the theme (reprise) as it perfectly captures the horror and the beauty of the film, I use it now sometimes if I need to get to sleep as its so fantastic and graceful.

Everyone says Steven Spielberg's best films go along the lines of Jaws or the Indiana Jones Films. But this is easily his most thought provoking and emotional achievement (And yes I am taking Saving Private Ryan into account while making this statement).

This film might be hitting the 3 hour mark but the tears will be pouring ( if they aren't something might be wrong with you), but it is definitely one everyone needs to see at least once in their lives and to get a rough idea on what it was like in the WW2 work camps.",10
30 December 2022,Heartbreaking,"I loved this movie. It is definitely one of, if not the, best holocaust movies I've ever seen. Not only was the film quality, script, and acting superb, there was also immense attention to detail in the story line. Many of the events that take place in the movie are accounts of real life events. The scene where the man survives capture by saying he was tasked with moving luggage out of the road for example, is something the real life counterpart of the portrayed character actually experienced. Heartbreaking, touching, and an absolutely masterpiece. I am so glad I watched this movie, and I think it's a movie everyone should watch once in their lifetime.

25 November 2012,"Epic, but fail to be believable enough for me","An epic true statement about probably the only member of the Nazi party that saved the victims behind one of the most atrocious massacre in history...and surprisingly, despite the heart-wrenching details and the inhumane deeds being presented on-screen, it gave off quite an overall positive impact too.

However, It failed to be included into my top list. Considering the weight of the subject matter, i expected a lot more from this movie. I believe the movie could have investigated things deeper and further given the amount of time allocated to this movie.

But it didn't, and some of the scenes behave in a way that I think it was kind of sugarcoated, or over-dramatized, that sometimes I wonder whether the scenes meant to emulate the harsh truth of war did serve their purpose. I am not saying the atrocities should have been made more gory - it doesn't need to - all I am asking and expecting is to do more justice to viewers who are relying on this movie to understand what has happened in a the full extent of this historical chapter.",5

14 July 2018,The Most Rewatchable Hard-to-Watch Movie Ever!,"A film shot in a documentary style can be wrenching and brutal, but can it also be as poignant and touching as usual great drama films? Yes, Spielberg proved this is very possible! I was overwhelmed with all different feelings throughout its 3 hours and 15 minutes runtime. This movie's catharsis is even may be stronger than any movie I've watched in my life!

Neeson's performance as Oskar Schindler is easily his best performance ever. He brought his character to life which is already can be top any list for top 10 most complex and compelling characters in film.

Schindler's List is undoubtedly a masterpiece, and easily one of, if not the best Spielberg's films, and its greatness made it the most rewatchable hard-to-watch movie ever!

17 May 2020,Not all that.,"I really don't understand the over the top praise for this film. The lockdown has meant I've had the time to watch longer films, and this is one I wanted to be able to sit down and fully concentrate on.

So, lights off and here we go. Three hours fifteen minutes later, was that it? This is what people have raved about?

Competent all round yes, but a work of genius? No.

I've seen it once and will never feel the need to revisit it.

19 September 2000,You may like it or not!,"Some people think that it is a good movie, some think that it is bad. It is a great achievement after all, cause it made me think of all the horror that had happened, again. No movie, no book, not even talking to a person who was in a concentration camp can bring you the horror in its full scope. Schindler's List is just a little part of the history of cruelty in World War 2, and Saving Private Ryan just another. Both Films had a deep impact here in Germany. Good or bad, it is good that so many young people find their interest in the darkest chapter of a civilized world.

14 February 2020,History reframed as art.,"Arguably Spielberg's greatest and most honest achievement and inarguably one of the most important films ever made. Spielberg, using the cinematic medium, connects its audience through time to raise awareness to the fact stranger than fiction of this history. Spielberg justifies making this film by not wasting one single frame to tell of the brutality and hope, it's an epic, it's watchable, and in making it so, means you can't look away.

2 October 2018,A review from 2018 - moving all the way through,"This is actually my first review on IMDB, and I would be the last to expect it being written about a black and white movie from 1993. This probably says a little about my prejudice on ""old"" movies in black and white. That said.

Some here believe Schindlers List is way too long a movie and dull. Over rated. I beg to differ. The fact that the movie is black and white does not bother me. You notice it in the beginning, but you quickly get used to it. As Ben Kingsley in the role of Itzhak Stern says; the movie is filmed in a way that seems to capture it as if it were filmed right there in 1940.

Another remark I would like to make in the beginning, is that my class, a bunch of 13-year olds, watched this film at school. I thought it was way too long, boring, and ugh, in black and white. I got the impression most of my classmates thought the same. Based on this experience, and that I just yesterday, at the age of 25, watched the movie again, I would say most teenagers (12-15) won't enjoy the movie as it should be enjoyed.

Since this is my first review it's probably too long and incoherent. I apologise. Steven Spielberg's story telling is capturing. Not for one moment did I expect or wish that the movie would come to an end. I am especially impressed by Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley - although that is evident, and predictable, should you watch the movie and enjoy it.

As a true movie fan and lover, I would say it in this simple way - the movie kept me watching to the end with a mix of horror an awe - and although most of this was sad and gruesome - the ending made me cry.

I have, admittedly, had a fascination for the holocaust and WW2 the last week, something that maybe makes me biased. Going into watching this, I thought; this is a movie from 1993, in black and white. Also a very delicate subject is being presented here, which maybe makes the movie ""good"" in a sense because the story and reality of the events is so realistic. I can only conlude that this is a very good film.",10
16 October 2021,Great movie from a master story teller!,"The reason I liked this movie is that it tells the story in so skillful a way that it feels like I was one of the characters in the movie. Thank you all who brought this epic story together.

5 September 2020,"Heartbreaking and Heartwarming, an Essential Film for All Humans","""Schindler's List"" is a movie that both shows us the best and the worst of humanity. It's an enthralling work of cinematic mastery, and I think that it is a film that every human being should watch. That's not hyperbole or exaggeration. The atrocity that the Nazi regime committed against the Jewish population will always be remembered as one of the most despicable acts of history. But the film is more than scenes of brutality. We are also shown that trauma and war can often bring out the most brave and heroic actions.

The film focuses on the actions of Oskar Schindler, played brilliantly by Liam Neeson. Schindler runs a factory that makes pots and pans, and he is initially very cozy and close with high ranking members of the Nazi Party. Through bribes and lavish parties, Schindler is able to gain a tremendous amount of political power and he is also able to secure a source of free labor: recently displaced Jews who now live in the cramped ghettoes of Krak√≥w, Poland. Schindler is assisted by Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), a Jewish accountant who manages the financials of Schindler's factory. After a period of comfort and stability, Amon G√∂th (Ralph Fiennes) takes charge as the new commandant of Krak√≥w. G√∂th orders the liquidation of the ghetto and the subsequent transplant of the Jews to the nearby Plasz√≥w concentration camp. The rest of the film involves Schindler's shift from a greedy factory runner to becoming more and more empathetic of the Jewish strife. Schindler's character arc is placed opposite G√∂th's unchanging brutality and psychopathic fits of rage.

There is lots of symbolism to behold in this movie. Some are more obvious, such as the girl in the red dress and the candles. But I think just the contrast between Schindler's and G√∂th's differing aspects of man's treatment of fellow man is what elevates this film and moves me, personally. There are many examples within the film, scenes with Schindler and G√∂th played back to back where we see their reactions to events play out in starkly different ways. You could really tell this kind of a story in a variety of different settings, but the Holocaust is definitely one that hits many emotional chords.

On top of it being one of the best depictions of the Holocaust in cinematic history, the deeply layered thematic storytelling, as well as top-notch acting, cinematography, and direction from the venerable Steven Spielberg, ""Schindler's List"" is certainly one of the greatest films of all time. It's not a film that you watch for entertainment, it is one to be cherished as a work of art, and as one that will educate and move future generations to never forget our past, both the courageous and the depraved.",10
7 December 2002,A wonderful movie,"First of all, I'm german, that's why I watched the movie from another point of view. I think you can't say this movie is good or bad. It wants you to remember what terrible things happened in history and just think about them. It's very hard to describe for a german but everything showed in this movie is true, it's fact. There's no hidden message so you can really think about the things happening. After watching this movie you will never think about the holocaust as you did before. I have to thank Steven Spielberg for this experience...

2 September 2020,Wow just wow,"From the very beginning till the end, I was just star struck. The scenes, the acting, just everything. It came together so nicely. I must say while this film was very amazing, what made this film even better was how true it stuck to history. I was able to relate scenes in the movie with my history class and I even learnt more in depth on some aspects.

This movie is so beautiful put together that I can't even begin to express how amazing it is. All I'll say is that this is definitely a film I'd recommend to everyone (though a certain level of maturity is still necessary).

28 June 2019,"A Horrific, Depressing, Honest yet also an Occasionally Hopeful and Beautiful Film from Steven Spielberg","Schindler's List is long, depressing, horrific and is in no means an easy film to watch but I personally believe all humans need to watch it to have a greater insight on the atrocity that was the Holocaust. The film has incredible acting with Liam Neeson giving the best performance of his career as Oskar Schindler the first flawed then latter redeemed protagonist of the film, not to mention Ben Kinglsley as Itzhak Stern and Ralph Fiennes as the horrific, evil and vile yet also human Amon Goeth the ruthless Nazi commandant of the Krakow-Plaszow concentration camp. The use of black and white is extremely well used by Spielberg giving the visuals a blunt almost nonchalant feeling of honesty about the events unfolding. But what is truly special is how he uses a small amount of color at certain moments in the film, like for instance the little girl in the red coat, that adds to the emotions being felt onscreen. Schindler's List is also incredibly tense at times. The threat of the Jewish characters being killed is constantly lingering with some scenes like the showers in Auschwitz and a worker being taken out back of the factory being unbearable to watch at times. But with all the horrible inhuman actions happening, the film also is quiet beautiful and hopeful and heartwarming towards the end that is sure to leave most audience members weeping. Schindler's List is a haunting film that will leave you emotionally broken by the end of it but will give you a greater insight and understanding of the truly inhuman acts committed during the holocaust that is important for all people to recognize and come to terms with.",9

20 April 2023,My favorite movie from Steven Spielberg,"If I really had to pick a problem, I'd say the first hour of the movie, while not terrible at all, felt a little bit underwhelming. It was still shot brilliantly, edited brilliantly, acted well and was still visually stunning. But I felt like it was not fully giving the gothic and horrifying imagery that I thought I was going to get. Only one man is shot from what I remember in the first hour. But the film immediately gets better when Ralph Fiennes appears as Amon Goth. Fiennes gives a horrifying and powerful performance and makes the film become a 10/10. The gothic imagery also becomes horrifying and heartbreaking to watch. It also has much better pacing, writing and also establishes a horrifying and gothic atmosphere that makes it so good. The acting from everyone is out of this world. Liam Neeson is absolutely phenomenal as the titular Oskar Schindler and gives a powerful and heartbreaking performance. Fiennes as I said earlier becomes a god-send to a first act and immediately makes the movie better because of his performance and the intimidation he gives in the way he portrays Goth. Ben Kingsley gives a fantastic performance as well knowing how to portray a person who is willing to help a man who works for the Nazi party who turns into a good person. But knows without him he'll probably be killed by the Nazis. The cinematography and editing are absolutely phenomenal forming a documentary style of the movie that in some ways is similar to the 1975 film Shoah which really fits the tone of the movie. The music is also phenomenal. I mean it's John Williams and he almost always does a perfect job establishing the film's tone and style of the film. With a gorgeous main theme to establish the heartbreaking and horrifying scenes you'll see later. Seeing the corpses of the Jewish people being burned is extremely heartbreaking to watch. I can see why this is one of the greatest films of all time because of the cinematography, editing, the performances, Spielberg's direction, the visuals, the themes, the messages, the music, the sound design, the writing, the tone, the style and the atmosphere of the film.",10
21 November 2005,"I'm sorry, but it's awful","I don't know what to say about this movie. I had never seen it, so when I received it this spring I was eager to watch it. I find the subject of the Holocaust to be fascinating (not in a good way) because it's just astounding that this actually happened. It baffles the mind how this could occur on such a grand scale. I'm always watching shows on the history channel about WWII and the Holocaust and so I had very high expectations for this movie. So, I put it in my DVD player and sat down to watch a movie about a subject that I have a lot of interest in. Three hours later I felt as if every ounce of life had been sucked from my body. I was bored to death. I could never get emotionally attached to anyone in the movie. I know this sounds bad but I never felt sorry for anyone in this film. This film felt like it had no real vision or direction and it never bothered to develop any characters; everyone in the movie came across as wooden figures to me.

Now comes the real question; should a person watch a movie about the Holocaust expecting to be entertained? Well, the answer to this question is both yes and no. You shouldn't be entertained because it covers such a dark subject but anyone who enjoys history could be entertained because it covers significant event in human history. This where the film fails. It covers the event but it doesn't attempt to make the movie interesting, Spielberg must of decided that the subject matter alone was interesting enough and left it at that.

I can watch a show about the Holocaust on the history channel and I will be more emotionally attached to the people in that one hour show than I will be to anyone in that three hour boring film, Schlinder's List. I'm sorry but that's poor execution on Spielberg's part.",1
18 October 2020,Horrors like no other,"In World War 2 in Krak√≥w the Germans force Polish Jews into the Ghetto. Oskar Schindler, an ethnic German, Nazi Party member and businessman from Czechoslovakia, acquires a factory to make his fortune. He employs Jews to save them from concentration camps.

A haunting film which brings home the horror of the Holocaust in a way no other film has done. Filmed with great effect in black and white, this is one of Spielberg's finest. Liam Neeson stars in the title role with Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley in support. A must watch.

4 August 2023,Wow! Devastating! A must-see! Spielberg makes it again! Masterpiece! ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER MADE!,"""The list is life""

A great visual piece! Filming and directing is extremely good, perfect and manages to make the film feel real.

The use of light and shadows is perfect to the cameras!

Acting is amazingly performed and feels aswell very authentic.

A very important, sad, dark and heavy film that everyone needs to see!

That Spielberg and the production decided to do this in black and white, makes it a very unique and interesting modern cinema history, but it fits very good and makes the storytelling feels more genuine.

The red girl is genius symbolise the hope and power for change.

A very interesting perspective into moral.

You will easily notice its a film that stands out and its extremely well made!

Spielberg certainly knows how to tell a story!

Its a fantastic and devastating film from the start all the way to the end!

A true masterpiece displaying the true horror of history!

Definitely deserved its Oscars!

This should be shown around the world in schools for everyone!

Beautiful ending! A masterpiece of human creation!

Totally a must-see at least once in your life!

And if either Tom Hanks or Tommy Lee Jones think that they will ever be forgiven for robbing, repectively, Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes of Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor in 1993 for their performances in Philadelphia and The Fugitive(?!), they ae sorely mistaken. I thank you.

23 August 2023,Spielberg's best.,"Schindler's List.

In German-occupied Poland during World War II, industrialist Oskar Schindler gradually becomes concerned for his Jewish workforce after witnessing their persecution by the Nazis.

Schindler's list is one of the best drama movies and biopics I've ever seen, undoubtedly it is a strong one that tries to show the suffer of the Jews in Poland back to the world war II, it's not the only movie that covers this matter, I've watched The Pianist the thing that made me appreciate more and more this masterpiece, you can see clearly that Spielberg's movie inspired the other one .

I haven't seen a lot of Spielberg's work but he's definitely one of the best actif and living directors, one of the directors who worked a lot through different generations...

This movie wouldn't be that great without Liam Neeson who made a great performance, probably his best as I need to mention that Ralph Fiennes did a wonderful job too.

The cinematography and using the black and white was very successful, serving the plot and time era, besides I really loved the soundtracks in this movie.",9
25 August 2020,Overrated title in my opinion.,"The black and white film was a poor choice that eliminated the potential for any visual mastery since Spielberg isn't very good with black and white filming. There simply isn't any beautiful imagery or camera work in this film, a lot of intense set pieces (luggage stacked up, etc) but the camera glides by real quick in a hurry. It's a strange choice not to loom over the set a little longer, considering it is a 3 hour long picture.

In the end it is very boring. The first hurdle is the acting level, Leem Neeson just isn't very good. Then this is emphasized by the poor accent from Ralph Finnes, the conversations between the two come across very poorly rehearsed and amateurish.

What echoes the filming quality and acting quality is nearly all the scenes with extras, all seeming to be amateurs and not actors with any chops at all. I saw straight through it all, in some scenes the extras are smiling. This is supposed two be the persecution of the Jewish people from the Nazis... Why the heck are people smiling without any context? Also if they are not smiling they are just normal faced, not distressed, angry, confused, in pain or otherwise.

This is mirrored by the one dimensional antagonist, who spends nearly every second on film shooting random Jews. It is extremely contrived and I don't believe a single frame of it. This is poorly researched crap made into popcorn material for the sake of pulling emotional strings. Well, it didn't work on me.

If you want to see some real mastery and horror shown in this topic then I recommend 'Conspiracy', A HBO for TV movie on a secret meeting that pushes forward the plans for the death trains and concentration death camps... that will blow you away. Failing this, I would recommend Band of Brothers, a ten part mini series that covers american soldiers going to the front lines in WW2.

I give this a 5/10 as an average film. Usually this rating and below I give to films I would never watch again, including this one.",5

6 July 2021,"If all but a few movies are erased from human memory, let Schindler's List be one that remains.","Schindler's List is simply Steven Spielberg's greatest movie. I dare you to challenge this. Sure, ET is great, and so is Jurassic Park, and so forth. But out of all the movies that Spielberg has directed, how can any of them top the power and importance of this one?

Schindler's List tells the true story of Oskar Schindler, portrayed wonderfully by Liam Neeson. He is a German who saved the lives of over 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust. Schindler does this out of greed, making them low wage workers in his factory for his benefit, but he later does it out of compassion for his fellow man.

That's the theme of the movie that echoes throughout long after the credits roll, and this is where the film's power stems from. The Nazis considered Jews to be ""vermin"" and not humans worthy of love, care, or compassion. Oskar Schindler over time sees that they ARE in fact worthy, and uses this basic human value to change the world.

Steven Spielberg waited over a decade to make this movie, because even though he wanted to do it after making E. T., he felt that he wasn't ready to tackle the Holocaust yet. (Note that Spielberg himself is Jewish.)

The time he took is well worth it, since he crafted the movie so well. Using beautiful black and white cinematography, he makes this tragic event come alive to those who were not there to see the unspeakable event.

Since this movie is centered around the greatest tragedy in all of human history, the film gains an R Rating for it's realistic violence. Prepare for Jews to be shot, burned, or gassed for what they believe in. It's hard to watch, but it's the most effective quality. There were people who took pleasure in killing millions of their own kind, and Spielberg exposes this horror to perfection.

This shows how Schindler's List won 7 Oscars, including Steven's sole Best Picture win and his first of 2 Best Director wins(the other being for Saving Private Ryan). All 7 are well earned for this fantastic movie.

I first saw this in 10th grade in History class, so I was 16. I would say 15 or 16 would be the best age to see this, and I say that because while everyone should see Schindler's List, it is not for the young, and historical prior knowledge is necessary.

Aside from the flaw of crimes against humanity, my only critique of Schindler's List is that the German accents of Non-German actors are so thick that I needed subtitles to follow the dialogue. Apart from this, Schindler's List is nothing short of a masterpiece.

Despite it's grim subject matter, Schindler's List must be seen, even if just once. Thank you, Oskar Schindler for your heroic act, and thank you Steven Spielberg for telling us his incredible story. By doing so, you have given us the best movie about the Holocaust ever made.

This is a powerful film that will leave a great impact on you. It should never be forgotten. If all but a few movies are erased from human memory, let Schindler's List be one that remains.",10

5 April 2013,Memorable film of Jewish oppression during WWII,"This film is for those older than 16. It is not a chic flick nor a family film. It is a thought provoking film dealing with the Jewish oppression in WWII. The film captures your attention and holds it throughout the film. The actors Liam Neeson, Ben Kingley and Ralph Fiennes do give a stellar performance. However, it is the supporting cast which makes the film work. I would have rated it higher if the film could have stayed within my 2 hour bottom limit. Although a memorable film and a film which deals with such a politically charged subject, I feel that I was not so entertained as I was educated, even though it is a work of fiction. Not a film for those wanting entertainment. It is a thought provoking film that all should watch at some time.

28 November 2003,Nazis and Saddam,"I've watched Schindler's List twice now, a fine movie and a reasonably accurate record of those events. Events? Hmm what a curious word to use. The sheer horror, brutality and inhumane treatment of Jewish people is a scar that Germany must bear for all eternity. So why, in God's name did the USA just sit by and do nothing. America has always had a large jewish population and reports of the holocaust must have filtered through to the authorities. In 2003 the USA goes to war on Iraq and the Saddam Hussein regime. Nothing can ever compare Saddam's reign with that of Adolf Hitler. And yet, the Americans did nothing. It took the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the US Fleet to awaken them, but how do you tell millions of Jews including so many, many children that only the Japanese attack was important enough for America to enter the war.

19 April 2023,Humanity's Worst and Best displayed in a Single Film..,"The genocide of Jews in Second World War has been portrayed on screen time and again, but none has been as widely recognized and praised as Steven Spielberg's Iconic Film centering on an opportunistic, womanizer, war profiteer who became World's Greatest Humanitarian. The carefully constructed plan of Nazis to ostracize the thriving, affluent community of Jews, throwing them into slums, and dehumanizing them to such a horrifying extent, that at the end they are herded like mere sheeps for slaughter in the Concentration camps. The horrifying scenes stick in your brain, and with John Williams' iconic score your heart bleeds again and again. Brilliant performances from Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley elevate this film and especially Ralph Fiennes' Aemon Goeth, is a character that exudes such rare kind of evil, it will send chills down your spine. This landmark film needs to be seen by everyone to understand what evil humans are capable of unleashing, and how humans no matter how many faults they have, can stand up for whats right.

18 July 2001,Everyone should watch this film,"This is almost certainly the finest film I have seen to date, with Saving Private Ryan, another Spielberg film coming a fairly close second. Everything about this film is designed to try and raise awareness of actual events in their gruesome detail. Spielberg should be credited for using moderation to get the message across. There are scenes of violence, but overall the film is all the more effective for the implication of what is to come. Fiennes is chilling as the camp commandant, doubly so when you realise that this was an actual person who actually did the things shown, and all this less than a lifetime ago. Cinematography was superb throughout, and the brave decision to shoot in black and white adds to the authentic feel of the film. The final scenes are particularly emotional, and many people in the cinema were crying at the end. This film should be required viewing for any holocaust denier types, or just to those who have no concept of how evil men can be to their fellow man. Many people in Germany were left shocked after watching this film, because it's not the sort of thing that is discussed in depth over there (according to my German friend). 10/10",10
8 August 1998,"A powerful, moving masterpiece. The most meaningful and emotional film ever made.","Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List is a reflection on how great this director is. His 3-hour painting of Oskar Schindler and his forever changing view on the Nazi rampage against the innocent Jews is simply the greatest film achievement since the simple secret of Citizen Kane is finally revealed in a magnificent, grand and intelligent way. The final scene in which a marching group of 11,000 or so saved Jews morph into real survivors (an in color vision) and the ceremonial funeral of Oskar Schindler showing the several survivors of the Schindler factory is a real marvel and a sign that box office king Steven Spielberg doesn't work just for money. Spielberg should be knighted or something for this movie, just like Schindler saved the Jews Spielberg let the Jews' pain and suffering be recognised and World War II be looked at beyond the view of the British and American army.

19 May 2018,Schindler's List,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger

Schindler's List tells the story of Oscar Schindler as he says many Jews during World War II. The story is one that leaves you stunned. It is saddening, disturbing, and painful. The horrors of World War II and the brutality of the Nazi party are all clearly seen. The characters are powerfully portrayed and the ending is saddening yet hopeful.

The acting is sublime. Liam Neeson gives his best performance ever as Oscar Schindler. Ralph Fiennes also performs extremely well as a despicable and detestable Nazi commander. All of the supporting actors and actresses perform very well.

The pacing is slow and the runtime is overlong but Spielberg directs the film with great respect for the victims of this horrible tragedy.

Pros: Saddening, disturbing, and painful story, very deep characters, sublime acting, amazing performance by Liam Leeson and Ralph Fiennes, and great directing by Spielberg

Cons: Some slow pacing and an overlong runtime

Overall Rating: 9.0",9
1 June 2020,Love Time!,"In Krak√≥w during World War II, the Germans have forced local Polish Jews into the overcrowded Krak√≥w Ghetto. Oskar Schindler, an ethnic German from Czechoslovakia, arrives in the city hoping to make his fortune. A member of the Nazi Party, Schindler lavishes bribes on Wehrmacht (German armed forces) and SS officials and acquires a factory to produce enamelware. To help him run the business, Schindler enlists the aid of Itzhak Stern, a local Jewish official who has contacts with black marketeers and the Jewish business community. Stern helps Schindler arrange financing for the factory. Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys wealth and status as ""Herr Direktor"", and Stern handles administration. Schindler hires Jewish workers because they cost less, while Stern ensures that as many people as possible are deemed essential to the German war effort, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps or killed.

25 September 2018,Powerful,"I personally thought that this was one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. It is the first film to truly make me feel. I can't remember a point where I wasn't emotional. Spielberg certainly knows how to manipulate the emotions of his audience but what got me most was the realization of just how bad and how large of a scale the Holocaust truly was. 10/10 in my book. A film that is still relevant to this day.

15 July 2023,Great movie about a terrible plan,"Long, and black and white. The only two knocks against an otherwise riveting representation of the Holocaust. I feel strange reting this film, as it feels more documentary than entertainment and my heart goes out to all six million casualties and also the survivors. Spielberg makes a really good effort to capture the emotional turmoil that only the people involved could truly feel during such an atrocious event in history.

Three main characters dominate the film. Let's start with Izthak Stern, the jew who works as Mr. Schindler's accountant, and also who works for Amon Goeth. Those are the three main characters. Ben Kingsley does a phenomenal job playing Stern and encapsulates an intelligent man who is always rightfully fearing death around every corner. He has information and basically knows all that goes on from both sides. His realism and sometimes sarcasm in the face of tragedy is great. He also feels like Mr. Schindler's psychologist on occasion as he listens to his plots, both the real ideas and the ones to be employed as deceit to get people out.

Amon Goeth is played well by Ralph Fiennes. By ""well"" i mean a murderous nazi leader who kills rampantly and truly does a good job portraying what i'd say is a pure hatred for jews and has no real empathy for the prisoners. True blank stares and evil psychopathic behavior are maybe adjectives a bit short of experiencing his lack of respect for human life.

And then there is Oskar Schindler. A nazi leader himself, this businessman might be perceived as a slick rich capitalist businessman and cheating husband because he is those things. But this IS the Holocaust and in light of that tragedy, this man uses his wealth to procure human life and preserve a small portion of the prisoner population. The juxtapostion of him and Goeth, though they are side by side quite often, makes him the quintessential hero of the day. He deserves that title.

All and all a really great depiction of something very hard to depict at all. All three of the above actors do a great job and worth a viewing for anyone who wants a glimpse onto Nazi Germany during WWII.",8
19 March 2020,thinking,"I really don't dare to comment on this magnificent and great film.However, I feel that if I don't write anything about the movies that I have always wanted to watch but dared not watch, it is really difficult to comfort my vulgar and sincere feelings.

Hey, I'm so entangled.Like Mr. Schindler's every choice.I am also very glad that I only saw the film at this time, when I was younger, my meager patience must not have allowed me to spend more than three hours in front of the black-and-white film, and I must have done the frustration of falling asleep and eating snacks to distract my attention, right?

11 February 2020,Dull and too long,"Movies and documentaries about Holocaust are necessary to show people how hate and fear can turn human beings into monstrous beings but I rarely see those movies speaking about gypsies, homosexuals, disabled, mentally ill and other minorities who were also treated in a very inhumane way. In general, those stories lack something showing people how every human being must be treated with respect and dignity because, as another user said, people seem to be interested only in their cause, even if their neighbor's pain is similar to their own (in this case discrimination). Disliking such a movie apparently makes one automatically a bad person, but portraying arabians as terrorists seems to be fine for many, and implying gypsies and bad and dishonest as well. The same people who will reprimand you for disliking Schindler's List are the ones who think it's ok to hate on fats, homosexuals, the disabled. They are the same ones who think the mentally ill are just weak minded, the victims or rape brought it to themselves or the poor are lazy or undeserving of a better life. Society needs movies telling all types of stories about discriminated communities, individuals and ethnicities. The fact that the same person capable of great gratuitous dislike towards one person and great empathy towards another tells that we are missing a link that shows how every person should be treated with respect and not only one group.",5
14 March 2023,Great and historic movie.,"I watched this movie and i loved it. I loved the story and that I have been there. I was to Krakow on vacation and i remember a few places out of the movie that i've seen in Krakow.

The first 20 minutes i did not really know where the movie was going. Then it started, the horrible cruelty of the camps. Oscar is the example of a good man, and he was brave for what he did because for one move he could be dead.

The movie brought this man up to his glory that he deserves. He should not be forgotten. The movie made me think about the horrible stuff that hapend at that time, the cruelty of society that the people just went thru.

16 July 2023,Be prepared to be moved to tears,"""Schindler's List"" is a deeply impactful film that takes you on an emotional journey from start to finish. At first glance, it may not appear particularly special, but as the story unfolds, it gradually reveals its true power. Director Steven Spielberg's masterful storytelling and the exceptional performances of the cast make this a truly unforgettable cinematic experience.

The film tells the true story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a German businessman who saves the lives of over a thousand Jewish people during the Holocaust. It expertly depicts the horrors of the era, showcasing the unimaginable suffering endured by the victims. The gradual transformation of Schindler from a profit-driven opportunist to a compassionate savior is both inspiring and heartbreaking.

As the narrative progresses, the emotional weight of the story intensifies, culminating in a profoundly moving ending. It's during this climax that the film truly shines, leaving a lasting impact that lingers in your mind and heart long after the credits roll. The combination of John Williams' haunting score and the heartbreaking performances of the cast creates an atmosphere that evokes genuine emotions, often leading to tears.

""Schindler's List"" is not an easy film to watch, but its importance cannot be overstated. It serves as a powerful reminder of the atrocities of the Holocaust and the resilience of the human spirit. This film is a testament to the indomitable strength of those who survived and the importance of standing up against injustice.",10

3 December 2020,a must-see film!,"Schindler's List is a powerful film that not only reimagines Holocaust events with brutal realism but also provides a cinematic representation of grief and tragedy. This film is a great example of how screenplay, film direction, acting, and cinematography can collectively tell a vivid story, even for sensitive and controversial ones such as the events of the Holocaust. Its success as a film is one of the many ways this conversation is kept alive- fostering and encouraging empathy and compassion for others in generations to come.

I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short.",10
24 May 2021,Indescribable,"I have watched many movies in my life, many of them astonishing and with a great story. None of them compare to ""Schindler's List"". This movie is raw, uncensored truth and I will never watch a movie of the same quality again. It is beautiful and horrifying, but it does history justice and I love it for the way it doesn't hide the real events which so many million people went through. Expect to have this movie etched in your soul for the rest of your life, and rightfully so.

5 February 2006,"Wonderfully made film, but very flawed.............","The problem with 'Schindler's List' is that, although superbly made by one of the most talented directors who ever lived, it has an agenda: to convince people of the Holocaust. I mean, why add all those dramatic scenes of children being led to their deaths, the gassings, bodies burning etc? What did all that add to the film story apart from try to shock the viewers? Schindler himself was, in reality, far removed from the nice man portrayed by Liam Neeson. Most of what he did was not because he particularly cared about the Jews, but because they made him lots of money. He was also a serial womaniser and adulterer. Basically, the film is a sentimental Hollywood melodrama which happens to be set at a time of great cruelty, motivated by blind fanaticism. An opportunity was lost to analyse WHY the Nazis hated Jews so much, what were the fundamental roots of the German-Jewish conflict? Instead Spielberg went for the safe option of creating brutal German robots and innocent, perplexed Jewish victims. And the final scene when Schindler gave his speech was frankly ridiculous. Final verdict: magnificent film, subject matter not properly presented.",6

10 February 2005,"See ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" instead.","In one of the final scenes of ""Schindler's List,"" which may serve as a microcosm of this terribly flawed movie, a camp inmate is depicted as being so grateful to his kindly and charitable Nazi liberator that with his own hand he removes a gold tooth from his own mouth and gratefully hands it to the Nazi as a gift. Allowing that such a thing may actually have taken place, still I believe one is entitled to question the artistic judgment the director exercised in showing it. Surely Mr. Spielberg has seen the film ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" and knows that among the damning evidence presented by the United States Army War Tribunal against Nazi war criminals were gold teeth that were forcibly removed from the mouths of inmates and kept as booty by the thugs who ran the camps. In the wake of the war crimes trials, the extracted gold tooth became one of the main icons or symbols of the horrible wrongs perpetrated against the Jews by the Nazis. What kind of a sick joke is it to show a camp inmate voluntarily extracting his own gold tooth, when it is very well known that it was usually either Nazi camp guards or ""sonderkommandos"" (camp inmates who turned traitor) who forcibly performed the extractions, sometimes before the victim was even put to death?

The entire movie is defective in my opinion, because it conveys the idea that there was significant Nazi sympathy for concentration camp inmates. For a generation of film-goer who did not live through World War II and who were born decades later, this film may be the only one they'll see on the subject of concentration camps and the Nazis. Many of the audience probably left the theaters after seeing this film with the false impression that it wasn't so bad in the forced labor camps because the guys running them were sympathetic, charitably minded human beings. In fact, most Nazis who had anything to do with the camps or forced labor were the worst sort of subhuman vermin (they were called the ""scum of Europe"" at the time). What purpose does it serve to depict any Nazi with control over concentration camp inmates as a philanthropist, with a charming romantic passion for his imprisoned slaves?

As a rule, any so-called historical truth is open to question and doubt, never more so in a movie than here. Although the facts in ""Schindler's List"" are generally accepted by film-goers and critics alike (according to the press), can we be absolutely sure they are true, when everything else we know about the subject runs 180 degrees in the opposite direction? Just because a work has been published or produced doesn't make it true. Many historical accounts have been proved wrong in spirit and in fact.

The danger of any movie that treats controversial and ethically difficult historical subject matter is that it is likely to be regarded as a universal truth about the period instead of as a particular story. So I don't regard this movie as true history, because it is misleading as a generalization. And possibly some or all of the relevant ""facts"" presented are false or distorted. I recommend to anyone who does not want to be misled about the holocaust that they see ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" instead!",
17 February 2019,As Much a Monument of Remembrance as Any Obelisk,"Powerfully executed from opening scene to credits, this is an exceptionally crafted masterpiece of cinema that speaks to, on every level, Spielberg's utter mastery of his art. There's a haunting dramatic irony that fuels the tension behind each blissfully optimistic moment of ignorant joy, juxtaposed perfectly against scenes of unbridled human horror that never stray into the exploitative or the over-dramatised, but instead tells this tragedy in an unprecedented level of realism that cannot fail to move the very heart.

6 May 2022,Masterpiece - The best Spielberg has ever done,"It would have been impossible to make a film like Schindler's List one, or five, or even ten years after the ending of II World War. It is needed to go forward a few decades so people can believe that what happened in Europe on 1940s has been real and it is not an evil fictional story. Spielberg assumes this responsability and has the courage to present us an Holocaust film. And not an average one, but the best of all of them.

Spielberg, one of the most talented directors of all time, is able to leave behind his blockbuster, family-entertaining, adventure style (Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, Jaws, E. T) to suddenly give us a very graphic, disturbing, yet personal, film about horror, suffering and death, demonstrating his amazing talent. It is, indeed, the best film Spielberg has ever done without any doubt.

The plot is deep and complete, the direction/rythm is fantastic, it is visually amazing, the black and white filter fits perfectly, the cast (shout out to Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes) is fresh and flawless and the score by John Williams is a masterpiece (who also leaves behind his leitmotiv style with many instruments to just a very touching, single violin, making the film very intimate and sensitive).

To sum up, for me it is extremely hard to find something wrong in this film, it is overwhelmly easy to start listing how many fantastic things it has, and it is not possible to give it less than a 10/10. If you are a human being, it is mandatory for you to watch this despite of how hard it can be.",10

14 March 2020,we should know,"The List of Schindler let us know the situation of the Jews at the time, and also mentioned the anti-Jewish massacre slightly. For example, more than 10,000 massacred Jews were dug out and burned to ashes, such as in Auschwitz In addition to the smokey chimneys and smoke chimneys, director Spielberg described the Holocaust with cold numbers, and the entire film did not give reasons for anti-Jewish massacres. These subjects are so dark and heavy, and perhaps no audience is willing to watch such a desperate movie. Spielberg cleverly shows a warmth by describing the story of these two good and evil men. And good-Human beings can still do good in the face of evil, and eventually fight evil.
