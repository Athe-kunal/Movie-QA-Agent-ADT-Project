27 February 2020,I have NEVER seen such a performance ... ever!,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz! He has won just about every award for his performance in this film, and he deserves every single one of them. Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo!

30 May 2014,Quentin Tarantino's style and Christoph Waltz's menace,"In 1941 Nazi-occupied France, ""The Jew Hunter"" SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) finds the Dreyfus family hidden by their neighbors. Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) escapes after her family is massacred. Meanwhile Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) has gathered 8 Jewish American soldiers to kill Nazis behind enemy lines. Their brutal scalping campaign instills fear among the Germans. Donowitz (Eli Roth) is even given a nickname ""The Bear Jew"" for brutally beating Nazis with a baseball bat. Then in June 1944, Shosanna has a new name and a theater. She catches the eye of German war hero Fredrick Zoller who wants a big premiere in her theater that will attract the biggest of Nazi leaders. It even attracts the Jew Hunter as well as the Inglourious Basterds.

Christoph Waltz is great as the cold menacing well-mannered Nazi. He is completely engrossing in every one of his scenes. Every word he speaks is dripping with menace. His scenes are quiet and some of the most compelling parts of the movie. Then Quentin Tarantino has injected his brutal violence into this Jewish revenge fantasy. It is nothing less than audacious and uniquely original.",8
20 November 2022,Oh! What a Lovely War...,"There's a hunter called Hans Landa you should fear, if circumcision defines the way your men appear, on the surface quite polite, underneath riven with spite, carries a scar that lets you know of his career (or at least he will). But those un-helmeted can rejoice and be spurred, avenging evil come Inglorious Basterds, being led by Aldo Raine, with a remit to cause pain, several parts may disappear as things are sheared.

Great dialogue, great direction, sublime performances and original in its depiction of a war picture that's been repainted a thousand times before, but seldom with such entertainment - Tarantino's best in my opinion.

12 December 2021,Glorious indeed!,"Aside from the Kill Bill's I have not seen any other Tarantino film. I heard this one was good and so I watched. It's great. From the opening scene you are mesmerized by Christoph Waltz's unnerving performance. He gets a lot of credit and rightfully so. Hans Lands is possibly one of the greatest movie villains of all time. There so many iconic moments and Tarantino demonstrates how normal dialogue scenes can become suddenly intense with words alone. Every actor gives it their all with Brad Pitt giving a memorable performance as well. This movie is worth watching just for its opening but it also has back to back quality scenes that are well shot and have excellent dialogue. The movie balances it's comedy with excellent dark moments reminding viewers that this is indeed a WW2 film. Overall, my favourite Tarantino film of the three I've seen and might be for some time. Worth watching for Christoph Waltz.

5 August 2016,Tarantino's best? I think so,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz!

7 February 2020,I can't believe I just now watched this for the first time.,"This is a perfect Tarantino movie. It's explosive and exciting while also deep and well thought out. It took me a minute to get used to reading so many subtitles because of the variety of languages used, but I think that's a quality that makes the movie even more enticing. It is incredibly well done and it had a hold of me from beginning to end. Fair warning for any Tarantino movie, be prepared for the gore and violence. It runs rampant throughout the movie, but it's kind of gratifying seeing it happen to the Nazis.

25 August 2009,Who the hell is Christoph Waltz?,"That's what I thought, when I heard about the cast of Inglorious Basterds. And I'm both from Germany and into movies.

That guy is older than 50 and so far he almost only played in mediocre TV series - and even there he didn't play the main parts. Obviously nobody ever noticed, what he's capable of. Now, thanks to QT, he got one shot to change that - and - let's put it this way - that was a bingo! He is the living proof of what a great caster Tarrantino is.

By the way: I think it's a great privilege to watch the movie as a German - being able to understand everything. And the German dialog is written almost as good as the English.

Now I could repeat, what many others have written here before. I'll put it short: Finally, QT is back.

8 September 2009,World War II In an Alternate Universe,"I take exception to the comment that one reviewer made saying that a film like Inglourious Basterds had not been made before. Not only was one made, but it was made during World War II. When Hitler, Dead Or Alive was shown I'm sure the same rousing cheers went up from the audience who really wanted World War II to end that way.

Quentin Tarantino must have seen Hitler, Dead Or Alive and decided to do a big budget version of that B film propaganda flick from the Forties. In that one Ward Bond, Paul Fix,and Warren Hymer play three German speaking gangsters who take a contract out on Adolph Hitler from some public spirited citizen. They enlist in the army, but as soon as they can they desert grab a plane with a pilot and land in Germany and set about to perform their task.

What Tarantino has given us is Hitler, Dead Or Alive with official sanction. Brad Pitt heads a group of GIs, the rest of them are Jewish so they'll have proper motivation for this job, Pitt's a good old boy from Tennessee. The purpose of their mission is to just kill Nazis, the higher up, the better. And they soon get a reputation that's come to the attention of the Fuehrer himself.

This film is a throwback to those propaganda films that came out as morale boosters during World War II. Pitt and the rest of the cast look like they're having a great old time with this. Best performance is Christoph Waltz who plays an SS colonel who specialized in tracking down Jews who've escaped Hitler's final solution. He might just get an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

As for the end, just relax and imagine this is World War II in an alternate Universe.",8

23 July 2009,"Great fun, a real surprise","It just goes to show how wrong you can be. I had not expected to like this film. I was disappointed by both the Kill Bill films (although i preferred the second) and Death Proof (although it was better in the shorter cut of the double-bill release). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction and think that Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature piece of film-making - technically his most superior - including the last great performance elicited from Robert De Niro. Since then it seems to me while his films have been okay (i haven't hated them) he has been treading water in referential, reverential, self-indulgent juvenilia.

Then i read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and i hated it! Sure it had some typical QT flourishes and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were a couple of great characters. But on page it was more juvenile rubbish, largely ruined by the largess of the uninteresting Basterds of the title. It made me seriously contemplate not seeing the film. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I only changed by mind when i had the opportunity to see the film with a Tarantino Q&A following in London. I figured it would be worth enduring to hear him in Q&A as i know from interviews how entertaining he can be in person.

So little was i prepared for the sheer exuberant fun and brilliance of Inglourious Basterds.

Easily Mr Tarantino's best work since Jackie Brown it is a triumph.

Yes the references are there but they do not interfere with the story, they are not the driving force. Yes Eli Roth is stunt casting but he works fine, with little to do but look aggressive, and does nothing to hurt the film as i had feared. While i admired Mr Tarantino for using stuntwoman Zoe Bell as herself in Death Proof in order to amp-up the exhilaration of the major stunt scene her lack of any acting ability in a key role was a problem for the film. The same could be said of Tarantino's own appearances in several films, especially Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, which Tarantino wrote.

What really makes this work is how BIG it is. The spaghetti western vibe to much of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderfully over the top without descending too far into the cartoon quality of Kill Bill. The violence is so big. The audacity so big. Brad Pitt is so big! In the trailers the Hitler moment and Pitt's performance bothered me but in the context of the film they are hilarious. Pitt is actually brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is Mifune's blustering samurai in Yojimbo, he is Robards Cheyenne from Once Upon a Time in the West, there is a very James Coburn vibe to him, and of course a suitably Lee Marvin edge.

Christoph Waltz (who i did not previously known) and Melanie Laurent (who i first noticed in a brilliant French-language British short film by Sean Ellis) are sensational and i expect to see both used a lot more in the future. Tarantino has clearly not lost his eye for casting, which seemed to desert him in Death Proof. Waltz is equally large in his performance. Chilling, yet theatrical. He is Fonda from OUATITW, Van Cleef from Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is suitably Cardinale innocence but tough, a fighter. They both dazzle here.

That every member of the cast gets the fun to be had from what they are doing while not indulging themselves in just having fun and trying to get laughs helps tremendously. The laughs - and there are loads - come organically. Only Mike Myers comes close to tipping the wink and pushing it too far but his scene is reigned in just enough - with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender who seems pulled directly from the mold of Attenborough's Great Escape leader.

All the actors shine and Tarantino throws in wonderful flourishes, but ones that work with the story. The introduction of Schweiger's Hugo Stiglitz is a riot. After a sensational slow-burn opening and a glorious intro to those inglourious Basterds the pace never lets up and over two and half hours flies by.

It also looks beautiful, marking this as a return to real film-making rather than just self-indulgent silliness. The musical choices, as always, are inspired from Morricone on.

The film is audacious and hilarious. After a summer when nearly every film has disappointed me it came as a huge surprise that the real fun and entertaining, but also involving and impressive film should be this one, when i would never have believed it from script form. Welcome back QT.",8
25 August 2009,No Matter How You Spell It,"...""Inglorious"" as our local theater decided to display its title on their marquee, minus the second word. It is terrific cinema.

I don't hesitate to recommend this film to all but the over-squeamish. Let them never know what they're missing.

I did hesitate to give it ten stars because of my experience of Tarantino's previous films. In every case, save ""Reservoir Dogs,"" they have improved with additional watching.

So although I gave it ten stars, I did so reluctantly. It leaves me no ""up"" to go to.

Yes Christoph Waltz is the Nazi we've all imagined the worst to be. He is cultured, sophisticated, suave and most sadistic, the kind of man who can make a glass of milk a threat and who puts out his cigarette abruptly in a strudel, grinding it into the whipped cream as if he were grinding his heel into a victim.

To understand Tarantino's films, you need only have a sense of dialogue, color and pacing. The colors are as bright as necessary and when necessary, brighter yet. In the French farmhouse of the opening scene, they are muted and dark, but excessively so. Outside a brilliant sun is shining, but in the one room of the house, everything is bathed in shadows and black.

It is a brilliant setting for an interrogation by Waltz, as the ""Jew Hunter"" of the SS, who dangles his host French farmer over the precipice of revealing what he cannot reveal numerous times, then pulls him back with obsequious lines of friendship and understanding.

A second sadistic German, well-played by August Diehl, later functions as important actor in the final plot twist. Diehl's Nazi Major, who has an ear for German accents, is almost as good as Waltz....almost.

Film classes will study much from this movie. They should look lovingly at the superb pacing. Tarantino knows just how long to draw out a scene, building suspense in the manner of Hitchcock, then at just the breaking point, suddenly coming to a resolution.

For color, look for a final shot at a French Theater, where its secretly Jewish proprietor is staging a surprise for the upper reaches of Nazi leadership.

We see her, played by Melanie Laurent, awaiting the hated German dignataries who will arrive for a film preview of the latest Deutsch film masterpiece, a propaganda piece about a German hero and his dubious accomplishments.

Laurent is framed on a balcony, reflected in the glass mirrors of the gorgeous theater, her red lips and low cut dress reflecting everywhere the intensity of her designs on her guests. It is a single shot that would be worth an entire film.

There are thankfully many more such images, many more paced scenes of exquisite dialog and suspense.

In short, see it. I'm sure you'll see it again and again.",10

16 February 2014,Hitler's Table Talk,"One good thing about waiting several years after a very well received film is released is that you can step back from it and judge it on its content without all the hype . Sometimes if you go against the grain you do feel you're in danger of being branded a blasphemous heretic who should be locked up in order to keep little children safe at night or worse still to protect film makers from unpopular views . To be honest I have real excuse for missing Tarantino's INGLOURIOUS except that it never popped up in front of my radar until now . After finally getting round to seeing the movie I can put my hand on my heart and say I didn't miss all that much

It's interesting that so many professional critics agreed that the best thing about the film was Christoph Waltz performance * and that this was qualified by the critics saying stuff along the lines of "" I found my interest waning when Waltz wasn't on screen "" . This sums up the entire problem with the movie - the scenes go on for far too long and lack a brevity of storytelling .A character sits down at a table and talks . And talks . And talks . There's a saying that jaw jaw is better than war war . Noble sentiments indeed and one hopes in an alternative universe that Tarantino is the British prime minister while Tony Blair is a cocky Hollywood movie brat but for a film lasting almost three hours there's little incident and actually feels longer than three hours

Two selling points might have been that it's a war film and that it's a post modernist film . In other words it's a film that should make intelligent fun of all those terrible B movies featuring criminals in uniform who have the choice of a hangman's noose and volunteering for a suicide mission but there's not a lot of fun to be had here . One had hoped for constant knowing cheeky winks to the audience but this doesn't happen . There's certainly very little action to the movie and most of the film is composed of characters sitting down and talking in German or French or English . Just because a film contains subtitles doesn't make it worthy and you're left feeling there's no way this film would have been produced if it wasn't for the name of Tarantino . Little of importance happens in the narrative except to illustrate the film's own underserved self importance

* Strangely enough when DJANGO UNCHAINED was released the critics once again praised Waltz as being the best thing about the movie . This is obviously critics code for "" Wait for this movie to appear on television because it's overlong , arrogantly self indulgent and often boring """,4

3 October 2009,A Comedy Of Horrors,"Brad Pitt sticks his index finger in Diane Kruger's leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants. Funny, horribly so. The invented yarn takes ""The Dirty Dozen"" for a ride and sometimes abandons it to pay tribute to other movies. Lots of fun. Even ""Paris when it sizzles"" is mentioned in a delightfully organic piece of dialog. I was thrilled by Christoph Waltzer's character and by his sensational performance. Brad Pitt creates a true original. I love the actor's lack of vanity. There's a quirk in the character that is pure Brad Pitt. Tarantino visits a new universe but. fortunately, his hand. his brain and his heart are visible all over the place.

19 March 2022,"I'm not a war film fan at all, but this is fantastic","From the moment this movie starts the score already gives an epic feeling. The first scene is so strong and somehow this level is maintained throughout the movie. Tarantino absolutely excels with this film. The story is great, but almost 2nd to the performance. Most actors are great, however it's Christoph Waltz that takes his role to the next level..

One word of precaution: there is the quintessential Quentin level of violence mixed with outstanding dialogue. Think reservoir dogs.

Personal Note: It's a film I watched coz of the IMDB 250 and I couldn't be happier. Without it; I would have probably not chosen to put it on that quickly. And this is one of those film that really gives credit to the quality of the list (with a few exceptions).

27 September 2009,Waltz with Pitt,"C. Waltz is the new discovery in this movie. He might have had a following in German speaking countries, but with this movie, he's getting world famous. Speaking 4 languages (and that's only in this movie, who knows how many more he is able to master) and being the main actor in this, despite the title of the movie. Which leads us to one thing that might be appalling to some people (especially to those who love(d) the original ""Inglorious Bastards"").

The thing is that the ""Basterds"" (and yes the spelling mistake was intentional by Mr. Tarantino) do not get that much screen time. It's almost as if their story isn't the main act. You could have a problem with that (not only as a fan as stated above), so be aware that this is more an ensemble picture. And as said, Mr. Waltz is fantastic (I'm pretty sure we're gonna see more of him soon). Brad Pitt would be the second one to mention. Eli Roth on the other hand, as fun as it is to see him on the big screen, he just doesn't fit the bill. Til Schweiger and the other German and European actors are all really good. I'd say that some give the performance of their life.

Speaking of the actors, one of the things that I really loved, is the fact that the movie is at least tri-lingual (is that a word?), french/German/English (with a bit of Italian thrown in there for good measure). That means a lot of subtitles if you watch the original version. But it works (imo) and makes the movie that much better.

Another thing that you shouldn't expect though, is too much action. I heard quite a few people that criticized the movie, for being too talky. But that's Tarantino for you. There is action of course, but the long running time (might be a bummer for some) is made up by many conversations. There is tension, there is fun to be had, but the movie does take it's time to reach it's goal. Again, something that won't work for everybody. Great movie that cements Tarantinos status as great director.",9

15 July 2014,"Hey, It's Tarantino!","I've read so many of the naysayers. Giving this a one rating seems really spiteful. They speak of Walz's excellence in his role. If there is an actor of such incredible skill, how can one give it one star. Yes this is violent. Yes it is gratuitous. Yes it stretches the bound of reality. But Tarantino pushes the envelope at every turn in every movie. My God, what about ""Django Unchained."" There will always be flying body parts and characters of almost supernatural proportions. The plot that leads to the face-off in the movie theater is very intricate and does stretch our believability meter, but it is really engaging. Yes, the Germans are interesting in their own ways. Remember, this is not a propaganda film. We are put into a setting that is not for one instance a real portrayal of an historical event. But it does draw out the evils of war and makes a serious statement. It does have heroes and heroines. I know at times I was left a bit confused as to the point, but it didn't diminish my enjoyment of the movie itself.

22 August 2009,"Not for critics, but people who love a good movie","Some critics might claim to need a code key to interpret what Tarantino means by this revisionist adventure film, but I'd say it's right under their up-turned noses: There's a great little scene where Mike Meyers plays a British military man who anticipates attacking a Nazi film premiere so he brings in an a film critic as an adviser. This may or may not be necessary but it does allow for a dialogue exchange like: Meyers: What do you do? Critic: I am a film critic.

Meyers: What are your accomplishments? Even though the critic goes on to list some compilation books, it may as well be a rhetorical question.

Tarantino thumbs his nose at convention and that is part of the movie's appeal. His movies are often about movies as much as they are about the content at hand. Yet he still manages to sustain genuine tension. The opening Nazi interrogation of a French farmer and a later a tavern basement guessing game scene must have had whopping page counts but they play out as chapters and remain engrossing high stakes set pieces. In the same film he can introduce a character by throwing a title onto the screen as if this member of the ""Basterds"" was cool enough to have his own movie, or play a 1980's David Bowie song while a woman prepares to do battle in her own way while Nazi flags hang outside the window.

The movie takes place in an alternate universe that could either be a dream or the unreality of the grind-house era Tarantino has celebrated in Kill Bill and, well, Grindhouse. Anyone with a brain will get that. If that sounds good, see it. I notice now there are blurbs about ""how Jewish critics feel"" about the movie. Well, those who go to a movie with a deliberately misspelled title knowing it is a revisionist fantasy and can't bear to see the character of Hitler as the butt of the joke don't have an opinion worthy of note. If you are an expert on NASA, your views on George Lucas' Star Wars movies are not necessarily of use to me. In fact it's a little galling that such a critic-proof designation as ""Jewish critic"" should be trotted out. They can say what they like about a sensitive document with the intentions of Schindler's List and God bless them. But if someone gets his boxers in a bunch over slapstick Nazis or clueless Hitler autographing the Grain Diary for Indiana Jones, then they just aren't going to be the right audience for Inglourious Basterds. In fact they shouldn't be watching fun movies at all. They should try staring at a blank wall and talking to themselves rather than type up their blather.

But it's not all fun. Sad things do happen and unfortunate events occur in this movie. The tension even in dialogue does come from the danger of having a Nazi at the table or someone daring to ask him to leave. But when you get reviewers comparing the Basterds to Al Qaida I think we can excuse those critics from the table as well. Or call Eli Roth over to them and yell ""Play ball!""",
26 August 2009,Words as weaponry,"Note: this comment was edited to meet IMDb length guidelines.

I first saw ""Inglourious Basterds"" in late July and concluded that it would flop and Tarantino would never again be relevant. Needless to say, I didn't like it and didn't even expect to see it again. Late August and Tarantino certainly seems relevant again. His biggest opening at the box office, rapturous media reviews, and a surprising amount of hype. Word of mouth is excellent. It remains to be seen how steady the movie's box office performance will be, but after the tepid reception at Cannes, the movie proved an unlikely hit. Two viewings later and ""Inglourious Basterds"" is probably my favorite movie of the year.

Why I initially reacted the way I did is increasingly mysterious to me, was it expectations of a men-on-a-mission film unfulfilled, the then seemingly tedious and over-written verbal jousts? Consciously or subconsciously, I didn't want to like the movie. I tutted at the glee with which the movie portrayed the violence the basterds inflicted. I resisted the charm of the film's construct, acknowledging that it was more than I expected it to be while at the same time lamenting Tarantino's juvenile and silly handling of such serious subject matter.

The truth, which has been revealed to me by two further viewings of the film, is that ""Inglourious Basterds"" might very well be Tarantino's greatest film, eclipsing even his most mature work to date ""Jackie Brown"". This is a glorious subversion of the dreary holocaust drama, a Spaghetti Western with WWII iconography, a love letter to the movies, and it is, every step of the way, aware of exactly what it's doing. In the end it basically comes down to personal opinion on whether this was a success or not, but what seems plainly obvious to me is that there is absolutely nothing about this film that is clumsy. The time and care taken with the screenplay is obvious, as is the time taken to edit the film. The Cannes cut wasn't longer, but it was apparently different in construct and differently-woven. When we're talking about a movie which depends entirely on: a) tension built through dialogue and character interaction, and b) the pacing of those scenes and how the scenes fit together, this could explain the significant difference between the reception at Cannes and the critical reception upon actual release.

The performance of the cast collectively is probably the most obviously praise-worthy aspect of the film. The Basterds are lovable and humorous, but also portray just the right amount of savagery to make it clear that what they're doing isn't child's play, and Brad Pitt is a standout as Aldo Raine, giving a fun comic performance but also creating perhaps the most sympathetic character in the film outside Melanie Laurent, whose Shosanna Dreyfus is the emotional core of the film. She also feels more like a film character than a real person, something Tarantino is aware of, as she is written as a classical tragic hero, complete with a deliberately clichéd romance and a climax to her story which really sums up everything this movie is about in its self-aware artifice and theatrical grandeur. Diane Kruger impresses as Bridget von Hammersmark, despite being given the tricky job of playing an actress. Undoubtedly the performance of the film, of the year, is Christoph Waltz's Hans Landa. It's perfect. It's exactly what it needed to be, and the wrong actor in that role would have destroyed the film.

In Tarantino's own words, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is about the power of cinema bringing down the Third Reich. An even better description would be the power of words challenging the power of violence. Intentionally or not, that is one of the most interesting parallels drawn in ""Inglourious Basterds"". In more than one scene verbal battles turn into violence, but in as many scenes the threat of violence is kept at bay by the power of words and acting, a major component of cinema. Tarantino's wordplay here isn't just characters saying cool stuff to one another, it's the entire language of the movie, the weapon of choice for his characters. Many say Tarantino should write plays if he's just going to have characters talk to each other for ages, but that wouldn't make sense because he delights as much in the conversation and his actors' performance as he does in their context in his film, and his films always feature the cinematic, except for ""Reservoir Dogs"".

""Inglourious Basterds"" is all about the cinema, and where the movie references in ""Kill Bill"" were part of a pastiche of B-movie cinema, ""Inglourious Basterds"" works the references seamlessly into a genuinely involving story, albeit one with a healthy dose of silliness and dark humor. Where I initially thought Tarantino failed most significantly was where he succeeded most greatly: in his attempt to create a grand love letter to the power of cinema. Tarantino proves literate in more than just junk film here- for all the allusions to macaroni combat films and spaghetti westerns, it's ultimately a gonzo celebration of high art. The entire film is burlesque in nature, best seen as a deliberately artificial cinematic recreation of WWII rather than straightforwardly as a WWII war film of any nature.

More than any of his other movies, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is about cinema. It's not just subtext, it's the reality of the film which is so tied to the world of cinema. The film may be total fantasy, and it has no qualms about depicting the cathartic power of violence, but it's ultimately taut, tense, entertaining, funny, and most importantly sort of beautiful in its own grandiose, bizarre manner. As Aldo declares his final act of brutality in the film his masterpiece, Tarantino seems to be declaring this film his own. Call it kosher porn, call it whatever you like, what I ultimately see this as is a tribute to cinephilia made with far more heart than I expected.",

4 October 2009,Tarantino and His Italian Critics,"You should hear the Italian critics talking about Tarantino and ""Inglorious Bastards"". They run out of superlatives.

I enjoy him, don't get me wrong, but I'm not shouting miracle when I still have ""The Great Escape"", for instance, so fresh in my mind. ""Inglorious Basterds"" more than any of the other Tarantino films is all about appearances. There is nothing underneath other than references to other movies. Nothing wrong with that in fact I like it but I refuse to treat Quentin Tarantino as a sort of Deity. I can't buy it. I think he should be placed exactly where he belongs among the best of his kind but what kind is that? Never mind, it works. Italian critics who are so prepared to destroy their own - you should read some of the reviews for ""Baaria"" - are prepared to fall to their knees in front of Tarantino. This are the same critics that last year, the year of ""Milk"", ""Slumdog Millionaire"" ""Edge Of Heaven"", The Wrestler"" etc, gave the David de Donatello Award for best picture to ""Grand Torino"" I want to make sure that I'm making my point clearly. ""Inglorious Bastards"" is a terrific comedy with most of Tarantino's trademark tricks in place. You'll have a great time with Brad Pitt and an incredible Christoph Waltz as the ultimate Nazi villain but don't expect a masterpiece as declared by some critics. That kind of review damages the film and me the spectator. It forces something on me. As if I was suppose to feel the same otherwise there is something wrong with me. No. I liked it, I recommend it for what it is. Period.",6
11 September 2009,A failure to fuse different movie genres into one feature.,"Tarantino was in my opinion a master in fusing different movie genres into one. But he miserably and painfully fails to do so in Inglourious Bastards (IB).

Where in the past in movies like Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bill saga there is a constant mix of both comical and gritty scenes which are consistently applied throughout these movies, in IB Tarantino tried to only loosely paste them together. The result is an unfocused string of scenes in which each displays another facet of the different genre. In one scene it's drama and violence followed by one that would have perfectly fitted into a Naked Gun type of film. This simply doesn't work and I found myself being highly irritated watching this failed experiment ruin an otherwise fine movie idea.

Another failure of the movie is to not present the viewer dialogs which are actually worth the elaborate time it takes to conclude them. The dialog often proceeds at glacial speeds and likewise just as easily melds and vaporises as time progresses, leaving a pile of scattered moraine in stead of something actually contributing to the, as it already stands, paper thin plot.

In the end IB is nothing more than a mismatch of ideas with a steal from Pulp Fiction here and a pinch from Reservoir Dogs there. These rehashed ideas, far superiorly employed in the past, will perhaps fool the younger moviegoer into believing they are watching something fresh and innovative, but people who have seen these other movies by QT surely wont be impressed. The movie ends at two and a half hours featuring long, drawn-out scenes that could have been easily compressed into one and a half. And like with Death Proof, there is far too little pay off to warrant stealing people's time and attention over these all-heard-before and talky routines.

Through most of the duration of the film I contemplated suggesting to my friend, who was clearly not being entertained either, to leave, but I decided to see it through till the end. Suffice to say I have never been so glad the ending credits finally rolled so I could get up and make my way to the exit.

The pro's:

Excellent acting (apart from a horrible Pitt who was clearly miscast) and good cinematography in a film with some solid and interesting ideas.

The con's:

The film's criminally in need of an editor and serves perhaps a bit too much dialog in a foreign language for the average moviegoer to swallow. Not enough suspense to justify bludgeoning the audience with endless routines of mere dialog and no character development to make the audience care about whatever outcome these scenes, and ultimately the whole movie, might bring.

The civilized monster, polyglot, refined and deadly. He gets us going from the first, sensational scene. Brad Pitt is also wonderful. Was he putting a Mussolinni chin while impersonating (hilariously) an Italian? I thought so. His character's name sounds like Aldo Ray and I'm sure that's no accident. The film is full of movie references. Another character is named Fenek, as an homage to his 1970's sexpot, Edwige Fenech. What is already one of Tarantino's trademarks is his sure step along the most immediately recognizable bits of pop culture. He's clearly not a cultured man but a pop expert, king in a world where people get their news from TV, don't read, other than magazines and comics, etc. That's how it happens, to be in the right place at the right time. For better or worse this are Tarantino times.

8 September 2009,Larger than life in the best cinematic ways,"Inglourious Basterds (2009)

We all know by now that Quentin Tarantino is in love with the movies, so it's no surprise that much of this film centers are around an astonishing movie theater. But his love of movies also shows in the way he works with classic ideas and great visual strategies that come from decades of the best of Hollywood. The very first scene is like a remake from some classic Western--John Ford or Sergio Leone, take your pick--with the isolated family seeing trouble coming in, ever so gradually, from the far distance.

And then trouble arrives, and it unfolds here like a croissant in the morning sun, steam slowly rising into the French Provincial air. This, you'll see, or you know already, is film-making at its best, old-school or new-school, it doesn't matter. The suspense, the elegant and fluid camera-work, the astonishing writing and even more astonishing delivery by the two men at this very first juncture, playing a kind of ""I know what you are thinking"" kind of game, all drawn out in a breathtaking, poetic, nerve-wracking way.

Then all hell breaks loose. This is the other side of Tarantino, the violent violence, where the blood is too red and too balletic to be real. I don't have the ability to step out of this kind of on screen gore and so it shocks me every time, and it seems like the movie might work just as well (or better) with implied violence, rather than splattering it in your face. But this director, I think, sees all of it from a director's point of view--that everything is artifice, including the preceding scene with the two men, where I, for one, was impressed partly by believing it, by being completely sucked in. Which makes the offputting violence that follows all the more upending.

I have no doubt it is this push-pull effect that makes all of Tarantino's films have that energy few others can match. In this case, there is a lot of plain old fun built into seeing the bad guys get what they deserve (I felt a weird pleasure, which I confess and which I don't understand, in seeing one very particular bad guy shot to pieces near the end), and a lot of suspense as you root for the unlikely heroes. The archetypes, like Brad Pitt's good bad guy role with a Kentucky accent (better than your Italian, Brad), and the more original characters, like the young woman who owns the theater and is truly trapped by circumstances, equally make their scenes larger than life.

In fact, Inglourious Basterds is pure Hollywood in the way it makes everything on the screen larger than life. Isn't that what the golden age of Hollywood was all about? Yes. And it is exactly what some directors like Tarantino are still bent on pulling off. A great film. Whatever the problems and the gore, this strikes me as a perfect film the way Fargo is perfect, or Reservoir Dogs. Tastes aside, you have to see it.",10
20 September 2009,Brilliantly offbeat wartime western,"Wow. It's been a while since I left a movie theatre so overwhelmed. From the first minute to the last this movie is shocking, amusing and horrendously entertaining all at the same time. The prologue is vintage Tarantino. The way the tension is build up throughout that opening scene is truly magnificent, and the camera pans down just at the right time. And by that time you've already learned to absolutely despise Landa, probably the most disgusting character Tarantino ever came up with. He's truly a man you love to hate, and his charming persona just makes him seem even more evil. He's if possible even more threatening than Jules Winfield was in the infamous breakfast scene from ""Pulp Fiction"". The segments with the basterds are probably the ones Tarantino had the most fun with, and these segments really know no boundaries in any way. Not only are they hilariously violent (the baseball bat!), they also ignore every possible historic fact. I wouldn't really want it any other way really. Another highlight is the bar scene, which illustrates perfectly how unpredictable this movie is. There are too many good moments to be naming them all, but this movie benefits so much from its outrageousness you really need to see everything for yourself.",10

8 November 2010,Sorry sweaty-palmed fanboys - this is one of Tarantino's worst.,"Read on before you complain!

I am a fan of Tarantino, so why give Basterds a middling rating, a score similar to such non-classics as Big Man Japan and Silent Hill?

Well after the initial scene there just aren't any scenes that ""pop"" or are worthy of a zippy description.

IB just isn't as intricate and tricky as I think it wants to be, so we are left with a movie with long drawn out scenes, not enough dialogue worthy of note and insufficient action to fill in the lengthy gaps. I think Tarantino felt this might become known as ""the one where some Jewish guys have a crack at Hitler"".

As mentioned the best scene in IB is the first with all the hallmarks of a Tarantino special. In essence it is a German soldier politely but forcefully interrogating a Frenchman who he believes to be harbouring Jews, so I'll leave the description at that, because Tarantino makes it so much more that trying to describe it in more detail would be pointless.

In broad terms though it has crackling dialogue, the tension builds throughout and the scene is allowed to play out over about 20 minutes, where other directors might give it 3, get to the payoff and move on.

In Chapter Two we meet the Basterds – in another example of ""taking their word for it"", as we are informed that the Basterds are an elite team of vicious, mostly Jewish, soldiers hellbent on killing as many Nazis as possible and striking fear into enemy ranks.

We are introduced to a couple of Basterds, a German named Hugo Stiglitz who is infamous and feared (again because we are told so) and the ""Bear Jew"", a man who carries a baseball bat and beats his victims to a bloody pulp, but mostly they remain a faceless bunch headed by one Bradley Pitt - you might have heard of him.

Speaking of baseball bats, in the real life game of ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" I'd take a machine gun over a baseball bat every time. What does the Bear Jew do in combat, hang in the background until someone runs out of bullets? Or wait until a German soldier shows up with a club or bat so it is a fair fight? Seems a pretty inadequate weapon 99% of the time.

We are given a couple of examples as to how the Basterds work, and EVERYONE has seen the speech Aldo Raine (Pitt) gives to his squad applicants, ""And I want my scalps!"" but they just don't seem that scary or menacing really. Nonetheless (because the plot says so) their reputation gets all the way to Mr Hitler himself, who deems them trouble enough that he takes time out of running a conflict involving several million soldiers to consider how he might deal with them.

The remaining Chapters involve events that bring the main combatants into close proximity so that we might have some sort of climax to the film. In this case a Nazi propaganda film is to be premiered in a small French cinema, with many German dignitaries in attendance, including a man with an abbreviated mustache.

This gives a small window of opportunity for assassins to kill most of the Nazi war machine in one crack, thereby ending the war (apparently). At least in this circumstance Tarantino didn't think small! Of course it leaks out that the premiere is happening and the British intelligence formulate a plan to bring in the Basterds and have them meet with a liaison to crash the premiere and do what they do best.

Need I mention at this point we are about an hour and 40 minutes into the film, and the titular Inglourious Basterds have two on screen kills? Seems a little light in a war movie when they are the most feared soldiers in the entire war doesn't it? This movie isn't overlong, just ""over-nothing-worthwhile-happening"". I can sit through 2 and a half hours standing on my head if the movie justifies it, but I can't say that Inglourious Basterds gave me sufficient reward for my time, let alone ""Bang"" for my buck. There were almost more rounds fired in the standoff at the conclusion of Reservoir Dogs! Nazi Colonel Hans Landa, as the ""Jew Hunter"", is the best thing in the film and it is no surprise that he gets the best dialogue. The scenes in which he features provide some tension and menace that is not really tangible for the remainder of the film.

As mentioned before the Basterds are largely under-utilised but that is also reflective in the fact that they are soldiers and this is a movie largely without battles and action.

Tarantino sticks to his guns though and IB is again a movie made solely on his terms, the long drawn out scenes (many of them boring), considerable use of subtitles - even a bizarre section with a voice-over by Samuel L. Jackson for some reason - the music at times is also way too contemporary for a WW2 film, and if I bagged 300 for that then I must definitely point it out here.

I think it's interesting that Tarantino chose to plot his film in an alternate version of WW2, because in an alternate universe Inglourious Basterds would have far more action and be a far superior film.

Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. As a director Tarantino aims for ""cool"" above all else. This just ain't that cool, regardless of what the sweaty palmed fanboys think.

P.S. When I looked to IMDb to make sure I spelt a couple names right I saw that IB is currently in the top 100 ranked films of all time. This is surely just a sad joke.

5 October 2009,The Jewish Scalphunters of Quentin Tarantino,"Once again, revenge is at the center of a Quentin Tarantino movie. This time a Jewish dirty dozen takes things on their own hands. Tarantino re-writes history and shortens WWII with a comic stroke that is as entertaining as it is vacuous. A fantasy that re-arranges some controversial historical points. Okay, it's a movie and as such it works for most of its two and a half hours. Christoph Waltz opens things up in the most promising way. The opening sequence is filled with a subtle but unbearable tension. Weltz amalgamates all the Nazi villains we have loved and hated in the movies into one glorious creation. (I will advise my countrymen to see it in its original multi-language version - the Italian version is another movie altogether. Some of the extra pleasures are in the dialog that, naturally, are not to be found in the Italian version) Brad Pitt, rapidly becoming one of the best character actors in the world, with a leading man's face and billing, is truly fantastic. Diane Kruger makes a credible Barbara Bouchet (one of Tarantino's muses from trash action Italian movies from the 70's) and the rest of the cast has some exquisite touches like Rod Taylor as Winston Churchill. Highly recommended for a Sunday afternoon.",7
23 August 2009,Quentin Tarantino is a Crazy Basterd,"I can't imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is greater than Quentin Tarantino's. (At least in his films) Inglourious Basterds is no different. We all know Tarantino, the guy who exploded on the scene in the early 90s with cult classics, such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Since, he has been a disappointment for some. Well, I am relieved to say, Tarantino has not lost his touch. He brings us his best since Pulp Fiction and thankfully so.

We know the story, a WWII tale told only as Tarantino can. (Fictional of course) A war film hasn't been done like this before. Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine leads the Basterds in Nazi occupied France. Their goal - killin' Nazi's. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa plays a similar role on the other side. He's know as the ""Jew Hunter"" and goes about his business as ruthless as no other. The third sub story consists of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who witnesses the slaughter of her family. And she, of course, wishes to plot revenge on the Germans for her devastating lose. There actually is three stories here intertwining and connecting with each other. If you know anything about Tarantino or his films, this is nothing new for him.

War has never been been so fun. The Basterds, are haunting, but at the same time, very funny, at times even hilarious. The dark comedy aspect play a big aspect in this as in many other Tarantino films. The entertainment and hilarity is led by Brad Pitt. I found him extremely funny and entertaining. I couldn't wait to see him on screen again. Even with his crazy accent, he works in this type of film. Also making great impressions were Mélanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz, who were tremendous. The film was filled with noteworthy performances.

The story itself, has so many historical inaccuracies to even count, but so what? It isn't meant to be a documentary. Tarantino wanted to have fun with, as should we. The cinematography department deserves big props with beautiful vibrant colors highlighting the film. You've really got to love the last line in the film... but Pulp Fiction remains his masterpiece.

Quentin Tarantino among all other things, is an entertainer. WWII, is one of the most tragic events in history, but Tarantino some how manages to make it fun. Inglourious Basterds is a fun film, it's tremendously entertaining, shocking, dramatic, suspenseful, and funny at the same time. Jam packed with everything you look for in a movie, done with that certain Tarantino style, it's worth being checked out. It's time to experience for yourself what war is like through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino.",
20 October 2010,Christoph Waltz - an Oscar performance within a pile!,"It's a useless thing to post a review on a movie that already has more than a thousand reviews on IMDb. But the division between people who loved it and those who hated it is rather fascinating so I'll add my two cents.

I'm a person who's of the later opinion. I just don't like Tarantino and his way of making an ""homage"" to me just seems like a cheap way of stealing stuff, that's not known or obscure at best for a mainstream audience but insults the true fan.

I'm also a fan of 'alternate realities'-story lines (I recommend Ian McKellen in ""Richard III"", taking the age-old Shakespeare play into the time of WW2) and not necessarily too concerned with historic accuracy. In my mind, one could have done something with the story of ""Inglorious Basterds"" but what ruins it in this film is the horrible acting.

Not even talking about Brad Pitt hamming it up like it really was a real grind house film but what in the heavens could have provoked any director to put Eli Roth in front of a camera? I realise that there isn't much real acting involved in a homage to exploitation flicks but at least a little charisma, a little character for an protagonist in a mainstream movie – is that too much to ask for? We now move on to the German imports: Till Schweiger, Daniel Brühl and Gedeon Burkhard. Schweiger divides the audience in Germany. He's by fans depicted as the Ben Affleck of German cinemas; by adversaries he's considered as a German version of Ben Affleck who's performance is annoying but who can produce a sellable love comedy during Summer. Brühl is another actor who leaves critics divided. 'A great talent in the making', say some; 'an actor with a steady repertoire of four facial expressions', say the others (three of which are featured in ""Inglorious Basterds"". And of course Burkhard, prior to ""Inglorious Basterds"" a regular in many-a daily soap-opera that are geared toward pensioners and the unemployed. The rest of the cast is relatively unknown to me and I'm relative grateful for that. And, adding insult to injury for hammy acting and lazy direction: the caricature of Hitler and his regime, just a few years after an audience has applauded the performances of Bruno Ganz and others in ""Der Untergang"".

I give this film four stars  no, I give the actor Christoph Waltz four stars. And another Oscar  because he deserves it. Skills and a presence that rivals performances of contemporary roles like Heath Ledger as the Joker or Javier Badem in movies like ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""The Sea Inside"". That's the fascinating aspect about the movie: putting up 1st class actors against 2nd and 3rd rate: the result is ""Inglorious Basterds"".",4
8 October 2021,Pretty good,"This movie is a bit overrated and really isn't the best of Tarantino, but its still a good film. Very great acting and cast of characters, amazing cinematogaphy. A entertaining but stupid and unrealistic story of WW2. Good effects and just very well done, good film but overated.

18 August 2022,Tarantino's Pride,"Wow! Every single time I watch this movie I am completely engaged and excited by it.

The acting is incredible and Hans Landa is one of the best characters ever written in film history.

The story is captivating with twists that make the film impossible to look away from.

The feel of the movie is so immersive that without the sometimes comical arrows and signs, I sometimes forget I'm even watching a movie and not in the moment with the characters.

This is the pinnacle of film making in my opinion and the silly, dark, and comedic moments of the film make it an absolute masterpiece.

3 October 2009,A Brilliant Filmmaker With Very Little To Say,"Very entertaining, that's for sure. Great little moments ""inspired"" by other movies. ""The Guns Of Navarone"", ""Operation Crossbow"" and a myriad of 70's B exploitation Italian movies. Tarantino is certainly clever and knows how to use the camera but then, I have to say it, nothing. The childish ""divertimento"" dressed in smart ass dialog remains there. The entertainment value is, perhaps, the most one should expect from a movie but it seems a damn shame that such a talent should be put at the service of something so one dimensional. I can't help but remember Ernst Lubitch's ""To Be Or Not To Be"" that was also a comedy with remarkable, inventive dialog but it also had so many other layers that ""To Be Or Not To Be"" after 70 years still resonates with whoever has seen it. Christoph Waltz is terrific and Brad Pitt is always great fun to watch but the experience is purely epidermic in spite of some truly gruesome moments. Am I expecting oranges from an apple tree? If that's so forget what I've just said and run to meet Tarantino's basterds.

14 April 2022,Tarantino at his best,"This movie is a masterpiece. There is everything that a great movie needs: awesome humour (but the movie is not a comedy), great actors and the most important - the most terrifying villain in movies history, Hans Landa. Whenever he appears you can feel how scarred everyone else is, how smart he is and the actor gave his best playing him. Tarantino made a very radical, but marvelous decision that the movie is not in english - when french people talks they talk in french, germans in german etc. - the effect of that was just incredible amd you can feel how real this world is (i mean... Its Tarantino, he likes to change the history so it's not quiet real). It's awesome, go watch it, 10/10.

23 August 2009,Tarantino Delivers!!!,"I must admit when I saw the preview for ""Inglorious Basterds"" I gave myself big expectations. THIS FILM DID NOT Disappoint.

Rarely when I watch a movie with such high-expectations do I have those expectations met or exceeded; this film did that and more. Even more rarely do I clap at the end of a movie, this I and everyone else in the theater did.

I have to say I am a little biased towards Quentin, I grew up with ""Pulp Fiction."" I watched it when I was 12 and it is still my favorite and most influential film.

However, since then Quentin has not really lived up to his billing. His style was getting a little predictable instead of familiar, the quality honestly wasn't there (I never watched Jackie Brown, and then there's Grindhouse). That is until ""Inglorious Basterds."" What Quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre, a spaghetti western feel that could only be done by Tarantino or Sergio Leone, but seeing how Leone is dead, Tarantino's the self appointed guy on this masterpiece.

So let's look at the movie which I won't give away. The writing was spot on, a beautiful transition between using not one but four different languages in this movie. Not to mention this movie was set up in the classic Tarantino mold, great scenes of rich meaningful dialog and sudden shocking action.

The acting was superb!! Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar, seriously. I don't say that often, but honestly the man should get one for this movie, he spoke every language in this movie, and delivered with such amazing touch and poise. He stole the show in a movie that everybody was amazingly impressive.

I have no problem building this movie up, because this movie is the best film I've seen all year, and probably all of next year. Quite frankly the more I think about it, this movie may crack my top films of all time, and is Quentin's best movie since ""Pulp Fiction."" Take it from me, watch this film. I loved it doesn't do this movie enough justice.

I watched it yesterday and I'm still blown away. Thank you Quentin from the bottom of my heart for you making this movie. You're back on top again buddy. I can't say enough for ""Inglorious Basterds!""",10

1 May 2023,Not that great,"Just another terrentino film trying to be a western with over the top gratuitous violence to try and shock the audience. The story is basic and contrived. It's not that the acting is bad given the material - they do the best they have to work with but to call this a great or good film doesn't make a lot of sense. There is no special underlying message. Just a lot of violence for the sake of violence and to satisfy Quentin's strange fascination with blood and gore and thinking that makes him a great writer and director. If you like gore, then this is the movie for you. If you want a good story line you might as well pass.

23 November 2009,Downhill since PF,"Seeing this film with an 8.5 rating beggars belief. Tarantino's finest moment was undoubtedly Pulp Fiction. Clever story, interesting characters, roller coaster ride and a well thought out, interwoven plot. This film is quite the opposite. Almost lazy. Weak and insulting script, AWFUL acting from Brad Pitt (embarrassingly bad given how much he's manage to shine in other, more challenging roles (i.e. Snatch), and predictable throughout. So, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and downhill ever since. Where's the spark gone? Or perhaps QT's just lost it for good. Pity.

It seems many people these days are just happy to hail any old tripe he roles out as 'original and daring', when in reality it's quite the opposite - shallow and intellectually insulting. There were a couple of moments when the dialogue started to show some of the old sparkle, but generally (apart from the main German officer) performances were weak or, worse, comical. Each film he brings out I hope for a return to form, but what once was concentrate now just seems to be over-diluted tripe.",1
22 May 2014,"Bold, brutal and brilliant.","Even though the title is virtually identical to Enzo G. Castellari's 1978 Italian warsploitation 'classic' The Inglourious Bastards, Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is most definitely NOT a remake. Far from it. Not only is it one of Tarantino's more original efforts to date, but it also one of his best films for a long time, a riveting tale of derring-do that features plenty of everything that made his first two movies such a success: great dialogue, wonderful performances (Christoph Waltz is brilliant, as is an almost unrecognisable Mike Myers), excellent pacing, impressive direction, explosive violence, fantastic use of music, and more than a few playful visual touches of the kind that only Quentin seems to be able to get away with.

Despite being fairly talky in places, with the bulk of the dialogue spoken in either German or French (and subtitled in English), the film is a thoroughly absorbing experience, with not a boring moment in its entire 153 minutes. The long conversational scenes are brilliantly executed and entertaining in their own right, but they also serve to make the violence seem even more explosive and brutal when it happens. And boy, is it nasty when it wants to be, with bloody scalpings, repeated baseball bat blows to the skull, and point-blank gunshots to the nether regions amongst the graphic carnage on display.

It's not all typically cool Tarantino monologues and OTT gore, though: in an extremely bold move, the writer/director eventually steers events into fantastical territory, rewriting history to suit his whims. Those who have slated the film for its lack of historical accuracy are completely missing the point: Quentin is giving us his version of events, entertainment being the number one priority, facts be damned. It's daring movie-making and a whole lot of fun when approached with the right attitude.",9
18 August 2010,"Disaster Movie: probably the worst ""film"" I have ever seen....","Shame on IMDb saying this is a drama/thriller/war film. Nothing of the sort. ""Saving Private Ryan"" would come into that category, not this dreadful mess of a movie.It looks and feels like the writer/director so called has made it up as he goes along as the whole thing is uneven and drifts from drama to farce and various other genres.

It is part parody, part fantasy, part black comedy(without being funny)and proved to be a total waste of my time and goodness knows why I did not bother to turn it off sooner. Brad Pitt is a complete embarrassment as he looks like he got out of his VIP chair to ad lib his role. And the actor playing Hitler is also an absolute joke but humorless.

In brief the scenario is that a bunch of Jews in the 1940's go to get revenge on Nazi's, and the climax of this takes place in a cinema in Paris where all the German leaders will be present.

The picture has unnecessary and needless violence, the plot and story are outrageously ridiculous and whilst Christopher Waltz steals the show even he cannot save this movie.

Now have to ask rhetorically:

Why do the members here give this movie over 8/10 on average? Further, why have are the box office takings almost twice the apparent budget? Seems that a few influential but totally out of touch film reviewers and some clever misleading marketing has duped a lot of people into believing there is some worth in this disaster of a movie.

My verdict:

What a load of rubbish,

27 January 2010,Top 250!? Are you kidding me???????,"""Inglourious Basterds,"" a title which is stolen from a superior Italian trash flick by Enzo Castellari, is pure pretentious drivel.

The opening scene of the movie is the only one which can compare to films from the glory days of Quentin Tarantino. The rest of the movie just descends down a long and boring hill and putters to a stop. It never builds any kind of strong characters. We are given a glimpse into ONE of the 'basterds' past but none of the others. It's like Tarantino said every few days of shooting: 'You know what would be freakin' kewl? If we did ....this....' It's all a jumbled mess with no theme even. It bounces from Spaghetti Western, to Italian Exploitation to Eastern martial arts and back around again. I got lost in the 'coolness' of it all.

Brad Pitt who I happen to think is a fine actor, fell way short in this. His little southern accent gimmick wears off after about 10 minutes and his character just seems comical. And Eli Roth as 'the bear jew ?' What the heck is that!?

This Tarantino guy just happens to be the ONLY film maker in Hollywood that is brash enough to steal from the masters (Leone, Fulci, Castellari, Argento, etc) and doesn't mind adding a dash of modern Hollywood lameness to it. It's ashame Americans are dumb enough to fall for it and we don't seem to have room in our hearts for more creativity in films these days.

A total example of style over substance. It will not stand the test of time. I'll stick with the originals. Blue Underground releases a good handful every year! This is not a good movie. 2 out of 10, kids.",2

18 February 2010,Where Tarantino fantasizes about dirty war in war,"Okay – here's the story, in a paragraph: a bunch of American soldiers terrorize German infantry for years, in France, behind enemy lines. They become infamous to the Nazis, resorting to intense cruelty to the Germans. Even der Führer wants them caught. Meanwhile, in a French town, a lovely French-Jewish femme fatale plans to blow up her cinema when a famous German action flick is shown to the German hierarchy – including Hitler, Goering, Goebbels and Borman. Coincidentally, those infamous American soldiers are sent to do the same job. Also, there's a very nasty Nazi colonel who just loves to hunt down and kill Jews – and he smells a rat in the House of Cinema. How it all turns out, I'll leave up to you to discover – that is, if you see this film.

But, I don't recommend at all. Let me tell you why.

First, it's billed as drama/thriller/war. Well, I guess it does contain all of those attributes, but they forgot about fantasy. Because, this story is, at core, a spoof about war and sheer fantasy, in addition.

Second, in its effort to establish and develop character, it's often boring because it's way too talky for a thriller; you see character from what people do, not from what they say. Brad Pitt (as Aldo Raine) is okay as an over-the-top parody of hill-billy Americana – and he does it well. But, even his character becomes too talky. The nasty Nazi, Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) is talky also, but at least he's a detective (in his own words), so he has to ask a lot of questions. The rest of the cast do their best with a script that varies between intense dread, only occasionally, to high camp, often – especially concerning the German hierarchy.

Third, the whole story is preposterous. Let's face it – any war story that purports to show the entire German hierarchy being blown up in a cinema can only be regarded as coming from another planet Earth in another universe. And the (way too long) card game scene in the café basement is screechingly contrived coincidence and just too stupid for words. So, if you do see it, leave believability (the prime requirement for good stories, especially war) at the door. You've been warned.

And, finally, although Quentin Tarantino started well with his filmic revelation, Reservoir Dogs (1992), and followed up with his much better Elmore Leonard story, Jackie Brown (1997) – his best to date – this one is his nadir, in my opinion. Technically very good, especially with the editing, this basterd of a story nevertheless kills the whole experience. If he was trying to show war in the raw, look no further than the battle scenes in The Thin Red Line (1998). If he was trying to create a thriller, stay with the Bourne franchise. If he was attempting drama in war, watch From Here to Eternity (1953) or Twelve O'Clock High (1949), and too many other superior films.

To be fair, it has its moments: the frenetic shootout in the café basement is editing at its best. And the opening scenes at the French farm are a tour de force in building dread. However, the cardboard cutout characters left me totally indifferent to the fate of any of them: in sum, a dead story about death at its worst. It'll be interesting to see if Christoph Waltz gets the Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor. Miracles do happen, though.

I note that Roger Ebert gave it four stars. Is that out of ten? I hope so – I give it four also.

Oh, heck, see it if you must, but just keep in mind it's a fantastic spoof.",4

16 December 2009,Abomination of a film,"Christoph Waltz and Mélanie Laurent acted faithfully, Brad Pitt looked and acted disgustingly. All those manners of him, I cannot imagine an Apache to behave like that.

US soldiers looked like they won the war being its major force? WTF? The Russians were the only reason the world had survived and hadn't become a total Jew genocide.

Was this film a joke, a comedy, a drama, or a parody? I didn't get that and I didn't like that. The end of the movie was absolutely terrible as it turned into a complete joke.

This film is an abomination for spoiling the history and making a mockery out of people who truly fought to save the world. Let's see ""Saving Private Ryan"" again.

5/10 (just for Christoph Waltz and Mélanie Laurent performance for the first 90% of the film).",5
7 September 2009,a master popularizer at his very best,"Tarantino was never much of a philosopher, humanist, or world historian – just someone so utterly immersed in cinema that he could translate his obsession into terms that seemed not just relevant but also emotionally engaged. Now, at a rather troublesome and ambiguous moment, he takes on the Nazi film, with Bowery Jews and Southern lieutenants teaming up in a simple-minded crusade against Evil. In so doing, he offers more evidence that he's drinking from a bottomless well – that the movies can, and should, do anything. This is especially propitious since it comes along at a moment when cinema history is going down the toilet almost as fast as world history. More than ever he's playing the film prof here, but unlike his Americanism, his cinephilia is not triumphalist: he knows too much about his subject to lie about it. Glorious tributes to Sergio Leone and Raiders of the Lost Ark (and King Kong!!) vie with articulate digs at Pabst and Jannings and nitrate film. And yet it's anything but an in-crowd movie; I'm sure I don't get half the references myself. Instead, he sculpts these elements as a master popularizer, boiling them down into a teeming, bizarre concoction that is both devastating and offhand, manic yet full of grace, a jokester who delivers the punchline as if his life depended on it. And while you can always hear him talking, it's the overtones and cross-rhythms of his superbly attuned cast that bring it to life. This is as close to profundity as this man will ever get - pretty damn close.",10

1 October 2021,"Witty, Quirky, Violent","You really can't go wrong making an anti-Nazi war movie. I think that's the one war everyone pretty much agrees upon. Quentin Tarantino takes some liberties with historical occurrences and I'm not mad. Sometimes you have to tell the story how you wanted it to be even if it's not how it was.

The Inglourious Basterds the movie is named after were a band of mostly Jewish-Americans taking the fight to the Nazis in France. They were led by Aldo (Brad Pitt), a Tennessee bred soldier who demanded Nazi scalps from his men. While the Basterds were fighting in their own unique fashion, a French Jewess who narrowly escaped slaughter was planning an attack of her own. While these two separate and capable parties were doing their thing, one SS officer seemed to be Johnny-on-the-spot for every plot. Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) was the German Sherlock Holmes and his demise couldn't come soon enough.

IB had Tarantino written all over it. It was witty, it was verbose, it was quirky, and it was violent.",7
30 August 2009,A disgusting travesty,"This is a disgusting travesty of a film that does its best to re-imagine the Holocaust as a comic book that was conceived by a 12-year old boy. There are a myriad of films that portray World War II in a fanciful light, but ""Inglorious Basterds"" is one of the few that I can recall that uses the extermination of the Jews as a launching pad for an outlandish Sam Peckenpaugh -inspired cartoon which depicts historical figures like Adolph Hitler and Joseph Goebbels - monsters who were responsible for the murder of millions of people - on the same level as Lex Luthor or The Joker.

Brad Pitt and his crew of seemingly invincible marauders cut through the German lines with such ease that it's a wonder that the war lasted as long as it did, and with such a sadistic bloodthirstiness that they seemed likely subjects for a war crimes trial at the conflict's end. Tarantino crudely and artlessly tries to take the narrative between their bloody and far-fetched ""heroics"" and more genuine atrocities suffered by victims of the Nazis, so the line between Tarantino's outlandish fairy tale and the real-life horrors of the Holocaust are blurred to a degree that made me feel like the director was exploiting the brutal death of six million people in order to splash a lot of cool, fake blood on a movie set. That's perfectly fine if you're making a flight of fantasy like ""Kill Bill"", but the blood that was spilled in the Holocaust wasn't supplied by Hollywood special effects wizards and deserves more respect than it's given here.",1
18 December 2009,Utter $hite,"Well what a crap movie.

I liked Pulp Fiction, but Tarantino is nothing more that a pretentious penis head, and in my opinion, quite talentless.

Brad Pitt was terrible, absolutely terrible.

The whole story was laughable, and was Hitler supposed to be funny? He was made to look goofy but I didn't laugh once at this stinking dog turd.

Anyone who rates this crap as even good needs their head testing or needs to stop licking Tarantinos backside.

23 July 2009,Waltz is a Genius!!!!!,"I had the PRIVILEGE of attending the UK premier of Inglorious Basterds this evening! Having seen the trailers i had high hopes but had doubts due to a string of self indulgent films (c'mon lets be honest, self indulgence is his tarantinos middle name)

I was surprised to find though that he had pulled the cat out of the bag with this one. The film is rich with interesting dialogue, Perfect timed comedy with a dash of brutal assassination.

The crowning glory of this film though lies with Christoph Waltz whom no fault or error can be found. He manages to create a real tension in the audience whilst remaining quite ""theatrical"" (couldn't think of a better word). He definitely deserved his prize at Cannes and is heading for an Oscar no doubt!!!! Hoping to see him in something again soon!

5 October 2009,Bring on the hate,"I might be one of the only people crying foul but aren't we getting diminishing returns with Tarantino since Kill Bill 2 ? I was majorly disappointed with Inglourious Basterds. I found the film weak, unsatisfying and plain long. It seems that Tarantino is writing longer and longer (and longer) conversation pieces or monologues about mundane or inane subjects with a very short (or no) payoff at the end. In his earlier filmography, those parts used to be clever, somewhat brilliant despite their outward superficiality but he did limit them, pace them better and they were nowhere near as self-indulgent as in Basterds. He relies on the quality of his actors to keep our collective interest but that can only go so far. I suppose those drawn-out conversations can build up a certain tension if you're patient enough and that Tarantino delights in doing the unexpected even with characters you think might be major. I'll give him some credit for subverting usual movie clichés, which might be due to his extensive movie knowledge.

Regarding the featured Basterds commando, they were a disappointment. Besides their leader (Brad Pitt's character) who sounds and looks more like a southern redneck than a Jewish American, the other members of the commando have extremely little screen time, even less talking time and zero personality. Being angry and killing Nazis with a baseball bat is not good characterization. If you were expecting some kind of over-the-top revenge trip on Nazis by the Jews, you'll get very little satisfaction even at the end as the Jews themselves are basically superfluous. I would argue that the German characters shown here are, in general, more interesting, likable and/or multifaceted. You almost feel sorry for some of them (which perhaps was Tarentino's intention but then he should have worked more on the Jewish characters to compensate). The actions scenes are usually quick and cringe-worthy with a longer set-piece at the end that was not particularly exhilarating or well shot. I know violence in real life is probably like that but their shortness was accentuated by the very static overly long conversations.

The most memorable character by far is the SS colonel Hans Landa. Beyond his amazing linguistic skills (my native language is french and his was very good), you'll enjoy his suave friendly unpredictable antics. He manages to make extremely long conversations somewhat bearable through sheer screen presence. I also liked very much Brad Pitt's enthusiastic and fun portrayal of Aldo Raine even though he's caricatured and not particularly believable. The 2 characters above are mostly responsible for the few funny bits. The cast in general was very good especially the 2 female leading roles. Certain trends (or trademarks) in Tarentino's film-making are getting worse and you should avoid this if you're looking for great action, comedy or war film unless you're really keen on overlong Tarentino-type dialogue and want to see great multilingual acting.

Rating: 4 out of 10",4
23 January 2020,"Somewhat silly plot, but nevertheless quite good suspense and juicy acting performances.","Brad Pitt is undercover in Nazi Germany during World War II with a secret mission to kill Hitler. Will he succeed or die trying?

The bad: this plot is rather silly at key moments, because some events that take place are simply not true to life or highly unlikely. Dont wanna nag about that flaw too much though, but it is a thing that bugs me nevertheless and it makes me only wanna award it with 8 stars, instead of 9 or 10.

The good: the suspense is terrific. Tarantino is a master at building up suspense in long lasting scenes. The dialogues and characters are to die for, ranging from violently wicked to hilariously stupid.

This is one of my favourite Tarantino movies of the last 20 years. It nowhere near equals Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs or Jackie Brown, but it comes close. Seen it many many times and I will enjoy it many more times to come.",8

26 September 2009,Only in a sick society can a guy like Tarantino make any money.,"I will make it short: Tarantino is a very sick individual, no doubt. He has no sense for timing, he steals of other ( better) directors like it would be virtuous, and he absolutely knows nothing about WWII. Brad Pitt, who is one of my favourite actors, simply stank. His accent was awful and he overacted like an amateur. The scene where his bluff of being an Italian should have been called, but for some weird reason is not, is absolutely laughable, but nevertheless not funny.

We were a bunch of guys watching that movie and none, seriously none liked it. I firmly believe that Tarantino is in love with himself and that shows what bad taste he has.

1 March 2021,Inglorious Basterds 2009 Review,"Tarantino does it again. Although not my favorite Tanantino film, it's still really great! If you've seen any of his previous work you know exactly what to expect. Inglorious Basterds does some masterful buildup. It all builds up to that finale, which is satisfying and so worth the 2 hour wait. Within the two hours before the finale contains some of the best character building i've seen, with some great acting (as usual, Tarantino knows exactly who he wants) that just make the film come alive. That combined with some tense action and some extremely suspenseful moments keep you on your toes the entire time. There's even a lot of humor in this which I wasn't expecting!

Personally there are some points that I felt dragged, but I feel like this will be even better with a second watch, and make most of those moments feel more meaningful.

12 June 2016,Most overrated movie of the 21st Century,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz!

Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo!

12 August 2009,Typical Tarantino overwhelms World War II fantasy,"Whenever I view a Quentin Tarantino film I expect a quirky plot, decent acting and a cool soundtrack. Unfortunately, I also expect non-existent pacing, a confusing narrative and long, drawn-out talking sequences.

You get plenty of the above with his newest effort, the revenge fantasy, ""Inglourious Basterds, a remake of the 1978 Italian picture, ""Bastardi Senza Gloria"" (literally ""Bastards Without Glory""). It's ""The Dirty Dozen"" meets ""Valkyrie"" meets ""Kill Bill"" and tells the story of a small band of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers who are dropped behind enemy lines in German-occupied France and strike fear in the hearts of Hitler's military.

Led by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), the group accomplishes this by raids and ambushes in which dead German soldiers are scalped (in some very gruesome scenes) and survivors have swastikas carved into their foreheads (think younger, more Teutonic versions of Charles Manson). While there are eight of these commandos, the two most interesting are Pfc. Omar ""The Bear Jew"" Ulmer (Omar), who beats Nazis with baseball bats; and Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), an ex-Wehrmacht soldier who killed a dozen of his own troops.

The trailers for the movie are really pushing this plot line, but that's a false premise. There are really only a few scenes of such carnage, instead the story revolves mostly around a lisping SS colonel, Hans ""The Jew-Hunter"" Landa (Christoph Waltz, a German actor appearing in a rare U.S. production) and a French Jew, Soshanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent, a French actress appearing in a rare U.S. production), whose family Landa had killed.

She owns a movie house in Paris and becomes acquainted with Frederick Zoller (Daniel Brühl), a war hero who supposedly killed over 100 U.S. soldiers in Italy. A film of this exploit, ""A Nation's Pride,"" was made by Nazi Minister of Propaganda, Josef Goebbels (Sylvester Groth). Of course, the premier of this film will take place at the picture show.

Also complicating matters is a British spy, Lt. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender) who is unintentionally hilariously briefed by Michael Myers (doing his worst Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake impersonation) and Winston Churchill (Rod Taylor, ""The Time Machine,"" ""The Birds""). Then, there's another subplot which has the Fuerher himself (Martin Wuttke) possibly attending the premier.

To complete these various story lines, Tarantino falls back on his habit of filming scene after scene of people sitting around tables, talking, talking and talking (see ""Grindhouse's Death Car""). Talking in taverns, talking in houses, talking in war rooms, talking in basements, talking in prisons. Mr. Tarantino, there is a person who toils on every film set that ever existed - this person called an ""editor."" Please make use of this person.

These sequences swallow up about 80 percent of the movie's 2-hour, 30-minute running time and leave precious little time for Pitt, who does well, albeit with a bad Southern accent, and his mercenaries.

There some good things about the film, however. The sets and costumes are wonderful and quite accurate as far as period detail goes; the location cinematography by Robert Richardson (""The Aviator,"" ""Kill Bill, Vols. 1 and 2"") is terrific; the movie uses authentic German, French and Italian (with subtitles); and Tarrantino knows his German cinema history, dropping names like Lili Riefenstahl, P.W. Pabst and Emil Jannings.

A good surgeon could have removed about 45-minutes from this movie, though, added a few more scenes of the Basterds and toned down the David Bowie. Then, it might have been the taut, compelling film I thought it could be.",4

8 February 2023,A tad underwhelming!,"Technically brilliant, like every other Tarantino feature, but it falls short when it comes to the narrative and its ultimate implications. Given their motivations, their innate aspirations, I feel, the narrative fell short of reaching that greater ceiling I was anxiously awaiting for.

Although they had a very gifted ensemble in function who did not in any way disappoint with their intense, commanding acts (with Christoph Waltz being the indisputable stand out), I am afraid even their fulfilling services failed to contribute to a greater outcome or, at the very least, a yield I could personally be content with.

10 September 2022,Don't know what kept me from watching this before,"A fantastic film, which has an espionage feel to it along with graphic violence and gore, which I personally love watching (especially evil people getting butchered and shot gorily and stuff).

This has some of the best performances I have seen from any actor. Brad Pitt did a spectacular job and that accent of his made it more entertaining (don't know if he nailed the accent or not). Melanie Laurent also played her role to perfection. Though being an ensemble piece, the show stealer for me is Christoph Waltz. Man, he had such a great screen presence and I couldn't picture anyone else playing that role! There were no weak links whatsoever. This movie is conversation-driven for the majority of its duration, but was thoroughly engaging and well-written. Cinematography, sound design and VFX were top notch. Another major plus point is the costuming and make-up, though minimalistic and nothing extravagant, but must have been thoroughly difficult to nail it, as simple make-up and costuming often proves to be the most difficult to get it right. The set designs also gave the feel of the 1940's era.

A must-watch for all the people who love intense character-driven stories along with occasional gore and bloodshed. A solid 10/10 from my side!",10

2 June 2009,"Brave, unique and just sheer brilliant!","Inglorious Basterds makes no apologies, asks for no forgiveness, it's a no holds barred assault on the senses. Tarantino doesn't care if he offends, if he steps all over stereotypes and clichés, this is film making at it purest. It's great to see a film maker whose work clearly isn't interfeared with by the powers that be. Tarantino is a master of effortlessly cranking up immense tension and suddenly mixing it with laugh out loud moments; you're not sure if you should be looking away in disgust or rolling around laughing, either way it's a roller coaster and one not to be missed! It's not for everyone, certainly if you're not a fan of Tarantino's style, this may be a little hard to swallow, but never-the-less, it is a film which simply has to be seen. No self respecting film fan should miss this. And the performance of Christoph Waltz... Oscar don't you dare ignore him!!

23 September 2011,Messy and indecisive,"Being a devoted Tarantino fan, for me this movie was a disappointment. Inglourious Basterds has its flashes of genius, as you'd expect from a Tarantino movie, but they're lost in a muddle of half-baked ideas and characters, and in the end it's probably his weakest movie so far, lacking in the one thing that even Death Proof had - energy and pace. The film does have some mentionable qualities, that are enough to make it watchable and even quite enjoyable - as you would expect from Tarantino, it's fantastically professional in every aspect, especially cinematography and sound. Some of the characters have tons of potential, and the actors are usually spot on (another honorable mention to Christoph Waltz), but there are so many characters that not one of them is developed enough to be satisfying. Tarantino fails to juggle a large number of plots and sub-plots the way he did in Jackie Brown in Pulp Fiction, and they never intertwine in any meaningful way. And worst of all, it's not even that controversial or offensive - Tarantino took a lot of liberties with history, and he certainly created violence that's more realistic and more explicit than ever before, but it's really just violence for the sake of itself. I realize I'm in a minority here, but I don't recommend this movie. I'm not saying don't watch it - there's a lot here to enjoy. But in the end, it's just not that good.",7
7 July 2023,One of his Worst,"It's titled 'Inglorious Basterds' - but at least half the movie is a boring story about a girl working in a theater.

And it gets weirder. The boring story is attempting to be serious; while the IB half is very slapstick, popcorn-esque storytelling.

I have long suspected that QT is scared to death to make a serious movie, that could actually be compared to other serious movies - thereby exposing him to ridicule.

His shtick has become his crutch.

And it's gotten worse over time, not better.

His most serious movie is RDs, followed by Pulp Fiction, and on and on down the list.

Either he is scared, like a poker player who wins a big pot, and then plays safe for the rest of the game - or he is suffering from some sort of brain deteriorating disease.",5

31 August 2009,Quentin Tarantino's best movie yet,"I have read criticisms of Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"", saying that it glorifies violence or that it glosses over Nazi atrocities. Some people apparently don't realize that no part of the movie is meant to be taken seriously. This flick should not be interpreted as a historical film. It is basically a comedic spaghetti western set in WWII.

Brad Pitt, playing a none-too-educated (but extremely clever) yokel leading a platoon of Jewish-American soldiers into Nazi-occupied France to kill and scalp Nazis, puts on one of the funniest performances that I've seen in years. And let me tell you, this movie leaves NOTHING to the imagination! As is the case with pretty much any Tarantino movie, this is one that squeamish people should avoid as if it was the H1N1 virus. For non-squeamish people, this is the flick for you! Tarantino is not afraid to show anything and play it for laughs. The scene in the cinema is, in my opinion, the movie's highlight: I would rank it right up there with Gene Kelly's stroll down the pluvial sidewalk in ""Singin' in the Rain"".

Among the rest of the cast: Christoph Waltz as Nazi Col. Hans Landa, aka the Jew Killer; Diane Kruger as German actress Bridget von Hammersmark, collaborating with the Allies; Til Schweiger as a German-born Jewish soldier with the Americans; Mike Myers as an English officer; and Melanie Laurent as the daughter of a Jewish family, now seeking revenge.

All in all, I recommend this movie as much as possible.",10

9 October 2009,Basterdized Gloryholes,"This starts out silly/cool, getting sillier by the minute and ends up something like a twelve year old's revenge-fantasy of what should have happened to those meanie Nazis. Sort of like Abbot and Costello Meets the Nazis. Or The Three Stooges' Kooky Trip to Göring and Hitler. I admire the hell out of QT, but this is a miss and the praise lavished on this movie is a sad case of the emperors new clothes. The key scene for me is in the Parisian cinema. With Hitler enjoying the Nazi-propaganda film. Hitler seated in medium close-up; moronically joyous at the violence inflicted on the allies by the nazi sniper on screen; slapping his knee and wheezing laughter from his sweaty face. Disgusting as his reaction may be, this is a mirror-image of the faces around you in the theater five minutes later, at his extended come-uppeance.

-So, if you had the same moronic joyous reaction; I guess yet another Gloryhole got Basterdized during the showing of this movie. And you're sitting on it.

2 November 2009,Not Very Glourious,"Overlong, talky, wartime adventure punctuated with moments of sadistic violence. Tarantino seems to have slipped since the stylishly exciting yet derivative mish-mash of KILL BILL VOL 1. His past few films have had their moments just as BASTERDS does, but the moments do not make up for the tedium inbetween. The reflexive filmic quotations are amusing if somewhat corny but there is much to savor in the characterization of Christoph Waltz (bravo!). Still, a turkey is a turkey. Quite frankly I'm surprised that fans are giving him a free pass on this one. I don't hear too many people defending DEATH PROOF, which has about as much substance as BASTERDS. I doubt I'll revisit this one. Where is the director of JACKIE BROWN?

31 July 2009,dialogue language visuals homage to cinema,"I have been feeling a little disappointed by Tarantino ever since death proof. But i insist it was only a little, because i can appreciate the amount of work in producing such an homage to stunts people. Inglorious Basterds has definitely propelled Tarantino to the top ranks in my universe. This movie can be summed up (albeit inadequately) in one word : ""RAW"".

There is an intense emotion in every scene. Revenge and justice seem to be the main themes, From the start of the movie one feels compassion towards the victims of the Nazis, and is placed in Tarantino's fictional dimension of the WW2 historical context.

Characters are unpredictiable, fun, scary, brutal, sexy, and other adjectives i am sure are escaping my mind that are just as fitting and positive. I won't go in to an appreciation of each character, but the other comments by fellow users sum up the appreciation of the various performances.

Dialogue has evolved from the classic Tarantino ""bad ass"" provocative style as seen in Pulp Fiction and Death Proof. One can feel in the dialogues that Tarantino is making more open references to other movies. Indeed, many dialogues were near lessons in cinema to the audience, the setting partly takes place at a movie premiere ; a reference to a movie is close around every corner.

It is nice to see that each language presented (German, French, and English) is employed rather equally and naturally. I speak both French and English very fluently, and am frequently disappointed in how English speaking characters in french movies act poorly, and how french speaking characters in English/American movies act poorly. Amazingly enough, Tarantino managed to make his actors pull off a natural and graceful performance from his actors. It helps put the audience in context of the historical context. Indeed ; soldiers, spies and civilans rarely understood soldiers/spies/civilians from other countries.

The visuals/photography are beautiful, with sceneries convincingly conveying a 1940s WWII Europe. The outfits are perfect, and the violence orgasmically/realistically conveyed. No punches are held back, and the Nazis are often shown being tortured. This makes the movie not open to all audiences ; the graphic violence can shock the more sensitive demographic.

volumes can be written about this movie. But the movie is so good, that during the North American Inglorious Basterds premiere at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal, i had to pee, but refused to go so as to not miss one single scene. I hope that image conveys how strongly i feel about this movie, and i'm a hard audience to please.",9
24 January 2010,When you lose your heart and soul as an artist....,"...you get something like this.Playing with artistic concepts and instruments as artifices in order to communicate something is one thing,but when you either have no idea what you want to say or your idea is something so personal and incomprehensible that maybe it's best to bury it in you rather than produce something for others to see,then what you end up with are those artifices only,without any kind of substance.Now,I'm not sure if Tarantino is either clueless(or somewhat of a nihilist) or that he really has an absurd agenda,but either way,his latest movies are pointless.I gave Kill Bill 1 5/10 because I at least acknowledged the technical side,but in this case,even the technical pluses are drowned in a sea of absurdity.If Tarantino thinks that he can rely 100% on reinterpreting movie clichés in a movie, without any regard for reality and common sense,then he's mistaken.It may work for the Zucker brothers or Jim Abrahams,but this one is no feel-good comedy,but rather a fictional continuous gore-fest and surrealist crap.If people are buying this one,it says something really disturbing about them.About how people are entertained these days.Tarantino may have largely avoided the ""Hollywood way"",but he slipped into something very idiotic.So,1 point for the technical part and for entertainment, and 2 points for Waltz (Landa) and the whole multi-lingual thing(impressive).The rest is pointless.Really garbage.",3
20 April 2010,Propaganda,"This is the sort of thing that you expect during a war and in America we have one every few years so there are plenty of them to compare this dog of a film to.

This is, above all, a propaganda film made, apparently, to demonstrate that all cruelty and savagery is permitted as long as it is in the interest of the Hollywood master race, the American. We are treated to psychopathic war criminals who extract their arbitrary vengeance on anyone they see as inferior and subhuman. This is supposed to be inspiring or amusing because the chosen villains are Nazis. This appears to be the the gist of the action.

There are a couple of obvious problems with this. First, of course, is the nature of evil. St. Ignatius in his spiritual exercises suggested imagining the army of good lined up against the army of evil so that one might contemplate the differences. This exercise has some problems as Thomas Merton pointed out, saying that he couldn't do it because it became much too much like Cecil B. Demille's Hollywood epics. Here, however, the legions of the good are apparently headed by a fellow playing a Cherokee descended country bumpkin who wants nothing more than to kill Nazis and who has, as a right hand man, a deranged Bostonian Jew who beats people to death while babbling about the Red Sox, for reasons I was never clear about. Clearly this is not what St. Ignatius had in mind and does not seem to partake of any essence of the good.

Second, having been raised by German Nazis in post war America I am in a position to point out that while Nazi ideology is fairly hideous, the Nazis themselves were, like other people, real people with faults and virtues. It was, I believe, Brownowski who said that the horror of the death camps was not that people were led to their deaths by Germans, but that they were led to their deaths by people whistling Mozart.

In the beginning of this film the countryside is being scoured by a German officer in a well pressed uniform looking for Jews using a small notebook. We know that, in fact, the ""final solution"" was implemented by means of an IBM machine leased from the company in America. All very modern and civilized. The Nazis were not Neanderthals who dined on the blood of babies every evening, they were among the most civilized people that the world had to offer at the time.

The lunatics in this film are, in large part, Americans and, in particular, Jewish Americans. We are presented with a gallery of Jewish criminals being given a last chance at redemption by the country boy who wants to have them scalp Nazis. Scalping is credited in the movie to the Apaches, a tribe of native Americans who lived in the hills of western Arizona and who did not practice scalping, at least not until they learned it from the inventors of the practice, the English. So the scalp hunting Jews are portrayed as sympathetic because of what they or their kin suffered from the Germans. This is a familiar type reminiscent of some of Leon Uris' characters who survived the war to become terrorists for the yet unfounded state of Israel in Exodus.

All of this and much more, is just the sort of thing one expects in wartime. It is called propaganda. The enemy, in this case the Nazi, is portrayed as less than human or as a defective human who can be killed in amusing ways by any form of cruelty or savagery because it is clothed in the armor of rightness. It's all OK, because it's just a country boy's attempt, to distribute a little justice in a confused and possibly mad world and if the Bear Jew and some of the others get a little carried away, well, it's all in a good cause.

Of course, it is all in the past and in Europe. No Iraqi's, Afghanis, or Palestinians are killed by the glorious bastards, and no reference oblique or direct is made that I noticed, although I admit my attention wandered rather badly in the second half. Still, with those wars under way this is the move that is offered to us as a paean to the rightness of the American and for that it is should be clearly labeled as propaganda.

I find all this to be a far more than I care to spend an hour and a half watching and I do not recommend it to you.",1
24 August 2009,Inglorious Letdown,"I'm a die-hard Tarantino fan, so I was pretty psyched going into the theater. When I left, the most feeling I could sum up about the movie was 'meh'. It's got some great bits, don't get me wrong - the acting and the dialog, at times, are just amazing. But things draaaaag out, and between trying to be funny and trying to be serious, it fails at both.

It's hard to cheer for the heroes, because their actions make them just as bad as those they torment. The film takes itself far, far too seriously, and that's really what ruins it.

I don't mind the fairy-tale style, I don't mind the hyperactive violence. The acting, dialog and cinematography are amazing. But when put together, someone forgot how to edit a film for time and pacing, and found it all so amazing they couldn't cut a second more.

It's disjointed, lengthy to the point of nausea, and amoral to the point of making the heroes no different from the villains. I wanted to like this film, but I can't. Don't bother with paying for tickets.",6

While the majority of people would tell you that he is a genius filmmaker who hasn't one bad film to his name, there is a small, but vocal minority who will tell you that while he is talented, he hasn't made anything fantastic for a while. Sure, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are masterpieces and Jackie Brown is his most mature work, but his other work has been deeply disappointing to say the least. The Kill Bill movies were self- indulgent, badly written and overly sadistic, and Death Proof was just boring. So would Inglourious Basterds be a late return to form? Well, while good, it doesn't present Tarantino at his best, and the film is still problematic as a whole.

The story is that during their occupation of France, the Nazis premiere a propaganda film at a theater to celebrate their achievements. When this is found out, many use this as a plan to kill the Nazis once and for all, including the British army, the theater's owner Shoshanna who has a vendetta against the Nazis and a group known as the Basterds, a bunch of American Jews who have traveled to France in order to kill Nazis.

While the plot is non-linear like Tarantino's other films, it suffers from the fact that there is a lot of pointless material in the film. Many characters who have no effect on the story are killed off, some scenes go on for way too long & some of the protagonists are deeply unlikable. This mainly implies to the Basterds themselves, who despite their cause, are portrayed as sadistic psychopaths who kill and torture many Nazis, despite some of the Nazis having legitimate grievances (i.e. having a child, keeping quiet to protect their fellow men). I'm not expecting a film like this to portray Nazis with Downfall-esque sympathy, but considering that most of the Nazis in the film are shown to be more human than in other films, the constant sadism feels unnecessary, and you can't help but feel that the Basterds are no better than the Nazis themselves.

The film's sadism is a major problem. Tarantino has a weird love for extreme violence, which would be fine provided that this was a more tongue in cheek context, but considering that the movie has a mostly straight face, you can't help but feel that the movie goes too far in places. This includes cutting the scalps off Nazis, beating them to death with baseball bats, torturing an innocent witness by sticking their fingers into a bullet wound and seeing someone get strangled to death, made even more disturbing by how it is partially real (Tarantino actually strangled one of his actresses to make the film look more real). Lovely.

It's a shame that the film is bogged down by being overly long and overly sadistic, as there is some great stuff in there. As many others have pointed out, the opening scene is brilliant. Great acting, dialogue, cinematography and pacing. It's also a perfect example of how Tarantino should use his unique brand of dialogue, to be quirky and advance the story, instead of using it to ramble. It's definitely the best scene in the film, and continues 2009's tradition of having great opening scenes (i.e. Watchmen, Up) in films.

On top of this, some of the characters are very well done. Shoshanna is the best character in the film, being the most three-dimensional and interesting, and her story arc in the film is the most compelling because of it, essentially being the brilliant female revenge story that Kill Bill should have been. You just wish the whole movie was focused on her, but still, her scenes are where the film reaches its peak, and Melanie Laurent delivers one of the best (and sadly underrated) performances in recent memory. It's also a very well- made film. The cinematography is gorgeous, the sets and production design are well done, and the acting is very good from everybody, even though I feel that some are wasted, mainly that of Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz, the latter of whom does the absolute best with a weak character. If you want to see him at his best, watch The Zero Theorem instead.

It's because of these things that I feel that while Inglourious Basterds is a slight return to form for Tarantino, it's still dragged down by many of Tarantino's usual faults. From the overly sadistic violence of the film, to the overlong running time, to the self-indulgent touches to the film (i.e. having a Mike Myers cameo, or Samuel L. Jackson as a narrator, clearly his easiest paycheck yet), the film's positive attributes, while present, are still balanced out by the film's many faults. It's definitely a step forward, but there's still some work to be done.",6
15 September 2019,Rubbish apart from the brilliant acting,"Some incredible performances in this movie, especially Christoph Waltz as Colonel Landa. The actors carry the movie. But I found the story pretty weak and not very engaging, overly long and rather dragging at times, and the whole tone to be weirdly and offensively dissonant with its subject material. I think the film is founded on rather shallow ideas, which are conveyed with typical Tarantino slickness, but in a crass way. Different elements of the movie lack cohesion - very jarringly at times - and the overall tone is rather soulless, despite some stellar character performances which (only just) make it worthwhile to watch.

22 September 2009,Tarantino's World War II movie - I don't get it.,"The opening to the film is exquisitely shot. It carries a fantastic level of suspense and emotion that made me think that we were in the realms of greatness. I was misled. If anything, the opening to the film is the film's peak and everything subsequently meanders down hill. The story of the film, as put out in the media is of a rag tag bunch of men led by Brad Pitt on a marauding crusade into enemy territory with the sole purpose of killing as many Nazis as gruesomely as possible. And the film is, in part, about that. But there is a much more interesting story of revenge that begins in that very first sequence that I didn't feel was adequately explored, as it somehow became second fiddle to the Basterds of the title. I guess Tarantino has his pick of people to work with and that, it seems, may be his downfall. There is no doubting that in Christoph Waltz, he has unearthed a gem, but that is far outweighed by the bizarre turn of Brad Pitt and needless cameos. For some reason Brad Pitt plays his character with a conscious under bite, by which I mean it only seems to appear when he thinks about it needing to be there. Where Pitt's good friend George Clooney can excel in the screwball characterisation as a wannabe Clark Gable, Pitt flows and crashes and burns badly. Mike Myers appears in a pointless cameo and the use of Eli Roth seems questionable at best. All of this lends the film a boy's club smugness in the same way that the Ocean films seem more like a gas for the stars than the audience. So, it comes across as a big laugh-in for the actors, all, except the European trio of Waltz, Bruhl and Laurent, mugging to camera in what seems like an effort to get laughs. The dark humour and snappy dialogue of Tarantino's early movies has gone. To be replaced by laboured dialogue in the style of Tarantino – something we saw enough of in the 90s with the numerous Tarantino-esquire efforts. It felt much like a film student in the late 90's, wishing to be the next Tarantino, has gone a bit too far for his student film in trying to include snappy dialogue unrelated to the screen imageryexcept this is Tarantino and it no student movie. The film also produces too many nods to Tarantino nerds (if they even exist) with the shootout where you're not sure how everyone got shot to the use of Harvey Keitel and Samuel L Jackson as voice cameos and the endless ""all the characters looking down to the camera"" shots that would have once made it new and exciting. It now seems a little tired and is definitely too self-congratulatory. At times the film is beautiful to watch. The cinematography is immense and one thing Tarantino does still manage to do to a high standard is choose his music well. The film covers a range of music that is often used in other film first, but does not look out of place here. The audience, however, seemed to be tuned into the humour and the style much more than me. There were laughs and guffaws as Pitt stuck out his chin and I had the general feeling that everyone was really enjoying the show. So, perhaps it was me. Perhaps I was not in the mood for it or perhaps I just didn't get it. But from the opening sequence that, to me, showed so much promise and, more importantly, showed what Tarantino is capable of, the rest became a damp squib (many of which were used throughout, as you can imagine).",5

25 November 2009,Another stinker from pain in the ass Quentin,"No words can describe how dreadful this movie is. Brad Pitt can't really act. That's evident from watching this. He thinks that he needs to pull a lip like Benjamin Buford Blue from Forrest Gump for the whole film. There are no real characters, just caricatures. The rewriting of history is the most objectionable bit. If the real Nazis were as oafish as portrayed here, the war would have lasted a week. The part that I cannot stand is the way that Quentin makes no apologies for setting up scenes of inordinate length, with no editing, and leaden dialogue. Every director has their own style, but Quentin does this kind of stuff in every film. He's no master like Scorcese. No thanks to Quentin for his ridiculous take on history. I think I will watch 'Downfall' a few times in a row now to get the taste of this stinker out of my mouth.

18 November 2009,Not so glorious violence,"The first half of this movie was quite good. It was interesting and suspenseful. The second half was pretty bad. The comic book revenge story came full circle and we see lots of comic Nazi characters and some badly acted ""good guys"" blowing them away. There's a lot of violence in this movie. I'm not squeamish about violence but I think it should at least have some purpose in a movie. There was little purpose to the violence here except to create a genre film where we see lots of people getting mowed down with rifles. We're somehow supposed to be amused by this.

I watched Reservoir Dogs recently. There was a movie where violence was employed effectively. It was realistic within the world the movie created. There were never any over-the-top sound effect. It was a crime movie which played it straight. Inglorious Basterds should have played it straight but didn't. I was rolling my eyes at how the violence was exaggerated with sound effects and extra bullets to the head and face.

None of the back-story of any of the Basterds is really explained either, they're simply Nazi hunters. We don't really get to like any of them either because they're too busy cutting scalps off and shooting people in the face. It's all about ""revenge"" and very little else.

There was 2 1/2 hours to work with here but few of the Basterds were really examined in depth. This seems like it was simply a revenge flick pure and simple. We saw that in Tarantino's last flick, ""Death Proof"" which I didn't care for either. It suffered the same problems. The characters were almost interchangeable.

The first half again, was pretty good. I wanted to see the exploits of the Inglorious Basterds across Europe. I was presented with a much lamer movie about the resistance movement plotting revenge against some comic book Nazis when they all go to one movie premiere in France.",4
30 March 2010,Absolute garbage of the lowest order.,"I have just sat through ""Inglorious Basterds"" which i bought on DVD today. The only thing that made the two and a half hours viewing bearable was the amount of wine i was drinking.

If Tarantino has to resort to parodies, homages, ripping off old theme music ( did anyone else remember the music from ""Kelly's Heroes"" used in the cinema scene near the end ?) and boring us all S***less with pointless dialogues in foreign languages that neither enhance the characters or stories, I suggest he quits now.

There is little character development, totally over the top violence (meaningless), a preposterous story, wooden acting (pitt in particular), Continuity errors a-plenty and holes in the script that you could drive a Nazi staff car through.

When is he going to get it through his head that he doesn't have Carte Blanche to do what ever the hell he wants with a new offering just because ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" broke new ground in the early 90's ? He follows the same format, breaking the ""story"" down into chapters and mixing up scenes, because thats all he knows but fails miserably. If a film isn't credible or entertaining then the audience is being conned, pure and simple.

Having watched Quentin Tarantino descend from the most original film maker around to someone who churns out crap like ""death Proof"" and ""Inglorious Basterds"" I can honestly say that I'm not going to give him another chance with my viewing money.

I suggest he takes his head out of his posterior and remembers that the viewing public will one day bury him if this shameless self indulgence continues.",1

8 December 2009,Not Very Glorious But Passable To An Extent,"So much hype but does the film deliver on its promises? Not exactly. Tarantino has managed to capture the European essence in his film. The sets, the landscapes, the costumes, the actors and the camera-work that gives a spacious feel of old Europe are well used. The film also has a polished look with some fine cinematography and background score. Most of Tarantino's films are ridden on dialogue and violence. 'Inglourious Basterds' is no exception but here he fails to create a balance unlike in his previous works ranging from 'Pulp Fiction' to 'Deathproof' where he succeeded in combining the two. Here, the dialogues are very long but most of the time they lack the meat and after some point they lose momentum. As someone who enjoys violence in movies, 'Inglourious Basterds' fails to deliver on that count too. For me the violence has to have some relevance to the story but here it appears a little out of place and safe (when compared to his other works). I didn't find the characters to be well developed either but some of the acting namely by a tortured Mélanie Laurent and a hateful Christoph Waltz was very good. Diane Kruger too manages to stand out in a brief role. Brad Pitt fails to impress. Daniel Brühl is passable. Overall, in my opinion, 'Inglourious Basterds' is a strictly average film mainly lifted by fine execution and a few notable sequences like the fire scene and the shootout in the bar.",

20 August 2010,A True Homage to Stupidity!,"You might enjoy this movie if you believe Tom and Jerry cartoons are the greatest artistic achievement of all time. You might enjoy this movie if you have absolutely no knowledge of history. You might enjoy this movie if you have never seen a good one. You might enjoy this movie if your favorite actors are Larry, Curly and Moe.

Tarantino has created his buffoonish, cartoonish, lampoonish impression of World War II. When every character and action is a joke, why give a shoot for over 2 and a half hours of shtick and schlock. There is no acting. It is all acting out. Tarantino is impressed with anyone who can speak or read a non-English language. There are only 6 billion such humans in the world.

Tarantino has such a warped concept of what is good acting, good writing. He can frame a shot. The first scene is what made the movie with critics. They left after the first 20 minutes and assumed the rest was as good.

What is worst of all is that Tarantino betrays his extreme ignorance of all realities of WW2. In order to take liberties with the truth you need to at least understand where the facts stop and fantasy begins. Tarantino misses the boat completely, so the entire premise of the movie is totally flawed. How could he miss depicting the Nazis as vampires? Why didn't he show Hitler's 30 inch ebony dildo and his crypt under the Brandenburg Gate? Also, the real Inglorious Basterds were not Jews, they were escapees from an insane asylum. They all had extreme physical deformities. Obviously, Hollywood wasn't prepared for the sight of freaks. Those facts should have been included. No legitimate WW2 movie would neglect to include them.",1
6 October 2009,"He loves his movies, doesn't he?","Everything is forgiven because ""Inglorious Basterds"" is so entertaining and at the end of the day that'ìs what matters. I think it's a pity that certain critics, specially in Italy, are determined to transform this clever pulp director into some kind of god. Maybe, partly, because Tarantino has been very clever, elevating some of the Italian pulp movies of the 60's and 70's to a sort of cult status. Italy is very grateful for that, he's rewarded with interminable praise. I fear that's the wrong approach, it's also confusing. He makes popcorn movies, brilliantly. The characters have never anything important to say, Burger King, Superman, that's the extent of its depth and I think he's tapping into a society that's getting shallower and shallower with every passing year. But, if I'm mentioning this instead of talking about all the great things I could be saying about his movie is because there is a strange force trying to brain wash me into believing that Tarantino is the most important influence in movies since time immemorial. No, he's a great director of inconsequential fun movies. I consider myself a fan and I intend to see all his future movies. This one has some wonderful touches, winking at other movies by John Sturges, Robert Aldrich etc. Brad Pitt and in particular Christoph Waltz give wonderful performances. Waltz is at the center of my favorite scenes in the film. Enjoy this movies for what it is and not for what critics are saying it is. You'll enjoy it even more that way.",7
22 August 2009,WWII not an ideal backdrop for QT's masterful talents,"""Inglourious Basterds"" is many things, but one thing it is not is a World War II drama. The setting is an alternate version of history, where Nazi-occupied France becomes the wild west for another of filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's Sergio Leone-inspired pulp action movies where various Jews can carry out their revenge fantasies on assorted members of the Third Reich.

A true QT film through and through, ""Basterds"" is smothered in the director's many trademarks, and calling cards are left at each of its lengthy and dynamically suspenseful scenes. From '60s-style title cards to narrative digressions to scenes set entirely around a table, fans of the filmmaker who revolutionized the writing and directing of film in the '90s will find his seventh feature film to completely satisfy their itch.

But does Tarantino's recklessly violent style have a place in telling a story that circumvents one of history's darkest chapters? That's a matter of personal taste. There's no doubting the filmmaker is in top form -- humorous and attention-grabbing, crafting some great characters and even better scenes -- but it's a style that's seen better applications than WWII.

Broken into chapters, ""Basterds"" introduces us to a couple main story lines that lead to an ultimate objective of revenge. If not for its pulp groundings, the film could be called ""Everbody Wants to Kill Hitler,"" for all intents and purposes. First there's Shoshanna, a young Jewish girl hiding in France who manages to escape when the farmer hiding her family confesses to the S.S. The scene is one of Tarantino's best, especially thanks to Christoph Waltz as the charming and delightfully intimidating Nazi Col. Hans Landa (aka ""the Jew hunter""), whose beguiling manner clashing with the serious undertones of the plot makes his performance worthy of nothing less than an Oscar nomination.

Then there are the Basterds, Jewish American soldiers under the command of Lt. Aldo Raine, a one-dimensional albeit hysterical character played just so by Brad Pitt. Raine is up for nothing but killing Nazis and making good sport of it, as is Eli Roth's character Sgt. Donowitz aka ""The Bear Jew,"" whose weapon of choice is a baseball bat. But no matter how outrageous it all sounds, there's nothing secretly fulfilling about Jews killing Nazis and that's part of the film's problem.

These stories come together in 1944, when Shoshanna is now running a movie theater (another predictable QT move) where the Nazi party hopes to show off its latest propaganda film, ""Nation's Pride,"" inviting the biggest names in the Nazi regime including the Fuhrer himself. This happening attracts the Basterds and even sparks vengeful thoughts for Shoshanna.

Of course preparing for such a plot brings need for deception, perfect fodder for these long intense scenes with inevitably violent conclusions along with of course the prowess of Waltz as Landa. Though for every brilliant set up, Tarantino brings it to climax with meaningless pulp. These violent battles and merciless killings send off vibrations that simply deaden upon hitting the air, not resonating through the rest of or after the film ends. That kind of bloody and clever outcome works great in films like ""Kill Bill"" or ""Pulp Fiction,"" where there's no realism to the circumstances of the violence, but it comes off as immature in the context of WWII and the Holocaust.

Perhaps I should have expected no less from the master of climactic deaths, but there's an unignorable side to ""Basterds"" and that's the emotional depth of the Holocaust and the terrible war surrounding it. When this sense of humor is effective, many people may feel guilty being entertained comically by ""Basterds,"" and at other times they might find it feels stupid and pointless. Then again, many might push the historical context aside and delight in all of the style and excellent craftsmanship.

So despite Tarantino's brilliance, all of which manifests itself through different scenes and character in ""Basterds,"" nothing accounts for the rift between how many viewers think about WWII as they watch a film about it (fictional or not) and how viewers watch a Tarantino film, a genre in itself that carries its own set of expectations. It can almost be best described in this way: Either wild west Ennio Morricone music set to Jews killing Germans in WWII works for you or the clash is a bit too unnatural. Either way, you respect the talents of the filmmaker. ~Steven C

21 August 2010,Fanboy directors fantasies---,"O.M.G. is it wrong to be BORED by this film? What has happened to my cute Brad baby? Can ya tell? I hated this movie. The two women were the only redeeming factors for me. Tarantino is a juvenile fan-boy of violence and shows it lovingly on the screen, in close up and long takes. But his fan base loves it all too, so he will keep getting funds to make these piles of dung. The opening sequence at the farm house is suspenseful and starts things off well. We dread what we know will happen to the Jews hiding under the floor boards. But by the time the young woman is running across the field, and it just ends with the officer yelling at her, things have already started to go wrong. At least to me. So much of the rest is just disjointed and makes you want to scream - get on with it! - too many long meaningful looks, too many in jokes that I for one didn't get. 4/10 only for his good actors doing their best.

23 April 2015,"offensive, propaganda and rewriting history","I really found this film so bad, the main reason I found it very offensive is that it has a theme of sadistic punishment being carried out against German soldiers by the American Jewish ""heroes"", and this is supposed to be ""justice"". Smashing captured German soldiers heads off with a baseball bat, carving swastikas into their foreheads. In Germany everyone age 16-60 had to join the army and most were just decent ordinary people and they in no way deserved to be tortured. Yet this film wants its audience to get satisfaction from seeing German people, any German, being tortured, by a jew.

Mentions of Jewish persecution are also overdone and constant references to the holocaust and stigma over ""anti-semitism"" is even used as a political tool for Zionist war crimes in Israel today. Did the film show any disabled, homosexuals, gypsies etc being persecuted? Is the film a sob story about the 20 million Russians killed during the war? Of course not it focused 100% on jews and they are the one and only we must feel sorry for, once again as all you can expect from American films.

This has been called a ""Jewish revenge movie"". The holocaust has been propagandised and used to justify crimes which Jewish supremacists commit today. When you consider the fanatical actions of Zionists against people who are against their racist ideologies (which even includes assassinating holocaust survivors who speak out against Zionist ideology), when you consider the Zionist war crimes against the Palestinian people and then even netanyahu trying to justify this by blaming Palestinians for the holocaust, it is terrible that a violent Jewish revenge/torture and propaganda movie has been made to cater to this bloodlust which does exist in zionists/Jewish extremists today (just watch israelis who watch the bombing of Gaza whilst cheering).

So rather than this (""yeah jews torture and murder those Germans yeah thats what they deserve!"") how about a movie like Schindlers list but instead set in occupied Palestine and showing the suffering of the people there today?! Because that's what I'd like to see. Not a film which once again tells everyone to feel sorry for Jewish people and that violence and torture committed by Jewish people is OK. In todays climate that is the last thing I think should exist.",1

15 June 2021,Pains me to see reviews with 1 and 2 ratings.,"Tarantino is wild. He's one of the most imaginatively creative directors of our times. He is that one director who turns wild fantasies, I'm sure the one that every right thinking individual has into a fantastic screenplay. That scene was the most satisfying scene is cinema history.

This was Christoph Waltz' first film with Tarantino and also his first Hollywood film I'm guessing. If only we got to see more of this fine gentleman's acting skills. We also get to see him in Django, he's insanely good in this film. He creates an aura of tension whenever he comes in screen. The guy speaks a host of different languages too and that Italian speaking scene is Comedy Gold. The opening scene is one of the most tense and riveting scenes in movie history. A sheer study in how to build tension, credit for which obviously goes to Mr. Tarantino who wrote it and directed it geniusly.

I've watched this film so many times as it has such memorable and iconic scenes and is very satisfying.

Thank God for Tarantino.

12 January 2013,Is it possible to make a movie worse than this?,"This fantasy war movie looks like a group of people got together and did the Zero Mostel-Gene Wilder-Dick Shawn approach, hoping to make the worst possible movie, not taking into account the dorks that latch onto the worst possible movie.

It defies description with how predictable and full of clichés it is. Worse yet, it defies description as to how contrived it is, looking like ""we're so mad we aren't going to take it any more"", in a world where this very concept is the very thing sane people are sick of.

It's full of hatred. It's violence Hollywood style, meant to make people think that some men are gods, so it goes over well with the losers and bubble boys who live in cubicles, hoping that some men are gods who can kill thousands of people just by talking tough.

It's pathetic, really. It honestly looks like a two year wrote this, and a three year old directed it.",2
19 September 2009,Would that be supposed to be an attempt to wake the sleepers in Metropolis?,"Little Quentin seems to have mastered the art of having the cake and eating it.

As usual, the pure sadistic display can be explained as a clever thought-provoking way of sending violence back into the audience's face.

Sure, Mr Tarantino. Violence is Baaad. Sadism is Baaad. It is well worth wading in it to make that point. How very brilliant.

The juvenile part of the audience may well not be clever enough to follow all the smart references to higher levels of consciousness though, but I'm confident they'll see the light one day.

Thanks for making this little world of ours a little better. You deserve a medal.",1
23 February 2010,Brad Pitt wins the war,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz!

Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo!

11 September 2010,"violent, silly, stupid","I think it takes a great talent to make the viciousness of the Nazis to seem like the good guys in a movie. Yet Quentin Tarantino manages to do it.

How can the worst and most stupid character in a movie be played by Brad Pitt, engaging in his idiocy, and the best played by an erudite educated Nazi who is far more interesting than all the grotesque anti-Nazis? That certainly takes some talent. When you are rooting for the Nazis -- the movie may have a problem. And this movie has a problem. As funny as it is, and there are some other sort of references they make that are sort of funny, but it's sort of stupid when it just comes down to it. I wish there were a better adjective to use, but stupid is all that really comes to mind.

24 August 2009,Applauding to violence,"I usually avoid movies with violence. I went to see this film because I speak French and German and I was curious about the angle of the Jews getting revenge.

What a disappointment! If revenge is being as cruel as the Nazis, what is the point. Half of the movie I could not watch because of all the blood and violence. Human beings should come up with better solutions. After all we should by now be a little bit more sophisticated than the primitive men who clubbed each other over the head. But obviously not. There was constant laughter and applause for the violent scenes in this movie. I am ashamed for my fellow human beings.

I gave the movie three points because of the fact that the dialogue was in the original languages and some of the acting was good. I regret having spent the money on that film.

9 December 2010,Well made with a brilliant Christoph Waltz but uneven and disjointed,"Now I like Quentin Tarantino's movies on the whole, Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs being my favourites of his. But Inglorious Basterds, as much as I wanted to like it, is not among Tarantino's best.

Granted it is very well made, with the cinematography and scenery amazing. Also the music is superb and Christolph Waltz is brilliant as the SS colonel being both charming and deliciously evil. Despite these high points, in my point of view it is just too uneven. Story-wise, it is essentially a series of vignettes and of variable quality too. There are some highlights such as the opening and the resistance-bar rendezvous, but there are some dull and bloated parts too unfortunately. The script has its fair share of wit but it is also some very stilted and ropey dialogue too. The characters come across as rather caricatured and clichéd, and the other acting is so-so at best. I actually think Brad Pitt gives one of his weaker performances here I'm afraid to say. And I also don't think Tarantino's direction is innovative or authentic enough, while I didn't thinmk much of the ending.

Overall it has its moments but these moments weren't enough as a whole. The result is a disjointed and altogether disappointing and somewhat self-indulgent effort. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5
18 November 2009,"I didn't like it and if you can overcome the hype, you might not, either.","Unnecessary gratuitous violence, twisting real history in some sort of alternate timeline of events, the use of music which does not marry well with the images on screen (...sounds more like Quentin's temp track of all his old favourite bits of music...)and the levity with which a very real tragic part of human history has been dealt with.

The acting was okay. The cinematography was reasonable. The direction was nothing out of the ordinary and the editing...ho hum.

And this Tarrantino guy is meant to be a new Hollywood genius??? Well...give me John Ford, William Wyler, Robert Wise...etc...etc... any day! Hollywood...down the tubes you go!

21 October 2010,Absolute dogshit!,"I love what Tarantino did in the 90s. I'm as big a fan of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. However, I didn't really know what to expect with this one. After half an hour, I knew this would be a huge disappointment, and after an hour, I kept feeling the temptation to simply stop watching the film then and there.

Quention Tarantino has completely lost the magic that gave the breakfast scene in Reservoir Dogs its magic. It seemed incomprehensible at that time to see a bunch of gangsters around a breakfast table discussion Madonna, 70s music and whether to tip or not, but Tarantino pulled it off with brilliant dialogue and brilliant actors.

This magic has been fading away for his past three films and is completely gone now. Tarantino can no longer create such scenes, and this film just reeks of his futile attempts to do just that. Again and again! The scenes are DREADFULLY long and the dialogue is downright boring.

The acting is fabulous and the cinematography is still very good. The actors speak absolutely fluent French and German, and I love that all the people in the film speak their own language and not English. That's what I give the 3 stars for. The rest of the film gets a solid 0.

Mr. Tarantino, you're over the hill and your last three films have sucked increasingly. I have no doubt your die hard fans will still be there for you, but I won't be giving any more of your films a chance.

A complete turd of a film.",3
23 August 2021,Very good!,"I liked it a lot to tell the truth. Again Tarantino giving us good characters like Aldo, Emmanuelle and obviously Hans Landa, the music is very well placed and I liked how the stories that are presented in chapters are connected very well to reach the final climax. The whole scene that happens near the end is one of the best I've ever seen in a film.

1 September 2009,Carry On Killing,"This film really should be called INDULGENT BASTARD. Sinking dread is a great suspense device in any film, that uneasy feeling of nervousness you get when the characters in whom you have invested some time and emotion get slightly trapped. However, in the tedious sequences in this indulgent serial killing schlock the suspense quickly evaporates and you get to just sit there until someone gets killed. And then, in this 150 minute film, Quentin kills them right before your eyes. You must pay attention because all the hypnotized media wannabees insist you wanna be 'cool' too, but for anyone watching with film with their own genuine heart, brain, and actual courage, well QT the emperor of cruelty has no clothes (again). Once, in older films when someone died it was a tragedy for the character and emotion evoked from the attentive audience. Like when Sonny was killed in The Godfather. Now-days thanks to QT, someone getting killed as cruelly and graphically as his blood-lust allows, it is actually akin what was, in a better film, the punchline of a joke or a song sequence in a musical. Now that he has teamed up with Jewish cinema hatemeister Eli Roth and decided to reboot THE WAR (something each is too young (in every way) to have experienced, they have simply created a Nazi pantomime that is an excuse to dress some out of work actors up as the Third Reich and then graphically kill and disgustingly scalp them right before your appalled eyes. And of course, the gorgeous women in this film get defiled humiliated and mercilessly killed in the most graphic close up QT's fevered misogynist hatred allows. So what's new about this episode of hatred? Well, it is well produced hatred, well photographed hatred and well decorated and designed hatred. Then in apocalyptic episode of bullet spraying hatred, it all burns up and disappears up the rectum of the history of over praised gimmick cinema. I do not care to see Eli Roth ever again, in film or in person, and I seriously wish the entire planet's inhabitants soon realize what a destructive influence he is on young minds. QT's desire to show human beings mercilessly mutilate each other is both unproductive in cinema and a one trick career that might just as easily burn out like the final few scenes in the climax of this pop comic drivel. There are laws against hate crimes and QT needs to have his career as chief hate dude consigned to the cutting room floor. The fact that people get killed in telling stories is one thing, but QT's films aren't just that, nor are they devices to tell a story, they are the whole story: the film exists to graphically show you as much hatred in the most gleeful way possible. And for that I condemn this rotten tedious stupid film.",2

30 September 2009,Worst American war movie ever made,"The Americans, as usual, are the Good Guys and the Germans the Bad Guys. But in this movie the yanks win by being more treacherous and brutal than their adversaries. They are supposedly of Jewish origin, which makes them Good Guys, but that's a flimsy excuse for sadistic violence. And the setting and plot has only a remote resemblance to whatever could have happened in France in 1944. You can of course make a fantasy movie about Merlin or about Caribbean pirates just for entertainment and nobody cares about historical accuracy. WWII is now just background scenery for those who enjoy senseless violence. I found the movie disgusting and, ever worse, boring.

8 October 2010,you gotta be kidding me,"this is the worst WWII movie I've seen and I have seen most of them. the cinema errors are too many to even list, nomenclature to time line. but of course this does not take place in our universe but a parallel one inhabited by Tarantino and company. not too mention this picture is a bad and ineffective shock movie/comedy. to top it all off Block Buster Video put this in the action section... this movie was so boring I nearly fell asleep more time than I care to count. I recommend whatever drug and lifestyle habits the cast partook of they give up and do about 5 years of rehab. if you want a decent WWII drama with Nazi slaying watch one of the numerous ones made by sane people. I gave this movie a 4 because Til was actually OK as a raving psycho, and Brad was hilarious trying to be southern, tough and military.

11 March 2017,pure Tarantino,"like each Tarantino film, it is first a show. a spectacular one, exploring many influences, the joy of violence and chaos and history as perfect pretext for a total, colorful, impressive and dramatic , unique and spectacular work. nothing new, at first sigh. but ""Inglorious Basterds"" has the virtue to remains a war film. one of the best. because it propose a different perspective about an events who seems be familiar. its roots, its tragedy in the clothes of a kind of Robin Hood and his fellows, the revenge and the drama of Shoah in a form who transforms old memories in a new, fascinating picture. sure, the acting is more than great. but the most important detail is the final impression. because, in strange way, it is a real useful history lesson.

9 October 2009,This film does not entertain.,"I simply ask one question, if this film were directed by anyone other than Quentin Tarantino, would it have even been released? The answer, I fear, is a resounding 'No"". It fails at almost every level between the opening scene and the final action scene. In between we have pointless scenes of gratuitous violence and long periods of tedium. I love Pulp Fiction, Snatch, The Long Good Friday, Kill Bills, Lock Stock, Layer Cake and many other 'violent' films. In each case there are excellent story lines woven with genuine humour. In this film the humour is completely lacking, apart from a few, nudge-nudge, wink-wink ""this is an in-joke and it really is VERY clever, trust me, I'm a great writer and film director."" I hope this proves to be a one-off failure for Mr. Tarantino.

20 September 2021,Glorious Basterds.,"Inglorious Basterds is Pulp Fiction's closest contender no doubt. I rate this movie extremely high because i think Inglorious Basterds is up there with one of the most entertaining movies ever made.

The role as Aldo Raine fits Brad Pitt perfectly and i think it's his best role ever and there's no doubt Christopher Waltz as Hans Landa is his best role ever.

Anyway Inglorious Basterds is intense, intimidating and like i said extremely entertaining, also absolutely hilarious.

Quentin Tarantino created some memorable scenes with his ingenious screenwriting (Again) and combined with the acting skills of Christoph Waltz, Brad Pitt etc. Tarantino creates some brilliant scenes for example the opening scene and the strüdel scene is two of the best in Inglorious Basterds.

Inglorious Basterds is a perfect movie and it's one of the most entertaining movies ever made.

5 February 2010,Hollywood's darkest hour this year.,"Buckle down tight if you decided to take a chance on Tarintion's new film.

Absolute garbage, absolute garbage absolutely.

I get the whole dark comedy attempt. I get that some people think Tarintino is an artistic genius. I don't get this movie.

I tried 3 times to make it through this movie, and when I finished, I wondered how much valuable time that I just lost.

The plot is mediocre, the dialogue is completely overdone - and the acting is all over the place.

Brad Pitt's accent was as distracting and annoying as his relationship with Angelina. The sex scene in the middle of the film is a perfect gauge of how demented, perverted, and gross Tarintino is.

I enjoyed ""Pulp Fiction"", I even thought ""Jackie Brown"" was mildly entertaining - but just to create a pathetic movie, slap your so-called artistic genius on it, with an ""A"" list actor, does not make a movie Oscar worthy.

This movie is like Mexican food. It may look good at first glance - but two hours later your sorry you ate it.",1
30 August 2009,The Glorious return of true cinematic excitement!,"Perhaps it's partly because I've always been a hugely over-enthusiast and biased Quentin Tarantino fan-boy (I even thought ""Death Proof"" was brilliant), but I can't fathom how anyone could possibly dislike ""Inglorious Bastards"". Tarantino's film is a genuine ode to cinema, and not at all a pretentious and personal hobby-project like some people claim, with a marvelously absurd plot & structure and a deeply fascinating cast of characters. ""Inglorious Bastards"" is the type of motion picture that causes spontaneous adrenalin-rushes inside your body and automatically makes your blood pump faster with its brilliant sequences that are alternatively suspenseful, comical and unbelievably violent. From the teaser trailers and previews we've been seeing months from beforehand, it looked as if this would become a simplistic and insignificant (but nevertheless entertaining) WWII-action flick, but the eventual finished product is a massively surprising epic with style and content that very well could be the most genius movie of the year. Right from the opening chapter, ingeniously titled ""Once upon a time in Nazi- occupied France"", it's crystal clear that Tarantino's amazing talent for writing dialogs hasn't vanished yet (in spite of what QT-haters claim) and that he even improved his skills regarding the building up of tension and atmosphere. Together with his talented eye for acting talent and exact casting (the relatively unknown Austrian actor Christoph Waltz depicts the ultimate Nazi villain in the history of War movies); the intro grows out to an intense and mesmerizing 15 minutes long verbal cat-and-mouse game ending in sheer terror. The next chapters are definitely more light-headed and marvelously over-the-top with the introduction of the titular bastards, the film-within-film plot about a German private who single-handedly slaughtered half an army and Joseph Goebbels turning his adventures into a propaganda movie, the hilarious preparations for a well-planned assassination attack and the return of an orphaned Jewish girl with her mind set on vengeance. The bastards are unquestionably the main attraction of the movie. They're a battalion composed of Jewish soldiers and one lunatic German deserter. Under the command of the pleasantly deranged Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt in an amusing role), they prowl around the occupied French countryside and sadistically kill & scalp Nazi officers wherever they can. This concept is vintage Tarantino, with borrowed ideas from great War movie classics, psychopathic character drawings (for example the Bear Jew with his baseball bat), hilariously witty dialogs and anecdotes and extreme uncompromising violence.

""Inglorious Bastards"" is a non-stop series of brilliant sequences and unforgettable little trivia details. I could easily list fantastic moments throughout five whole pages, like the use of David Bowie's song ""Cat People"" and the Strudel scene inside a French restaurant, but the principal message is to just go and watch this film! Only Tarantino could take a serious topic and setting like WWII and turn it into a darkly comical fantasy with absurd twists and a downright demented climax in which practically the entire Third Reich becomes exterminated in one massive shootout. Like always, Tarantino playfully messes around with the fixed values of cinema. Usually WWII movies stick close to the facts and alter the characters' names, but here the names of all Nazi commanders are maintained but the events are completely fictional. Still, and I truly hope that all the negative minded Tarantino critics will finally realize this as well, our director respects and pays attention to little important details like languages and cultural differences. The Germans speak German, the French speak French and the Americans mock the Europeans regarding all the typical clichés. Everything about ""Inglorious Bastards"" is brilliant and this will undoubtedly become another Tarantino movie that I plan to watch and re- watch numerous of times.",10

7 October 2009,Nazis for Dummies,"Without question, this movie is the worst movie in the top 100, and how it got there I will never know.

It is long. It has unbearably long sequences of the most awkward dialog you have ever seen. And clearly it's written for the ""Low IQ"" crowd. It had ""Pop up"" windows telling dimwits in the audience when a famous nazi would come on-screen. They even had one scene where they couldn't find any other way to show the guys with dynamite strapped to their legs, so they resorted to panning down, and doing a CGI ""cutaway"" of the pants. It was about as subtle and complex as Peewee's playhouse.

And yes, in classic Tarantino fashion, the Nazis at the end were SIMULTANEOUSLY a) blown up and b) blasted with machine guns and c) burned alive.

All those of you who voted this movie up into the high 8s should be ashamed. Tarantino jumped the shark well before Kill Bill, and this just cements him into the downward spiral he's been in. Hopefully he crashes soon, it's sad to see the creator of masterpieces like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs making tripe like this.

I'm giving this bomb 2 / 10. The concept of the team of Glorious Basterds was intriguing, and showed promise early on. Too bad we saw so little of them along the way....",1
17 November 2009,It's inglorious alright,"In Nazi occupied France, young Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus witnesses the slaughter of her family by Colonel Hans Landa. Narrowly escaping with her life, she plots her revenge several years later when German war hero Fredrick Zoller takes a rapid interest in her and arranges an illustrious movie premiere at the theater she now runs. With the promise of every major Nazi officer in attendance, the event catches the attention of the ""Basterds"", a group of Jewish-American guerilla soldiers led by the ruthless Lt. Aldo Raine. As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history...

Let me start by saying that despite my love for cinema and the number of films I watch per week, I never payed much attention to Quentin Tarantino's work. I did saw Kill Bill some time ago but I really didn't like it. Having said that, I'm well aware of Tarantino's style and formula and here he presented us with more from the same.The question that ensues is, are you a fan of Tarantino? For someone that enjoyed his previous work this film will probably be a delight; for me, I wouldn't say it was a disappointment, because knowing the kind of films Tarantino does, I was already expecting something among the lines of what I saw but I guess I still had a little bit of hope this film would be different.As I see it, Inglourious Basterds is painfully long and for the most part it feels inert with never ending dialog that isn't really necessary.The acting was completely over the top, specially Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz. Despite being known as the pretty boy in Hollywood I consider Brad Pitt to be one of the finest actors out there and he has starred in some of my favorite movies but his acting here is just all over the place.Then again, this is a Tarantino movie, so this is expected. The beautiful Diane Kruger who I usually enjoy watching didn't stood up for me either,I don't know if it was the fact that she spoke German most of the time and I'm used to see her speaking English or if I was just fed up with the movie by then but something was a little off with her.Anyway, as I mentioned before, in the end, it all comes down to a matter of taste,fans of Tarantino will most likely be pleased and non-fans will probably dislike the film. For me, 20 minutes of witty dialog and explicit( and somewhat funny) violence isn't worthy of watching 130 minutes of boring and pointless narrative.

7 May 2011,Inglouriously overrated,"Biggest problem Tarantino is facing before making any movie, is that he made his best two movies at the beginning of his carrier as director. Those are Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.

Almost every movie he made after that are good, but no where near as two mentioned above.

But this movie is simply ridiculous. Even Kill Bill makes more sense than this alternate look on history. Such a high rating on IMDb is not deserved at all. So many things in this movie treat audience as dumb ass. Apart the first scene with Mr. Waltz everything else is just plain crap. If you wanted to present alternate look on history that is all fine but do it without so many inconsistencies (like only two guards in front of a theater)

5 October 2009,not so good,"I had huge expectations for this film. Read plenty of great reviews and was preparing for a brilliant cinematic feast. Unfortunately, it was not to be. For a film that takes itself apparently ""tongue in cheek"" not enough humor, not enough action, not enough character development. Not enough violence even, it came sparsely every 20 minutes or so. Not enough fun, in general. Must say that the entire cinema was disappointed, people left in silence, without any enthusiasm or clapping. Too much talking, which is not a brilliant as they say, simply talking. Some developments are ridiculously stupid, too much even for such a far-fetched premise: the risky, aggressive behaviour of the English spy in the bar, the fact that a common soldier in a bar speaks fluent English, the fact they manage to lock down the entire theater - with the cream of Nazi German machine in it - without anyone outside noticing it, or a shrewd Nazi officer negotiating the terms of his surrender with English command... on the phone! If Germans were so stupid the war would have been over after 6 months, not 6 years. At least if the film were more funny, witty, but it weren't. Even the use of music was irritating (but for the Bowie's song). Sorry, but a disappointment for me.",6

These are the words that kept coming to mind during the three hours of monotony that my friends recommended to me as ""amazing."" Either they were lying to me, they saw a different ""Inglourious Basterds"", or I'm the only one who can see that the emperor is naked.

I enjoyed the three previous Quentin Tarantino films I've seen, ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Reservoir Dogs"", and ""Death Proof."" Not much happens, but there's a certain theatricality to the way Tarantino's often-nonlinear stories unfold.

""Basterds"" has all of the Tarantino trademarks: long stretches of mundane, but amusing, dialogue, larger than life characters, and occasional splatters of gore. But in his previous films, Tarantino was able to pull all this off with more panache. Every heavily-subtitled (most of the dialogue is either in German or French) scene drags its feet for what seems like forever, and only sometimes does the dialogue even approach being interesting. The plot, little there is, is divided into episodic chapters like a 1940's ""Pulp Fiction."" But this time, Tarantino exchanges depth for period detail, as if the historical significance of WWII will make up for all of the movie's shortcomings. The Basterds of the title, a team of Jewish American soldiers infiltrating German-occupied France to take brutal revenge on Nazi soldiers, actually get only a small percentage of the screen time. Most of the chapters focus on the film's German and French characters.

While Tarantino's previous efforts were made up of characters that started out resembling pulp creations and then grew in terms of complexity, all of the characters in ""Basterds"", both heroes and villains, are as flat as cardboard from beginning to end. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if the film was an action movie like the trailers seemed to suggest. But ""Basterds"" is completely dialogue and character driven. 90% of the movie is people having conversation while sitting at tables.

While ""Pulp Fiction"" featured an all-star cast led by Samuel L. Jackson (who lends his voice to ""Basterds"" as a narrator for a couple brief moments) and Bruce Willis, ""Basterds"" eschews stars for lesser known international character actors. Not to say any of them are bad actors. Christoph Waltz, Daniel Bruhl, and the haunting, enchanting Melanie Laurent are actually quite good. But none of them are able to entertain for any reasonable amount of time with the flat characters and even flatter dialogue they are given to work with. Diane Kruger (""National Treasure"") is pushed to the background for most of her scenes. Brad Pitt, effortlessly evoking a lazy Tennessee accent, is entertaining every minute he's on screen, but those minutes are actually few and far between. The most entertaining performance actually comes from Mike Myers, in one scene in the middle of ""Basterds"", as a British General.

In the end, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is more boring than any film about a plot to assassinate Hitler has a right to be and offers little to the cinema other than a title that rolls off the tongue nicely.",1
23 August 2009,Beyond awful,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz!

14 September 2009,An absolutely terrible movie,"I went to see this one because a Tarantino film is usually a good bang for a couple of bucks-what I saw was a film that tried very hard to be serious film and failed badly, in fact it was like watching old footage of a B-17 get hit by flack and roll upside down as a prelude to flying vertically into the ground at three times its top speed, on fire. The inclusion of Mike Myers as an actor doing a serious role was truly laughable in and of itself. The fact that some US soldier liked to carve swastikas into German soldiers heads is something that I have never heard before and I have heard all kinds of WW2 stories. Well, big deal on that anyway, I could imagine lots of worse things to do to German soldiers in WW2 than giving them improvised tattoos and hitting them with baseball bats. The portrayal of Adolf Hitler as funny man and also the portrayal of Joseph Goebels as funny man treads a fine line dipping into the and of ass jokes with remarkable ease, showing a bit of true bad taste on the part of the film maker. Whats next-pratfall jokes with Joseph Stalin?, who by the way, killed 27 million people, out doing Hitler's period of distemper by quite a few more million dead persons. Boo hiss on this flap doodle. Only good bit is when two guys gets their testes shot off in a bar scene-and not a vampire in sight.I honestly think this film does not contribute to the body of work that deals with WW2. Maybe in kind of a cheapish way it does, but I wouldn't want a WW2 vet to see it.",
5 May 2010,"Misfiring, self indulgent latest addition to the Tarantino staple","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

During the second world war, in Nazi occupied France, a young girl witnesses the execution of her family at the hands of Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), barely escaping herself. Years later, that young girl has grown into Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent) a cinema owner who has big plans for revenge at a big premiere that the German army will be attending. Meanwhile, similar plans for retribution are in mind for a group of Jewish-American soldiers calling themselves 'The Basterds', lead by tough nut hill billy Aldo Reine (Brad Pitt) who plan to leave their mark on the monsters by killing them- and taking their scalps as trophies.

Despite being one of the most recognised and influential writer/directors of our time, Quentin Tarantino is one of the most selective men in the business, dishing out new material once every blue moon. His latest work, a loose remake of an old war film with the same name, revolves around one of the biggest themes that his films are known for- revenge. Violent, bloody revenge, to be more precise. It's lacking the fun, vibrant edge of the Kill Bill films and for all it's brutality, does display a more mature, rounded edge than most of his work. This is a blessing and a curse, though, because Inglorious Basterds is simply no fun at all. In fact, it's deadly boring. The kiss arse film magazines and aficianardos have fallen over themselves with praise as usual, trying to make everyone feel it's another absolute work of genius and that Tarantino can do no wrong, but to a wider demographic of the audience, the film will just come over as pretentious and wholly self indulgent, thinking it's so clever but really just too big for it's boots. Most of the dialogue is over the top and completely unbelievable and the film pretentiously plays in different 'chapters', like it's some deep, meaningful piece of art and not just the usual Tarantino blood fest. Performances wise, Pitt carries the lead role well, not leaving a huge mark or creating a truly memorable character, but doing the best he can and to be fair, the supporting cast, including Laurent, Waltz, Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender and Diane Kruger, are all on top form too but the material weighs them down.

Those not screaming about the genius writing and directing will, as usual, be complaining about the violence, but despite some nasty scenes, it's hard to see it as a film that in any way really glorifies violence or stylises it, as some of Tarantino's past films arguably have. All the same, though, it's a slow, uppity mess of a film that is so far up itself it loses touch with what made it's directors films so great in the first place. **",4
17 August 2009,Another let down from the once great QT.,"So Quentin brings his unique directorial style to a film set in World War II and in doing so presents us with 'Allo 'Allo on crack, which I hasten to add is not a good thing. Once again told in chapters he impishly teases the audience by playing with the narrative, using quirky music and on screen graphics. Add in a couple of mates, a few stars and thank god one amazing performance and ladies and gentleman I give the 7th film by QT 'Inglourious Basterds'. Fortunately I wasn't expecting much from this film after his last three lacklustre attempts and so wasn't too disappointed when I finally saw it. The film they say is a 'return to form' for the director, who hasn't delivered since the underrated 'Jackie Brown' (in my opinion), but don't for one minute expect a return to past glories because this film has no idea what it's supposed to be. Part comedy, part drama, a distinct lack of action and overacting (in a film where he has spent so much time on getting Germans to speak French and vice versa with such attention to detail does he then get Mike Myers to play a caricatured British General?) cloud the plot which expects us to believe all sorts of preposterous aspects just because 'we are in the world of Tarantino'. It's crass, brash and at least an hour too long, but here's the crux everyone's cop out excuse is 'well that's what Tarantino does' to which my reply would be 'you are right of course but that's what he's being doing for 17 years, its wearing a little thin to see someone with obvious talent just treading water'. How many more slow motion walks with a funky bit of music do we need? How many more Samuel L Jackson voice overs? QT is like a child he just can't seem to grow up. There are however highlights (which is why I earlier referred to his obvious talent) Christopher Waltz as Col. Hans 'Jew Hunter' Landa stole the whole film for me and is one of the more comedic elements, there are still little touches of greatness in the camera work and audacious ideas, but for me its not enough. Brad 'Popeye' Pitt's performance is perhaps one of his worst and the dialogue at times goes on and on and without the ability to litter it with pop culture references just comes across as boring, there is even a scene he has stolen from one of his own earlier films. So ten years in gestation this vanity project feels like another up yours to Hollywood, on the one hand a geek trying to prove his knowledge by scattering references to early French and German cinema among the plot (the last few chapters centre around an art house cinema) and on the other a once infant terrible throwing his toys out of the pram because his last few films weren't as critically acclaimed, which is all well and good if you can back it up with the product. In the film Pitt's character cuts a swastika into the forehead of each Nazi he lets live, a permanent reminder of their crimes, on carving his last one he declares 'that may just be my masterpiece'. In fact it's just another swastika on another forehead and sadly this is just another Quentin Tarantino film in your local cinema.",4
23 September 2009,Once upon a time in Tarantino's envisioned Nazi occupied France...,"Inglorious Basterds, the latest film written/directed by Quentin Tarantino, the surrealistic phantasmagoria set during the World War II was a big disappointment for me. I found it irritating, boring, and full of Tarantino who did not make a movie about WWII but about his love for movies, this time for spaghetti westerns and his interest in the German movies of the Third Reich period. All his movies are about himself and often it works. I absolutely love Pulp Fiction and believe it is his glorious achievement. I like a lot Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown and both volumes of Kill Bill. I said more than once that Tarantino does not make profound statements or ask eternal questions, but what he does do is entertain, and he does it marvelously - with style, class, irony, wit, and talent. Deathproof was the first alarming signal that more than anything Tarantino loves to talk and talk he does to the point that the viewer gets bored and frustrated even while watching supposedly fast and violent movie. It only got worse in Inglorious Basterds. Something is terribly missing in QT's vision of the important and tragic period of European and World history. Oh, his movie looks splendid, art direction is the best ever in any QT's films. The soundtrack is killer as always, and I'll make sure to have it. The first Chapter of the film is perfection. Pure and simple, the masterwork of setting, writing and acting. If anything, the opening introduces Christoph Waltz and Denis Menochet in the star making performances. But you know what? I am really surprised that Waltz's work has been proclaimed something of revelation by the critics while Malcolm McDowell who played the same type with relish in The Passage (1979) had been but crucified by the critics. Back to Basterds, it all goes rapidly downhill after the opening scene. It seems to me that Tarantino was under the spell of his own self- importance. He could not force himself to make some or should I say many scenes shorter. Some scenes only exist because Tarantino had to make the participants speak out his witty remarks and be the part of the snappy dialogs, his trade mark, even if and when the scenes did not make any sense and just went on and on. I think that in his last movie, Tarantino lost the sense of rhythm, and the film stuck more than once. I won't say that Inglorious Basterds is a total failure but it is so pointless, self-adoring, and often empty that sadly the brilliance can't always shine through inglorious and pompous stupidity, emptiness, and juvenile arrogance.

I don't think the movie problem was total lack of historical accuracy. It is not the first time, the film makers or the writers take liberty with history to create their own interpretation and vision of the epoch and the events that influenced it. One of my favorite writers since my young days, French Alexander Dumas, famous for the highly successful historical-adventure novels, had said about his works, ""Sometimes I have to lift up the skirts of history to make Her good sons."" The father of The Three Musketeers (1844) and The Count of Monte Cristo could be justly proud of his creations. As the result, Tarantino's violation of history has produced just that - inglorious basterds.

My rating is 5/10 - for art direction, soundtrack, Chapter one, and introduction of Christoph Waltz, Mélanie Laurent, and Denis Menochet. Another point goes for using different languages throughout the film.",5

18 September 2009,Trash,"Some people have outgrown prepubescence and find this a very disturbing sign to were the world is heading with morons making films such as this one and influencing western youth. That's somewhat hopeful.

Even seen from a purely aesthetic standpoint and not a moral one putting Jewish people under hiding in the south of France to the sounds of a spaggeti western and cutting into the fake southern accent of Brad Pit can only be the work of a true cretin.

This tired provocation and disrespect to human suffering is as insidious as it is boring. And that's the most tragic thing of all to me.

Just cause some video store freak once got lucky throwing in a few old clichés doesn't mean we have to perpetually suffer as a global culture to this garbage. And what is worse he's created a whole new generation who savour artifacts that are worse than dirt, and favour and proliferate them.

I am barely holding back from wishing this guy a fate similar to the many splatter scenes he's subjected the world into. That would make some sense, if some idiot chooses to replicate scene after scene after scene of sadistic graphic brutality enabling and recreating it in the world it would make sense that he suffer through it, wouldn't it. But that would be going along his mentality, the twisted, stupid vindictive one. So I would reason that more awareness of this trash is the imperative, so more people can avoid their insidious ways, and will thus be better off. But I don't foresee much hope there. Anyway.

As for the holocaust read Primo Levi, watch Shindler's List, and the lovable Mel Brooks take on it, and try educating yourself on the reality of this unnamable horror that was the persecution of the Jewish people by the German people. And let's bear in mind that this hasn't been of course the sole genocide, but there are other ones in history that are comparable and even more brutal. Some are occurring right now in the genocide of the Kurdish people by the Turkish people, and of the Chinese people on their minorities. Others like the genocide of the Indian people by the American people occurred further down in history. And also becoming aware to the fact that the Jewish state has committed atrocities of immeasurable magnitude to the Palestinian people, atrocities that should never have been committed by a people that suffered so much in their own persecution by others.

And vote this garbage down to send this moron back to shelving videos.",
21 August 2010,worse than the Nazis,"Well, what can one say, and, in any event, who would read this review at this point anyway. Even though the first scene had some perverse interest, after that I skipped thru it to the end, but still couldn't avoid 1.) Brad Pitt doing one of the worst performances of all time; 2) a whole lot of scalping by the US team, filmed with obvious relish and disgusting detail by the psychopathic director; and 3)a total and extremely boring and unfunny rewrite of history. This film could only appeal to serial killers and the ilk who like QT. Whew! The real question is how can people watch and enjoy this rubbish. Since there have been few if any good films produced in the last decade, I guess Americans et al. are starved for entertainment. Still, watching such violence makes me again believe that a good % of viewers are sadists, with the assumption that most of these are young men since I cannot b3eliev that a woman could sit through this tripe.

27 November 2009,Purile rubbish,"I can see I'm in the minority regarding this film but with the exception of Waltz's performance there really is NOTHING to recommend.

This is an awful film by any standards and is a very poor offering from Tarantino. The dialogue is unusually sloppy and the action sparse and badly executed. The camera work and direction appear to be ..... Actually I'm going to stop there.

Im giving this 2 stars - I'd like to give it more because Waltz really was inspiring as the SS officer - I'd even go as far as to say he's almost deserving of an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor if you assume Pitt is the lead.

This is a bad film. One of the few films where I have actually hated myself for enduring it.

I cannot not enjoy any scene of this film, the dialogue, the music, the acting, the villain, oh my god the villain, what an impactful character and villain, I don't think I've seen a more terrifying and at the same time enjoyable villain than than Hans Landa. Every scene with him is pants-shtingly intense, what a beautiful film and what a beautiful acting from Christoph Waltz.

9 March 2019,The actors are top notch and the carnage is just right.,"In Nazi-occupied France during World War II, a plan to assassinate Nazi leaders by a group of Jewish U.S. soldiers coincides with a theatre owner's vengeful plans for the same. Directors: Quentin Tarantino, Eli Roth (uncredited). What a great flick.

Quentin Tarantino returns with the story of the Basterds, a group of Jewish soldiers performing guerilla warfare and terror tactics behind enemy lines to strike fear into the hearts of German soldiers during World War II. Inglourious Basterds is a very difficult film to pigeonhole. It's part Jewish revenge fantasy, part gung ho war film, part knowing parody of patriotic flag wavers and 100% Tarantino. Tarantino has found his new muse in Melanie Laurent. She was fabulous . The performance of Christoph Waltz, playing the Nazi Gestapo figure Col. Hans Landa, is the highlight of the film. His ability to convey courtliness and sympathy and then go to commit the cruelest of horrors is simply superb. Inglourious Basterds is naughty, apocalyptic fun -- Tarantino's version of a war movie, with history rewritten to avenge the guilty in ways that satisfy his pop-art cinema. Like a bat to the head, it's not too subtle, but you can't help but watch.",10
27 November 2009,less than vintage Tarantino,"It is schlock over substance in this WWII re-write from Tarantino. A film destined to be remembered solely for Christoph Waltz's chilling performance, this is a flabby outing from Tarantino that could have been so much better with some discipline in the editing room.

The story hardly matters, being merely the backdrop for the standard fare of bitter banter exploding into violence that we have come to expect from Tarantino. Amusing at first sight, these sequences do not stand up to repeat viewing, as most people's return to Pulp Fiction will testify. In IB, the sequence in the basement pub, where the Gestapo agent is introduced to rack up the tension, extends interminably. The Bear Jew is given a big build up to no real effect - by now, we know how this particular episode is going to end, diluting the visceral effect. Waltz is dazzling, sinister and absurd, and manages to eclipse an inspired performance from Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine. There is a truly laugh-out-loud moment when Raine gives us a display of his linguistic dexterity with regard to Italian. Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus is plodding at best. At only one time did I experience a cinematic moment - when the film projects on to a wall of smoke.

At times this feels like Valkyrie, The Comedy. For Tarantino, success has led to bigger budgets, and a corresponding lack of people prepared to honestly critique the film in the making, which is why the hunger and discipline are clearly absent from this film. The film is neither dull nor memorable, and that just isn't good enough from a filmmaker who has set the bar so high for himself.",5
10 December 2009,No plot - Just mindless violence and gore,"This film has no plot of any real substance it's just a few scenes strung together to bore and then shock the viewer.

In fact this is a theme with Mr QT, who, in my opinion, hasn't made one good movie. The best movie he was involved with was True Romance, an excellent film, which actually had a story. Fortunately QT never directed it; otherwise it would have been a mess.

Pulp Fiction is one of the most overrated films of all time. It was new, shocking, unusual and quirky, but it wasn't actually that good.

The plot for this awful film:

Scene 1

Bore the audience with some drawn out painful conversation.

Kill everyone in an unpleasant way.

Scene 2

Bore the audience with some drawn out painful conversation.

Kill everyone in an unpleasant way.

etc

There is nothing pleasant or redeeming about this film. It leaves a nasty taste in the mouth, mindless over-the-top gore and cruelty, which has now become blasé and acceptable.

A distasteful and pointless film, 1/10.",1
21 September 2009,Another Tarantino Turkey,"Quentin in my opinion has written and directed only really one good movie and that was the multiple award winning Pulp Fiction. However, most of films, especially of recent, have been real REAL turkeys. People still rate him and his stuff today and i really can't see why. There are many other directors and writers nowadays producing far better entertainment in all aspects of their movies. From this point on, i shall not believe the hype that is a Tarantino movie.

Inglorious was too long and worse still you felt it. The humor was, well, minimal and not that humorous. The violence was nothing new (minus the end scene). The dialog was sometimes very VERY drawn out.

For some they'll love this movie; and for others they'll hate it.

24 May 2010,Tarantino redefines what a turkey might be: this is very bad.,"It is slowly becoming apparent to me that Quentin Tarantino is something of a one-trick pony. And it really doesn't matter how many cineastic references you make, if you make them in a film which is simply not very good, such as Inglorious Basterds, it all becomes rather pointless. So much is mediocre to downright bad about this film that is difficult to know where to start. That there are, ironically, several very good performances in it - despite the idiotic film in which these take place - can, perhaps, be chalked up in Tarantino's credit, although I think it is more probably that he or his producer simply struck lucky when he chose his various casting agents. Inglorious Basterds strikes me as nothing more than a bad TV movie script by a not very bright though puerile teenager which somehow gets to be made on a big budget. And that is being kind. We are asked to accept that a film which starts with the brutal massacre of a Jewish family can then blandly go on to expect to be regarded as something of a light comedy. For 'light comedy' is what I assume Tarantino thought he was making. But do graphic scenes of scalping and a man having his brains beaten to mush with a baseball bat really create that many laughs? Tarantino seems to think so. The films then meanders along a rather silly plot line involving a British film critic turned serving soldier, a well-known German movie star who is - larks! - an British agent, Churchill, Hitler, Goebbels, a young Jewish woman who escaped the massacre of her family to arrive in Paris to run a cinema - and on it tediously goes. Lord how Tarantino must have chortled when he wrote the script. How clever Quentin must have thought he was. There is no thought here, no direction, no heart. It is just a mush of ideas, with the odd scene which plays well. But none of those reasonably good scenes adds up to a row of beans when it is all stitched together into a whole. Oddly enough, it is almost far too ridiculous to take this film seriously on any level, almost ridiculous even to discuss it seriously. Tarantino has a certain gift for making a certain kind of film. But take him out of that comfort zone, take him away from his one trick, and the alarming paucity of his imagination becomes all too painfully apparent. And what on earth persuaded Brad Pitt to get involved in a project as tiresome as Inglorious Basterds beats me. If you think Abbot and Costello liberate Auschwitz would have made a great comedy, this is for you. Otherwise find something better to do and save your money.",2
14 July 2010,Torturous and good(?) Tarantino,"""Inglourious Basterds"" is Quentin Tarantino. At his best? Perhaps.

It has in-your-face violence with left-field characters. I expected that, and I got that. I don't like Tarantino because of the extreme violence and the absurdity of situations that his characters get themselves into. I am usually confident with my decisions to avoid his movies. But here, I became increasingly restless, with it being a comedy, starring Brad Pitt, and all of its award nominations, including Best Screenplay? What?

It's one of those films that deserves its accolades, but it still doesn't mean it's good. I certainly didn't like it, but I watched the full two and a half hours. It's like a World War II epic, and told very slowly. But every time I had enough with a scene, Tarantino knew to switch up the narrative, so I kept watching. The story narratives changed often enough to keep me watching but not too often to get confusing. I will admit, that's good writing.

I got frustrated with the characters because I didn't know them well enough, but that is classic Tarantino. Violence, although necessary at times, was used way too heavily - again, that's classic Tarantino. There was just no sign of comedy, maybe a few non-sense lines for humour, but come on, this is World War II. I'm not one for being offended, but I don't find war particularly funny.

""Inglourious Basterds"" is Quentin Tarantino mastering what he is good at. For those that like him, this is a quality film experience, but for others like me, just because you can sit through two and a half hours of torture, doesn't mean it's good.",5
20 May 2019,Brilliant And Fun,"INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is a very unique kind of war film. In hindsight, it's just the sort of thing you'd expect from Quentin Tarantino, but the plot is totally unpredictable. It's just a great ride.

It somehow manages to be hilarious funny and incredibly tense both at the same time. It never lets up. The acting is absolutely wonderful. And the ending is one of the best I've seen. Highly recommend.

21 August 2009,Inglorious is Right,"It would be unfair to say this movie didn't have its moments, but overall I found Inglorious Basterds to be sub-par. The first half of the movie was fun, clever dialog, interesting story, great characters. The second half of the movie just fell apart.

Overall, it is clear that Tarantino is a fan of movies, since this film is an homage to a number of them. Once upon a time in the West features prominently. There are also a number of Wilhelm screams. The problem is: splicing together a bunch of good/great movies doesn't make a good movie in return.

Overall the acting of the main players was quite enjoyable. Brad Pitt, Diane Kruger, Daniel Bruhl, and Christoph Waltz deserve mention. Although towards the end when the film overall went to pieces the over the top acting got a bit ridiculous.

For someone trying to decide whether to see this movie, I would offer the following. The movie is two and a half hours, so be prepared for that. There are a number of rather gruesome scenes (maybe not quite Reservoir dogs intense, but the right ballpark). It is definitely a Quentin Tarantino movie.",5
27 November 2009,Funny?,"Firstly, my comments and my marking in no way reflect my opinion of the ability of the actors. It's the substance I take exception to. I'm appalled to find that this film is intended to be funny. Several contributors to the 'comments' section have used the adjectives 'humourous','hilarious' etc to describe it. Warfare may be many things - awful, soul destroying, mentally scaring at the same time as being honourable and even uplifting if done in a worthy cause. Under no circumstances can it, or should it, be funny. Quite honestly, I find it a sad reflection on the malaise of our culture that so many (I'm sure otherwise good people) should want to find it so, even in cinematic format. I found the film to be a repulsive and awful attempt to achieve a large audience at the expense of appealing to the darkest elements within our psyche. What are we to take from this? That the Allied side in a what was one of the few justifiable conflicts in world history contained the very same sadistic and homicidal element that existed in the evil we were trying to defeat? This film is an insult to those who fought and died. They deserve a better epitaph than this skin-flick for closet psychopaths. My only regret is that I don't appear to be able to give it a lesser mark that I have done",1
28 August 2009,I sure would like to take Tarantino's history class,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz! He has won just about every award for his performance in this film, and he deserves every single one of them. Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo! He is ULTRA polite with each one; and has supreme confidence in his scary, chilling, bold mannerisms. All I can say is: ""You see this movie for Christoph Waltz's performance; all the rest is secondary""!",8
2 January 2016,Tarantino laughs at his own fans,"There is one scene that stands out in this movie and in fact, in the entire body of Tarantino's work. The Nazi propaganda film at the end where a fictional German soldier effortlessly massacres his enemies. This scene, directed by Eli Roth, is perhaps the most politically interesting scene in any of Tarantino's films to date. That is, until you realize it's true purpose.

Let's quickly review the essential elements of the mise en abyme which is 'Pride of the Nation':

1. incompetent enemy soldiers die in droves 2. incompetent enemy commander makes unrealistically poor decisions 3. cowardly enemies use innocents as human shields 4. hero is outnumbered but prevails due to patriotism and/or desire for revenge

We may as well be watching The Patriot, American Sniper, Fury, Defiance, or any other war-glorifying, American piece of propaganda. And this is exactly the point we are supposed to take away from the ridiculousness of 'Pride of the Nation'. But, it should then occur to the viewer that the movie we have just watched, Inglorious Basterds, is itself just one of these pointless, war-mongering films with all of the above listed elements.

Never have I seen such callous disrespect of a filmmaker for his own audience. Tarantino is spitting in the face of his fans for enjoying the brutal murder of Hitler (and having enjoyed such a pointlessly violent WWII revenge film) all while 'Pride of the Nation' plays in the background. ""You gullible idiots"" says he as he laughs at his fans. The audience in the fictional theater in Paris is the audience of Inglorious Basterds.

I would be inclined not to condemn this motif so harshly if the movie itself had more substance to it. Unfortunately, Tarantino whips out all the old stops in this clichéd time waster. Contrived, poorly written dialogue meant to be witty is followed by intense violence which is followed by screaming - end scene. Once again, Tarantino shows that his incapable of deviating even a little bit from this tired formula.",1
30 January 2010,"Pale, poor and pretty stupid","Just one of the proves of Tarantino's decreasing film maker career - The Inglorious Bastards can probably suit the expectations and intellect of an unimaginative child. Shame for wasted money and some very good acting. The film is presenting a way how five year old American sees WWII. Poor sarcasm and pretty shallow plot development are the most hurting parts of the movie which is giving you the hard time for two and a half hours! Insult for everyone who has obtained Primary School diploma out of US but also for the audience who admired Tarantino at the time of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, The Inglorious Bastards is a ridiculous mishmash of different film styles served on the fast-mood plate adjusted for American Pop Corn cinemas.

Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo!

7 February 2011,Pretty weak,"This was definitely one of the weakest films by Tarantino. And there was a simple reason why.

He chose too serious and dramatic topic for his style. Yes, it fitted perfectly for Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs but to rape World War II in that way is a bit too much.

First scene was very promising when the Nazi was explaining the French man why Nazi regime hates Jews. Secondly we were introduced to Inglorious Basterds. The group of brutal Jews killing Nazis. First I thought it was a fine idea but later it got pretty tiring.

Then everything started to go downwards. Too long table scene showed the Jew girl Emanuelle who had escaped in the beginning from Nazis thinking about showing the great Nazi movie in her cinema. Afterwards another very long and weak table scene came by which ended with shooting.

And then the finale where Emanuelle let her lover burn down the Nazis filled cinema including Adolf.

Some big mistakes were that the table scenes and empty discussions were awful. They didn't lead nowhere. History rewriting in such a way wasn't believable as well. All great Nazis including Hitler were killed in a movie theater. And finally of course Tarantino's jokes which for me have been usually fine but put in such a plot wentjust too far.

Still, if you can put it up you may enjoy this film. I wouldn't say it was a complete waste of time but Tarantino crossed the line from where it got controversial for even myself.

More on the plus site there was some fine acting, some laughs and overall interesting point of view.

So let's just say below average, don't expect it to be Pulp Fiction.. 4/10",4
22 August 2010,Excellent Performances Marred by Buffoonery,"The movie starts with promise. I knew enough about the movie to know that it involved Nazis. We see the proverbial dairy farm in France, a father and three daughters, then the Nazis make their debut. The opening scene is gripping and terse, very legitimate. It is also brutal and believable. All throughout Christoph Waltz shines as the brilliant and merciless Col. Landa. He is truly the bastard of the film. Others submit masterful performances: Mélanie Laurent, Diane Kruger, Daniel Brühl. I especially fell in love with Mélanie's character, her mix of strength and tragedy (and beauty) was very well done. That red dress!

There are some great looks (scenery) and some well crafted sets. Kudos to the set designers. There were moments when this movie had award-winning flair, dialogue, etc. But...

Brad Pitt was a buffoon, and this was intentional. It was painful to watch Pitt ruin the mood and the movie. His accent was ludicrous, his behavior entirely unbelievable. His character, as well as all the ""basterds,"" were wholly out of place. Theirs was a comedy, a joke, a mockery which had no place with the rest of the film.

So this movie gets a 5. It gets a perfect score for the serious parts of the film, a zero for the abject ridicule of the dire and serious subject matter. I may actually watch this movie again - but I will not tolerate the insolence Brad Pitt participated in. Hopefully the chapters (DVD) will allow me to skip through and witness only the acceptable cinema. Trash the basterds.

Alas, what else could be expected from Quentin Tarantino? Brad Pit and Tarantino can now put on their resumes: ""I made light of WWII, the Holocaust and the deaths of millions upon millions of innocent people.""

EDIT: I reread my review and worried that people might misconstrue how I feel about Brad Pitt the actor. Brad has put in some masterful performances in his time: Se7en, Legends of the Fall, Fight Club. There are others too. Brad is easily one of the better actors of our time. So much more the reason to hammer him for his part in this film. You reach the heights - be careful not to fall.

As for Tarantino, I loved ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction,"" the latter being one of the best of the decade (my opinion). His later stuff... not my bag.",5
20 September 2009,Am I the only guy who hated Inglourious Basterds? Doubtful. This is Quentin Tarantino's WORST film!,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz! He has won just about every award for his performance in this film, and he deserves every single one of them. Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo!

All I can say is: ""You see this movie for Christoph Waltz's performance; all the rest is secondary""!",1
23 August 2009,"At last, a real return to form","First and foremost, Quentin Tarnatino's greatest love affair has been with the cinema itself and if he finds masterpieces in trash and the exploitation genre that the rest of us are oblivious to, it's hardly a crime. Indeed his passion for lost and forgotten genre pictures has rescued many a career and put the odd new face on the international map. Referencing other movies is, of course, nothing new and almost every auteur has at least one 'homage' in him. However, for Tarantino, 'homage' has virtually become his livelihood. And, of course, like all homages sometimes they work and sometimes they don't.

Film-buffs love them and often spend most of the movie picking out the references and this can sometimes spoil the fun; the fun of simply watching the movie and enjoying the plot. There is a great deal to enjoy in ""Inglourious Basterds"". This is Tarantino's homage to the war picture but it's just as much a pastiche of the Spaghetti Western, (the score, from opening bars of 'The Green Leaves of Summer' from Wayne's ""The Alamo"", is mostly made up of bits and pieces from other films and all sounding faintly 'Djangoesque'). Primarily, of course, it's a homage to the cinema itself, both the notion of 'film' and the place where films are shown.

The Basterds, (the title is taken from the English title of the little seen Italian movie ""Quel Maledetto Treno Blindato""), are a kind of Dirty Dozen presided over by Brad Pitt's gung-ho 'Apache' descendant, dropped into Nazi occupied France with the sole purpose of killing (and scalping) Nazis, but while Pitt is ostensibly the film's star the Basterds are only one strand of a diffuse plot, (the film is told in chapters), that introduces a number of other characters, all of whom become involved in a plot to kill the entire Nazi High Command, including Der Fuhrer himself. And since this is a fantasy, a cartoon of extreme violence, (thankfully only amounting to a very short period of screen time), it bears no relation to accuracy or history. Tarantino gathers his protagonists in and around a small Parisian cinema run by Melanie Laurents' Jewish survivor of an earlier massacre of the rest of her family, and it's here that the Basterds, on the one hand, and she and her partner, on the other, plan the events that will bring about an early end to the War. And like any movie set in and around a cinema, movie references predominate. It's fun if you get them but it's just as much fun if you don't.

Long admired for the 'cleverness' of his dialouge, Tarantino's movie is a very talkative picture indeed. From the opening chapter, which is mostly a dialogue between Col. Landa, the SS 'Jew Hunter' and the French farmer who is sheltering the Jews he is hunting, this is a film that is sustained by long conversations and some really first-class acting. Language itself plays a major part in proceedings and Tarantino has a field-day with his use of English, German, French (and Italian!) and the accents with which they are spoken. Indeed outcomes hang on language and what is said and what is meant. Sure, there is action and some very bloody violence, (not to mention some very dubious morality), but this is far from being a brainless, exploitative action picture. But did anyone expect it to be? I doubt it.

In a large cast there are some terrific performances. Pitt hams it up but with a knowing wink at the camera. Newcomer Christoph Waltz is a splendid Landa - it's a star-making performance that has already won him the Best Actor award at Cannes and could well win him a Supporting Actor Oscar next year. Michael Fassbender, (Bobby Sands in ""Hunger""), is perfection itself as a stiff-upper-lip British officer who used to be a film critic while Daniel Bruhl continues his upward climb as one of Europe's finest young actors as Fredrick Zoller, sniper extraordinaire, and whose exploits form the basis of the film that is being premiered for Hitler's benefit, with Bruhl playing 'himself' as Germany's answer to Audie Murphy, and Melanie Laurents is superb as the vengeful Shosanna. Here is another French actress about to make her international breakthrough.

It's a brave or a foolhardy or simply a vain director who will end a movie so chock full of film references with the line that 'this may just be my masterpiece'. If it isn't quite, it still marks a major return to form for a film-maker whose place in Pantheon is already assured. It's also the best film I've seen this year.",10
29 July 2021,"Incredible acting, tension filled movie","I can't believe I only watched this now! Inglorious Basterds is an extremely captivating and tension filled movie with long scenes leaving the viewer on the edge of their seats, carried by Christoph Waltz' striking performance as Col. Hans Landa AKA ""The Jew Hunter"".

With amazing plot twists and the Basterd's plan intersecting with Shosanna's, it leaves a first-time viewer dying to know how it will all end.

Inglorious Basterds is by far one of the best movies I have ever watched.

21 August 2009,"a spectacular achievement of ""movie"" cinema","Inglourious Basterds won't please everyone. It's not a full-blown crowd-pleaser like other (dumber) blockbusters from this past summer. It's a war film, but in the same way that Pulp Fiction was a crime film. Some will be thrown off by things that people tend to take for granted with Quentin Tarantino films: it's ""talky"", with pages and pages of dialog performed sometimes like a stage play, and the violence, when it happens at a moments notice, is graphic and harsh and not with much hope for the character killed or injured or, in this case, scalped. It might not even be a film some will claim is the greatest film ever of a generation like with PF. But, for me, it is about as pure a piece of cinematic bliss I could ask for this year. And, dare I suggest, it's as audacious and genre re-defining as anything Tarantino's done, or may do again.

Tarantino makes up his own rules to break them down and see what makes them tick. Godard was like that, but in this case we don't see a filmmaker lose control of his own rules as Godard ultimately did in his career. Instead its a sprawling epic that throws a few really big damn monkey wrenches into Americans vs. Germans vs. French in world war two. It tells concurrent stories that come together in the BIG climactic chapter (and make no mistake, these are BIG, long chapters unlike Kill Bill) about a Jewish girl, Shoshanna (Mélanie Laurent) who runs away just in time before the Nazis kill her family who are in hiding on a French farm, and years later becomes an owner of a movie theater in Paris and is picked out by a popular 'star' Nazi soldier (Daniel Bruhl) to screen a film starring himself in a recreation of his slaughtering 300 people from a roof-top.

The other is, naturally, the Basterds. It's actually with these story lines that Tarantino makes up his first rule to break: why not have a movie called Inglourious Basterds and *not* have them in every frame of the movie? Indeed, by my estimation, the Basterds are in about 55 to 60% of the full running time of the movie. But their scenes are the larger-than-life sort where we see Brad Pitt in an outstanding-cartoonish portrayal of a mass murderer/scalper who, in the real world, is a true-blue war criminal. Him and his men, which include ""the Bear"" (Eli Roth in a surprisingly good turn) and Hugo Stigliz, tear-ass around Europe taking down any Nazis in site (the ""killin' Nazi business"" as Ray says very clearly), and its hear we see an exaggeration of the take-no-prisoners philosophy of men in combat. Prisoners? Too much to bring along. Better to sic the Bear on em.

And all the while Tarantino provides us with an absolutely menacing presence with Hans Landa, a German colonel who appears in the opening scenes in a manner akin to Angel Eyes in the Good, the Bad and the Ugly (this is surely intentional, of course), only his evil is the smiling, chilling kind that reminds one of a William S. Buroughs line: the face of evil is the face of total need. Landa needs information, constantly, and asks so questioningly and with such cunning that we feel a sense of uncommon dread when he appears on screen, even when its just to eat a pastry with the (incognito) Shosanna. And leading in this role, almost threatening to tower over all of the other great or at least just revelatory performances, is that of Christoph Waltz. Take your eyes off this guy, I dare you. He's about as hypnotic and alluring and subtle as they come, and can floor you like Samuel L. Jackson reciting a Bible quote.

But oh, yeah, this film is ""talky"", make that clear again I should. Some scenes go on with a kind of cruel precision that one finds often in Tarantino's work, where you wonder if it might be going *too* long but, in reality, you'll probably be too caught up in the acting, or the suspense that builds (i.e. the basement-bar scene is a classic example) to such a thick point you'll get goosebumps. But at the same time that Tarantino makes a muchly European movie, with small nods to German and French cinema and a surprisingly mature control of the characters and mis-en-scene, he also makes a gaudy spectacle with his Hitler (at first) coming up like Moe Howard of the Three Stooges in You Natzi Spy, or even just Pitt's voice and mannerisms. It's something special to see a filmmaker embrace conventions and then set them with a box of grenades in another. If you see the climax you'll see what that means even more (and that, perhaps, reaches a pornographic exploitation of Nazi carnage).

Inglourious Basterds left me intrigued, startled, laughing, cringing, jaw-agape and eyes-widened, and left me hungry for more. Some will leave disappointed and some will complain. There not without their rights in this case. It's also one of a handful of examples in 2009 cinema of true f***-the-world ""art"" you'll come across. I, for one, can't wait to go into it again, even with that final line screaming (delightfully) of its director's hubris.",10

15 August 2010,Puerile tripe,"One-dimensional comic book characters; a disjointed plot - really just a series of vignettes, each with a predictable violent ending, signifying nothing; punctuated randomly with adolescent humor; and accompanied by trashy music which would undercut what is going on, if anything were going on.

I guess it's supposed to be a parody or something but if so it never quite rises above the level of Mad Magazine.

Brad Pitt gets to mug yet again. Waltz and Laurent get a promo out of it. I hope they go on to better things with a real director.

There is recognizable craftsmanship in the parts, but a movie is a whole, not merely a sum of the parts, and it must be judged accordingly.

10 November 2020,Circumcised Saviours,"Our Tarantino reappraisal continues on, landing this time on 2009 War/Western/Thriller ""Inglourious Basterds"". Seeing it again, this is another entry into to Tarantino's canon that I think is alright, rather than exceptional and another with a lazy ending, that will, for me, mar a few more of his films.

In Nazi occupied France, German high command are amassing on a small Parisian cinema, for the Premiere of a film about the exploits of German Sniper Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl). Though Zoller is smitten with the cinema's owner Emmanuelle Mimieux (Melanie Laurent) he is unaware that she is living under a pseudonym, since the execution of her Jewish family at the hands of Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) several years earlier, and the event offers her a chance for revenge. Unbeknownst to all of them, the Basterds, a Jewish American guerrilla company known for slaughtering as many Germans as they can find, is also targeting the affair.

I feel like ""Inglourious Basterds"" suffers on repeat viewings. I really dislike the ending and knowing that it's coming colours the whole endeavour for me. There are scenes that I remember liking much more the first time, with their inherent tension, specifically the opening scene - with Landa hunting for the Jewish family and the central bar scene where Diane Krueger and Michael Fassbender star. I feel like the ending ultimately undermines what comes before it, much like the conclusion of ""Once Upon A Time in Hollywood"" does to all the good work in that film.

It's not without good performances though, none more so than the Oscar-winning, star-making turn from Christoph Waltz. He is a charming mild-mannered crocodile, with the menace bristling in his eyes the whole film, until one moment of release right at the very end. Brad Pitt chews the scenery (in a good way) as Aldo Raine, leader of the Basterds and Daniel Bruhl has the right level of pride and revulsion to his cinematic exploits.

Let's not go overboard, it's not a bad film, there are entertaining sections and some good performances - but shorn of his ability to write the trademark snappy dialogue, I do feel like this is Tarantino's worst.",7
14 September 2009,Glorification of violence and unnecessary reanimation of old hostilities!,"Yesterday, watched ""Inglorious Basterds"" together with my boyfriend and as a German, I really have to comment about it! My expectations were really quite high because I had read that all the characters would be portrayed by actors of the matching nationality, which I regarded as a brilliant idea! I also knew that the story wouldn't be historically correct, but I didn't bother. In my opinion, the cinema is free to alter history, as long as it's good entertainment.

Well, the movie started with the scene about the French guy being visited by SS Colonel Landa - brilliant acting, especially on the part of Christoph Waltz, good story and I loved the switching of languages. (I was a little bit disappointed though that the Americans didn't speak English in the German version, but also German - why not be consistent and let every character speak their mother tongue? - Perhaps that would be to daring for a mainstream movie and you can't expect the average audience to read that many subtitles? I would have appreciated it to hear English spoken in the movie!) Anyway, so far I enjoyed the movie, but the moment those ""Inglorious Basterds"" entered the screen, that soon changed. Brad Pitt's speech full of hatred already made me frown. Take Nazi's scalps? Be as brutal as possible? - Excuse me, are those the guys I am supposed to sympathize with? - Okay, I thought, it's a Quentin Tarantino movie, so you're bound to hear a lot of language and and see graphic violence. I really enjoyed the plot line with the Jewish cinema owner and the Nazi officer / actor and the whole movie would have been brilliant, if they had just made this the main plot and left out the whole stupid Inglorious Basterds thing! What really gave me the creeps was this scene with the German soldier being beaten to death with a baseball batter. Don't get me wrong, I'm not generally against portraying violence in movies, but it always depends on the context! And it's really unacceptable to portray this violent execution as fun, with cheering and laughing people around, without ever questioning if this is the right thing to do. The ""Inglorious Basterds"" are the characters the audience is supposed to sympathize with because, obviously, they don't want to be on the side of the bad Nazis, though you see them committing much less bloody crimes on screen than the Basterds. Therefore the audience is supposed to enjoy the beating and take it as a righteous action! Pure mischievous joy! I can see all those teenagers laughing who the next day on the school ground stand by a fight, film it with their mobile phone and then upload it on youtube to have a laugh with millions of users who are just as stupid as themselves! I really couldn't believe it! Come on, in which century are we living, Americans? - Do you first need to have your very own Third Reich before you finally get the fact that such violence is NEVER EVER justified? When will you get it that you stop being the good guys the moment you take up the methods of the bad guys and use them against them? - It's the same all over: Iraq, Abu Ghraib, Inglorious Basterds! It is NOT funny to kill and mutilate people, whatever it is they did! Of course movies can portray people who think killing is funny, but they should never portray them as being good and right! And especially not in the context of the Third Reich! And by the way, does there have to be a ""funny"" insult against Germans every five minutes? - Why do you so reanimate the old hostilities of World War II? I thought we were over that! In Germany, we have learned our lesson of tolerance and peacefulness. Everyone who enjoys the movie has proved they haven't learned it yet!

Though I certainly don't sympathize with Nazis, the truest moment of the movie was the scene at the premiere of the movie ""Stolz der Nation"". Three American members of the ""Basterds"" tried to pretend to be Italians because they thought the Nazis wouldn't notice that they can't really speak Italian. But then Nazi officer Landa turned out to speak Italian fluently, to which Brad Pitt's character could only reply ""Grazie"". I just thought: ""Serves you right, ignorant Americans!"" I mean, they have no clue about Germans or Italians or Frenchmen, but they just think they can go into some other countries and kill a lot of people and have fun making a bloody mess in the presumed name of justice.

It's really a pity that a movie with such brilliant ideas has to be so awful, just because it glorifies violence and encourages intolerance! Inglorious Basterds certainly didn't improve my opinion about America and it certainly doesn't improve anybody's opinion about Germany. In recent years, Germany has produced sensitive storys about conflicts of conscience like ""The Reader"" - the U.S. gives us senseless beating and cheering about violence! Congratulation, Tarantino, for your contribution to international understanding! :(",1

16 October 2021,Glory at its peak!!!!!,"Inglorious Basterds; Tarantino grandeur and glory at its peak

The end credits of the film kick in following the line ""I think it just be might masterpiece"" by Brad Pitt (I'm sure there's a separate fan following for the end credits as well) and pretty much sums up the magnanimous piece of cinema by the legendary Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino,the undisputed monarch of non linear narratives, goes all guns blazing in his alternate-history depiction of the Nazi brutality and the eventual downfall of Hitler. The film revolves around the bloody and gruesome 'Inglorious Basterds', a group of Jewish Americans vowed to decimate as many Nazi soldiers as possible and act as a harbinger of Jewish liberation. Col. Hans Landa brilliantly portrayed by Christoph Waltz is a narcissistic and callous general in the ranks of the German military in German occupied France region where he's known as the ""jew-hunter"",is the textbook definition of movie villians and perhaps widely regarded as one of the finest villians ever to have graced the silver screen. With an astounding command over French,German, English and Italian, Christoph Waltz shoulders an aura of hostility and unpredictability and brings in a wave of energy to the character of Landa. He truly deserves the Oscar.

In terms of the writing and characterisation, Tarantino is at his belligerent best with extended scenes of intriguing dialogues, grotesque depictions of violence and an enviable cinematography and music composition. Every second of the narrative gets the audience glued to their screens and appreciate the Tarantino signature style film making. Inglorious Basterds is definitely not for the faint of hearts and those who detest violence in any form. One can't help but notice Tarantino's appetite for violence and storytelling is insatiable.",9

8 December 2009,He's finally gone completely mad...,"I actually sat down expecting to like this movie, and honestly even tried to enjoy it. Ultimately, however, it failed to entertain me.

Rarely have I seen a film that I thought so dull and childish. Besides two scenes that were nearly interesting, the rest, bad as they were, were dulled even further by lengthy and unlikely dialogue punctuated by scenes of gratuitous, gory violence.

The entire film seemed somehow schizoid, straining precariously on the verge of being a farcical comedy, yet ne'er so much as a titter was raised from this viewer.

The long-winded opening scene held some promise, but between that and an interesting rendezvous later in the movie, it sagged. After the second nearly-interesting scene, it free-wheeled downhill.

The tedium of the movie was almost salvaged by the compelling performance of Waltz, and Laurent, attractive and convincing, almost injects a touch of passion... but it wasn't enough. I frequently lost interest.

At points, I was almost offended - not so much by the ludicrous plot, inept writing/direction, or wanton brutality, but by the sheer audacity, inaccuracy, anachronism, and blatant historical theft that attempts to lend gravitas and meaning, but simply insults the intelligence.

It's a shame that an otherwise promising line up was wasted on this sloppy, thoughtless material - how can such a great cast be so... miscast?

I've given it two stars. One star is for the opening scene, which I found genuinely gripping, and the other is for the strongest and most interesting character in the entire movie, some of whose scenes are the only ones worth watching if only for the chilling cordiality that shrouds the menace he infuses into every line and gesture.

23 September 2020,Bloody revenge fantasy,"I would rank this movie on the same level as Django Unchained and it contains a lot of similar themes. The historical revisionist fantasy is the main premise, buttressed by gratuitous violence. This makes it natural to compare the two films. Inglourious Basterds is superior in its characterisation and storyline which are more engaging and slightly less sensationalistic. Despite this, the film does suffer from a grievous ethical code which is perhaps intended to be insightful but comes across as crude most of the time.

23 August 2009,A career at a crossroads.,"Quentin Tarantino needs to work out what kind of film maker he wants to be. Is he the brilliant director of Jackie Brown and Pulp Fiction. That Tarantino made intelligent, brilliant movies. Or is he the director of film-fan obsessed movies such as Kill Bill 1 and 2, Death Proof and this, Inglorious Basterds. Which ever one he is, his career s now at a crossroads.

And that is a shame, as there are moments in this movie when you can clearly see how good he can be. The opening chapter, which is mostly a talk between Col. Landa, and a farmer is brilliant. It's tense and grips through-out, as you never know how it's going to play out. It's also the best sequence in the movie.

But on the other side of the coin, there are the parts of the story involving the Basterds themselves. Some of the scenes involving them are very comical, and that includes Brad Pitt's performance. I'm not sure why he performs the part as he does, but Christoph Waltz, as Landa blows him off screen through-out, and is easily the best performance here. There is good support too, from Diane Kruger as a double agent, and a wonderful performance from Melanie Laurent as Shosanna. And this brings up another fault with the movie.

The story involving Shosanna is the best part of the story, yet it never ties in with the story involving the Basterds, even though the movie climaxes in the same location, a cinema. Tarantino should either have made 2 separate movies, about each story, or made one of them. The Shosanna part is serious and very well done, which as I mentioned puts it at odds with the Basterds side, which at times does get a bit over the top.

Tarantino as his is want, uses pieces of music or songs either from other movies, and some of this doesn't work either Instead it gives credence to the idea he is simply making movies that are homages to the past, instead of something original, which we know he can make.

This is a pity. As stated, there are moments here which show how good he can be. And he deserves credit for, in a big-budget movie, allowing Germans to speak in German, the French to speak French, instead of all the actors speaking in English with a funny accent.

To be fair, this is a much better movie than Death Proof, but now someone must take him to one side, and have a strong talk with him. If he keeps making these homages to films, then he is going to squander his talent. If he wants to do that, instead of coming up with a movie as good as Jackie Brown again, then so be it.

The choice is his.",4
12 December 2009,A travesty riding on the (ill-gotten) reputation of a hack-director.,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz!

3 June 2017,What shall the history books read?,"As Christoph Waltz's Nazi colonel states at one point, ""what shall the history books read?"" is an important theme of this Quentin Tarantino movie that subverts history to present an alternative look at how World War II might have shaped up with a few unwise choices from the Nazis. The plot has Hitler, Goebbels and other high ranking officials attending a propaganda film premiere together - something that gives two factions the same idea to blow up the Nazis. As per Tarantino norm, 'Inglourious Basterds' benefits from snappy dialogue and memorable characters, but this is very much an ensemble piece and sadly not all the characters are fascinating. Waltz is excellent with his cunning interrogations and Mélanie Laurent has some excellent moments as Jewish woman living under a pseudonym and operating the theatre where the propaganda film will be shown. None of the other characters are particularly remarkable though (same goes for the performances), especially Brad Pitt and the over-the-top Italian accent that he inflects at one point. Pitt does get some of the film's best lines though, including in the final memorable scene. Add in some superb spinning shots from Robert Richardson and this is a pretty good- looking film too, but whether it has much to offer beyond its novelty of twisting historical fact, as sometimes happens in the history books, is debatable.",7

21 August 2009,Yet another attempt to use popular media for a false sense of redress,"I love war movies. I love World War II movies specifically. They are a perfect venue for romance, intrigue and suspense. And the Nazis make great villains. That said, this movie was nothing but an semi-amusing parody of history that tries to exact retribution for something that can neither be undone, nor 70 years later, has any relevant or accountable culprits. The Jews have played the holocaust-card for sympathy and gain long enough, and it doesn't make them any more respectable as a political entity. Inglorious Basterds is an attempt to depict a vindictive fantasy of those who still hold a grudge around which they have formed their entire identity - a grudge that any ethnic group could hold if they were so little. For instance, just imagine when the Palestinians get a hold of the popular media. But, the truth is, it wasn't even that good of a movie, and normally, I like Quentin Tarantino. I think that if the makers really wanted to create a convincing band of Jewish marauders behind enemy lines, like the 'Inglorious Basterds,' the last thing they should have done is cast real Jews (rather, more like Til Schweiger). There were a few good performances...and the opening scene was about the most suspenseful. Other than that, it was a mess. Probably the worst acting I've ever seen Brad Pitt do.",5

15 April 2010,"A long, sad and boring decadence","I'm not a Tarantino's fan but I loved 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction'. So I can't believe that Tarantino directed 'Inglorious Basterds' After the opening scene with the Nazi officer interrogating the farmer who is hiding Jews in his basement the movie goes straight to the ridiculous, place from where don't exist come back. May be as an action B-movie 'Inglorious basterds' can stand up, but please!!!! We're talking about mainstream and a top level director. Obviously Tarantino forgets that grown-up people may be in attendance and assumes that there are only teenagers watching that sad remake of 'Dirty Dozen' and another good war themed movies. Boring (and pointless) conversations accumulate totalizing 154' of wasted budget. Also I'm tired with the sequence of 'homage' after 'homage' that Tarantino include in his movies. For surrealist movies I prefer Luis Buñuel's 'El perro andaluz' or 'El angel exterminador', but surrealism melted with the hyper-realism of Hitler, the Shoa, WWII is stupid if not unmoral. The usual argument with Tarantino lovers is ""if you can do it better...do it so"" but the point is, who needs this piece of bad B movie? The crew? Seriously disappointing performance by Brad Pitt who can't hide how amused he was filming that scrap. I can't understand how this movie is actually at 8.4 in IMDb please!!!!!! I absolutely hated 'Inglorious Basterds' and its collection of endless, sadistic and (the last but not the least) boring scenes. The scene where three people talk for several minutes at the same table, before, they are all shot is extremely boring, Ingmar Bergman mixed with Peckinpah? No way, Quentin! I deliberately did not read any reviews of this movie on IMDb before I watched it because I really wanted to see it without external influences, it's a pity I wasted two and a half hours of my precious life.",4
8 December 2010,"Dear Mr. Tarantino, good film are not toys","It is as if you exterminated your own film-making. Obviously you're burnt out; maybe you should retire and let new boys take over. Was it all Once Upon a Time...? Have you really nothing more to offer? Is there really nothing more to do (with your inglorious friends) than to laugh your way to the bank? Is this the kind of man you became after wiping the sweat off three marvelous films? Actually, if you allow me a rant, were those movies? or did you consider them toys you had to take apart during your adolescence? Now that you are a full-grown-man, aren't you able to play with them anymore? have you lost the innocence and the genuine investment of the real geniuses that have lived? Good film are not toys, and as with most toys, an adult doesn't play with them because it's ridiculous, a childish things to do. Inglourious Basterds is a reservoirs of toy dogs. I see (for some others out there too) little chance of recovery, and I don't think you will ever grace us again with another stunning motion picture. That's all Quentin!

10 January 2020,ONE HELL OF AN ENJOYABLE WW2 ADVENTURE BY THE LEGENDARY TARANTINO!!!,"Quentin Tarantino is easily one of the greats movie directors of all time!!! I consider Tarantino to be one of my top 5 fave directors ever along with my number one John Carpenter. I've loved Tarantino since his blood soaked debut ""Reservoir Dogs"" rocked the world way back in the 90's & of course loved ""Pulp Fiction"" & his true masterpiece in my opinion the excellent ""Jackie Brown"" & his ""Kill Bill"" flicks were great fun too if abit over the top & absolute loved his work on ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" probably the best Vampire film ever made!!! So yeah Tarantino is great & I'm a big fan.

Now down to his war epic adventure ""Inglourious Basterds"" it's as expected a fantastically well made & beautifully shot movie, the best of the best from an obsessed movie geek behind the camera & his cast is excellent, even though I'm not a ""Brad Pitt"" fan at all & consider him to be one of the most overrated actors in cinema history along with the terrible ""Tom CULT Cruise"", pitt is good in his role as the scarred Lt. Aldo Raine & he's funny often & has a thick hillbilly accent but the guy that stands out to me was the incredible casting of Horror Director ""Eli Roth"" who plays the baseball bat using big ""Jew Beary"" Sgt. Donny Donowitz who is a scene stealer of a role as beats to death deserving Nazi scum, he's great fun & hilarious at times, now the cast is excellent some truly outstanding performances here from the likes of ""Christoph Waltz"" & ""Michael Fassbender"" & ""Diane Kruger"" & ""Melanie Laurent"" all incredible performances.

This is an Awesome piece of Action adventure Thriller & drama set in Nazi occupied France during WW2 & a team of soldiers ""The Basterds"" are sent in behind enemy lines to slaughter & scalp as many Nazi's as possible, there's some Awesome gory scenes & some incredibly intense scenes along with the big pieces of smart & interesting dialogue that Tarantino loves to spill out of his characters!!! It's great entertainment within a work of art piece of filmmaking, Tarantino is a genius!!! I much preferred this over his ""Kill Bill"" films, it's still gritty & savage but fun & entertaining at the same time with beautiful music. Another Stone cold CLASSIC from a master of Cinema",6

3 February 2010,Academy Award Nominee??,"This is a very uneven film and way overrated. The opening chapter at the farmhouse is way too long, the conversation between the two men is boring and there's little tension. The scenes with Brad Pitt and his hick Tennessee accent are excruciating, once again he hams it up over the top. He cannot do comedy. The basement pub chapter on the other hand is a fascinating bit of movie making and scripting, top notch Tarantino, but that was what - 20 minutes out of the whole? Landa is a great character, superbly portrayed. The final cinema shoot 'em up is a silly fantasy, a smaller scope, more historical ending could have lent the whole movie a ""could have happened"" feel. So, a lukewarm effort.

26 November 2009,Who are the real Nazis? The allies or the 10 points raters?,"8.5 points rating (26.11.2009)? For what are these points? What do people like on this sh**? Usually Tarantino makes not too bad movies with ridiculous violence scenes - but now? The whole movie looks like a dumb army propaganda video.Every normal human should see, that the actions of the ""heroes"" are in no way better then those of the ""enemies"". Killing unarmed kneeing people with baseball bat's is tough? The Nazi sign on the head is nothing else as the Yellow star (even worse cause its not removable). The story is simple, also the characters - only a little thrill and the rest is very very dumb. Nazis killing is fun,Nazis are no humans - before 60 years it was the same, only with Jews instead of Nazis. Looks like you've learned exactly NOTHING! So who are the real Nazis in this movie? So many people like this crap, i'm really afraid!

1 December 2009,Complete nonsense,"What can I say apart from 'do not waste your money'. Tarantino is vastly over-rated in my view, but I was beginning to change those views at the beginning of the film where the opening scenes were superbly tense. Then it went downhill into a mixture of 'how the USA won the war' and simply 'complete nonsense'. The more the movie progressed the more annoying it became and the more bizarre and contrived the storyline became. Why contrive a film about (in)famous characters and then try to rewrite the whole history of the 2nd world war? I'm sorry but Tarantino is a pretentious little man who unfortunately believes much of the adoration written on this site. I would have preferred to have watched Eastenders !!!

6 September 2009,Adult puberty?,"I was prepared to write something really mean this time. It was supposed to be about Tarantino wanting us to giggle once again together with the sadist inside us. Giggle about the lynch justice, the reptile morality and the sometimes rather stomach turning violence.

But once again I was seduced. Not at least by the dialogues, which go on not only for 5 minutes, but for 10 or nearly 15 minutes. And I promise, even the most shallow action addict will sit quiet, not wanting to miss a word. That's focus, that's great movie-making.

But the story is certainly the worst ever by Tarantino, although told in a much clever way. When he leaves the retaliation morals of a 14-year-old, he will not just perform great movie-making. He will also make good films.

13 October 2021,"""This might just be my masterpiece""","Tarantino proves just how flexible the setting can be for a Tarantino film through this motion picture, divided into 5 chapters with two storylines all merging to a thrilling conclusion and a chilling final shot, one can easily assume this might just be Tarantino's masterpiece, although many say otherwise it can really only be decided by the viewer themselves. A majority of the film being spoken in a different language labeling it as a subtitle movie can be a turn down for certain audiences but with Tarantino's masterful dialogue it is not only easy to follow but extremely enjoyable to keep track of, worth also mentioning is the fascist feeling that eminate throughout Christopher Waltz's entire performance as a member of the Nazi party undoubtedly adds to the entire feeling of the 1940's menacing world power.

Words are not enough to describe this film's mild impact it has on its viewers, positively or negatively, my only recommendation would be to experience this motion picture firsthand and with an open mind, and who knows just how much this film will surprise you.",10

11 March 2010,The first IMDb disappointment ever,"I don't usually trust reviews and ratings, but IMDb had never failed me, until now. I used to think that enough intelligent people vote over time, to get the rating about right. I've changed my mind.

I don't care one bit about the brilliant performance of the SS officer, the colors, the pace, or the jokes. The message is so disturbingly wrong, that it trumps any of the positive aspects of this piece of trash. If over 90% of the people who watched the film can not see anything wrong with it, then this world is certainly doomed.

I have enjoyed many of Tarantino's films, regardless of the violence. Up until now, the violence was due to personal and largely justified revenge, or part of the character of very sick individuals. Putting Vermacht foot soldiers in the same basket with SS and Gestapo officers is just plain wrong. I wonder how this film would be rated if it were about a Palestinian squad scalping Jews or marking their foreheads with the star of David.

These issues are not to be trifled with. Not all Germans were Nazis deserving the wrath of Jehovah. Any attempt at generalizations about a large group of people should be condemned, first of all by the Jewish people, who know what discrimination and persecution is. Hateful films like this would barely make it as war-time propaganda and you hail it as one of the best films of all time? I would like to tell you what I think of you, but I bet my review would not make it through the editors, so I will simply suggest you watch it again after you've grown up.",1
23 August 2009,"Unexpected, But Fantastic","I've been excited about this film since I first heard about it and loved what I had heard about the plot. So, now, Basterds is finally here and I love it. While it's not what I expected, I think that's a good thing. This is not the Kill Bill of WWII films that some might think it is. In fact, the Basterds aren't even in the movie for a good chunk of the time. However, there is so much juicy dialogue and tension in so many scenes, that you can't help but be fascinated by what's going on.

I won't waste space by repeating the initial plot, but suffice to say, there is so much happening and so many characters that it constantly stays interesting. Everyone here, even Roth, are entertaining. I will say this is a Nazi revenge fantasy come true, as anyone who hates the Nazi's (and who doesn't) will most likely laugh at the inhumanity that is returned to them. Yes, it is also a funny movie, particularly Brad Pitt, who is wonderful, funny, and thoroughly entertaining as Aldo 'Apache' Reins (spelling?).

But don't go in expecting a huge action adventure. The film has less action and more dialogue and drama. Some scenes drag on, but they are filled with suspense. And Tarantino is very successful in these scenes by bringing out the worst dread and SS officer could possibly bring out. There are even some big surprises in store, but I won't spoil that here. Suffice to say, anyone who ever wanted to see a Nazi get their head bashed in by a baseball bat should go see this film.",8
7 November 2021,Classic,"One of the best, if not the best Tarantino movie.

Cristopher Waltz and Brad Pitt really had a lot of pressure on their shoulders for this one, but for actors this good, they simply take the pressure and turn it into a classic.

Great work all around.

11 October 2010,Wow bad,"What is the deal with this movie? I was bored out of my skull during this movie. I don't know if I missed something, but I thought this movie was terrible. I would also like to mention that I watched this in my home on Movies on Demand. I saw it with my dad and friend, and we all basically wanted to turn it off. The only reason we watched the whole thing was that when I finally snapped and decided i was done watching, the piece of garbage was nearly over. I see that it's high on the list of best movies of all time for IMDb ratings. This really does baffle me. I was not intrigued with the plot at all. The parts that were meant to be funny did not translate for me. I really thought this movie was lame.

6 December 2020,Loved it. One of his better ones,"Ok, well this film was the only Tarantino film I hadn't watched yet. And wow, I really enjoyed this. The mix of fiction and non fiction worked so well and the story was fantastic and really kept me gripped.

A couple of Tarantino films I thought were dragged out in certain areas, but this I don't think was the case at all. The acting was fantastic by everyone involved, special mention to Christoph Waltz who was phenomenal.

At the end of the day this is a classic Tarantino movie, with gore, violence and a gripping long story. If you enjoyed the others and haven't seen this one then I highly recommend you do, because as mentioned at the top. This is one of his better ones.

I will say though, I've seen some reviews saying it's humorous and I honestly don't see it. It doesn't take anything away from the film, but I don't see where the comedy was.",9
2 May 2021,Inglorious indeed,"Oops Zemo was a Nazi.

Just rewatched this Tarantino flick. Last time that I watched it, I was a bit bored until the ending, which became grand and entertaining.

This time, even though I was still bored at some parts, I found many major scenes intense. There were no background music throughout the conversations, and the dialogues and nonverbal behaviors built up the tension, and then the eventual fallout happened.

This sequence occurred many times, and the scenes where Christoph Waltz was in were the best. His happy yet menacing behavior worked very well. The other casts were great and cool, especially Brad Pitt.

Overall, some slow parts, but great acting and dialogues made for a pretty awesome reimagination of Nazi downfall. 8.5/10.",8
21 August 2009,One too many turns of the screw; and surprisingly pro-German.,"By far the most enjoyable thing about ""Inglourious Basterds"" (sic, sic) are the performances by the cast of outstanding European actors. These Europeans really know their stuff. In fact, this film's real stars are the Europeans, especially Christoph Waltz from Austria and Melanie Laurent from France. Their performances are wonderful. As for top-billed Brad Pitt, he has only a supporting role as Tarantino's 21st Century stand-in for Lee Marvin. Pitt may be the star on the marquis, but he's far from being the star of this film.

Some reviewers here seem to think the movie is anti-German. I can't imagine how they can possibly think that. Perhaps the bravest man in the whole film is a captured German soldier who courageously chooses death before dishonor. Sure, there are the usual Teutonic sadists and pigs, but on the level of plain soldiers, both sides seem to be more or less equal in executing their inglorious duties. In fact, in their manner of carrying out their parts in total war, the Americans and British in this film don't seem much of a step up from their German enemies. Indeed, these irregulars of the OSS and SOE employ many of the same methods used by their Nazi opponents: torture, threats of retaliation against families, etc. Is it possible for a particular group of sadists to claim the high moral ground?

Despite the excellent acting, and superb photography and costuming, this film eventually disappoints. The last 1/4 of the film descends into the realm of pure nonsense, fantasy and ludicrous, contrived situations: a country bumpkin milkmaid becomes a cinema owner; dozens of the Reich's highest ranking officials and officers gather in a hostile city with barely a guard in sight. That's so ludicrous that anyone from the Secret Service watching this film would have tears of laughter rolling down his or her cheeks. Just like a person who always gives a screw one too many turns and breaks something, director Tarantino just doesn't know how to leave well enough alone or quit when he is ahead. Like a child, he insists on demonstrating how much he knows (or thinks he knows) about movies and their history, and so he winds up damaging his own movie.

With his in-jokes and his sly aural and visual references to other films and their makers Tarantino wants to impress us, but he really only manages to foul his own work. I know who Aldo Ray was; I've seen him and the late, great Lee Marvin. Is Tarantino trying to impress me with the fact that he knows them, too?

The very talented Tarantino should spend less time being referential and reverential, and more time mastering his movie-making skills.",7

23 August 2009,Don't Bother With It,"There are war movies, and there are war movies. Some people call ""Casablanca"" a war movie. I don't. War movies are supposed to depict actual fighting...you know, shooting and combat. I always feel especially cheated when they promote a film as a 'war' movie, and it involves little or no artillery fire. This film portrays a few minutes of horrendous bloodletting, but no actual on screen 'combat'.

It's the same old stuff you've seen from Tarantino. Threats, hostile situations, characters being backed into a corner, more threats, murders and mutilation. It features the usual round about dialogue, except here it goes on and on and on.

Some of the actors are entertaining. One guy gives the worst performance as Hitler I've ever seen. Brad Pitt acts like a clown.

So this isn't really a 'war' film. I thought it might be an updated version of the ""Dirty Dozen"" but it doesn't resemble that one at all. Just a collection of drawn out confrontations that leave you really cold. Don't bother.",2
15 September 2009,A completely juvenile film,"Sitting in the cinema, I was absolutely furious with myself for paying money to see this trash. The violence was gratuitous, every scene and character was clichéd, QT was just trying way too hard. It was hard to shake the feeling that this film was adapted from a short story written by a 14 year old boy trying to shock his parents, and make his friends think that he is cool. The strudel scene made me ill. Here's the overdone cliché: let's make the bad guy eat food and talk with his mouth full. How many times have we seen this in a film? This film was yawn from one end to the other. When I wasn't rolling my eyes at the ridiculous scenes of violence, I was yawning at the drawn out conversations, and the obvious efforts that went into 'building tension.' I cannot believe that so many people have raved on about how great this film is, when it is one of the worst films ever made. I guarantee that all the people who claim to love it won't bother to watch it again on DVD.

6 January 2022,Gripping,"In my memory this was too long and guilty of portraying Nazis as cartoonishly evil in the way which has seeped into some depictions. Rewatching, I don't think that's fair - many scenes are masterclasses in building extended tension, Walz is brilliant, and it's down to his performance, I think, that the portrayal of Nazism remains the right side of appropriate. I'm still not sure what I think of this sort of alternative history and revenge fantasy - and by 'not sure' I mean 'not sure', not as code for 'I really don't like'. But it's far more gripping and generally better than I gave it credit for.

5 September 2009,"Brad Pitt is a mean, mean man.","No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz! He has won just about every award for his performance in this film, and he deserves every single one of them. Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo!

All I can say is: ""You see this movie for Christoph Waltz's performance; all the rest is secondary""!",8
23 August 2009,"Long, Gory, and Not Quite Glourious","Taking its basic inspiration from a subpar '70s actioner (same title, but spelled correctly) by Enzo Castellari, Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" is the story of a group of Jewish-American soldiers scalping Nazis at the end of World War II...or maybe it's about the plot to kill the officers of the Nazi high command at the world premiere of a propaganda flick at a small French art theatre...or maybe it's about sitting around in a pub, trying to guess what cultural icon is written on that card pasted to your forehead.

To say ""Basterds"" takes the 'scenic route' to its inevitable conclusion would be a vast understatement. There is almost too much nuance, subtlety, and craftsmanship to absorb in one sitting, but in its own novel-like way (like the ""Kill Bill"" films, this is also divided into chapters), it all comes together, somehow.

An avid disciple of trash cinema with an undeniable knack for recycling said trash into creations of originality and cinematic slickness, Tarantino's love--first and foremost--is his characters...and their ability to jaw away on subjects ranging from crucial to superficial. Critics hailed this approach most notably in ""Pulp Fiction,"" Tarantino's 1994 breakthrough. But by the time ""Death Proof"" rolled into theaters as part of the ""Grindhouse"" double bill in 2007, many seemed burned out by what had, at that point, become formulaic (scenes of winding conversation juxtaposed against moments of shocking violence). Those disappointed by ""Death Proof"" are not likely to be won over by the ambitious–yet garrulous–""Basterds.""

Neither will those who have viewed the ""Basterds"" trailer (a shrewdly assembled string of highlights from the film's scattered--yet potent --action scenes) expecting a slam-bang fiesta of Nazi scalpings and bodies riddled with machine-gun fire. As exciting as it would be to see Tarantino truly cut loose with a scuzzy, exploitative homage to his forefathers, I think that duty will be forever be supplanted by frequent collaborator Robert Rodriguez (""Planet Terror""; ""Sin City""). Still, Tarantino has pulled off quite a feat with ""Basterds"": he has made an art film that will play on nearly every screen in America, has the misspelled taboo of its title to draw in the curious, and makes sure most of the film's dialog is spoken in an array of languages (French, German, broken Italian)–that's right, this is a film that, for the most part, is READ. The opening-day crowd I saw this with expressed audible displeasure at the near-constant barrage of subtitled dialog. ""C'mon, when do we get to see more scalpings?"" it seemed to cantankerously demand.

As a period piece, ""Basterds"" is aesthetically interesting in that it straddles the line between the tropes associated with low-budget independent film-making and infuses them with a distinctly mainstream slickness (by comparison, this fictionalized take on the fall of the Third Reich and the end of WWII boasts a better plot and more excitement than last year's fact-based ""Valkyrie""). The result is an oft-confounding collection of seemingly disparate events and characters (including frequent flashbacks that, puzzlingly, lack any sort of context), but I can't deny the sheer genius of certain passages, and the way the climax doesn't shy away from upending the proceedings in an unabashed orgy of blood and madness.

Above all else, the film is a showcase for Tarantino's distinctly well (some would say over)-drawn characters. Frequently, he will bring the story to an unexpected halt to give a newly-introduced face a monologue that shades in every nook and nuance, often before said character is unceremoniously blown away minutes later. While the result is an arrhythmic pace in a film that could have easily benefited from some dialog clipping, it also portends a depth that goes largely unseen in our attention-deficit era of film-making. And while Brad Pitt earns top billing as Lt. Aldo ""The Apache"" Raine (and is perfectly serviceable in the role), the film contains standout performances from Melanie Laurent (as the Jewish survivor of a Nazi raid, who runs the aforementioned French art theatre and conveys a detached, ice-cold beauty) and especially Christoph Waltz as Third Reich Colonel Hans Landa, whose ingratiating smile and laugh portends a darkness that's nothing short of horrifying (don't be surprised if he snags a Best Supporting Actor nod at next year's Oscars).",7
4 September 2010,Thoroughly dumb,"For some reason I had high hopes for this movie, probably because of the hype. It turns out it was ALL hype I am saddened to say. I have no problem with the exaggerated violence, it's expected in a Tarantino movie. The problem for me is that the movie comes across as thoroughly dumb or even daft. From Dusk Till Dawn looks like a masterpiece in comparison to this crap. Time spent watching this movie is purely wasted time.

The story and dialogue is cliché, mostly boring and even childish. It could be a sign of the movie that the only really good acting in this movie is by the villain. How this movie has received any good reviews is beyond me. Another HUGE mystery is that this movie could be even nominated for ONE award. On one hand Christoph Waltz was by far the best actor in the movie, but then again there was no competition was there? My guess is that there must have been a drought in the movie business or a total lack of ideas the whole of 2009.

Do yourself a favor and stay away from it. Tarantino has made good movies. This is definitely not one of them.",2
19 July 2016,Are we provoked yet or do we need more? Quentin Tarantino,"Just terrible. Turn the table around and have the audience laugh when SS soldiers smash Jewish heads while making baseball jokes. Disgusting!

Tarantino is determined to see how far he can push idiocy before the public and critics realize their legs where pulled. Shatting on the floor is not art despite being done by Leonardo da Vinci it is just.... shat!

One could easily stop here but adding to the stupidity is the ridiculous portrayals of Germans as stereotypical witless automatons while the crude and charming smartness of our utterly psychopathic ""heroes"" is supposed to be taken for granted. Americans you know!

I guess Tarantino, just like an obstinate child, tries to push our patience to the point where the crowd goes berserk but no. The world tolerates an insidious amount of stupidity.",1
20 December 2009,Un-glorious Mastrubation,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz!

24 January 2010,I also wish I could give this movie a 0.,"Why oh Why do people like this movie? I lost interest in the first 10 minutes. The rest of the movie I kept wishing for it to end. It has a laundry list of stuff it did wrong; The suspense scenes went on way to long, there was usually no point to all the violence, it made me feel bad for the nazi's (thats a first), Diane Kruger in 2 scenes then gets killed, shitty ending, stupid plot line with the nazi guy and the french theatre owner, terrible accents, and Brad Pitt doing nothing and saying nothing importent for 2 hours. I will never ever ever see this movie again. This is the new definition of the worst movie I have seen. This was worse then vampire town or red blooded American girl and thats saying something. Overall DO.......NOT....WATCH.....THIS....MOVIE!

30 March 2017,Fun Film,"Quentin Tarantino plays around with history and by doing so he created a great film. This is one of his best films he has made.

Inglourious Basterds starring Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Mélanie Laurent. The film tells the fictional alternate history story of two plots to assassinate Nazi Germany's political leadership, one planned by Shosanna Dreyfus (Laurent), a young French Jewish cinema proprietor, and the other by a team of Jewish-American soldiers led by First Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Pitt). Christoph Waltz co-stars as Hans Landa, an SS colonel tracking down Raine's group who has a connection to Shosanna's past. The film's title was inspired by Italian director Enzo G. Castellari's macaroni combat film, The Inglorious Bastards (1978).

This film however is a little long but still enjoyable

19 May 2019,All over the place,"The acting in this film is quite good. The storyline is ok but wanders off at times to being ludicrous. It contains violence, which you would expect in a war film, but it some scenes are just gratuitous. The biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. It contains all parts of drama, war, action and black comedy. That maybe the makers intentions, however, the ongoing result is it's frustrating and annoying. It's not a bad movie but in no way deserves high scores or classic status.

12 April 2021,Very good,"Exceptionally good. The genre ""Guerra"" can only be characterized by the historical context, because in what concerns action scenes on the battlefields; mishmash of human bodies lying on the ground or enemy armies, this is left aside in Inglourious Basterds. The feature film focuses on two stories that are initially parallel, however, as the film develops, these stories intersect in a very interesting way. In general, what most calls the attention of those who watch is the complexity and tension present in each dialogue. It is worth emphasizing the importance of the soundtrack. Many songs are capable of referring to the thirties and forties of the twentieth century, a period in which the film is set.

Film seen on April 10, 2021.

19 June 2011,A masterpiece. Simple as that,"Greetings from Lithuania.

Going to be short here.

This movie is a masterpiece, lets face it.

Everything, and i mean EVERYTHING in this movie works on the highest level. Writing is the best one in 2010, and i LOVE ""The Hurt Locker"". Acting, directing is brilliant. Christoph Waltz is unforgettable here, and the others are a joy to watch, especially Diane Kruger (whitch i didn't tough was a good actress before this movie) and Michael Fassbender (he will certainly win an Oscar one day).

This is my favorite movie from a cult director Quentin Tarantino. ""Pulp Fiction"" follows next.

Watch it, this is an unforgettable movie and real joy to all haters of Nazis and fascism.",10
17 March 2020,A Real Good Story!,"He's been able to make a living off it, but Quentin Tarantino doesn't do what he does simply to make money off it. By the time Inglorious Basterds came out, Tarantino already had major success in Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, more than enough to permit him to live the rest of his life in good comfort. Quentin Tarantino just loves cinema, and that's never been more obvious than with this film. The meticulous attention to detail and carefully - and successfully - written plot leaves the audience feeling completely satisfied. In a film that relies partially on subtitles to tell its dialogue, it's extremely effective and entertaining. As with previous films, Tarantino doesn't waste time. This movie is to the point and every single scene adds to the plot. Coming fresh out of this movie, it's a fantastic product that I will definitely be going back to watch many times.

13 September 2009,Not as good as I had hoped,"I will keep this short.

Bit of a let down, Had some good moments. The first 10 minutes of the film are just gripping. Then fell flat. Some action, some script, o.k acting but I left just feeling that it should or could have been better.

Yes I laughed and cringed and the cinematography is done well but it wasn't enough to save this film. I almost wish he stayed with the original story instead of just taking the title and inventing a completely different story all together.

Don't get me wrong I am a massive Tarantino fan. His work is truly amazing but this just didn't seem to have that flare he normally possesses.

28 August 2009,Tarantino Can't Top Real World War Two with His Fantasy Version,"""Inglourious Basterds"" wants to be World War Two on steroids. It wants to be bigger, stranger, bloodier, meaner, funnier, more stylish than WW II ever was. Here's the problem: World War Two WAS on steroids. It WAS bigger, stranger, bloodier, meaner, funnier, and more stylish than anything a sheltered film geek like Quentin Tarantino could dream up.

Tarantino didn't have to invent a group of Jews who fight Nazis; there were such Jews, including the Warsaw Ghetto fighters, who staged the first urban uprising in occupied Europe, The Bielski Partisans, who fought in the forest, and the Treblinka and Sobibor Uprisings in death camps. Nothing Tarantino could invent could be stranger than the life of Oswald Rufeisen, a Jew who survived by posing as an SS man; his memoir, ""In the Lion's Den,"" is far freakier and gasp-inducing than anything in Tarantino's film. No filmmaker will ever make a more over-the-top or diabolically stylish production than Leni Riefenstahl's 1935 documentary of the Nuremburg Nazi Party Congress, ""Triumph of the Will."" Tarantino has a reputation for stylish violence; the violent scenes in ""Inglourious Basterds"" are not as violent nor as innovative in their use of violence as those in ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""The Passion of the Christ."" Tarantino also has a reputation for witty, stylish dialogue. Again, the real World War Two produced plenty of unforgettable lines: ""Peace in our time,"" ""Who remembers the Armenians?"" ""I shall return,"" ""Nuts."" Tarantino's most daring ambition is to provide a more ignominious end for Hitler than Hitler's real demise. Sorry, can't be done. Hitler died a betrayed, solitary loser, knowing full well that everything he had strived for was lost. A far better movie, ""Downfall,"" depicts Hitler's nightmarish real life descent into Hell; Magda and Joseph Goebbels' historically accurate deaths in ""Downfall,"" preceded by their murder of their own children, are as creepy as it gets. Tarantino can't top history.

""Inglourious Basterds"" consists, for the most part, of a series of relatively disconnected dialogue scenes; the sensationally violent scenes are few and far between. Dialogue goes on and on and on. Yes, there are some gems, and some tension is created, but the simple fact is that Tarantino needs an editor. I never thought I'd be so bored in a lurid, violent movie about Jews wrecking revenge on Nazis. There are three different scenes of Nazis and resistance members who are hiding something sitting around tables, consuming food and drinks, and hoping that the Nazis don't discover their secrets. The first time Tarantino does this it is very powerful. The third time it just drags, and you think, ""Come on. Don't you have anything else to say?"" Suspension of disbelief and conventional narrative structure work magic on the brain, inviting identification. Tarantino does everything he can to push his viewers away from involvement in this film and to remind viewers that he, Quentin Tarantino, quirky film genius, is the real star.

The Basterds of the title are minor characters; the plot hops from place to place, character to character. When top Nazis appear on screen, a hand scrawled note appears on the film, with an arrow and the Nazi's name. Some scenes, like the opening involving a Nazi interrogation of a French peasant, are played as if real, and other scenes are obviously played with lots of winking and nudging at the audience. Musical styles shift throughout the movie. ""This is really a salute to Spaghetti Westerns!"" some of the music shrieks. Experimentation is welcome, but all this ""Hey, don't forget, Quentin Tarantino is behind the camera; I'm famous for quirky films"" winking and nudging broke my involvement with the film and made it a real slog for me. I didn't care about what I was looking at, and I got bored.

""Inglourious Basterds""' opening scene is flawless. Nazis arrive at an isolated French farmhouse. A girl is hanging sheets on a line. Given Tarantino's penchant for saluting past films, I immediately thought of Andrzej Wajda's ""Ashes and Diamonds,"" and was ready to see a character bleed to death all over those clean sheets. Not so. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), a Nazi ""Jew Hunter,"" is there to interrogate the farmer (Denis Menochet). Menochet is brilliant in this scene, a study in stoic, peasant masculinity. Waltz waltzes into movie history. His fastidious, precious, melodramatic performance as a perfectly evil Nazi enters cinematic history. His life will never be the same.

The rapturous embrace of ""Inglourious Basterds"" by critics and film fans is kind of depressing. It's sad to think that there are young people who will think that this is what World War Two either was like or should have been like, and it's sad to think that they are so divorced from history that they don't get how wrong both assumptions are. Years from now scholars will study kids who think that no Jews fought back till Tarantino invented them.",6
15 December 2009,A nadir in popular culture,"An offensive pile of terd.

To make a revenge fantasy as realistic as this, on a subject that remains as serious as this, is just, plain and simply put, naked exploitation, That so many find it enjoyable is sad and pathetic but probably to be expected in a culture that celebrates superficiality, that venerates celebrity, and is ignorant to the point of being easily manipulated by those who have anything but its best interests at heart.

The work of a mind sadly bereft of a moral compass.

'3' for the actors who perform brilliantly but who should have known better.

7 February 2010,Tarantino has lost it...,"Tarantino did a few things right: Pulp Fiction, Four Rooms, Natural Born Killers, From Dusk till Dawn. He did it in between '94 and '96. Compared to those films, all his others suck, although, if you compare them with other films, they may be OK or even great. This movie is neither. It's all like a long (very long) bad joke.

What's it about? There is this group of American Jews that fight a guerrilla type warfare behind German enemy lines. It's what today would be called terrorism. Is this film about them? No. Are you confused yet? There is this Austrian actor, Christoph Waltz, who plays the role of a German psychopathic officer, speaking English, French and Italian to perfection. He does it well, got an Oscar for it, although I suspect more for the fact that he can speak 5 languages, which is rather astounding to Americans. Is the film about him? Not really. There is an actor playing Hitler. About him? No! Brad Pitt? No.

As any Tarantined story there is a lot of talk. Only in this film, it amounts to nothing. The characters are completely impossible to identify yourself with. Actually, the one taking the top for this would be the psychopathic German, so that says a lot about the others. The script makes no sense, mostly, and the little it does, it is completely boring. As for any message the movie would have, I call them racist, any of them, as every nationality is stereotyped to the absurd.

Bottom line: one thing the movie got right. No one deserves any glory for the film, including Tarantino. It can be fun, obviously, since so many people liked it, but I hated the time lost on it.",6
26 April 2013,A charming and brazen excursion from reality,"To compare Quinten Tarenino movies to those they pay homage to is to ignore the experience itself. Our story or wishful revisionist history gets the nod due to its' fun characters and war driven Mexican standoffs. We have Christoph Waltz' charming Nazi Col. Hans Landa, Brad Pitt's brazen Lt. Aldo Raine and Melanie Laurant's strong Shoshanna to rally around. The framing of each scene with a mixed genre of soundtrack is yet another fun ploy and not one visual or sound is accidental. In putting out fire with gasoline, ""Tarantino the Entertainer"" resurfaces here with a fun, cunning and ridiculous tale of ""Jewish Revenge"". Enjoy!

14 September 2009,"Interesting, but not the ""New Dirty Dozen"" action film its advertising purports","""Inglourious Basterds"" is an interesting film, but not really a satisfying one. It has the ideas and framework of a cracking 1960's style WWII action spectacle, along the lines of ""The Dirty Dozen"" or ""Where Eagles Dare,"" (Or even Italy's ""Inglorious Bastards"" from which the new film gains its name). But the long sequences that make up IG are really more like outtakes from a Hollywood film. It's as though Tarantinio is presenting the conversations that happened in the big budget 1960s WWII action epic when the camera wasn't on. In that way, it is actually much more like his first commercial feature ""Reservoir Dogs""--long dialog sequences punctuated by violent outbursts; all surface style, no deep characterization; incredibly entertaining dialog, but way too much of it, etc.

I had very high hopes after the first sequence, a very skillful lift of the prolonged yet tense opening sequence from Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West."" But I was soon to find out that the film was just going to be one such sequence after another, each less effective than the last simply due to the repetition. There were no real themes developed, the Basterds (except for Pitt's cartoony ""Psychotic Andy Taylor"") were basically faceless and uninteresting, and the whole thing was unfocused and unbalanced. But even so, the dialog scenes were entertaining while they were taking place—it's just that they served absolutely no other purpose than momentary amusement. It would have been really cool if Tarrantino had collaborated with someone who could have integrated the best of his conversational sparring sequences into an actual story.",6

No show of empathy, compassion or mercy. The bloodthirsty revenge theme worked for Kill Bill but that was one messed up woman hunting a bunch of even more messed up freaks and the visual art and music were the main quality anyway. I'm actually starting to question QT's emotional health. This movie makes him appear as a sadistic narcissist. It's simply disgusting. One point goes to Waltz' performance which was amazing and really wasted on a film like this. I wish I hadn't seen it, it made me depressed and disillusioned with parts of humanity. The emotional response this movie invoked in me is pretty much the straight opposite of what I got from Avatar, which I also saw recently. Then again, I guess the universe isn't quite done yet with its need to manifest nihilism and violence and that's probably why these lame movies keep being made. But maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm just too stupid to understand QT's genius. If that is the case so be it, I'd rather focus on other perspectives of reality than this one.",2
9 July 2021,Scratching My Head,"Not sure what to make of this film. I liked it but didn't like it.

Not sure whether it was supposed to be a dark comedy or just dark.

One point off for the most unbelievable Hitler in a movie.

One point back on for the excellent performance of Christoph Waltz.

The ending made the movie.. if only it happened that way!

30 December 2012,I'm no longer a Tarantino fan after watching this.,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz! He has won just about every award for his performance in this film, and he deserves every single one of them. Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo! He is ULTRA polite with each one; and has supreme confidence in his scary, chilling, bold mannerisms. All I can say is: ""You see this movie for Christoph Waltz's performance; all the rest is secondary""!",
20 March 2022,Brilliant acting by Christoph Waltz,"It's a Tarantino movie, not everyone is gonna like it but if you like his masterpieces this should be your go-to choice. Kept me on the edge of my seat from the very beginning to the end. A movie that contains all the emotions.

10 May 2013,One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made And One Of The Greatest War Films Ever Made. A Tarantino Masterpiece.,"Inglorious Bastards is one of the greatest films ever made that combines excellent direction,brilliant acting,a great screenplay,amazing Action,wonderful soundtrack and black humor. It is one of my favorite movies,a classic war film and a Tarantino Masterpiece.

Set in France in the 1940s during World War II,Inglorious Bastards tells the story of a secret army known as The Bastards,a group of Jewish soldiers led by LT. Aldo Raine(Brad Pitt)who hunt,capture,kill and scalp Nazi soldiers. And while The Bastards hunt Nazi soldiers they soon have to deal with Nazi detective Hans Landa(Christoph Waltz)who is nicknamed ""The Jew Hunter"". Meanwhile,young Jewish girl Shoshanna Dreyfus(Melanie Laurant)who owns a local theater wants revenge on the Nazi when the Nazi wants to show one of their films at her theater. The tension builds up to a conclusion that Aldo Raine,The Bastards,Hans Landa or Shoshanna Dreyfus will never forget.

Inglorious Bastards is a masterpiece of cinema that will have you mesmerized and glued to the screen,a big and epic War film that is brutal,intense,violent and funny. With Bastards,Quentin Tarantino takes the genre of the Spaghetti Western and applies it to the World War II backdrop and gives viewers not a realistic world,but a Tarantino world where everything is bigger than life and everything is exaggerated beyond belief. Tarantino has never made a conventional film or has never played by the rules and IB is as about as unconventional as it gets because with IB Tarantino gives viewers a WWII film unlike we have never seen before where Tarantino boldly rewrites history and real life characters without a problem and in it's own way makes the revisionist history believable. Tarantino also fills the film with lots of anachronisms using songs and music scores that are not from the 1940s but are from later in the 20th century,it seems like a risky move but songs fit in well with the scenes in the film and you never ask about realism and accuracy. The Screenplay by Tarantino is excellent and unforgettable,with Tarantino giving each of the characters in the film great dialog that's funny and humorous and delightfully over the top. The dialog in the film is very memorable and well-written it stays with you for a days and you will quote lines from the film again and again. The pace of the film is amazing because even though the film is 152 minutes at times it feels like it's 90 minutes thanks to the dialog from Tarantino and editing by Sally Menke making the film go by smoothly and making IB one of the fastest 2 and a half hours you will ever watch. The three main characters in the film Aldo Raine,Hans Landa and Shoshanna Dreyfus are classic Tarantino characters who are very memorable in their own way. The two characters Aldo and Hans are both mirrors of each other in some ways because while Aldo hunts down Nazis and Hans hunts the Jews both characters use similar tactics such as talk,smarts and cleverness to do their job. Both are dangerous and great at what they do. Characters and revenge is a common theme in most of Tarantino's film and Shoshanna Dreyfus is another character looking for revenge. With Shoshanna you feel her rage and anger because of what the Nazis have done to her people and when you see Shoshanna you can relate to her and wanting to have revenge. These are three classic Tarantino characters that will stick with you after watching the film. The violence and Action scenes in the film are done with brilliance and style because every Action done with an air of suspense and great build up and when build up stops and when the Action comes it's like an explosion. This film also has one of the best shootouts in film history and when it happens it will be like someone punched you in the face. The ending of IB is classic Tarantino and it is so powerful that you will be in awe at it's intensity and brilliance and it is truly an ending that you have to see and believe. It's a great explosive ending and is one of the reasons Inglorious Bastards is a masterpiece.

The whole cast does an excellent job in their roles. Brad Pitt is excellent as LT. Aldo Raine,with Pitt bringing humor and over the top greatness to the role. Christoph Waltz won a Oscar for his brilliant and masterful performance as Hans Landa,one of the best villains in film history. Waltz is menacing,powerful,terrifying and unforgettable in his role. Great performance. Melanie Laurent is wonderful and sexy as Shoshanna Dreyfus,with Laurent bringing intensity and depth to the role. Eli Roth is funny and tough as Donny Donowitz,nicknamed ""The Bear Jew. Michael Fessbender is great as LT. Archie Hicox,a British soldier who works with The Bastards. Diane Kruger is fantastic as Bridget Von Hammersmark,a double agent working with The Bastards. Daniel Bruhl is great as Freddrick Zoller,a German war hero who likes Shosanna. Til Schweiger is tough and intense as Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz,a German soldier killer who helps The Bastards. August Dieli is wonderful in his role as German soldier Major Hellstrom. Gedeon Burkhard is smooth and cool as Cpt. Wilhelm Wicki. Martin Wuttke(Hitler)and Sylvester Groth(Joseph Goebbels)give fun and over the top performances. Mike Myers(Gen. Ed Fenech),B.J Novak(Pfc. Utivich),Jacky Ido(Mercel),Rod Taylor(Winston Churchill),Julie Dreyfus(Francesca),Omar Doom(Pfc. Omar)and Denis Menochet(Perrier LaPadite)give good performances too.

The direction by Quentin Tarantino is excellent,with Tarantino bringing a beautiful and gritty cinematic style to the film and moving the camera at all costs when needed. Great direction by Tarantino.

I love music that is used in this film which is mostly composed songs from Ennio Morricone and other composers. I also loved the use of the song Cat People from David Bowie. Great soundtrack.

In final word,if you love Quentin Tarantino,War Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Inglorious Bastards,an epic Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10
27 July 2010,"Awful,","I give this film 1 out of 10 simply because I cant award 0 out of 10.. it is two and a half hours of trash, pointless, boring, full of excessive gratuitous violence of the worst kind, with cardboard cutouts for characters, a plot that is moronic, acting that is noticeable only by its absence, and lacking any redeeming features at all. The second world war was the most dreadful occurrence of the 20th century, and to reduce it to this rubbish comic book inanity is an insult to the 50 million lives it took. To read reviews describing it as hilarious and howlingly funny makes me despair, the war wasn't hilarious or howlingly funny, and this movie wasn't, either. Tarantino has plumbed new depths of tripe with this effort, and my biggest regret is that I was stupid enough to buy this on DVD as I missed it at the cinema... there went some money and three hours of my life i will never see again.....(sigh) to anyone who is thinking about seeing this, I offer the following advice.. don't bother, pull all your fingernails out with pliers instead.. it won't be as violent, it WILL be more enjoyable, and you won't regret it as much afterwards.......

22 May 2016,Please allow me to save you 2 hrs 33 min,"Let me start by saying I was a big fan of Tarantino's early work. I rate some scenes from True Romance, Reservoir Dogs, and Pulp Fiction as some of the most engaging I've ever seen...and own copies of all three, which I've watched numerous times each.

Sadly, for me, QT has completely lost whatever gift he gave that early work. His early films were so fresh...and constantly challenged ones expectations making their story-lines unpredictable and entertaining.

And his reputation for creating dialog and characters in those films was WELL deserved.

BUT...Inglourious Basterds contains only flickers of that earlier genius.

IF the dialog does share any of that former glory...it is COMPLETELY masked by being in foreign languages a LOT of the time (French, German and Italian)...and then the subtitles (which over-ride your disc's) are tiny and hard to read.

So you strain to understand a LOT of what is being said.

The story is historically inaccurate to say the least...which would be OK if it wasn't completely flat and unbelievable...and in addition you find yourself caring so little about most of the characters that when they are killed off you don't care.

Brad Pitt puts on a phony accent and smirks his way through another performance...and is paired with Christoph Waltz who is appropriately menacing at times...and completely over the top at others.

So the movie begins to take on a cartoony, farcical feel...complete with lame characterizations and ludicrously improbable situations.

I bought my copy at a LOW price from a sale bin at a store (no wonder there)...and will likely NEVER watch it again.

Hopefully I'll save some of you time you'd not get back otherwise...but if you read this and go on to see this film...you can't say I didn't warn you.",1
23 August 2009,Bloody Mess,"What a huge disappointment this movie was. Tarantino's done some off-the-wall but really cool stuff, like ""Kill Bill, vols. 1 & 2"" or even the classic ""Pulp Fiction"" but this one just stunk, period. Brad Pitt has shown that he has great acting chops, particularly in stuff like ""Seven"", ""Benjamin Button"" and ""Snatch"" but in this atrocious film, he just hams it up as a twisted, 2-dimensional character who gets his thrill only from the kill (and a whole lot of torturing too). What the hell was he thinking, taking on this role?! Diane Kruger was good as the coolly mysterious Bridget and Micheal Fassbender (who was so good in ""Hunger"") does the best he can with the role he's stuck playing but seeing Mike Meyers as a general was too much because I kept picturing Austin Powers trying to play leader. Eli Roth should stick to writing and directing those shallow slasher films he specializes in because as an actor, he's just not that talented. Tarantino likes lots of gore in films so he worked some weak little story into the plot so that audiences would sit through his blood-and-guts fest. Better films about alternate history endings and World War 2 in particular are not hard to find. This one belongs on late night cable or worse. What a waste of money and time.",1
10 October 2022,This is a top tier Quentin Tarantino movie,"-This is a top tier Quentin Tarantino movie-

This HAS to go in your top 5 Quentin Tarantino movies, it's so well done, so wonderfully acted, so intense at times, and so funny, so entertaining, everything is just spot on. If you like the artistry of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill, etc more, that's fine, but I'm always rotating this in as his best film ever made, but all his film eras are pretty different, so hard to compare.

All I know is, no movie gets me smiling ear to ear as much as Basterds does in a few scenes.

Theres a couple? Moments that I didn't love, but that's about the least of any Tarantino movie, as they're always controversial like that. I'm still giving it a 10, because when it's good, it's unbeatable as a movie. The intro and ending are just phenomenal. This is what you go to the movies for.",10

3 April 2010,Tarantino's On Fire ..!!,"In Nazi-occupied France during World War II, a group of Jewish-American soldiers known as ""The Basterds"" are chosen specifically to spread fear throughout the Third Reich by scalping and brutally killing Nazis.

This is the ending that the holocaust truly needed & millions wished for. The opening scene between Nazi Colonel Hans Landa (Christopher Waltz), nick-named the Jew Hunter & LaPadite is one of the best scenes in cinematic history. This scene will take your breath away & your heart will be pounding all the way through. Brad Pitt does not dominate the film, as one would expect & its not really a bad thing in this case. The scalping scenes with Brad Pitt & his Basterds will leave you in splits or freak you out. I loved the way this movie was told. Tarantino is one of the best storytellers ever.

Christopher Waltz, god this man made me hate him & love him at the same time & he won an Oscar for that. I am very happy that he won, he portrayed the most insane character so well. Humour is very much a key part as with all Tarantino films. The violence is sudden & lyrical. This film is a piece of art. Shoshanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent) who manages to escape from under Landa's nose & plays a key part at the end was wonderful. There are so many parts to this movie that I can't indulge here. Diane Kruger also gives a solid performance. For a Holocaust movie, Hitler is very much sidelined.

This is a beautiful film, inspite of its questionable politics & its textured characters, the poetry of the dialogue & its exquisite images. But more because it is so acutely bizarre that it's the closest we might ever get to the truth. This is definitely one of the most satisfying films in all aspects.

16 October 2009,Garbage Movie,"This movie was garbage. A pretentious, self-indulgent mess. It consisted of interminable dialogue and a paper-thin plot stretching out over nearly three hours. Booooooooring! I realize that this movie was not supposed to be a flat-out action film, but, come on people, the ad campaign for this film was incredibly misleading. And another thing: why do the opening credits have to be modeled after a film from the 60s or 70s? For what possible reason? In Jackie Brown and Death Proof it made sense, as each was an homage to styles past. But why do it for this one? Yes, Quentin, we know what a big fan of these eras you are. We get it. Move on. And why the cartoon title over Hugo what's-his-name? Tarantino didn't do much else like this in the film. It just threw it off balance for me. What'd he make this stuff up as he went along? And is it true that Tarantino rushed production to get the movie done in time to compete at Cannes? If so, that is the dumbest and most narcissistic thing I've ever heard. I'm tired of listening to this guy talk about how much god-given talent he has. Make an entertaining movie, for pete's sake! Reign yourself in! The movies you make shouldn't just be for you and Eli Roth and Robert Rodriguez to watch and pat each other on the backs after. It's getting old, people. Does ANYBODY agree with me, or does everyone still think this guy is God because he had Travolta and Jackson talking about cheeseburgers before killing somebody?",
1 December 2009,How can this be in the top 100? Beware the IMDb rating.,"I was debating between this movie and 2012 but chose Inglourious Basterds due to it's amazingly high IMDb rating. I must say now, what a disappointment. I expected a certain amount of gratuitous violence, but I also expected a lot of witty dialog. I got a huge dosage of the former, but not nearly enough of the latter. I felt shortchanged. The ratio between violence to plot is very important and I think this movie gets it totally wrong. And the plot? It's that believable or really all that entertaining either. Save your time and money. I can't believe what this rating says for the gory and violent tastes of the modern masses.

30 May 2021,Tarantino Just Can't Make a Bad Film,"This film is dumb fun in the best possible way, is it historically accurate? No. Is it something that could have really happened? No. Is it energetic, witty and massively entertaining? Yes.

This film is Tarantino doing what he does best, taking a load of characters you may not normally root for, have them do some pretty horrific stuff and still make you want them to succeed. Christoph Waltz puts in a brilliant performance as this evil scheming SS officer who is just supremely charming and the rest of the cast follow suit, all giving brilliant performances, behind the camera too the work is stunning with the costumes, sets and camera work all coming together perfectly, this film deals with some really dark subject matter but you come away with a smile on your face and for me at least that is why Tarantino makes such great films, if you haven't watch this film, do so as soon as possibly. 9/10.

20 August 2020,Inglourious Basterds,"Drama comes from the people to the subsequent paragraphs dialogue will happen violence expectations, the so-called ""the calm before the storm"", quentin use dialogue a little approaching the critical point, that is his forte, similar examples are ""true romance"" theo Ken Wright and history in his dad's dialogue, ""reservoir dogs"" at the end of the dialogue, etc. The dramatic tension would not be as strong without the explosive ""tipping point"" that gives the audience expectation, such as the opening of Reservoir Dogs and Quentin's passage in Four Rooms, which is pure lip service.

Maybe this is the movie number 1000000 that talks about Nazis. is there any other subjects that Hollywood can produce?! I think this movie is another American propaganda to show super heros American. I expect next Hollywood movie is American hero will save Jesus!!!

28 August 2022,Overated Mess,"Yes, Christoph Waltz steals the movie, but as the interrogating Nazi Hans Landa, it's his own movie to steal, because it hardly belongs to first-billed Brad Pitt, using the worst Southern Accent and attempting the jowly tough guy persona of Marlon Brando... Then his own Dirty Dozen are hardly distinguised from each other except ""The Bear Jew"" played by director and horrible actor Eli Roth, who wouldn't be formidable in a My Little Pony cartoon... And the German Serial Killer of Nazis with some potential but winds up dying before the story, about a Jewish girl's drawn-out revenge on Waltz, gains momentum, which it never really does... It's one long scene after another without any real connection... At one point Pitt and his boys are completely missing during a tavern sequence where Tarantino throws in more movie trivia... This is an overrated mess...

31 July 2022,I wish I could see this film at the theater,"One of the best films I've ever seen in my life!!!

Besides our main characters like Aldo, Hans Lada,..., I was so impressed with the below details:

+ Richard Sammel - who played Sgt. Rachtman - perfectly delivered and expressed what Quentin wanted us to see in this scene. See how he stayed calm, firmly knelt while getting interrogated and threatened, then his face with the indomitable look in his eyes along with how the camera moved - indeed proved how he got the medal for his bravery. We kinda see how Quentin built him as a courageous soldier even though he's on the Nazi side.

+ Sturmbannführer Hellstrom could even identify Wicki and Stiglitz as Obersturmführer München and Obersturmführer Frankfurt. He surely found that Hicox was a fake Hauptsturmführer and decided to play games all along (card, intruder, "" Auf ein tausendjähriges Deutsches Reich"", Scotch) to expose 'em 100%. At the ""Drei Gläser"" moment, you can see how Hellstrom was a bit disappointed when Hicox gave himself up with that ""stupid"" sign. Otherwise, he coulda come up with another more irritating game to poke the Basterds!",10
23 December 2009,"Shallow, indulgent and pretentious","Anticipating the release of what was supposed to be Quentin Tarantino's return to form, but not necessarily fooled by the almost-radioactively-glowing praise it had received from contributors to IMDb, I had optimistically imagined the film would be strewn with witty dialogue, high tension and atmospheric camera-work. What I saw instead was shallow, indulgent and pretentious. The characters had all the depth of bad comic book caricatures, and scene after scene involved actors having to explain the inconsistencies and downright unlikelihoods in the plot to each other. Any tension intended by the constant interrogations was drowned by repetition of questions and painfully obvious answers. I always knew Bande Apart's latest offering would gain an almost automatic entry into the IMDb Top 250, deserving or otherwise, but its current ranking of 68 shocks me. Tarantino's easily-pleased and over-loyal fans, by enjoying this movie as much as they profess, must share the eroded attention spans of the coked-up sycophants that appear to make up Tarantino's inner circle... seals, faithfully honking their applause for a steady degeneration from one of the world's most exciting directors into the washed-up hack he is quickly becoming. I will stop short of pointing out the Top 250's other most undeserving inclusions, let alone it's many glaring omissions ... movies whose thorough production ethics shame most modern efforts... but I can recommend (especially to any other film lovers out there on this cusp, who suspect the emperor has no clothes) that outgrowing Tarantino, at least, will probably coincide with a major leap forward in their ability to correctly assess the merits of a film. This one sucked.",2

In inglorious bastards is so much talking and blaming German propaganda... and what is all this jumbo posters and commercials for this film? Its nothing else that American propaganda. And lets see statistic... Inglorious bastards has 8,6 points in average, release was one month ago and film has 71000 votes. And you tell me these votes are realistic and independent from flood of commercials. I'm not saying this film is poor, but it is absolutely overrated. This is an average film for my taste and I think 6 points is enough. I would suggest you film Zwartboek (2006) if you like historical dramas ( Pay attention on number of votes ).

23 August 2009,Another Gem From Hollywood's Most Obscene Director,"What is the fascination with Quentin Tarantino? He is the Larry Flynt of violence; reveling in it, smearing it all over the screen, forcing the viewer to overdose on it. His films are all about violence for its own sake; there is no greater artistic merit to this filth, no matter how many allegedly intelligent critics effusively praise it.

The message this movie sends is truly frightening. The ""good guys"" set out on a mission to brutalize the ""bad guys."" Our ""heroes"" do nothing laudatory at all throughout the movie, except to violently destroy ""bad guys."" They have no scruples, no principles and no morality. This is typical of those who inhabit Tarantino's warped, pornographic world. As another reviewer noted here, this film unintentionally causes the viewer (at least those viewers with any semblance of decency) to sympathize with the Nazis. That certainly can't be what Tarantino was trying to achieve.

""Inglorious Bastards"" is political correctness gone amuck, armed with an electric buzz saw. The cartoonish caricatures, the vapid, sophomoric revision of history, the profane ""might makes right"" credo- all of it should make any halfway intelligent and sensitive person cringe in disbelief. Brad Pitt's accent is about as ridiculous as any I've ever heard; he would have been laughed off the stage of most elementary school productions.

Those who think our civilization is collapsing will not be comforted by this film. Tarantino is an overrated, vile filmmaker who has perhaps produced his ""masterpiece"" here. Or at least we can hope.",1

6 August 2009,Inglorious? Quite the opposite in fact,"I screened this movie tonight at USC, and I've needed the past few hours to organize my thoughts well enough to coherently describe the obscenely beautiful cinematic achievement that is Inglorious Basterds. Have you ever seen a movie and been struck nearly speechless when you're walking out of the theater? This movie blows those out of the proverbial water. I would have said speechless, but I was able to say the word wow, which I said an ungodly number of times. It wasn't until around now that I find myself able to at least write a slightly more aesthetically pleasing grouping of words. As usual Tarantino has given me deeper insight into the art form that is cinema, but even when compared to his previous, outstanding work, this film stands out. I would go into the depths of his work, analyzing the intricate beauty of each individual shot, but there isn't nearly enough room in this forum to do that. I will tell you that throughout this film you will be amazed. Brad Pitt delivers an amazing performance that is equal parts knee-slapping ""good ole boy"" and unrepentant mass murderer. You'll certainly laugh at his Tennessee accented minimalist Italian, and you'll definitely cringe at his inspired cranial ""artwork"". Christoph Waltz defines the phrase ""stand and deliver"" with his portrayal of Col. Hans Landa, an SS officer and noted Jew hunter. He'll make you cringe with his speeches, both at their content and the calm yet weighted manner with which he presents them. His manner has the feel of a kindly uncle, but you can feel the immense tension that each word he utters carries, as if a monster is lurking just below the surface, waiting to be released. Finally we have Eli Roth. To call his performance of Sgt. Donny Donowitz impressive would be a disservice. Even in the trailer his rage is palpable, but in the film it emanates from the screen, reaching out and touching the audience. With each swing of his already infamous baseball bat, this ""Bear Jew"" radiates that much more of his righteous anger. These performances would be more than enough to make this a great film, but they're just the tip of the iceberg. Supported by amazing actors such as Til Schweiger, Diane Kruger, Mélanie Laurent, B.J. Novak, and Daniel Brühl, these roles are pushed from simply great to truly inspiring. If you believe in the raw and awesome power of cinema then this is a film for you. If you just want to be entertained for a few hours then this is also a film for you. Regardless of how you feel about Quentin Tarantino I urge you to see this film, to be open to its powerful energy. This film will not only entertain, and teach, but will also provoke many philosophical discussions about the ethics, or lack thereof, displayed by its many characters. In closing I will merely say I intend to see this movie again, in theaters, and I hope you'll do that same.",10

22 December 2009,Worst Movie I have ever seen in my entire life,"This movie is a disgrace to cinema and to world war II in general. The rating for this movie is rather disturbing given the shear brutality, inhumanity and cruelty of the ""protagonists"" in the movie. Scalping and bashing the heads of POWs should be denounced not praised. The entire plot of the movie is razor thin and shallow and does not have an ounce of historical plausibility to it.

If you favor a good story, historical plausibility,deep characters and a sensible use of violence then please stay clear of this steeping pile of crap that some call a movie. How it made it to the top 100 is beyond me.

20 September 2009,Was it supposed to be funny?,"Let me just say, I am a fan of Tarantino but this film is making me wonder if that will continue.

Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction had humour, style and shock. Jackie Brown had a great story and style. Kill Bill (The imported version - The UK cut DVD makes no sense) had style and a fun story. Death Proof was pointless. It had no redeeming features to balance the violence.

This is one of the worst movies I've seen at the cinema. I'm not even sure if it was even supposed to be funny. And I'm so disappointed. I was hoping Death Proof was going to be an exception. If I'd been at the cinema on my own I would have walked out.

I hated Starship Troopers (and would have walked out on that too) despite being a huge Heinlein fan. The humour in that was very similar to IB and totally missed me too.",1

9 May 2013,"It has its moments, strong cinema feeling throughout, but the humorous tone and the ""deja-vu"" revenge story cause disappointment","Inglourious Basterds was a little bit, in fact quite different film than previous Tarantino films which disappointed me at theater personally as a fan of him. The movie has one of the greatest opening sequences ever filmed, it proves how genius Tarantino is, but unfortunately the rest of the film was a let down after this sequence. This sequence is an example of quintessential cinema, pure genius. The vision and the mastery of the director shine such as the timing of the camera down or the suspense, atmosphere or the acting, it is a perfect sequence, but as said the movie was lack of the magic that this part had. For example, the revenge story in this movie was a little bit bland or lack of spark, especially in comparison with Kill Bill. Also, the similarities between the two stories make it even worse! (blonde avenger, the same songs etc.) In addition, the heroine of this movie was not likable like The Bride, she was rather cold that's why I couldn't identify with her throughout the movie. Christopher Waltz's performance is jaw dropping, incredible, however Pitt is not ""so so"" as some people claim, he is great too! I have no idea why some people doesn't accept that he is a very talented actor. His performances in 12 Monkeys, Burn After Reading and Tree of Life were Oscar worthy for example. Diane Kruger is the third best of the cast, her subtle performance is outstanding. Returning to the film, the movie was somehow ""cold"" in comparison with other Tarantino movies and that annoyed me. I don't say soulless, but somehow lack of any real spark except for the famous opening sequence or let's say the movie was lack of emotional involvement. The violence in the movie was very brutal, so unbearable at times, but that's OK. Some action scenes are stylish, but some of those are not, too brutal and raw like the baseball bat scene. If the point of those kind of scenes is to disturb audiences, yes it delivers! Hitler was portrayed in a comical tone which harms the seriousness and realism of the movie (in contrast with the movie, Valkrie for example) He just shouts people around him. I hate Eli Roth because of his sick and sadistic director identity, but his persona and his role suits him very well in this movie and he works as a post-modernism tool of Tarantino. The camera usage in the translation scene was another example as Tarantino highlights ""cinema"" over everything else. The villain of the movie, Hans Landa was a great character study, however, until the end, somehow the character lost his mystery? impact? And one of the biggest disappointments for me was the theater sequence because of the over humor or the funny tone. I had expected a suspenseful, exciting or even interesting climax, but instead got a sequence that works more like a parody! May be Tarantino tried to make his own Stalag 17 or Dirty Dozen (both movies have funny moments which I don't like particularly either), but comedy just doesn't work in this movie. Another problem was the confusing and controversial aspect of the film. In a scene, ""a good guy"" of the film torments a woman to get some information, he is a hero, also an anti hero, may be both may be neither of them! In another scene, a German soldier who has a wife and a baby gets shot, in those scenes, I know, Tarantino tries to throw us a curve, but personally I wasn't amazed, instead frustrated. He did the same thing to the relationship between the heroine and another German soldier, I won't go further not to spoil anything, but many twists in the movie didn't amaze me as the director would expect or wish. However, the last twist at the theater shows that Tarantino doesn't take any side or has some ideological thoughts, instead his only purpose is to amaze or surprise audiences and gets applause! The bar sequence was great, it shows us again that Tarantino is a dialog expert for sure! The ""deserve"" scene was stylish and also powerful. The ""hot"" climax was unfortunately lack of suspense, excitement or real action. At the end, if he can rule his ego a little bit, if he can forget about the cheers that he would want to get, instead focusing on his art, sure he will make much better movies.",8

27 September 2009,Canned cheese,"Straight from the can. It combines the historical accuracy and realism of 300 with the premise of The Dirty Dozen. It's pulp fiction, true, but is it intentional kitsch. Having watched it, I thought it might have been but after I read an interview with Tarantino, I changed my mind.

It taps into that primeval want for doing bad things to people we don't like. Revenge, don't think so, well, maybe in case of the girl but she's not the audience, she's not even a basterd. Justice, not exactly that either, it's not a court in there and it's done from a contemporary and utterly simplified point of view. It does however provide a relief for that sense of powerlessness you might experience when confronted with ""the heavy stuff"", that is if you are ignorant enough to be able to talk yourself into it. And in the end, those cheers don't change anything or make you one of the ""good guys"".

I found the audiences reactions to be more amusing than the movie itself. Take the reactions people had to the scalping or ""batting"" scenes. On one hand the disgust and shock of some of the more sensitive of our brothers and sisters out there, just as highly emotional as the joy and bewilderment some of our domesticated animals have experienced. To be honest, the volume of graphic violence was rather small. Just a few rather short scenes in between all that talking and talking, French, German, Italian.

Getting to the one redeeming feature of the movie that I've managed to find, unintentional as it might have been, it made thousands of testosterone laden juveniles read subtitles. I find that hilarious.

How about this for a tag line: This is what the play from The Producers would have looked like had Germany won the war.

As a pulp violence showcase it's lackluster and as a serious war movie it's script is just ridiculous and mediocre, so except for the stylization and technical aspects, what's exactly supposed to be the movies appeal.",3

21 August 2009,Inglorious indeed,"I have never gone to a Tarentino movie expecting great things. Matter of fact, the only Tarentino directed movie I enjoyed was Reservoir Dogs. That movie was solid all the way through. Except for a few scenes, everything was connected. Basterds, is the first one that I had hopes for. So much for hopes and dreams.

I didn't get enough of Pitt. He had the best ""interesting"" character that anyone could stay attached to. Christoph Waltz's Colonel Landa was definitely interesting and scary at first but soon lost my interest when he became inconsistent and clownish - not something you want from the lead baddie who, at first, appeared devious, evil, and unpredictable. Everyone else had their 15 seconds of fame and then wiped themselves off my memory.

The movie had too much talk(is there such a thing as gratuitous boring talk?). A true Tarentino obsession. I got bored during most of the conversations. It seemed intentional. Was that to distract from the occasional blood-lust? Yeah, it was bloody, and I got the dark humor in it, but it was clumsy. The best scene was near the end which occurred at a theater and affected the audience in a dark and disturbing way.

The best the movie had to offer was some great imagery and choreography but nothing that should earn anyone any awards. What killed that was the lack of emotional attachment. Really, when I think about it, this movie came across more as a study of Coen brother movie-making and failing to achieve anywhere near that level. Is Tarentino trying to imitate them? There is no way to talk anyone out of seeing this movie so I won't try. However, it is doubtful I will ever consider seeing another Tarentino film.

14 January 2010,The most idiotic world war 2 movie ever made,"I must say I love movies about history and previous wars.

So I was trying too enjoy this movie, but I would not get over the fact that all kind of cliché's are wrapped up in this single movie. I thought this movie would be a pleasant surprise since it's a Tarrantino, BUT it was so predicable. There where no surprises in this movie and we knew how the movie where going too end very early on.

Movies about WW2 are beginning to water out!, we have seen them all and we are constantly reminded by Hollywood about this part of history. Please Hollywood,,,,, time has changed and the holocaust offspring are now repeating history in their promised land. I could not keep myself from thinking that the justified cruelty in this film is probably going to justify the unjust cruelty going on in the worlds single concentration camp in the promised land.

I'm disappointed in this movie and Tarrantino",1
24 August 2009,Pulpy history didn't work,"The lacking story line did not have the characteristic, imaginary ""coolness"" of his other films. Alas, this was the worst of his films and a disappointment from such a great/unique filmmaker.

The movie was divided into a series of 5 chapters. Each chapter consisted of long drawn out dialogue, containing some suspense and concluding in a rather disappointingly predictable manner thus lacking the customarily ironic dialogue that make conversations about cheeseburgers fascinating and also lacking the delightfully shocking surprises and uniquely interesting imagination. These five chapters connected in such a disjointed manner it seemed as though he were making 5 random clips that vaguely associated with each other (similar to a movie he had a hand in – four rooms).

Other Tarantino films employ completely original conceptualized fusions of genres like Kill Bill's fusion of kung fu with the spaghetti western aura and sexy female assassins. What a unique fun concept! This concept although somewhat unique, (the killing Nazi fantasy), had a slight tasteless sensation maybe since it turns this whole event into a thrill rather than something that should remain solemn.

For such a long movie, I've never seen such a complete lack of character development. Even with the seemingly pure raw entertaining Kill Bills which contained characters with interesting histories and vulnerabilities, the Inglorious Bastard's characters went below one dimensional, to half a dimension, almost robotic like and all of them were so insignificant and the movie was 2.5 hours long!

Despite all the bad, it is a Tarantino film and since it is so, it is a refreshing divergence from the prototypical. Tarantino's trademark perverse tongue and cheek violence was rampant throughout even if it mostly lacked the violence art of Kill Bill 1. Tarantino's trademark personal dialogue was there despite getting boring at times.

Tarantino as great as a film maker he is clearly has his boundaries. You can sense his contemporary soul clashing with historical matter thereby limiting his scope and imagination or making things seem way too out of place. Historical stuff no matter how ""pulpy"" it gets might be outside his boundaries.",5

1 May 2011,Condoning torture and murder,"Amongst the most disgusting films made, condoning & GLORIFYING the brutal torture of unarmed German soldiers in WW2. Against the Geneva convention but seems to be OKed by Hollywood and the media. Can you IMAGINE a film being made with Israeli soldiers as victims ? No that wouldn't happen, and that says a lot doesn't it ! The message it gives to armed forces serving in war zones in todays conflicts, does NOT need explaining

The style of the film ( as other reviewers have pointed out ) is oddly out of period, as if the director had been influenced by spaghetti westerns. The main characters are portrayed in a crass 2d way, and there are long sections of 'padding' between the scenes of human degradation, and brutal murder.

3 February 2010,"Apart from some solid performances, this is an overlong and self-indulgent experience for me.","Pitt plays his character as a supposed broad comic caricature but I find the character deeply annoying and unfunny. Waltz is very good as a Nazi and a small cameo from a almost unrecognisable Meyers is surprisingly good, if only the makeup didn't give him away. Fassbender too is very good in quite a small role.

There is a nihilistic pleasure to be had from killing Nazis but the pacing in this film is off. First chapter starts well, then by the third it feels like filler then the rest just feels like a period take on the recent Ocean's Eleven films. This film is very dialogue heavy, and while this is historical fiction, some dialogue feels very anachronistic. The whole things feels overlong, self-indulgent and even quite petulant(e.g. the notes that pop up on screen with a big arrow pointing to someone of importance).

The cinematography is quite pretty in places, but I never really feel as if it's the Forties.

The score would be perfect for a western or a seventies exploitation film but here feels unfitting and too bombastic. It takes me out of the period the film is supposed to be set.

Overall: a very frustrating experience for me as the premise has so much promise but the result is too busy boasting the usual Tarantino touches that it misses something vital: heart. Sure, it may mostly look 'cool' but I didn't like any of the protagonists enough to care.",

20 September 2009,Tarantino's Glorious Return,"Once again we witness a masterpiece crafted from the hands of Quentin Tarantino. 'Inglorius Basterds' strikes us with an original script, superb directing and creative blood spilling scenes. This movie is a 'must watch' regardless of the very graphic bloody scenes common in the Tarantino cinema.

*WARNING* - If you don't like Tarantino films stay away from this one, because this is Quentin at his best. You won't hear such a bald statement as 'this is the new Pulp Fiction' but entertainment, intrigue and 'black humor' is guaranteed.

Not the best of acting by Brad Pitt by he sure does a good job and he definitely achieves Tarantino's expectations. Loyal to his cinema, Quentin shows some songs used in the Score of Kill Bill vol.1/2 and similar western music like 'From Dusk 'till Dawn'.

12 February 2010,Let my people go,"Another juvenile revenge fantasy brought to you by the master of the genre. Mr. Tarantino knows his demographic well, and he plays to it expertly here. Just as Ronald Reagan was directly responsible for the ""dumbing down"" of American political discourse, so too has QT taken on the responsibility for the dumbing down of American cinema.

Brad Pitt provides some unintentional laughs in the lead role of Lt. Aldo Raine. His hill-country accent is never believable. A descendant of American Indians, Raine is of course, the right man for the job. Especially the part about taking Nazi scalps. Ah, QT. You are certainly an equal opportunity offender.

Which brings to mind how uneasy I am about Mr. Tarantino taking on the mantle of filmmaker as fantasy avenger for the Jewish people. The holocaust and Nazi atrocities are not exactly the most apt sources for a farce such as this. I'm reminded of Roberto Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful,"" another misguided attempt at mining humor from a situation that was an abject nightmare for any and all of its unfortunate participants.

There are one or two set pieces that demonstrate Mr. Tarantino's skill at developing a well-realized scene. But overall, the effect is mind-numbingly sensational, and then, quickly forgettable. The movie is like a bad dream, whose bits and pieces you're unable to reconstruct into a cohesive whole. My greatest fear is that this piece of revisionist history will be remembered by its legion of youthful Tarantino enthusiasts as the way things actually went down. Thanks for nothing, QT.",5
28 August 2009,Not Quentin Tarantino at his best.,"Our story begins in World War 2, where Lt. Aldo Raine(Brad Pitt), puts a group a Jewish soldiers together, who are called Inglourious Basterds, there mission is to hunt and scalp Nazis at all cost. They have a plan to into Germany. But another story comes into play with Shosanna(Melanie Laurent) a Jew disguised as a french, who escaped the Nazis years earlier, in which her family was slaughtered by the Nazis. Who now runs a movie theater, and is ploting her own revenge.

Now Pulp Fiction(1994), and Kill Bill vol 1 and 2(2003-2004) are what I considered to be masterpieces. But Inglourious Basterds is not in that category, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Most of the character don't really grab any interest, Tarantino does not across with interesting dialog with any of the characters, except in the beginning, but it goes away after that. And Eli Roth is clearly no actor, he just doesn't do much. And Brad Pitt wears himself out fast. Now it did have some good shoot out scenes. And it also had a great setting. But after it got to be boring, where one scene, i nearly dosed off. But I did like Melanie Laurent, who becomes the only interest through out the whole film. Not Tarantinos best work, but not his worst, but it could have been better.",7

Is it than at least entertaining? Not at all ... boring and annoying. Or should these quasi-Jewish bastards be funny? What a pity! What an insult to the real Jewish fighters against the Nazis!

7 July 2012,Major surprise,"I am normally the first to slam revisionist history and did not go to see this on cinema release.

It came onto television recently and having nothing better to do, and there being not much else on, gave it a whirl. Well blow me down,I really enjoyed it, and had to go away and think why I did so, when the plot is overall quite preposterous. And I think that is the key to the movie, it is sheer over the top nonsense so that it actually transcends revisionist history and becomes a piece of entertainment.

There is some stuff in there though that isn't much known that is real history. Both Goebbels and Hitler were huge movie fans and indeed Goebbels produced a version of Titanic that is quite extraordinary in its propaganda but is regarded as the first effort to seriously make a movie about the tragedy (Google Nazi Titanic). It can be bought and I have a copy but it can now be downloaded from You Tube. Goebbels production makes his one just as ridiculous as I.B. which adds to the irony.

I found it hard not to watch this movie without a grin on my face because it is very well acted (actually overacted) and so clichéd (deliberately) that it does not really take itself seriously, and you can see that. Brad Pitt is having a ball. But it was the performance of Cristoph Waltz that really blew me away. How good was he? The perfect blend of Nazi evil with a touch of vaudeville thrown in.

Recommended.

This movie is completely over the top which is why it works. It does not want to try and rewrite history like the goddam awful Abraham Lincoln:Vampire Killer which takes itself all to seriously.",8
11 December 2009,I Must Have Missed A Meeting,"I guess I must have missed a meeting. I fail to see how a boring, badly edited mess that goes on way too long and has a centre more boggy than the pitch at Turf Moor has been lauded with praise.

Sure - Quentin has great technical control and the film features some fine acting in places but it's no excuse for a total lack of narrative drive.

In old Hollywood, he would have been told to cut the film by an hour and get on with the story but sadly length and spectacle now appear to be equated with great films.

On the whole I would rather have been watching ""Who Dares Wins"" for a laugh.

11 January 2016,Such a pleasure watching Nazis being killed!,"Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt): ""Nazi ain't got no humanity. They're the foot soldiers of a Jew hunting, mass murdering maniac, and they need to be destroyed. That's why any and every son of a b---- we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're gonna die"".

Such a pleasure watching Nazis being killed! Tarantino uses his art for doing what history couldn't do: to kill the f------- Nazis.

Inglourious Basterds is a masterpiece. The film is bloody violent (violence which is so characteristic from Tarantino it ends out being funny), but a bit of justice does not hurt, does it? Let's cheer for every f----- German & Austrian Nazi shot and dead!

The beginning of the movie is spectacular. The dialog between Christoph Waltz and the French farmer, brilliantly performed by Denis Ménochet, is awesome. The dialog lasts for 12 minutes (it starts at 6'50"" and ends at 18'50""). Tarantino worked on the script of Inglorious Basterds for 10 years. The music of the film is amazing and includes works by Ennio Morricone and a song by David Bowie.

The casting, like in all Tarantino movies, is breathtaking. Waltz surprises us speaking 4 languages, Brad Pitt glows in his role of Aldo, Fassbender appears irresistible in his role as a British spy cinema critic disguised as an SS officer. Mélanie Laurent plays well enough the role of Shosanna, Daniel Brühl appears both nice and macabre, Diane Kruger is the perfect diva (her German is exquisite), and August Diehl appears impeccable in his role of a Gestapo pig. One of my favourite basterd is Hugo Stiglitz, performed by Til Schweiger (a German actor who always refused to wear a Nazi uniform in a movie, but he accepted it in Inglorious Basterds because there he was given the privilege of killing Nazis).

Inglourious Basterds is the last Tarantino movie edited by Sally Menke, who was the editor of all Tarantino's movies from Reservoir Dogs (1992) (she died in 2010).

Inglourious Basterds got 8 Academy Award Nominations (Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Achievement in Directing, Best Writing, Original Screenplay, Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Achievement in Cinematography, Best Achievement in Film Editing, Best Achievement in Sound Mixing, and Best Achievement in Sound Editing), and won one Oscar (Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role: Christoph Waltz).

Just as Saul fia is the best movie about the Holocaust that I've ever seen (it is terribly real, breathtaking and depressing), Inglourious Basterds is the great antidote to all the sadness, pain and anger that one feels when reading about the Holocaust and watching WWII movies. A pleasure for the eye, the ear, the mind and the heart. Tarantino makes justice to the horrible history of humankind. A cool, funny, brutal and surprising film.

Fun facts: Samuel L. Jackson is the narrator, Tarantino appears twice as a cameo (he is the first scalped Nazi and an American soldier in 'Pride of Nation'), and the OSS American commander who talks to Waltz on the phone at the end of the movie is Harvey Keitel. These performances are uncredited.

In Germany all the swastikas had to be removed or hidden from all movie posters, since Nazi symbols are banned by law in Germany (except for historical documents).

The best: the dialog between Waltz and Méchonet, the names that Brad Pitt gives the German Nazis, Hitler asking for a chewing gum, Fassbender's irresistible smile, the music, the script, Tarantino's style, and the dirty Nazis burning in flames.

The worst: the bad French actress at the tavern, some cuts, and some anachronisms.",10
29 July 2010,Awful,"This was probably the worst film I saw in a couple of years. Pointless violence and a complete lack of an history (believable or not).

In 1941 a Jewish teenager girl escapes from death at the hands of the Nazis. In 1944-45 she is the owner of a theater in Paris. And she's grown up. Around 25-30.

It's like if QT isn't aware of time. Or the time WWII lasted from the invasion of Poland to the surrender of Japan. He doesn't, but there are people that know. If he wants to make some sort of what if historic film better do it with something that wasn't so dramatic and involved so many suffering and death.

A film where people laugh at every shot like if they were a moronic audience in the US in the present??.

An African as a projectionist in Paris under Nazi rule (???).

He probably arrived Paris after Senegal independence. Oh wait, Senegal was only independent a lot later.

This supposed director does not even know that seeing an African on Europe before the 60's was a rarity. Unlike the US there were almost no Africans in Europe before the fall of colonial regimes.

If this is what he does better, I suggest he just stops and spare us the excruciating pain that is to spend money and time on a piece of garbage like this. The plot is for morons, the acting is below anything I've ever seen in ""first class"" movies"". The photography is completely average. This film is a pointless exercise and waste of time. It will go down in cinema history as the most overrated piece of trash ever to be made.

I'm absolutely amazed to see this film in the top 250. What kind of public looks at this miserable movie and thinks it's the best thing they ever saw? Teens that saw two movies?

Absolutely disgusting.",1
27 August 2009,"It's not for everyone, but it's QT in his finest hour.","No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz! He has won just about every award for his performance in this film, and he deserves every single one of them. Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo!

28 May 2010,Yakkety Yak Yak Yak,"I saw the trailer and thought this movie would be fun. I knew I was in trouble at the opening scene where the visiting Nazi has a long chat with the farmer. I'd say 90% of this movie is long irrelevant chats in restaurants and other rooms. I mean who cares? This was advertised as a fun action-packed war movie about crazy guys that kill Nazis. Instead you get a snooze fest.

Every now and then I'd think ""OK now we're going to get to the good stuff. He's been torturing us so we'll really enjoy the good stuff"". But you know what? There was no good stuff. Sure there was a few war porn moments, but nothing that got me really engaged in the flick.

Gratuitous violence is part of a Tarantino movie experience. So I was not surprised to see it. But somehow it just seemed adolescent. It added nothing to the story. The military does have a command structure and they don't let their soldiers carve people up like a Thanksgiving goose for fun. This was the 2nd World War where the Allies were actually good guys.

I must admit after seeing numerous Hitler parodies on YouTube I'm rather spoiled. Every actor that plays Hitler must measure up to the YouTube parody version. This one does not.

And the ending - f'ing retarded. Like a frustrated cinema owner could bring down the entire Third Reich. The thing is so full of holes you'd think the Nazis were complete amateurs that couldn't guard an outhouse.",4
16 July 2019,"Brilliant film, Highly misinterpreted.","Over the course of the release of this film I have noticed many people labelling it ""a mockery of the real tragic events"", which I feel is extremely blunt, heres why.. It's not trying to be real.

the reason I dislike platoon is because its attempting to feel real, whilst over-exaggerating the killing of innocent Vietnamese citizens, if you really want to know a great example of the events of Vietnam made comical just to the appropriate level to stay immersive, look no further than Forrest Gump.

Inglorious Basterds is comical, it manages to stay plausible and tragic, and that is one of the many reason this film is so brilliant, Not regarding the freakishly hypnotic camerawork, incredible performance from all sides of the spectrum and brilliant direction.

If you really want an authentic war experience, exploring the ins and outs of this horrific war, don't become angry at this film. I mean it's a Tarantino film for christ's Sake.

7 February 2011,Rotten movie,"I'm glad I didn't pay to see this trash in a theater. The only ""inglorious bastards"" are the writers and producers of this film. The sadistic Brad Pitt character was a slap in the face to every ""Greatest Generation"" American that served honorably during the war and to every Native American on the planet. The plot was so full of holes, I'm surprised my television wasn't dripping disgusting liquids all over the floor. TWO GUARDS IN THE WHOLE THEATER PROTECTING THE TOP FOUR Nazis OF THE THIRD Reich?!?!?! SEDAGIVE?!?! The only decent uniformed character in the entire film was the German soldier that was beaten to death with a bat. The only bright spot I saw was the acting of Laurent and Walsch. It was their great misfortune to have participated in this dreadful experience.

23 August 2009,An incohesive film made by an inconsistent basterd.,"In the 1st 10 minutes of the films, Tarantino used about 10 different fonts for various on screen titles. Might not seem like a big deal to most folks, but it is an early example of the films' sloppy inconsistency. QT has always liked to mix genres, most successfully in the Kill Bill films, and I'm fine with that. But here, his A.D.D.-enabled multi-style style is at its most random and really doesn't work for what this film could've been. (I considered offering a list of all the inconsistencies, but my reviews are generally too long anyway.) What I had hoped for, and what the trailer seemed to promise, was a Dirty Dozen homage, where a team of badass characters are assembled with the mission of killing Nazis. Generally, in that type of group mission film (Dirty Dozen, Oceans 11, The Seven Samurai or even QT's own Reservoir Dogs), you'd get to know a bit about each of the members of the team, building some kind of relationship between the various characters and the audience. But QT doesn't take the time to do that. We never really get to know any of the people in the film. Instead, he spends a few slow 20 minute sections in ways that don't enhance our relationships with the characters, the story or the film overall.

So what's good? 1. The film does offer some fantastically funny and quirky performances. Brad Pitt is hilarious, and the film's main villain SS Col. Landa, played by Christoph Waltz, is as funny as he is batshit crazy evil. Pretty much all of the supporting cast, with the exception perhaps of 1 or 2 of the 'Basterds', are also noteworthy. 2. No one knows how to use music in films better than Q. 3. A bunch of Jews kick a whole bunch of Nazi butt in some particularly gratifying (and gruesomely violent) ways.

Final say? Disappointing, but worth seeing. Not for the kids or for people who don't like seeing Nazis die.",6
28 April 2010,I really cant get Tarantino,"I was one of many of those who thought Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs brilliant and intellectual even though the violence was over the top.

However I really cant get Tarantino anymore. Were as those two movies were witty and full of fun dialogue his works after, including Kill Bill, Bulletproof and yes Inglorious Bastards is nothing but senseless action movies with little worthwhile dialogue and intrigue and way too much senseless violence.

It gave me the same feeling as I watched the new Star Wars movies. Did really the same person make this and that? Did really the same person make Reservoir Dogs and this pile of crap?

4 January 2016,You Know What? This Just Might Be Quentin Tarantino's Masterpiece!,"The sixth film by Quentin Tarantino finds the esteemed filmmaker in sublime form as he blends the genres of war & spaghetti western into one stylish, violent & vengeful cinematic delight that brims with Tarantino's patented wordplay, fascinating characters, uninhibited violence, outstanding cast & excellent performances to deliver a thrilling ride that enthrals, entertains & satisfies on all levels, and keeps getting better with every subsequent viewing.

Set in Nazi-occupied France, Inglourious Basterds intercuts two story lines. First concerns a young Jewish girl who, after witnessing her family being killed by an SS officer, plots her revenge several years later when a German war film is arranged to premiere at her theatre. The second plot follows a team of Jewish-American soldiers who plan to assassinate all the Nazi leaders attending the film premiere. The two plots of revenge eventually coincide as the story nears its conclusion.

Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, Inglourious Basterds is told in five chapters and features the best opening scene of any Tarantino movie to date. The first twenty minutes is a pure exercise in unabridged, patient & flawless filmmaking for the director allows the dialogue-heavy segment to instil an unnerving ambiance on its own and keeps a firm check on the pace & camera movements. It also introduces us to the villain in grand style and by the time the first chapter ends, we know all there is to know about Hans Landa & his cunning tactics.

Tarantino's direction is terrific while his screenplay is a gem in itself. Adding enough meat on every character's bone, he manages to carve out many suspenseful moments from the most unexpected corners and while his usual elements, such as pop culture references, dark humour, blood-soaked violence are in tact, the writer-director also removes the veil of hypocrisy to show that all humans, regardless of their labels, are capable of intense cruelty. Also, by setting his narrative in a fictional alternate history, he frees himself from following the fact formula and plays as per his wishes.

The technical aspects are fabulously carried out, each adding something to the movie. Production design team does a really fine job in setting up the World War II iconography, albeit with little dose of western landscape. Cinematography gives its images a sumptuous look n feel, while exquisitely moving the camera around to capture the drama in splendid detail. Editing is expertly carried out & its 152 minutes of runtime is consistently paced. And as always, Tarantino manages to put together an amazing soundtrack, comprising of wonderful tracks that seamlessly integrates with the scenes and effortlessly uplift the whole experience.

Coming to the performances, Inglourious Basterds features a stellar cast in Brad Pitt, Christopher Waltz, Mélanie Laurent, Diane Kruger, Michael Fassbender, Eli Roth, Daniel Brühl & others, and all of them are fabulous in their given roles. Pitt plays a character that belongs to his comfort zone & does well with what he's given. Fassbender is present in just one chapter yet manages to leave his mark. Kruger & Brühl balance their act really well, Roth gets to play the coolest basterd of them all as that skull bashing scene had all the build-up elements of a spaghetti western Mexican standoff. However, the best performances come from Waltz & Laurent.

Making a lasting impression right within the opening segment, Waltz brings this ingeniously written character to life as per the exact demands of the screenplay and delivers an absolutely impeccable performance that easily goes down as one of decade's best. The character of Hans Landa is one of Tarantino's finest creations and Waltz only gets better in that role as the story progresses. Without Waltz's contribution, Inglourious Basterds amounts to pretty much nothing plus it's a rare instance of perfect actor-character marriage. Laurent is another revelation and plays her part with stunning finesse plus and just like Waltz, her input is devoid of any faults.

On an overall scale, Inglourious Basterds is another original, sophisticated & downright captivating extravaganza from Quentin Tarantino that, like few of his earlier flicks, requires a little getting used to. Jam-packed with vibrant flavours & accomplished in nearly every filmmaking aspect, the movie brilliantly exhibits just how far this master storyteller has come over the years in tightening his grip around his craft. One of the best films of its year and certainly amongst the finest from Tarantino's filmography, Inglourious Basterds is a slow burner but it has all the ingredients of an instant classic and considering numerous other positives, I think this just might be his masterpiece.",
2 December 2009,Very very very very boring,"This is the worst film I've seen so far Tarantino. The film is much too long and the story is far from convincing.

This is particularly unfortunate that there are many good actors and actresses. When you go see a Tarantino movie is expected to more than most regular movie.

This is not even a good movie to rent. And even less to see the theater. And forget to make a gift unless it is your enemy.

The film is extremely disappointing. It continues to expect that there's something interesting. And this expectation turns quickly to boredom.

If the intention was to make a film of black humor and / or a funny movie, it completely missed.

A film to avoid at all costs. Even if you're a big fan of Tarantino.",2
21 August 2009,Inglorious Disappointment,"Of all the films slated for release this year, this is the one I was waiting for. Tarantino is unique in that he can borrow from so many genres and directorial styles, has an incredible ear for scoring his films, and of course can write dialog like almost no other. Much of this is true with Inglourious Basterds, and yet it just doesn't fit together like it has in past efforts. The magic is not there. The film has, what I feel, are three incredible scenes including the brilliant and nerve wracking opening sequence. One scene, in a restaurant, is as if Tarantino channels a very restrained Bunuel. The other, though a bit long, in a basement bar works for the most part and introduces an important character and some crucial plot development. It builds slowly to something important so its length is forgivable. None of these scenes, I hesitate to add, involve Brad Pitt. Mr. Pitt is a fine actor, but he is just a bit too much this side of parody here. Many of the other scenes are little more than filler. I can appreciate Tarantino's humour very much. I laughed hysterically through much of Kill Bill Vol. 1. It was riveting, compelling, and fun. Inglorious Basterds tries to be these things but somehow misses the mark. 6/10.",6
27 April 2023,"Silly, pointless, and only if you plan to study to be a surgeon","As it always happens with Tarantino's movies, this one is again silly, pointless, and again pointlessly bloody

If you want to be a surgeon you may actually learn a thing or two about blood, killings, etc. Otherwise, you will just question yourself the point of so much realism.

The story is just silly, surreal, and overall dumb. The acting is overall great especially Diane Kruger. As for Brad Pitt trying to sound like a hick, simply no.

Overall, a movie for a saturday evening and nothing more.

10 October 2009,Inglourious Tarantino..,"Typical Tarantino. A passable film which everybody hails as a masterpiece. But it isn't. The multi-narrative storyline starts out boring but turns out OK, and the ending is tense, with Tarantino borrowing from the cult kitsch B-movie to good effect. On the other hand, I wish Hollywood would stop dealing with the Nazis and the Holocaust. Enough is enough is enough! We know it happened, quadrillions other genocides happened throughout history too, without Hollywood making a billion films about them - akin to the effect of a brainwash. The stylized violence I also find unattractive. It's highly unrealistic and tends to make it look appealing, when in reality violence is the exact opposite.

23 July 2011,Silly Violence,"This is a silly, violent, unhistorical fantasy. I guess it must make sense to someone who still hates the Nazis so much that they revel in seeing them brutalized, killed, and dismembered. Never mind that nothing in it is remotely similar on any level to anything that actually happened in World War II.

I am sitting here trying to imagine what motivated this creation and how it made it to production. Are there Jewish persons among us that need to see something like this? Possibly, but they can't be prevalent. Are there young people who might be duped into thinking this is historical? Why would anyone do that? Why would someone want them to believe the war ended like this instead of the arguably more dramatic way that it actually did end? Was this just a bizarre excuse to make a graphically violent film that an oddly disturbed new audience might be willing to pay money to see?

I never got the SAW movies either. Yet, I have heard young people praising them and eagerly comparing notes. Is this another film for that crowd? Is it just another violent blood fest masquerading as art? Don't bother answering. If you think this film has merit, you have already lost my attention.",1
14 November 2022,Highly predictable but entertaining,"If anyone is a master of making a formula movie, it has to be Tarantino. The formula = An emotionally intense opening sequence/ first act + Nicely build up a scene, and then kill off everyone + Gore + Cartoonish CGI + Lots of tomato ketchup + Excessive use of the N-word . . . Oh, and, + A beautiful lady's feet :D

Christoph Waltz is terrifying as a Nazi officer and has done a great job intensifying the opening sequence. The coldness in his eyes! Amazing performance.

Brad Pitt plays Brad Pitt. He leads an American team in killing off Nazis.

I loved Fassbender's role as well, and he's such a charm. He plays a British movie reviewer and writer who does not really like violence. The tavern sequence is also great and keeps the tension high.

The thing is, I am not a fan of Tarantino's formula, especially the mindless killing, making almost all the characters dispensable. And in the end whole film appears to be a survival game - whoever survives will be crowned the protagonist.

Since I like war films and Nazi - Allies portrayal, Inglourious Basterds gets a pass.",7
8 August 2009,Inglourious Basterds Review from Melbourne Film Festival,"Last night I caught a screening of Inglourious Basterds as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival. Before the movie even begun, I'll say that there was a great atmosphere by being surrounded by two cinemas filled exclusively with excited Tarantino fans. A film like this is always going to be much more enjoyable if you're watching it together with like-minded individuals.

So as the trailers show, the film is basically a spaghetti western set in Nazi-occupied France from 1941-1944. The trailers would also have you believe that this is Brad Pitt's movie and that he and his Basterds are the stars of the show. However, the Basterds themselves are only one of many parts that make up the story, as there is a very large ensemble cast that all have different narratives, only linking up towards the end of the film.

One of the highlights of this film for me was Christoph Waltz as the sadistic Nazi Jew Hunter Hans Landa. You can really see why he was rewarded with a Best Actor Award at Cannes for his effort here, as he truly dominates the film. The first scene of the movie in particular, where he slowly interrogates a Jewish family to find if they are hiding anybody or anything, is truly thrilling, suspenseful and possibly my favorite part of the movie.

Violence is used sparingly, but effectively. Some of it is jarringly realistic (yes, there is some scalping) but most of it is done in a darkly humorous way. There is also a great shootout scene that is so fast and choreographed so well that it is a real blast to watch. It's not Tarantino's most violent film, in fact it would probably be one of his tamer movies, but you've got to remember who we're talking about here. When things do get bloody, it makes for a bloody great time at the movies.

Unfortunately, some things don't work out quite as well. The main thing that bothered me is that the cast is so large, that it feels like we don't get to know the characters as well as what we would like. The film is split up into five different chapters, and these chapters are generally made up a scene of lengthy dialogue that eventually leads towards a vicious conclusion. While this is enjoyable to sit through and it feels as though the dialogue is always taking us towards a relevant ending, it also makes us feel as though we have only really sat through 5 scenes and then the movie is over. In fact, despite the two and a half hour running time, I could have been happy if this movie went for an extra hour or more. Even if he split it into two films or made it into a miniseries it might have been more satisfying.

The ending was good, but a little underwhelming. This didn't leave me with the same emotional high as the ending of something like Reservoir Dogs. In fact, when the credits came up I just felt a little disappointed that it had finished so soon. However, if two and half hours go by that fast, with your eyes glued to the screen the whole time, I guess you can't complain too much. I suppose I was just hoping for a little more of an exclamation mark in the movies final moments.

The music is always a very important part of a Tarantino movie, and in Inglourious Basterds I felt it was a bit of a mixed bag. Some of it was sublimely awesome, such as David Bowie's Cat People, while some of it felt a little autopilot. For example, some of the music that Tarantino uses he has also used in his Kill Bill films. I know that the music is not original to those films to begin with, but hearing it again so recently from another film from the same director, I found it a little distracting. Then again, that might just be because I have seen the Kill Bill films so many times that I now find the music attached to those scenes. If I watch Inglourious Basterds a few more times then perhaps my opinion might change.

All in all, it was a great movie, but it wasn't up there with Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction. Still, if you are looking forward to seeing this I don't think that you will be disappointed. This is truly an event film and something that will work at its best on a big screen with a big audience. I'm already excited about seeing it for a second time.",8

24 June 2021,8.6/10 - A Stunning Film,"My second Tarantino Movie! :)

Inglorious Basterds (yes, it's written that way on purpose) is a 2009 film by Quentin Tarantino. The film follows the Basterds, a special unit of American Jewish soldiers who basically hunts down Nazis, and Shoshanna - a Jewish woman whose family was killed by the Nazis in France during ww2.

This film is really sharp and well made, and you can certainly feel it throughout the film - from the amazing cinematography to the amazing acting of the main cast, from the awesome. Thrilling tension-building moments to the very-on-point soundtrack. Christoph Waltz and Brad Pitt are both killin it on this film, and the way that this movie got me to the edge of my sit is truly remarkable.

However! With all that being said, the film has two tiny problems.

1. The pacing feels a bit off from time to time, especially during A German Night in Paris.

2. Most of the characters are pretty simple and not so deep.

Now, don't get me wrong - I like this movie a lot, and I thought that it was a really fun film to watch (went by so quickly, considering the fact that this film is frickin 2.5 hours) . It does have some good emotional moment (provided by Shoshanna, of course), but most of the film we're more interested in the plot and not THAT emotionally inveseted. It doesn't have to be a complicated film, but it does come with its problems.

In conclusion, I find this film extremely enjoyable, and kinda orgasmic on a technical level. It lacks a bit of emotion and interesting characters but it does what it was intended to do very well, generally. Feeling an 8.5/10 on this one.",8
5 October 2009,This is just sick....,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz!

Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo!

All I can say is: ""You see this movie for Christoph Waltz's performance; all the rest is secondary""!",1
25 August 2009,The ultimate cinema basted is back but is it cinema bliss or a total miss?,"It's been a long time coming, sure some might argue that Kill Bill isn't a total mess, but for a lot of people Quentin Tarentino hasn't made a good film since Jackie Brown. Does Inglourious Basterds mark his triumphant return as king or does it just dig his grave deeper? The story takes place in Nazi occupied France and a young Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus witnesses the slaughter of her family by Colonel Hans Landa. Narrowly escaping with her life, she plots her revenge several years later when German war hero Fredrick Zoller quickly takes an interest in her and arranges an illustrious movie premiere at the theatre she now runs. With the promise of every major Nazi officer in attendance, the event catches the attention of the ""Basterds"", a group of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers led by the ruthless Lt. Aldo Raine. As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history.

Let's face it, the first trailer for this was terrible. It looked and sounded like kill Bill the World War II version, and true to formula it is. Oddly enough however that works to the films advantage rather than as a handicap. In Kill Bill the endless homage and references were almost unbearable. Any fan of The Shaw Brothers or Lady Snowblood could see from the second that film started who and what he was ripping off, which wouldn't have been a problem if it had been done well. reservoir Dogs, fantastic movie, total rip off of the movie ""City on Fire"". Why is it so highly touted as one of the best movies of all time? It's because Tarentino knew how to improve on the formula. With Kill Bill he did nothing but homage. Granted Inglorious Basterds isn't a fantastic movie, it's enjoyable, funny and wonderfully acted but in ten years time nobody will be referring to it as a classic. It has a lot going for it, the story is always engaging and takes several highly amusing twists that you don't see coming.

So why doesn't it entirely work? For many of the same reasons Kill Bill didn't work. Tarentino is really smart about knowing what just the right about of good is. He never overdoes it and when it's good it's fantastic. That said the film features some scenes of just monotony, mostly when Eli Roth rears his head but in a movie this well polished the moments of low grade stuff sticks out a mile. Pitt is passable as Lt. Aldo Raine but it's his co star Christoph Waltz WHO BRINGS THE GOOD. He is smart, edgy and most important absolutely hysterical. What it lacks is the texture of felt life; to put it another way, you don't believe a word of it. To fans of ""pure"" cinema this might not matter, because the film creates a world unto itself; it is about technique and spatial understanding, not realism. (The same defence used to be deployed by fans of Brian De Palma). But lacking that human dimension, the QT effect will always come up short. He's a great film encyclopaedist, which is somewhat different from a great film-maker.

QT's bullet-speed banter is back (although without the modern pop references, obviously), firing out a hail of comedy moments, with rat-a-tat regularity. The opening act feels like a spaghetti western, as we're introduced to the film's star man, Nazi officer and ace 'Jew hunter' Landa (Christoph Waltz's scene-stealing moments are brimming with malice and ominous humour), before picking up pace as a war flick with the unleashing of the Basterds, a brutal Dirty Dozen who carve swastikas onto the faces of their foes. The director's signature flourishes – close-ups of female feet, biting barroom banter and the Mexican stand-off – all get a fresh and funny update. The soundtrack's decent, too.

Verdict: Tarentino's back but not quite on top form. This is undoubtedly the best film he has made this decade but something feels out of place whether it be the underuse of the bastards or the stilted first act this is no Pulp Fiction. It is, however, a good film full of, as I like to put it ""F*ck Yeahs"". it will have you hooting and hollering until the final credits roll. The picture contains all the things his fans like about Tarantino -- the wit, the audacity but at the very same time it leaves in everything we don't favour him for. Hopefully next time he can iron out the wrinkles. 3/5.",6

20 August 2009,Not quite,"OK, there's a great joke. One joke, but a great one.

Some Nazis get killed.

Some film gets played.

The SS guy has a great time (He's the lead, I don't know why the trailer makes it look like Brad is.) Lots of riffs on classic shots, and possibly lots of in-jokes in the non-subtitled background dialogue.

Myers is gold.

But to be honest, during the long two and a half hours. Twice I thought ""you could lose a reel here and not miss anything"".

Twice.

These reels are 20 minutes long.

Probably about right.",5
19 May 2016,Let's kill as much Nazis as possible,"How the hell can people rate Inglourious Basterds with the lowest possible score? That is just completely ridiculous. That you don't like the movie I can get but scoring it a one is just infantile behavior. So those reviewers never saw a worse movie then this one? It's just pathetic. I guess they must be right wing Nazis scum and they don't like watching Nazis getting beaten. Well I give it a ten. I thought it was an excellent movie. One that I will watch again in the future, and even more then once. Even if I remember every line in the movie I will watch it again. The dialogues are just sublime. The acting is far above all the crap we are used to watch. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa is just outstanding. Probably the best role he ever played. And even though he plays a mean German Nazi Jew hunter he's still very enjoyable to watch. He should get an Oscar for his acting in Inglorious Basterds. Brad Pitt as Luitenant Aldo Raine is just great fun to watch. I mean what is not fun about watching killing dirty Nazis? It's just hilarious, certainly the conversations they have about killing as much Nazis as possible. The rest of the cast is also very good. Every single character in this movie is top notch. I am a big fan of Quentin Tarantino and with Inglourious Basterd he shows us again that he's one of the best movie makers ever. Great movie!",10

17 September 2009,A Nutshell Review: Inglourious Basterds,"While Quentin Tarantino's love for movies is unquestionable, Inglourious Basterds tops his previous efforts in genre revolution, tossing a whole of of ingredients together and mixing them up, and you'll be put into a mental dizzy just keeping track of the numerous odes, homages, and pure love for the cinema that Tarantino included in this film, a misnomer most definitely that this is anything but a WWII movie about a group of US-Jewish guerrilla soldiers inserted into enemy territory to strike fear through their inhumane ways of exterminating Hitler's army.

Told in chapters (which I felt could actually stand alone as short films) and running some 153 minutes, Inglourious Basterds isn't your father's war movie, where it's flat out action from end to end. In true Tarantino fashion, you've got to brace yourself for a lot, and I mean a whole lot of dialogues and conversations as only how Tarantino knows to craft in an engrossing, engaging fashion. While the violence and F-bombs have been considerably toned down, the way the characters interact, from egoistical monologues to a pair of lovebirds realizing their calling, from intense conversations to foolhardy game play around a table, are pure gold, with such talky scenes getting milked dry, before mayhem got unleashed akin to pressing the reset button, only to have the next chapter repeat itself stylistically all over again. I continue to stand amazed at how Tarantino fashions and crafts his dialogues.

If you're geared up for some rowdy action as the trailer made it out to be, then you'll be disappointed outright, since you don't really get to see the Basterds in action all the time, especially after that rousing speech by Lt Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) outlining the Basterds' mission, with the narrative fast-forwarding many years to the tail-end of the war. Not that I didn't mind of course, as there are a lot more going for the film, than a straight-out action whack fest, knowing Tarantino being at the helm.

And in Tarantino-verse, the chapters here are designed with a lot of precision, despite having a lot going for it. I especially enjoyed the opening, quite unconventional in a way, but what an introduction to the villain, played in such low key terms as it built up toward quiet revelation. The gem of the film is undoubtedly Christoph Waltz's chilling performance as Col. Hans Landa, aka The Jew Hunter, earning a reputation of always getting his man through extremely convincing techniques of interviews, interrogation and negotiations. Tarantino has crafted a highly complex villain, and I dare say the best amongst his stories thus far, who's always full of surprises for his enemies. A cunning linguist as well, he's tremendously gentlemanly in his demeanour, never betraying the sick and ruthless core hidden behind that shiny medal-filled uniform. Waltz is definitely worthy of all accolades coming his way by virtue of his sterling performance here.

The other scene which worked magically, was that in a tavern, where Lt Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender) and Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger) meet up with double agent actress Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) to discuss plans for Operation Kino, only to be constantly interrupted by Major Dieter Hellstrom (August Diehl). What transpired is something that bordered on the hilarious, yet constantly teething on knife's edge given our heroes' bluff on the verge of being exposed. And with two Mexican stand offs done in Tarantino style, what more can you ask for as it continued being played out with pure glee.

The story arc of Shosanna Dreyfus may run typical of a revenge flick, where the victim swears vengeance over her once German hunter, but thanks to Melanie Laurent's luminous presence as Shosanna, it got elevated to a lot more as she held her own, allowing you to sympathize with her plight and steely resolve in her mission. This arc is also one of the most beautifully shot (especially the scenes in the movie theatre), having importance as the melting pot primed for regime change. Filled at every moment with nuggets of cinema information that only Tarantino can weave together in an engaging fashion, it even features a movie-in- movie directed by Eli Roth, who had also donned his acting hat as one of the Basterds.

Tarantino continues to leave his indelible mark on modern cinema, and like the final, permanent branding, this film has certainly served to be the masterpiece reflective of what he does best. Definitely worth repeated viewings just to lap up all the gems you've missed the first time round.",8

30 December 2009,It's good and bad in almost equal measure,"So you know what it's about. Here's a review you can read in about the same time it takes to play a game of who's who.

Firstly there are some wonderfully iconic scenes, such as the 'basement stand-off', and one highly effective performance in Waltz's Nazi detective, Hans Landa, which give Inglorius a rewatchability.

Praise must also be encouraged for the direction of languages, which lend the movie priceless creditability, along with a great deal of its appeal.

Sadly, as has been mentioned elsewhere at length, Mike Myers' cameo is without purpose and merely distracting, as is Brad Pitt's redneck accent.

Perhaps the biggest flaw of the movie, though, is Tarintino's continued obsession with segmenting movies unnecessarily, along with adding titles, and back stories related by voice-overs. These disrupt, not just the flow of the movie (any movie), but also the 'feel' of it. For example, all the cat and mouse tension and emotional intensity of the intro, is undone at the moment when Quinten reaches for the titles board.

The ending was a little flat for me also, and somehow unsatisfying. This typifies the mood of the film, which wavers uncertainly between being a serious war movie and a knowing pantomime.

You finished that game yet?",4
6 August 2019,Bunch of Nazi Sympathizers in these reviews,"Watched this again for the first time in since maybe I saw it in the theater. First off, Christoph Waltz gives the performance of a lifetime, and beyond deserving of the academy award. Secondly, the pacing and dialogue are some of Tarantino's finest. And finally to all the negative 1 star reviews that talk about the excessive violence in the film against the Nazis, go F yourselves. Pick up a f'ing history book, watch a documentary, or whatever you have to do do to realize the people that perpetrated these crimes against humanity were vile human beings. They deserve no respect in this movie or any other.

7 February 2011,Atrocious,"I am sorry, but this is simply an awful movie. The only good thing about this movie is Waltz and even he is unable to waltz this movie into at least a mediocrity. I don't understand the desire to create something that did not exist. Jewish resistance to German rule was not abundant or organized, but it was not as insufficient to force movie-makers into making these cartoons; Hollywood finds itself into a familiar territory yet again: rewriting history for future generations. Over 100 Heros of the Soviet Union (the highest medal given to soviet soldier during war, usually after death in action) were Jews. Why not make a movie about any one of them? What the hell was this? And you take THIS to Cannes?

If anyone likes World War Two movies and appreciates historic validity of cinema, do watch the 2010 Russian Movie ""Brest Fortress"" (Брестская крепость, both dubbed and subtitled versions exist). The main character of the movie and one of the Fortress defenders was also Jewish.",1

21 August 2009,Tarantino in top form with brilliant WWII anti-Nazi salute that dares you to look away...,"Quentin Tarantino has taken his anti-Nazi fantasy to new heights with this engrossing dark comedy/fantasy that has ""The Basterds"" (led by BRAD PITT) out for Nazi scalps to add to an ever growing collection. But first and foremost, he has constructed a screenplay that never lets up veering between tension and laughter, and gives several members of his cast a chance at Oscar-winning performances.

Foremost among these is CHRISTOPH WALTZ who waltzes off with all of his scenes by playing the ""Jew Hunter"" with subtle bits of characterization that remind me of a young Conrad Veidt at the height of his powers. He never misses an opportunity to give greater depth to his character's personality quirks and sudden changes of mood that always heighten the tension. The farmhouse scene that starts the story rolling is one of the greatest pieces of sustained suspense I've ever seen any director pull, even Hitchcock.

My only quibble with the film, in fact, would be the extended bar scene in which a clever plot to trap some Nazi officers goes awry. The director could have tightened the whole sequence with a cut of some ten or more minutes.

But who's going to voice complaints when the film is fiendishly clever from start to finish, and so well executed that you leave the theater after being spellbound for the duration of the lengthy story. All of the performances surrounding BRAD PITT and CHRISTOPH WALTZ are pitch perfect and Pitt himself is mighty amusing as the Southern lieutenant who likes to cut Swastikas into the skulls of his German foes.

DENIS MENOCHET is superb as the farmer in the film's opening scene, matching the convincing performance of CHRISTOPH WALTZ every step of the way. Not enough praise can be said for the performances Tarantino has gotten from his entire cast and that includes MELANIE LAURENT who has a key role as the only woman who manages to escape the massacre that opens the film. Her interaction with a German officer (DANIEL BRUHL) who is attracted by her is a fascinating one, especially since she has no intention of succumbing to his courteous flirtations.

This is definitely putting Tarantino's best foot forward--and if it doesn't end up with several Oscar nominations in both acting and technical categories, I'll be very surprised.

Just brilliant.",9
10 April 2018,A very watchable fairy tale,"The script is decent. It is not Tarantino's best. Quite far from it. But it is still watchable. And interesting. Far more watchable and interesting than the latest Rodrigues movies, that seems about right.

It is a fairy tale with WWII as the backdrop. The production team made the actors only resemble enough as to hint at the historical characters. I laughed my rear off reading the uninspired reviews and tantrums. I guess they loved Pulp Fiction for its fine rendition of Jimmy Carter meeting Nikita Khruchev.

22 April 2022,WTH? But in a good way,"A piece of garbage story line for sure, but a fun watch nonetheless. It left me thinking; ""what the hell did I just watch?"" but in a positive, funny way. Is it historically accurate? Hell no. Would it have been fun if it really went down like that? Maybe. It's way less gory than I had expected from a Tarantino movie, but it had it's moments (like scalping a skull, yuck).

I could practically feel Brad Pitt having fun playing his character through the screen and Christoph Waltz was amazing as well.

All in all a fun movie to watch.

7 September 2009,wtf?,"This movie was so bad that after years of using IMDb, I finally registered purely to write this comment.

Crap doesn't begin to describe it.

The most compelling evidence yet as to why Hollywood should be banned from making war movies.

French and German are used as if trying to give some vague impression that Tarantino isn't completely full of ""unchecked ego"" - I would think that paying more attention to the plot and actual history would have been wise if I'd wanted to retain some semblance of accuracy - otherwise, sod it - why not have all characters speak English for the US audience (let's face it, no one else will be watching this)? A bit of escapism is all well and good, but this isn't even that, just purile nonsense. I'm not even that bothered by Hollywood's usual bending/rewriting/falsification of history for it's own ends - we all expect that - American hero, European baddies (at best numpties) - but this wasn't just unresearched childish adventure rubbish, but also cinematically juvenile - no subtlety, no nuance, just clumsy - like someone handed a 12 year old a camera and said, ""Make a film about WWII - let you imagination run wild"".

What is cinema coming to when people rate this rubbish?",1

9 October 2010,"Near perfection, but only in two scenes.","Inglorious Bastards has one of the greatest first acts of any war movie I have ever watched. With a perfect combination of acting, directing and set design, the scene is both unbearably tense yet painfully subtle. By simply changing it to black and white, the entire performance could be slipped right into Shindler's List without any additional modifications. It seemed to be a prelude to what would be perhaps the best war movie to hit theaters in this century. But I was mislead.

As soon as the next 'chapter' began, it became obvious that the rest of the movie would not be able to live up to it's introduction. Going back and forth between excruciatingly dull and unrealistically Hollywood, you have to start to wonder if there were two different production teams making the same movie. It only comes close to reaching the initial level in a later scene that takes place in a pub containing both Germans soldiers and undercover English agents, but even that is slightly distracted by a very brief flashback with an electric guitar overplay.

The actual plot of the film apparently takes place in some bizarre alternate universe where the events that occur are not even close to reality. Perhaps there is some higher artistic goal here, but it is completely lost on me. In addition, the Nazi high command is portrayed so unrealistically, that you can't even hate Hitler because he comes off more like a cartoon character than the leader of the Third Reich.

I do not want to say Inglorious Bastards is not worth seeing, but rather don't expect a serious World War II movie, even after watching the first act.",5
3 July 2010,Inglorious indeed,"I didn't see Inglourious Basterds when it came out first. After the huge hype it received, I did decide to give it a shot, and ordered it on demand. What can I tell you, I was really disappointed. Yes, the movie was fun in some parts, but mostly just boring and superficial. I talked my girlfriend in to watching the movie with me. She felt asleep after the first hour... Can't blame her.

I applaud Tarantinos approach, making a wild west style WW2 movie. The music and certain shots created an interesting ambiance. Very enjoyable was also Christoph Waltz' acting. That said, I don't have more positive things to share about this movie.

The rest was as mentioned very superficial, unrealistic, and in certain scenes just plainly boring. Other reviews have mentioned the ""table talks"". Seriously, there were scenes where I was like ""are you kidding me?"". I felt like a kid, waiting for the grown-ups to finish talking. Of course as a kid I didn't have a remote control with a fast-forward button..

Would I watch this movie again? Absolutely not. Would I recommend it to anybody else? Not really. But seeing the rating it gets here on IMDb, maybe thats just me.... So go ahead, give it a try and make your own judgment. But don't say I didn't warn you.",5
7 July 2009,A Unique Masterpiece from Tarantino,"Every Quentin Tarantino (QT) fan must see Inglorious Basterds, like every QT movie a person's unable to assign one drama, this movie is a perfect blend of war, comedy, action, thriller, drama, and romance. I was unable to take my eyes off of Christopher Waltz's performance as Colon Hans Landa or 'The Jew Hunter.' The story is a masterpiece, but I can tell that this movie, like most QT movies are going to be underrated and will lack in awards it deserves. I think Christopher Waltz should easily be a nominee. I think this movie should also win Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. But even if this incredible film doesn't get recognized in awards I can tell that it will go down as one of the best war movies ever made in history. I think its amazingly creative of QT not to follow the criteria that history gave him, he changes the actual history of the war with his characters. Pure Genius.

12 July 2010,Wow,"I just registered an IMDb account so that I could give this movie 1 star.

I watched it because it was among the top 100 movies of all time, according to IMDb. It was honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is a sheer two and a half hours of torture. There are so many irrelevant scenes that you should just get up and make yourself a sandwich for without pausing the movie, because in the end, nothing that happened prior matters. They tell you the conclusion halfway through, which leads you to think ""wow, it can't possibly be that. they just told me thats whats going to happen."" but low and behold, it happens. If this movie is supposed to be a parody it's a terrible one.

I highly recommend avoiding this movie at all costs.

21 August 2009,Self Indulgent Cocaine Induced Stupor,"I have as many seen all Tarantino's work and loved the majority of it but I have also as many noticed a steady spiral downwards in his work culminating with inglorious bastards. Jackie Brown, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are three films that I could easily watch over and over again while Inglorious Bastards I had trouble sitting through once. It was the first films EVER that I contemplated walking out of. . .this might be due to the fact that I rarely go to the cinema on a whim but Tarantino carried so much credit in my book that I went on the day it opened without reading anything about the work.

It seems to me that no one really has the courage to say what they think...that this movie is something they would expect from a B or even C production! The story line is absolute garbage and all though I sat through the whole 150 minutes of the film I couldn't help but think that Mr Tarantino should stay of Cocaine and maybe watch some classics again before making a movie. Inglorious Bastards is like a WW2 comedy with a Western Twist...I hated it. There is not a single part of the movie which is historical accurate including things like uniforms, weapons etc. which by the end of the movie was the least of my concern. The acting was by in large rubbish...perhaps Brad Pitts worst performance. The only light point in the movie when it comes to acting is the performance of Christoph Waltz in his role of the SS Col. Hans Landa.

All in all there is not much reason to see this film...there a couple of funny moments and several well done gory scenes apart from that tickets for this film should be given away for free.

All of this being said I think that this movie will be well received by the general audience who will most likely praise it for being courageous and what not but the reality is that if this movie was made by someone not famous it would have been labeled as what it is...absolute rubbish.",7
20 February 2010,This is the most overrated movie ever,"This is the most overrated movie I have ever tried to watch. I do not know where those people giving it positive reviews are coming from. Of all my friends only one managed to watch it to the end and even he was not impressed. It is hard to guess what the point of the movie is. It does not teach anything and it does not entertain. As another reviewer said ""The sickening and disgusting depiction of the actions (scalping, etc.) of this renegade group certainly does not help endear viewers to their cause (unless the viewer is either well propagandized or sick in the head)."" Jews are skilfully portrayed as being so repulsive, so I cannot get rid of a feeling that a subtle anti-Semitic message was the real purpose of this movie.

12 January 2022,A superbly entertaining Quentin Tarantino war movie,"Inglourious Basterds delivers everything you would expect from a Quentin Tarantino movie, and then some. All of the directors signature dialouge, style and flair are still present. Not to mention the inherent brutality of the story. The script is very witty aswell. The real highlight of the movie for me was the villain of the picture Hans Landa, played by the great Christoph Waltz. Hans Landa is one of the most charming villains in any movie I have seen. An yet he still manages to be very imposing aswell, as all the best villains are. The rest of the cast is great aswell, and the characters all stand out from each other because of their different personalities and motives. And thhe third-act of the film is just GLORIOUS. Overall, Inglourious Basterds is another gem in Quentin Tarantinos crown.

22 April 2011,An Inside Joke. Perverse and Boring.,"Watching this boring/repulsive film makes you feel as if you're witnessing an inside joke. And that's exactly what it is. With the exception of Christoph Waltz, who deserves a better vehicle for his chilling character and considerable talent, this thing is all about insider actors offering bad impressions/homages of other insider actors/motifs. Agonizingly awkward silences ensue when no one gets the joke, and sudden moments of flying giblet-style gore are what immature Tarantino fans enjoy, apparently. But not the average film audience, nor the smarter ones. Not popcorn-movie lovers. Not action fans, western watchers or WWII buffs. Not me.

But this says something about shifting culture and art. If the most sick, immature work wins this much attention, acclaim and influence, then we are indeed riding our civilization's descent with glee. Just count me out. I can't applaud this cultural failure.

I recently watched the film for the 3rd time and I can confidently say, this film has not lost its touch once you give it a second viewing. I would give an in-depth review but seeing as everyones given it a 1 in the most CHILDISH fashion, I decided to balance the books and just rate it, NOTHING ELSE.

And these haters giving it a rating of 1 probably love watching these annoying over-the-top Marvel films cos it has special effects & all of that green screen stuff and think that it's more ""cinematically"" better than 'Inglorious Basterds'!

26 December 2012,"Imagine ""Allo Allo"" without the silly bits ... Truly awful","Reservoir Dogs was a fine and clever thriller ... When Pulp Fiction came out I was just knocked out by its inventiveness and humour ... Jackie Brown was OK but nothing great even though there were some fine performances ... Kill Bill 1 was absolutely mind bogglingly great :)) ... Kill Bill 2 not so ... Then Mr Ts half of Grindhouse was kind of rally crap actually ... Can't even remember what it was called ... Planet Terror ( the other half of Grindhouse ) was what Mr T should have made, cos it was brilliant Then this ... This thing ... Apparently cost 75 million to make !!!! ... Well at least half a million made it to the screen ... It looks like some cheapo TV production ... The acting !!! ... Well apart from the two women and a couple of minor male supports none of this lot should be allowed in front of a camera again ... Pitt included ... Amateur hour at the Mr Clever factory Tarantino used to write really clever scripts, but there is none of that here ... He nearly gets there in the basement bar, but nowhere near his earlier achievements So please ... Its not violent ... Its not funny ... Its not clever ... How its got such a high vote on here is very suspect ... The fact is its just no good and I would advise anyone who hasn't seen it yet to realise that there was a reason for that ... Its not worth seeing",2
17 June 2020,A warlike fantasy,"Since his first works, Quentin Tarantino has experimented mixing numerous genres. From violent crime in his early works, to exploitation and martial arts cinema later. In 'Inglourious Basterds' we find a film that also handles numerous genres, mainly western and war, with a good dose of suspense and violence, genres perfectly handled by the filmmaker. We have endearing characters and masterfully constructed dialogues by Tarantino. And it is that in this film, the long dialogues predominate, but they are written in such an intelligent way that it is impossible to bore the viewer. Dialogues that scene after scene build a suspense that Tarantino makes simple actions, such as serving milk, totally unbearable and keep you on the edge of the seat. This is, without a doubt, one of the best works in Quentin Tarantino's career. Mixing genres in such a harmonious way and creating a suspense of passage as slow as effective. A film that will be remembered for its great script, unforgettable characters and the classic Quentin Tarantino label.

12 August 2022,Magnificent performance by Christoph Waltz!,"This is the Tarantino Movie of the 2000's no doubt, carried by fictional storyline set in WW2 that can only be hoped to have been real.

The main highlight of the film is not the storyline or Brad Pitt but a magnificent performance by Christoph Waltz who portrays his role and speaks multiple languages flawlessly. How can someone be so talented and underrated at the same time. His performance will make you root for him despite him being the villain.

Storyline and screenplay were as usual very good and Mr Waltz truly deserved the Oscar for his role.

21 August 2009,Fun and entertaining joy film that's done in a unique fashion a real action packed bloody treat!,"I must say that director Quentin Tarantino does it again, as if you've watched his films you know he always makes them entertaining by blending them with humor and action. While going over the top with violence and human blood. Well this 40's era comedy fantasy drama ""Inglourious Basterds"" is no different as it's a film that some may find to long or overstated or drawn out still it's script and story is interesting to hold a viewers thoughts for the entire time.

As one knows Tarantino tells stories in his own unique and assertive ways as here he shows that World War II was won through a combination of luring Germans, to the power of their own cinema which brings them to the prowess of a band of renegade soldiers all supposedly Jews. This band of outcast is lead by Lt. Aldo Raine(Brad Pitt)who's a southern country mountain moonshine hillbilly as one can tell by the twang and draw of his accent. Pitt who gives a good turn is mostly overshadowed though by the supporting cast, especially that of Christoph Waltz who as a villain Col. Hans Landa starts the film off with a direct and cut and dry scene as the ""Jew Hunter"" as he begins his search in Nazi occupied France which is the films setting thru and thru. And well worth the watch and a good treat is Eli Roth as ""Bear Jew"" Sgt. Donny Donowitz who smashes the heads of German soldiers to a bloody pulp.

Now that the battle lines have been drawn the film moves along like chapters from a book as many scenes seem like a game where people whether Jewish or German always seem in trouble. As this moves along with it's over the top blood and gore and a lot of reading German script as it's gross yet fun to see the gang scalp German heads. A clever and interesting plot develops to rid the evil Germans out of France. Enter Bridget a German actress who's an undercover spy played by Diane Kruger who lures a bar scene of good and bad guys to face blood. Yet the most climatic plan after this is when French Jew Shosanna who changes identity after her family is slaughtered and opens a new cinema to plot revenge. As now the Germans have fallen to the trap as they love war cinema only they will literally come to a climactic blowout in her French cinema of paradise or should I say German hell! Overall this is a fun thrill good film that's over the top with blood and unique gore that's funny as many scenes tease the audience. As it was interesting to see Quentin's interesting take on how War War II was won. Clearly always he has fun with history as historic villains like Hitler and Goebbels are played as jokes, and the female leads are interesting by ending up doomed and the performances are strong especially Pitt's southern accent, yet the strongest and most magnetic is Waltz's. So overall really this unique fun alerted history film even though full of propaganda can be classified as glorious work. Clearly count it as a feel good film to see.",8
17 March 2022,Weird in a good way,"My first watch of Inglorious Basterds left me uttering with raised eyebrows. Like all of Tarantino's movies it is really violent. However the style of this movie feels a little different compared to his other movies. It feels like a story is being told but every scene still feels real. I think this is because of amongst other things the oscar worthy acting of Christoph Waltz. I have never seen a stare that intimidating. It is one of my favourite performances in a movie ever. Rivaling that of Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. Overall I didn't really like every scene in the movie especially with the Jewish Americans. It felt out of character to have them with the elegance and intimidating Hans Landa. But is also makes for a nice contrary.

Overall I realise the movie has enough flaws and doesn't deserve a 10/10 but it still is my favourite movie ever.

9/10.",9
3 October 2009,"Trailer so misleading, movie more farce than ""Western"" War flick","The trailer for Inglourious Basterds is misleading, making us believe it is about Brad Pitt's ""basterds"" seriously going Nazi Hunting. But the star clearly is Christoph Waltz, who not only speaks 4 languages brilliantly, but is up for an Oscar in his role as sweet, yet vicious ""Jew hunter"". Would Jews feel happy about this movie of REVENGE? I don't think so. Tarantino said before hand that this, his, movie will be the mother of all war movies. Clearly it is not. As always it is glorifying violence and thinking all conversation between men is amusing. Well.... He should have at least made sure, Pitt doesn't stumble over his own words constantly trying to get the Southern accent right. And why was Churchill (nice one there by Rod Taylor) sitting in a room clearly done in Hitler style fascist architecture? And the Paris cinema was really too much just Babelsberg film studios. And in an Indian newspaper I read that Basterds is spelled wrong because that is how Germans would pronounce it. Another big mistakes, Bastards!

23 January 2010,Not Impressed by Glorious rubbish,"After seeing many Tarantino films and understanding and enjoying much of his darker humour and intellect, I was hugely disappointed in this movie and the way it was presented. Although many of his films are depicted with violence which is graphically portrayed this time seemed a bit out of the ordinary and over the top. Maybe after seeing so many of his films I was wasn't expecting the level of violence as it was portrayed or maybe I'm just tired of seeing the same old thing from him. The film opens up well and cements Christoph Waltz's character beautifully as the Sly, calculating and deadly SS officer, a character the was so well developed that you really hate him and just want some him to get what is deserved. Daniel Brühl also plays his annoying and persistent character well and although you want him to get what he does, you also feel some pity for him. But for the rest, well they just filled the gaps in some very long drawn out scenes that by the next scene you have try and remember what the hell is going on. Story was less about the Inglorious Basterds and their exploits and more about the plight of a young Jewish girl whom escapes from the murderous (Christoph Waltz). So where this title comes from is unknown. Brad Pitt just rolls with the punches and doesn't deliver anything extraordinary. Nice touch to use an old Universal Logo at the beginning and roman numerals under the title like a 1960's war movie. But thats where the similarities end. Tarantinos effort to cross a war drama of old with his own unique style failed in my eyes by using Scalping and other various violence to make it entertaining. Very disappointed in this.",2
15 December 2009,What a glorious ... Abomination,"This is really a movie I'd like to forget very soon. Awful performances, violence with no meaning at all, bud representation of the epoch, characters that aren't even characters but caricatures. Jews that looks like Vikings, Nazis like gangsters, a Hitler like goofy, A terrible mess of a movie. I think that this is one of the worst movies I ever see in my hole life. And Tarantino gave us glorious moments with ""Pulp fiction"" etc. But this was a terrible miscarriage, not even acceptable us a joke of bud quality!! And 8,5 in rating ? That was a real surprise for me. It seems that many people have a terrible taste, or that ratings aren't very reliable any more... If I was in your position, I would watch movies like this only if I was in calaboose!

11 May 2010,Underwhelmed,"I sat down to watch this movie, eagerly anticipating what I thought would be a great film. It certainly isn't a bad film, but I think Tarantino over-reached on this one.

What I Liked: -The Basterds. I really wish the movie had been more about them. -Diane Kruger. She gave an amazing performance. -Christopher Waltz. Deserved his Oscar. -Sound and Cinematography were excellent.

What I Didn't:

-Pacing. For me, the movie was just too slow. Scenes would go on too long, only to blow up into some action that was over in seconds. -Using modern music in a period piece. Took me right out of the movie. Sometimes, I think Tarantino falls so in love with his ideas, he forgets about the movie-goer.

...Inglorious Basterds almost seems like a Pollock painting...the canvas is covered with paint, but what it all means is anyone's guess.",5
1 January 2010,A Particularly Horrible Film,"I can't believe the hype or the IMDb rating this film has received. It is utterly ridiculous from concept to execution. Even the acting is pitiful. The first thing that disappoints me is that the heroes of the film are despicable. Scalping? Come on. I know war is horrible but please, those scenes trivialized the noble efforts of the allies who fought that war. What was Tarantino thinking trying to make the US forces look like savages.

What I liked best about this film is that I thought it looked stupid enough that I didn't spend $20 at the theater and $50 for a babysitter. I watched it on DVD instead and that was a big enough mistake. Stay away. Stay far away.

27 March 2016,Just brilliant as usual.,"""The ultimate authority must always rest with the individual's own reason and critical analysis."" (Dalai Lama)

A film is a film. You've got a story, characters, and a scenery. Music to go with it and voilà.. You've got a picture. Of course you can criticize till you weight an ounce, but that's not what a film is about.

Inglorious Bastards is perfect. Amazing actors, good scenery, and I happen to like the dialogs. It doesn't matter where the characters come from, but they have been put down perfect. The dialects, expressions and other characteristics are sensational. The Tarantino style music from old French chansons to the Good, Bad and Ugly western sound. For me it all blends into a film I can't stop watching. The chapters, details of the scenes, the acting, the different angles from which all the acting comes together to a perfect finish. You just have to see it for yourself.

Colonel Hans Landa. Christoph Waltz. Was he really just passing by when they were shooting a scene or so? How fortunate were they, when he walked there and was asked to play this role?

Waltz was the topping on a delicious cake. I've seen and liked him in other films, but in this one he is the red wire through the film. Utter brilliance.

Thanks again Mr Tarantino.",10
13 October 2014,Tarantino's WW2 drama is unorthodox and spectacular,"Nazi-occupied France, June 1944. Lt. Aldo Raine leads a squad of crack Jewish US Army soldiers deep behind enemy lines. Their job: killing Germans, as many as possible. Meanwhile Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels is about to premier his latest propaganda film at a cinema in Paris. All the high-ranking Nazis will be there, making it a perfect target for the Raine's squad. Meanwhile, the manageress of the cinema, a Jew whose entire family was wiped out by the Nazis, has similar plans.

Superb film. Not your average WW2 drama - this is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino so it was never going to be conventional. From rewriting history to the use of David Bowie's ""Cat People"" in a scene, there is nothing conventional and very little historically reverent about this movie, but Tarantino makes it work, and work spectacularly.

Great action and great plot. As is his custom, Tarantino methodically builds the plot and the tension yet the film doesn't drag. It is engaging throughout thanks to Tarantino's fantastic dialogue and a wonderful sense of menace and impending action.

On that note, although Brad Pitt is billed as the lead actor, the star of the show, for my mind, is Christoph Waltz as the cunning and sadistic SS Colonel. Superb performance, part charm, part menace. It's his fiendish charm with the sense that he's building up to something despicable that makes the non-action side so riveting. Waltz deservedly won Best Supporting Actor at the 2010 Oscars.

Brad Pitt, Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger also put in great performances. The remaining cast is star-studded: Michael Fassbender, Eli Roth, Til Schweiger, Daniel Bruhl. Mike Myers, Rod Taylor and Lea Seydoux also make brief appearances.",9
30 June 2010,Underwhelmed,"The film was off to a firm start, with the whole interrogation scene acted well and believably, Setting the rest of the film up perfectly. Sadly, it all went downhill from there. The Second chapter was passable, but the third and forth are unnecessarily slow and dull. It is actually bad enough that you were relieved when chapter three ends, only to have to sit through another slow chapter straight after. This is all a shame, as the final chapter is very well executed, and a perfect finale to the film. Yes, I know it wasn't at all realistic, but come on people, this is Tarantino! However, it all comes down to the middle chapters, and I think if these had been reduced by about half, the film would be a 7-8, Yet it was not, and is therefore ultimately a disappointment.

26 August 2009,A disappointed fan...,"Many reviews you will read here claim that this is a return to form for Tarantino...

I went into this film absolutely open minded and ready to be entertained, the first 'Chapter' is certainly promising with it's taut tension and fantastic climax...

sadly its a wobbly roller-coaster all downhill from there...despite some excellent performances (though i hardly think Brad Pitt in 'boofhead / Burn After Reading mode qualifies as one of them), but the tension builds and dissipates unevenly, even the standout scenes such as the cellar and cinema climax. Part of the problem is there's just SO MUCH going on, a subtext on both films and violence,knowing references to other war, spaghetti western, European art and exploitation films that Basterds is a twitchy and uneven mess despite some wonderful moments.

The plot is two converging but extremely predictable lines, and in a sense that is one of the problems, often we know whats going to happen and don't care much when we get there...this is a marked contrast to the snappy editing and craft on display in his earlier films.

The titular Basterds themselves (please dummies who question the intentional spelling need to watch closer!) are not much more than a weak half baked exploitation ensemble/distraction/ device from the main action with our heroine whose own plot seems to career to a predictable campy end...we hardly 'know her' enough to feel much in amidst the heavy handed 'cleverness' of the final cinema scenes...

Personally i did not find the film very violent compared to most, and that's more to do with the uneven suspense I think...it will be interesting to see how time treats this film. Perhaps I'll grow to love it, though i hardly feel compelled to see it again.

My gut feeling is critics are praising it more for the heavy handed cinematic subtext and Kubrick-esquire attempts at humor - however lame. It's never completely boring during it's 2 hour plus duration, nor is it very compelling or involving... It's also possible younger cinema fans feel like they're discovering Tarantino for themselves...hopefully they'll do a little more exploring to discover that this is a much weaker effort than his previous work.

Go in with extremely low expectations..or just go next door to District 9 for a real hoot..",2
9 April 2021,My Favorite Tarantino Movie!,"This movie is quite easily my favorite movie from Quentin Tarantino, which is saying a lot considering his list of films. Honestly, I love this movie because it is just insane. The cast is stacked, the writing is probably my favorite of any Tarantino movie, and the action (especially by Christoph Waltz) are among the greatest performances of the 21st century. Overall, this is one of my favorite movies of all-time and my favorite Tarantino movie.

9.3/10.

30 September 2009,Tarantinos worst,"After death proof i was somewhat puzzled over the lack of rhythm in the dialogue, the edge wasn't there anymore any characters were bleak in comparsion with his earlier work. Now this. This movie lacks everything, the story is not engaging in any way, im not the kind of guy that wants lot of guns in a movie but this hasn't got any drama or anything that gets you excited. I don't even know why the movie has even got basterds in the title, the whole movie has barely nothing to do with them. They are introduced in the beginning then there is a gap and they show up in the end, but has very little to do with the events that take place. Those seems to have happened anyway. This time even the music pick that sets the mood in his movies are misplaced, cant just throw a spaghetti western tune in randomly to make it cool. On top of all this, its stupid.

Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo!

1 September 2009,Tarantino does World War II with Glourious results!,"I have to admit that I've not always been the biggest fan of everything that Quentin Tarantino has released; but I have always admired the man both for making exactly the films he wants, and for trying his hand at different genres. World War II was not the obvious place to go, and it becomes even less obvious when you take out any ties to actual history and replace it with a black comic surreal style that is fleshed out with absurd characters and intense violence; but Tarantino has done just that, and for me has masterminded the best film of his career! Tarantino himself calls this a 'men on a mission' film, but really it's much more than that and the film would better be described as a World War II themed ensemble. The bulk of the film takes place in 1944 and the stage is set in Nazi-occupied France. A group of Jewish-American soldiers nicknamed 'The Basterds' have been dropped into enemy territory in order to hunt down and kill as many Nazi's as possible - a task they carry out with relish. Meanwhile, it has emerged that the Nazi's are holding a film premiere in a small theatre in France owned by a Nazi hating French-Jewish girl. Naturally, the Basterds soon take an interest in the event - since every major Nazi will be in attendance - but their plans to spoil the Third Reich's evening coincides with those of the theatre owner...who has a revenge of her own in mind.

Like most of Tarantino's films, this one is executed in chapters - there are five of them and they all follow in chronological order. Each chapter has a distinct style and purpose and in fact each one could almost be a film within itself. Tarantino sets the benchmark immediately with the first scene - an intense sequence that sees ruthless SS Officer Hans Landa turn up at the house of a French farmer whom he suspects of hiding Jews. This scene is unbelievably intense; Tarantino expertly builds the pressure throughout the scene until it finally reaches boiling point in spectacular fashion. That's basically the crux of the film; each sequence featured is completely gripping and intense, and this makes the two and a half hour running time fly by. The film is peppered with Tarantino's trademark sharp dialogue, (which is featured in English, French, German and Italian!) and it is unbelievably good - almost every line uttered is infinitely quotable, and each of the conversations between the many characters is interesting in its own right. Every scene appears to have been meticulously planned to the finest detail – and there honestly isn't one moment in the entire film that isn't extremely well done. I'm also amazed at how funny the film is – several sequences in this film wouldn't be out of place in a comedy, and yet they blend seamlessly with the intensity and violence on show elsewhere.

Throughout his career, Tarantino has excelled at casting the right people for the right roles; and Inglourious Basterds is another success on that front. Brad Pitt is the biggest star name in the cast, his Lieutenant Aldo Raine is a gloriously over the top stereotype and Pitt pins down the role fabulously. However, it is in fact Austrian actor Christophe Waltz who comes out of the film with the most praise; his subtly psychotic portrayal of SS Officer Hans Landa is absolutely brilliant and will surely go down as one of cinema's great villains. The mesmeric French actress Mélanie Laurent also stands out (both for her beauty and acting), and there's also memorable roles for Michael Fassbender, Til Schweiger (his awesomely cool character doesn't feature enough!), Diane Kruger and Hostel director Eli Roth, who gives a surprisingly effective performance as a baseball bat wielding lunatic nicknamed ""The Bear Jew"". All of the central characters are very well written and Tarantino excels at getting the point of all of them across, even though the screen time is generously shared between them all.

Rumour has it that Inglourious Basterds was ten years in the making, and I can say that the wait was worth it! I really am struggling to comprehend just how amazingly brilliant this film is. Tarantino has made a movie the likes of which has never been seen before, and if a better movie than this one is released in my lifetime, I will be surprised.",10
16 August 2009,Hillbilly Brad,"Motor-mouth director, Quentin Tarantino is rather good at killing people. Fast. Slow. Or slo-mo. But always inventively. Death may be delayed with deviously droll asides or a bit of creative torture. An ear deliciously sliced off in Reservoir Dogs. An all-girl singalong with action replays of our fatal car-smash for Deathproof. Wedding massacre in Kill Bill. Or death requiring an internal carwash in Pulp Fiction. Inglourious Basterds is no exception. Death is nasty, funny, almost operatic. But never boring. One could almost write an outline based on who dies and how.

Brad Pitt (Aldo Raine) leads an unconventional group of Jewish Americans behind enemy lines in World War II. Their fighting style includes Apache Indian tactics to terrorize the Nazis. Graphic violence is mixed with tongue-twisting wittiness in Tarantino's peerless signature style. The dialogue is developed to delay inevitable slaughter with ingenious irreverence. Stock characters are engineered with comic book gusto - and are so colourfully convincing that departures from historical fact seem mere details. A mesmerisingly multilingual special officer, Hans 'The Jew Hunter' Lands (with an award-winning performance from Christoph Waltz) is main antagonist to Brad's 'Basterds', as well as two other camps (French Jew Shosanna, and Churchill's Brits plus Diane Kruger) who similarly plot to blow up Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels and the big bad guys. All in a giant conflagration of dynamite, double-agents, guns and plenty of old nitrate film. This happens at an old cinema which is showing a triumphant Nazi propaganda movie-within-the-movie, coincidentally directed by (Jewish) Eli Roth. Who coincidentally plays baseball-bat-bearing Donny Donnowitz, 'Bear Jew,' and who dispatches Nazis by beating them bloodthirstily to a pulp.

When you expect violence, you get just sardonic wink. When you don't, you get full-on, glorious, extended, blood-and-guts. Femme Fatales meanwhile deconstruct stereotypes and inject fashion into daring mise-en-scene and plot-devices. Shosanna (Melanie Laurent)'s enviable red dress kicks off a climactic chapter with feminine visual splendour and predictably subverts the traditional macho of war films. Obscure soundtrack references are abandoned for Bowie's more visceral Cat People which explodes into our eardrums, and the fire of the Fuhrer is threatened with a heavy dose of gasoline. Zoe Bell leaps invisibly from Deathproof leading lady to stunt-double for Laurent and Kruger and the action finale delivers pay-off for a rather wordy middle section.

There are more historical and cult film references (of varying levels of difficulty) than you could shake from a shibboleth of war movies. It is very clever. It is very Tarantino. It is very art-house. But is it good entertainment? Stylistically, it recalls Pulp Fiction more than any of the director's other work. But the extended inter-action dialogues sometimes flag more than in his earlier glories. It still has great commercial appeal - fortunately for Mr Weinstein, whose flagging production company needs shekels to offset 500 million dollars of debts. But is it Tarantino's masterpiece that has been ten years in the making? For some, Inglourious Basterds could seem like Tarantino-lite. Perhaps more blood-letting and less word-games would have better satisfied our lust for passive cinema, big stars, three-second cuts and more explosions than obscure eponyms. And for serious cinema-goers, while acknowledging Tarantino's nod to French New Wave, are we not entitled to ask if his films are going to have a point? ""We're French. We respect directors in our country,"" Shosanna quips. Yes, but should they not also demonstrate substance to deserve it? Godard shot a lot of film just to question film-making styles. Only later did he seek to make films of depth. Each of Tarantino's films is like the arrival of a new voice in cinema. Yet having found his voice, what exactly does he want to say? Any new ground with Inglourious Basterds is firmly in the realm of genre manipulation. I didn't feel it said anything new about Jews and Germans. And questions of race or language seem necessary conceits within the film rather than earth-shaking profundities. Tarantino can justify every aspect of the film to anyone who listens. Maybe I'm making ungrateful quibbles. Maybe our children's children will speak of him with reverence. And if you are a Tarantino fan like I am, you will probably watch it twice anyway, whatever it's faults. Does a film need any further justification?",8
23 February 2010,DIsappointing DVD fare,"As many others have commented on the film, and I don't want to rehash what they've submitted. The problem I have with this film was that I saw it on DVDm and the English subtitles for the Germans-speaking-German were so minuscule I couldn't read them. The English subtitles for Englanders-speaking-English were standard DVD fare and easy to read. But since the film depends so much on Subtitled German-to-English translations, having them be unreadable was insufferable. I had to scan back three and four times to read what the Germans were saying. and this eventually got frustrating. So I didn't enjoy the DVD version of the film at all...

19 November 2009,Worst QT movie to date!,"This is truly a painful ordeal. Any score over 6.5 is a total disgrace. Its not funny, its not exciting, thrilling nor good in any way. Yes Tarantino is a brilliant director/writer and I must admit I am a huge fan of all his previous work.

This movie however is bad, really bad. The scenes, except the first, are lacking everything that makes Quentin good. The dialog is completely lacking his usual finesse and nerve. The violence is just overkill but OK we got your point QT you are not a big fan of ze Germans.. Please stick to movies which take place after 1960 in the future..

15 October 2012,From annoyingly isolated to cynically satisfying,"I do not consider Quentin Tarantino to be the godfather of auteur-driven cinema nor do I consider him to be one of the men who continue to ""ruin"" it, so to speak. I consider him to be a director with a solid style, a talent for witty, eccentric dialog, a natural at erecting characters that we like for their quirky societal views and their strange talking points, and overall, the non-linear coherency of it all. What I like about Tarantino can easily be turned into what I do not like about Tarantino without changing a single word above. After viewing Grindhouse: Death Proof, Pulp Fiction, and Reservoir Dogs, I was convinced that the man was a breath of refreshing cinematic air; a man more concerned with the things in cinema that can easily create a wonderful cacophony of energy and spunk. But after viewing Inglourious Basterds, my enthusiasm for the man hasn't lessened but came to a stunning, unexpected trip back to reality realizing like many other directors working in the medium, the man is not perfect.

Perhaps in the right eyes, Inglourious Basterds is a perfect movie. I suspect that everyone who will see it or has seen it has emerged with completely different viewpoints. That's the beauty of a Tarantino film, again, one person can like specific things about the film and love it for those reasons and another can point out those same little things and hate the movie just for that. Dissent is a beautiful thing, and it seems that's one of the many things that ""The Tarantinian Formula"" intends to do.

The film begins rather maturely as we are presented with a title card saying that the film is set in the Nazi-run areas of France, and then we see Colonel Hans Landa (also known as ""The Jew Hunter,"" played by Christoph Waltz) arrive on a desolate country farm to meet farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet). Landa is going around to different locations to try and find out if people are hiding Jews to protect them from Nazi persecution, and after a lengthy discussion with Perrier, the farmer informs Landa that he does in fact have Jews hiding in the house and Landa's goons immediately try to kill them under the floorboards of the house. The scene is particularly tense and gratifying, mainly because of its constantly unsettling nature and intimate shots, and serves as one of the best scenes in the film.

From there on out, we are greeted with a number of other scenarios seemingly taken from all over the grid. Now we are three years in the future and see Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) giving a mean pep talk to his boys, eight Jews recruited to accomplish one assignment; to kill Nazis, or in Raine's southern, twangy accent, ""nat-zees."" Among Raine's crew is Donny ""Bear Jew"" Donowitz (Eli Roth), a rather unnecessary, obnoxious caricature who is used as the violent soul of the whole operation. In a later scene, we seem him viciously beat a man's head in with a baseball bat, even after he breaks his neck upon being struck the first time. Certain scenes like that do not offend me, particularly, but I question their presence in a film dominated by dialog and sequences set in bars or elegant locations.

Another subplot, arguably the most interesting, involves a German sniper (Daniel Brühl) striking a friendship with a young Jewish woman who owns a French cinema (Mélanie Laurent). And another subplot involves a German film critic named Lieutenant Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender), who will become involved with a secret operation to bomb the premiere of the Nazi propaganda film the German sniper is a part of.

Now that we've got the continuously twisty, absurd narrative out of the way, we have the content and the aesthetics to explore. For starters, one can not deny, this is probably the strangest work of Tarantino yet, drastically different from his previous installments, for the sole reason that it does not rely much on the things that I listed above. He breaks form, creating long, somewhat poetic dialog scenes to set the mood, rather than the cut-throat, bloody, unapologetic goriness the trailer promised us. The problem with Tarantino, which even existed in Pulp Fiction, a film I awarded a perfect rating of four stars to, is that once the man gets started, he doesn't know when to stop. Certain scenes become long and winded, many of them overstaying their welcome, and consistently thriving on repetitive, uninteresting chatter that obscures the purpose and the enjoyment one anticipates walking in.

On the plus side, the film has some of the finest, rawest performances of the 2009 year. Brad Pitt gives a fine, no-nonsense performance as Raine, Eli Roth is capable as ""Bear Jew,"" and Michael Fassbender, once more, is continuously wonderful in one of the many diverse roles of his career. Yet the highlight here is the merciless, unmatchable, truly divine work of brilliance done by Christoph Waltz as ""The Jew Hunter."" His performance alone elevates the film to the point where when he's on screen, we forget all the monotony and watery dialog we've just sat through.

Consistent readers of my work will take note that I do greatly appreciate dialog in my films. But even I have a limit. There is enough dialog here to sustain two or three films, and that's a sign of a prolific, uncompromising auteur. If only the dialog had been easier to listen to, rather than just a good chunk of it being nonsensical, irrelevant banter would we have had some substantial meat to this story. This is a film that fluctuates from annoyingly isolated from its audience to cynically satisfying during a majority of its highlighting scenes. For a Tarantino fan, I can't expect they'll look for anything less.

Starring: Brad Pitt, Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender, and Christoph Waltz. Directed by: Quentin Tarantino.",6
5 December 2009,Tarantino's Deterioration on Full Displaw (spoiler alert),"This movie shows Tarantino's deterioration, clumping together his predilection for gory violence with comic book approaches to story and character. This is sad, because the bits and pieces of the movie and the acting are quite good, but the scenes add up to an unpleasant mess. Add to that the ridiculous story line--a successful assassination of Hitler, Goering, Goebbels, and Bormann at a movie premiere in Nazi occupied Paris after D-Day--as if any of those would travel to Paris at that point! What's more, Tarantino doesn't even care enough to keep his dates and the count of years right from scene to scene.

Tarantino has always been a self-indulgent writer/director, but somehow in the early films it worked. Even Kill Bill worked, particularly part 1, despite his stretching it to a four hour film. But the sort of weaknesses that always lurked close to or at the surface in those and other films clearly have taken over if Inglorious Basterds is a harbinger of the future. Quentin, let's get a little realism into your film making.",2
4 October 2020,I Love QT...Didn't Like This,"I have seen examples of people commenting about QT not being great, or a movie not being as good as people say and had largely disagreed with them.

Sooo now its my turn. I still love QT but Basterds just didn't draw me in. Yes it has lots of dialogue but I didn't really get swept away by it as I have with other Qt films.

I'm not going to dismiss other people's love for this movie, it just isn't for me

7 February 2017,A cinematographic caricature.,"This is a bad movie. Tarantino is undoubtedly one of the filmmakers I least appreciate, though he acknowledges his legacy for film art. Unfortunately, this film is uninteresting, boring, highly stereotyped and has an environment that never harmonizes with the time and space portrayed, looking like a caricature more than a serious and credible film. The guilt of this is the incorrigible taste of Tarantino, who likes to transform a regular film into a collage of elements imported from a thousand and one genres of cinema. Sometimes the collage turns out to be funny, but in this case it was stupid like a Frankenstein monster. Credibility was never part of the script, absolutely miserable and illogical. The characters are caricatures and never show themselves capable of reaching the audience, with their forced dialogues and theatrical postures. It features a strong cast, where you can see Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Eli Roth or Diane Kruger, but they are not to blame for the crap. They did what Tarantino wanted, the way he pointed them out. The film still has good costumes but most of the scenarios do not come as a surprise either. There are some well-done scenes, but most of them are due to a huge performance by Waltz, undoubtedly the actor in the best shape in this film and the biggest positive aspect to point out. Despite being a minor actor, he shone more than the main ones, stealing the scene from Roth and Pitt (this must be his worst film work), deserving the loud applause of the audience.",2
2 September 2009,Quentin Tarantino's Blast!,"I am a big fan of Quentin Tarantino. I completely loved Pulp Fiction, and has some of the best dialogue ever written. I was a fan of his Kill Bill films, and I loved Death Proof almost as much as Pulp Fiction, and had a great time with it. Inglorious Basterds is another remarkable achievement from Tarantino. It is a clever, funny, audacious and entertaining spin on World War II. I loved it. I did not know what to expect, if more of a comedy or a drama, but ultimately it had the classic Tarantino features. The film is superbly written, and I enjoyed all of the dialogue, which of course is what Tarantino does best. This is no exception. I was completely emerged into this other world, one we have never seen before. The performances were all very strong. Brad Pitt shines here, but then again, I have always found him to be a very charismatic actor, and I enjoy almost all of his work. Christoph Waltz did not disappoint after hearing all of the praise. His performance is not overly-flashy, but it works perfectly. He is without a doubt the best in the film, and that is saying a lot. Classic performance I am sure. But a lot of others impressed me a lot also. Mélanie Laurent and Diane Kruger were very good, Til Schweiger and Daniel Brühl almost equally as great as Waltz. Pitt, Waltz, and these four made the film. Eli Roth was quite good, and I enjoyed seeing him perform in this. The cameo by Mike Myers was very funny, and Martin Wuttke created a very memorable Hitler. Similar to Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, the film had a lot of blending music, and I loved it for that. The costumes and set designs were all exquisite, and I loved all of it.

Although I am a quite a big Tarantino fan, sometimes his films do overload in my viewings, sometimes I have some sort of resentment towards them. Pulp Fiction, sometimes I feel it is very disturbing and very violence-oriented, and Kill Bill the same, and I feel like it is stuffed with style, but sometimes I wonder about the substance. Also, I find Kill Bill sort of overrated, whereas I find Death Proof very underrated. I still love them, yeah, but I feel that way sometimes. I am not sure whether I will feel the same way from time to time with Inglorious Basterds, but I do think it is equally as great as Pulp Fiction, and I think it will fare very well with time!",
8 September 2021,One helluva movie.,"I loved it , the actors acting wth the most they can . Tarantino giving it all. It is too good.

7 October 2017,Perfection,"I appreciate Tarantino very much, but something like this I could not expect. He gathered fantastic group of actors who all overcame themselves, and such great competition Christoph Waltz easily stole the movie. I have absolutely no objections to it. Screenplay, acting, directing, cadres, sound, music,... perfection. One of the very best movies I ever saw.

31 July 2010,funny,"A film about the Second World War without Russian? This is really funny.

The only adequate scene - the first one.

My first thought after watching the film - a flight of paranoid delusions. But given the director can say otherwise: good cynical, but too bombastic farce.

The film is not worthy of Oscar and repeated viewing.

I'm very afraid that this film will see my grandma or one of those who erected the red flag over the Reichstag.

2/10 for a sense of humor

21 August 2022,Inglorious Waltz,"Probably Quentin Tarantino's best film, with an actual credible plot, well chosen cast, and where the violent ending serves an actual intention other than just being a director signature. Moreover, the opening scene is a stroke of genius, much thanks to the perfectly built up sensitive and euphemistic tension, combined with a sublime acting performance by Christoph Waltz.

20 April 2011,Tarantino's point of view,"Quentin Tarantino is truly one of a kind. His well-known earmarks are always fun to watch. I think it's phenomenal how he can make films which are so full of personality and quality - brilliant performances, epic quotes, satisfaction. Inglorious Basterds had been waited for some time and I gotta tell you, it absolutely delivered. I thought it might be good, a real shooter. What I didn't think was that it would make a list to my elite films. It was a surprise at times, but when I think now, it isn't. Why? Because it's Tarantino's. You just know you get great stuff.

Obviously, it is Christoph Waltz in the role of Col. Hans Landa, to whom all the applauds are going to. His performance is second to none. But I wouldn't underrate Brad Pitt's role as Lt. Aldo Raine. Terrific actor, extremely versatile.

Believe me, Quentin Tarantino gives a new look to the WWII. It may like you, it may not. It probably does. In the end, it's your call. I arrant enjoy it. I thought it was a work by a genius. Well done.",10
9 April 2010,Completely unexpected,"When I decided to watch this film, I was clueless about it. The ads suggested that it was a comedy. It is, but not in the way one would think. I also didn't realize that it was directed by Quentin Tarantino. So basically, the whole thing was a surprise for me.

In many ways, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a good surprise. It's an intriguing, interesting, highly fictional story, with tension throughout, especially in the beginning scene where Colonel Landa (Christoph Waltz) questions a French farmer (Denis Menochet) about hiding a Jewish family.

The Basterds, led by Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) are out to scalp Germans, and their mission collides with that of a Jewish woman (Melanie Laurent) who has fake papers and runs a film theater in Paris. She has a mission, too, and on the night a film is shown that is to be attended by Hitler and SS officers, the plans take effect.

Brad Pitt is very funny as Aldo, and Christoph Waltz gives a great performance as Landa. Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger, playing a German actress who is collaborating with the Americans, are both wonderful in their roles.

""Inglourious Basterds"" is filled with horrible violence done as only Tarantino can - you're laughing one minute and repulsed the next - it also has an excellent cast. Tarantino reminds us of the flammability of nitrate and of life, which in this film is pretty cheap.

I don't want to give anything away. As with all films, take it for what it is, fictional with plot holes, and you will be entertained.",8
11 October 2018,Weirdly epic,"Even though I'm a massive fan of Quentin Tarantino's work, I have to admit that he's had a few 'misses' here and there. However, I'm pleased to say that, despite possibly nothing ever reaching the dizzying heights on 'Pulp Fiction,' 'Inglourious Basterds' comes about as close as it can in terms of entertainment value.

Before I watched it, I have to confess not knowing an awful lot about it. The fact that it was a 'Tarantino movie' was enough for me to know that I was going to watch it. All I knew, from the posters mainly, was that it was a World War II film. And, seeing as I do occasionally dip into that genre, I figured it would be Tarantino's take on that particular period in history and that, like most war movies, it would attempt to be 'historically accurate.' How wrong I was.

I'm sure most people know the 'basics' of history surrounding that dark period of 20th Century history and that's all this film relies on. You have the setting, i.e. Nazi-occupied France where fearsome German SS officers ruthlessly hunt down Jews, up against the local resistance and an American platoon dropped behind enemy lines to generally disrupt the occupation. However, don't expect much in the way of 'historical accuracy' after that.

You've probably seen Brad Pitt's face on much of the marketing material surrounding this film. Yes, he's the biggest star so why not promote that fact? And, yes, he gives good value as the leader of the American Nazi-hunting band of brothers. However, what this film never anticipated was how well Christoph Waltz would play Pitt's opposite - the fiendish Colonel Hans Landa. He steals every scene he's in and you'll be hard pressed to find a more terrifying movie villain in recent times. He's right up there with Darth Vadar, Hannibal Lecter and Heath Ledger's Joker. And, even if you don't enjoy anything else about this film, you should watch it just for him.

The 'structure' of 'Inglourious Basterds' is typical Tarantino. It's split into about six (quite long) 'chapters' through the film's two and a half hour runtime. Each of these could almost be a separate story on their own, if it wasn't for the fact that they all link up in the end perfectly. This sort of story-telling may feel a little disjointed at first, but the way they're told makes them impossible to look away. I may go as far as to say that this film could possibly be the 'tensest' ever made. Because the stories all have their individual characters, you never know who may or may not make it out of the chapter alive. The tension in every scene is cranked up to the max and you probably won't guess everything that's to come.

Whether you're a die-hard fan of Tarantino, Brad Pitt, or the genre in general, it doesn't really matter. You only have to enjoy good story-telling, fantastic memorable characters and good films in general to appreciate this (just be warned about the no holes barred violence and bad language, ala every Tarantino movie ever made).",10
20 August 2009,Pulp Fiction goes France in WW 2,"I'm still impressed by this film directed by Quentin Tarantino. The last movie by him which impressed me that much was Pulp Fiction. All the ingredients I loved in Pulp Fiction I found again in Inglorious Basterds. I was totally impressed how Mr. Tarantino handled it to direct a movie with three languages. One of the reasons might be that he made right choices for the cast. Germans/Austrians are speaking German, Americans/British are speaking English and French are speaking French. Only one person in this movie can speak all three (four) languages fluently: the SS Officer Hans Landa. Hans Landa is portrayed by the Austrian actor Christoph Waltz. He must be some kind of a linguistic genius. To be precisely they are speaking a little Italian too. It's worth to watch the movie only to listen to the Italian from Brad Pitt. Unfortunately I don't speak any French but it was wonderful to listen to the other languages I know well. Next to Christoph Waltz and Brad Pitt the beautiful French Actress Mèlanie Laurent convinced me.

This movie contains a lot of dialogues, humor, bloody violence and perfect acting. It reminded me a lot on Pulp Fiction. The most important thing I was positively surprised as I was about 15 years ago during watching Pulp Fiction. I'm a big fan of Spaghetti Westerns and it was fun hearing familiar sounds in the background. But I wished Tarantino would have used lesser known Music because some of them we already have heard in his former works. Inglorious Basterds includes everything what you need for a pleasant evening: well written dialogues and a lot of killed Nazis.",10
23 September 2022,A stylish Bugs Bunny cartoon with real peoples,"I have to say Quentin Tarantino always make very entertaining films, I do enjoy watching them. This one is very entertaining, but I do have some criticisms. It is basically a pantomime with the nazis being cartoon characters. The guy playing Hitler might as well be in a Bugs Bunny cartoon, so if you're looking for realism then you won't find it here.

The writing is very good, except I think sometimes it can be cringeworthy and cheesy. First of all Christopher Waltz is amazingly good at the Nazi guy, he's very charming which makes hi character even scarier, I can see why everyone loved him in this. Then there is Mikey Fassbender, he is as cool as a cucumber a the British guy. The blonde jewish girl is drop dead gorgeous, like a female deer. Diane Kruger is extremely sexy as a hot blonde nazi,I will be fantasising about both of them later yes sir, say what you want about the nazis, but they sure had sex appeal, at times it is hard to tell if you are watching a WW2 movie or looking at a group of supermodels doing an edgy photoshoot.

So there is a lot to like about the film, it keeps your attention all the way through, and it looks very stylish and cool. Now for the things I didn't like, well I think that sometimes QT gets praise for being edgy that he doesn't actually deserve, take this movie and Django as examples, it's basically just glorifying murdering nazis and slave owners, there is nothing at all edgy or risky about that in our current culture, it is literally the safest thing you could ever do in a movie.

This leads me to the most annoying thing, Brad Pitt and his merry band of nazi hunters, it gave me d**** chills every time they were on screen, this guy is a cookie cutter American square jaw hero, he is collecting nazi scalps, whoah! Look out, captain America is in town, what won't he say? It is just so corny, I know you're supposed to think they're the cool guys, but it's basically just the A team with twice as many members, and taking themselves way too seriously, when you compare them to Christopher Waltz's character he wins by a country mile in the coolness department, does he need a whole crew of yes men with zero personality? No, does he have to try make him self seem tough talking about ripping peoples heads off? No, he has polite but very intimidating conversations whilst drinking milk and eating pastries like a real badass.

Now for my least favourite thing about the movie, there is a character called The Bear Jew... really... the character is called The Bear Jew, because he is so big and scary that it is like dealing with a grizzly bear that happens to be circumsided and has keen business instincts, watch out you no good nazis, the Bear Jew is in town, it really makes me cringe so hard. Anyway, if I just make myself ignore the things that annoy me, it is very entertaining and definitely one of Tarantinos best movies, I'd say the 4th best after the first two and then the Hollywood one. I'm going to be very very generous and give it a 9 because Christopher Waltz is awesome, there are two knock out blondes, and lots of stylish nazi imagery, minus one point for the cheesy bear jew and Americans saving the day (as usual) rubbish, I did enjoy it from start to finish and that has to count for something.",9
18 July 2010,If you like blood and gore but lack intelligence this is for you!,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz!

Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo! He is ULTRA polite with each one; and has supreme confidence in his scary, chilling, bold mannerisms. All I can say is: ""You see this movie for Christoph Waltz's performance; all the rest is secondary""!",3
30 August 2009,Disappointing: slow and skillless,"Tarantino's latest, a WWII revenge tale, is also his most disappointing, somehow managing to be like a bowl of plain oatmeal: tough to stomach, lumpy in spots, and ultimately flavorless.

I confess to being a full-throated fan of Quentin Tarantino. (We both come from solid video-store-employee stock, you see.) I have enjoyed all of his films, including the ones he wrote but didn't direct. And I have to say that compared with his other works, Inglourious Basterds falls short of all of them.

The (fictional) story is about a group of Jewish Americans recruited by one Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) to hunt Nazi soldiers and, well, scalp them. Raine's Basterds are very good at their jobs (Raine's required 100 literal scalps from his crew), and their notoriety has spread. The team is assigned by the Americans to rendezvous with a German actress/double agent named Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger), who has discovered that the location of the premiere of Joseph Goebbels' latest propaganda film has been moved from the vast Ritz theater to a smaller venue in Nazi-occupied Paris.

Unbeknownst to von Hammersmark and the Basterds, the young owner of the new venue, played by Melanie Laurent has her own plans for the premiere; she and her lover will set the theater on fire, killing all the high-ranking Nazis inside, including Goebbels and Hitler.

There are also two other smaller stories (all four dovetail in the end, of course). An SS officer, Colonel Landa (Christoph Waltz), known as ""the Jew Hunter,"" has a Jewish family murdered on a remote farm in France, where they are being hid. Naturally, the one person who escapes his wrath that day grows into the young theater owner. Also, a German sharpshooter, now a national hero, is the subject of Goebbels' new film and is himself trying to woo the young theater owner.

My first problem with the movie is the revenge factor itself. In order for me to root for a protagonist who's exacting revenge, I need to a) sympathize with their plight and b) believe that the punishment they're meting out is suitable. And although there's plenty of style to this film, I don't think that the Basterds met either of those criteria. In fact, it would be one thing if this were a straightforward (and straightfaced) revenge flick, like Death Wish, but Pitt and his fellow Basterds take far too much glee in torturing and dissecting Nazis than I'm comfortable with. Their mirth seems not only out of place, it seems kind of sick minded and unnecessary.

My second problem is just as insidious: the casting of Brad Pitt. I am a fan of Brad Pitt's work, as I am of Tarantino's. I think he can turn in good work when he wants to - that is, when he's not playing the sly, smarmy character he sometimes lapses into in movies like the Ocean's films. And that's what he does here. He's not just a superspy who's in charge of an elite commando unit, he's just a thuggish jerk who's really no better than the villains he's mowing down. On top of that, Pitt uses a ridiculous southern drawl that sounds exactly like someone trying to sound like a southern backwoods hillbilly mountain man: made-up, well over the top, and really grating to the ears. Killing natsies, indeed. I just think that a better actor, in this case, would have lent more gravitas to the role; Pitt's Raine feels like everything in the movie's supposed to be a big joke.

Overall, I was surprised to find few real twists or any memorable dialog (other than the laughable lines that Pitt overplays, seen in the trailers and previews anyway). Tarantino is known for slick, clever dialog, especially quick patter, and none of that was evident here. The twist - such as it is - is amply evident to everyone except the characters themselves.

At 153 minutes, Inglourious Basterds is as long as most other Tarantino songs, but without crisp dialog and tightly staged action scenes, it drags on. In some scenes (a standoff in an underground bar is well shot), this works, but overall there's just far too much down time.",4
19 July 2010,California ueber alles,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz! He has won just about every award for his performance in this film, and he deserves every single one of them. Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo!

3 September 2009,Oh my god they killed history! You Basterds!,"So, the wait for ""Basterds"" is finally over. Was it worth it?

Let's look at the negatives first.

Criticism 1: It was quite ""talkie"" for a war film.

Yes, this is true. but this is no ordinary war film. whilst it is (very) violent in places, as one would expect from a modern war film, the film is an exercise in characterisation and with this in mind, it is very successful. Landa, Dreyfus and Raine are brilliant lead characters whilst the supporting characters, namely Sgt. Donny Donowitz, Lt. Archie Hicox and Bridget Von Hammersmark, are wonderful characters. So while this is a very dialogue heavy film, the dialogue between the characters both forms the story and strengthens the characters.

Criticism 2: It was too bloody and violent.

OK, let us look at films like Hostel. The violence is so strong and so frequent that we as an audience are numb to it and it becomes boring by the end.

""Basterds"" is a war film after all so we can give it some leeway for being violent in places but it was realistic and it served a purpose.

Criticism 3: There was no story.

Like all of Tarantino's films (Jackie Brown aside) there is little story but whatever the story is, it is well executed and all plot holes are tied up by the end. When you go to see a Tarantino film, you should know what to expect by now.

Criticism 4: The music didn't fit.

I agree with this one on only one point. The David Bowie song, although it was used effectively and it suited the scene. The rest of the music was perfect for the film.

Criticism 5: It wasn't even remotely historically accurate.

Yes it was, the soldiers uniforms, set design, weapons, cinema (right down to the type of projector and films) were all accurate. it was only the story that was fiction.

So, was it worth the wait. You had better believe it",10
19 December 2009,Don't waste your time,"So much hype 'bout it, it's unbelievable... Could barely stay until the end - Brad Pitt's performance is so miserable, downright annoying actually and mainly because of his accent. It continues to define him as a mediocre actor, this is what he has been for the last 7-8 years.

I have no problem watching graphic violence and gore if it supports the movie, however I was disgusted by Tarantino's insult to our intelligence on this one: gratuitous scenes abound and the camera pauses unnecessarily onto those scenes.

I also found Christopher Waltz's performance performance less than stellar, and I was looking forward to watch him! That added to my disappointment.

The bad: disgusting and unnecessary violence, undefined characters - Brad Pitt being the lead in this category, twisted historical account - I mean REALLY twisted, if you saw the movie you know what I mean, long, boring scenes, unrealistic scenes - to only name one: Hitler and the top-5 SS brass come to see a movie in occupied territory accompanied of only 2 guards!, conveniently switch of languages that did not make sense - Germans switching to English, french for no apparent reason, and many more not worth taking the time to mention - that many they are! The good: there are a few scenes brilliantly done, one can see the Tarantino signature in them (the initial scene at the farm, the meeting between Landau and Shosanna at the restaurant), however this good fades out in the overall mess.

I am a fan of Tarantino but this movie disappointed me.

All in all, if you have anything else better to do (e.g. walk your dog, pet your cat, listen to your canary - you name it), just do that, don't waste your time!!! Especially if you like Tarantino or Brad Pitt. Keep their image untainted in your mind by avoiding this farse...",1
20 July 2010,Far from the best of Tarantino's work.,"First of all, I am really an admirer of early Tarantino movies. I strongly suggest that everyone who didn't watch ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" do so. No lack of violence there also. Rest of his movies could easily be skipped although ""Kill Bill"" has some moments. This is my first review here and I am writing it because I am so disappointed in the movie and in the direction this author is going. I suppose the great reviews and rating of this movie is caused by new generation of movie goers admiration of pure gore and exaggeration. There is definitely not much left from the original artistic freshness and mastery in somewhat artificial (deliberately) but certainly intelligent and fluent Tarantino style dialogue. I am giving it 3 out of 10, because there are still some movies worse than this one.

21 August 2009,"A WWII masterpiece from Tarantino that shoves a lot in our face, but luckily knows what to do with it.","Quentin Tarantino has a way with dialogue, and a way with plot. Along with that, he has a way with throwing too much plot into a movie, or too much dialogue into a film with not enough plot (like Death Proof). This film has quite a large amount of dialogue, and it also has many different story lines and characters, none of which are elaborated on until near the end, so it almost seems as though they've been abandoned. By the end of the movie, it's quite apparent that nothing has been abandoned and all these story lines have been calculated as to how to end them perfectly and how to connect everything. Tarantino knew what he was doing.

Like all of Tarantino's films, this one is split up into chapters. Unlike any of his other's, this one is almost completely chronological, aside from the infrequent flashbacks. One story revolves around the Inglorious Basterds, a group of Jewish-American soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Rein (Brad Pitt), and their Nazi scalping. Another story involves Shoshana (Melani Laurent), an escaped Jew who ran away from the evil ""Jew Killer"", Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), who is out for revenge. Perhaps she will get the revenge she wants when Landa is security at a movie premier at the theater she owns. And there's dozens of fairly main characters and actors along the way to go along with the main plots.

If this film could be compared to any other Tarantino film, it would have to be Reservoir Dogs. Not because of any plot similarities, or similar scenes, but this film is devoid of emotion. Tarantino has his more emotional films, like the second Kill Bill, or Jackie Brown, or even Pulp Fiction, but this isn't really one of them. With that said, this still has characters that are likable and that the audience cares about, this movie just overall isn't an overly emotional film. But that's not what it's about anyways, it's a war film.

The movie is rich in characters, and boy are there a lot of them with quite a bit of screen time. Brad Pitt is definitely the main character of the Americans, and he gives an over the top, often times comedic performance, but he plays a great contrast to the German's lead actor Christoph Waltz, who plays the sinister and evil Col. Hans Landa. Melanie Laurent plays a reserved (for the most part), but interesting role as the woman hell bent on revenge. Diane Kruger plays a rather minor, but interesting role as a German movie star who is actually a spy for the Americans. Every role played is played well, but unlike as it would seem by the trailers, all these actors aren't wrapped around Brad Pitt's finger, but instead Christoph Waltz's. He's the bad guy, and not just that, but he's also the smartest and most cunning of the characters. Really, this film revolves around him, and it works well that way, he's a great character.

My only major quibble with the film is it's set-up. The way the movie is set up, it's only loosely thrown together until everything at the end brings the stories together. So for the first hour and a half (or around there), this movie felt like a constantly changing anthology. Once chapter five binds it together and gives us a typical great Tarantino ending, it makes the movie whole. But the looseness of the film towards the middle brought up questions as to what the purpose of different characters were. Luckily, the answers are all in the last chapter.

Quentin Tarantino has yet again made another movie masterpiece. This one is one of leisure, but at the same time a constantly changing story. By the end, this film has delivered the goods. The rest of the film sets up what will happen with typical rich Tarantino dialogue, and some bloody violence. Definitely it's a unique take on World War II.

My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 154 mins. R for strong violence, language and brief sexuality.",9

27 August 2009,Basterds is Irony!,"This movie is special because it is IRONIC. It is the exact opposite of what you would expect a WW2 movie to be about. The usual fare is the persecution of the jews in most WW2 nazi films. IBasterds is different because it takes that premise and then reverses it: What would happen if WW2 had been about the persecution of the Nazis? This movie manages to make the Nazis look evil, but at the same time it turns the Jews and the Americans into the true evil making victims out of the Germans. No mercy is shown to the German army and the movie is about revenge and taking the evil that the Germans personified in WW2 and placing that evil intention into the hands of the allies and the jew.

The movie manages to have a fair bit of tongue in cheek humour mixed in with an interesting intellectual plot. This movie succeeds because it manages to do something that no other WW2 movies have managed to do, and it does it rather well! The true star of this movie is the 'jew hunter' Nazi. This guy is very intelligent, and comes across as a nice guy on the outside with a true hidden diabolical intention buried beneath his friendly intellectual exterior. His wholesome milk drinking friendly approach to solving his mysteries makes for a very interesting character! Brad Pitt, while doing an excellent job of acting out his character is not seen very much in the film at all.

The movie is controversial beyond belief and is the kind of movie that leaves you thinking about it long after you have watched it. I rate this movie an 8/10. In my opinion a little more action would have done this movie more justice, and a little less screen time to the artsie visuals and what seems to be at times drawn-out conversations would have made this movie a 9.

A good movie for sure, and an instant classic",8

24 February 2014,A movie for ignorant Morons,"Too bad I couldn't give this piece of dog roll a big fat zero. I knew this was going to be historically wrong crap when the movie begins in 1941 with a Nazi round-up of French Jews. The round-ups began in 1942. What really worries me is that piece of wet-dream vengeance fiction will be believed by the morons who get off on this sort of crap. There is no part of this movie that is not fiction; I suppose this is an accomplishment. Whoever wrote the script and the producers must have some real knowledge of the period, especially in regard to film, in that Lilian Harvey, Emile Jannings, and a poster featuring a Clouzot add a gram of reality...that and the fact that Goebbels controlled film, that Hitler (like Mussolini and Stalin) was a film buff. Other that that, the rest is the pornography of mindless violence. What was Quentin T thinking?

22 November 2009,Load of rubbish,"The first 20 minutes where the best part of this overrated flop! I thought finally Tarantino had done it again after a lot of so so films, but what started well went of the boil real fast. This film is described as a drama! Sure it started like it, but lost that serious feel, and became a very none serious, very inaccurate historical Hollywood farce!

Specially when Mike Meyers character came up, what did they think that he could act an British officer, with lots of make up and that oh so over done fake accent (yeah baby). Brad Pitt stars in this flop to give it some weight, but is only part of the side cast, the German/Nazi's are betrayed as an circus act, with a story line that could have delivered a very solid film, but it just went no where, 2 1/2 hours of over done boring dialog that is more of a comedy then a drama. But then again Hollywood has only ever done a few good World War 2 films, and this is not one of them.

The score of 4 is only held up by the fact that it started well (first 20 minutes) and that all characters spoke their language as per nationality. Whats next for Tarantino? A Xmas movie? Or wait he will do a sci-fi film! As far as I am concerned he is still part of the Hollywood party due to a hit a long long time ago and I just could not take this as a serious film.",4

21 August 2009,Good but somewhat overblown.,"The movie is a bit long, drags in the middle and has a corny, hokey comic book story style, nevertheless the movie is good but definitely not great. Instead of an action packed movie focusing on a bunch of angry Jewish soldiers going after vicious, unrepentant Nazis, the audience is given a complex story with plots and subplots that are pursued to the point that the Basterds are almost shunted to the sidelines. There is solid acting, with Brad Pitt demonstrating a definite flair for comedy and Christopher Waltz giving a commendable performance as a suave but sinister SS colonel, but the muddled, absurd story is what keeps this movie from achieving anything approaching cinematic greatness. Solid acting coupled with a goofy story does not make for good cinema. This movie also continues the now time honored tradition of bashing Germans, which is nothing new in Hollywood cinema. Once again the Germans are portrayed as hapless buffoons. Yet despite the fact that they started and lost the war, and that it is highly tempting to mock their outrageous conduct, it is a stretch to present the Germans as bumbling fools. They might have been fools but they were far from bumbling and what they did in Word War Two was not a laughing matter. If someone wants to make a movie about inglorious basterds then make a movie about inglorious basterds and place them squarely on center stage where they belong.",7

14 April 2020,Proof that people are sheep,"One of the worst movies ever made and one of the worst performances in the history of film by Brad Pitt. The fact that Christophe Waltz is phenomenal in his part does not create a greate film. He's a fantastic actor but that's where all compliments for this abysmal piece of self indulgent crap ends. I'm not sure if Tarantino is just making fun of his fans or what. This movie is horrible and the fact that it's rated so high on IMDB just shows how people follow along with what they believe is ""supposed"" to be good. I'm still dumbfounded by how bad Brad Pitt is. Did he win the Razzie for this? If not, WHO...was worse? Worst Tarantino film of all time. Really it's been all downhill since Pulp Fiction.

11 March 2010,Easily forgettable,"Inglorious Basterds is yet another flashy exercise in pulp excess taking liberties as much with history as accents. Pitt and co play the titular basterds who operate behind enemy lines scalping Nazis (Pitt demands 100 scalps per member of his unit) culminating in a plot to wipe out the nazi hierarchy at a Parisian film premiere. Unbeknowknst to them the cinema's owner is plotting almost precisely the same thing. Eventually the 2 groups' paths collide in the film's explosive cinematic climax. Personally, i didn't enjoy it much, nor was there much chance I was going to as the thought of Tarantino directing a war film fills me with bemusement - like Leone directing a comedy. His overwrought self-satisfied style is all over this like the cream on the strudel in one restaurant scene. Every scene is planned to look and sound as cool as possible, removing any semblance of naturalism from the product in the process. The table conversations that fill the majority of the runtime never sound like a conversation people do or would actually have, rather they're pure script delivered by actors who sound only like they are delivering lines. The emotional vacuum in these scenes and others runs to the heart of what's wrong with what promised from its beginnings to have some substance to it yet with conversational emotion understated out of existence and the emotionless murders that make up the film's action there's nothing left for the viewer to latch on to. We're never supposed to empathise with anyone in the film because we're never given the chance, everyone is a basterd in this - the women perhaps moreso than the men and no one wins in the end. Nihilism? Not quite. Just a film that starts slowly, never gets out of a canter then gets lost along the way choosing to retire early rather than finish the race. Not the best couple of hours i've ever spent by any stretch.",5
18 April 2019,Some kind of Wolfenstein but not that good,"To me Mr. Tarantino is a strange and an odd entity. As a director of his movies, he's pretty good, but as everything else ... I've watched this one for the third time now and am finally ready to write a review. Where do I start? He's unpredictable at storytelling. Sometimes good, sometimes bad and sometimes unbearable horrific, the basic problem being - he does not know how to finish the story/movie so he abruptly just stops. Or, as in this case, invents some fictitious plot, thus prolonging the ""experience"" for at least one unnecessary hour. Otherwise good actors (except for Mr. Waltz who never performs bad, no matter what) perform horribly as on purpose. Like in exploitation movies. In this movie the ""good guys"" are presented as in the title, being no better than their enemy. Mocking? Not sure. Anyway, the story, editing, acting (mostly) and all other stuff sucks big-time. A lot of idling mixed with some graphic violence. If this movie is ""just a movie"", with no message/moral and for entertainment purpose only, it may pass (but shorter, at a 100 to 120 minutes rate). Just as Wolfenstein game. You play it, laugh (or not) at jokes, kill everything that moves and sleep well. In all other cases, it's a waste of time and fail. So, you decide what to do with it. Mr. Waltz is excellent. Everything else - a cartoon. Not to be mixed for good taste's sake. I'm not going to watch it ever again.",5
1 September 2009,A half masterpiece,"It was so wonderful to escape from all that MTV like trash movies populated with Barbies and Kens and enter a world where good cinema even if crazy is the absolute key word.

With the first scene I was put in heaven, with superb dialogs that lasted for minutes and a fabulous camera that managed to captured all the surrounding mysteries and its tinny details as I have seldom seen before. Right there I thought I was in the presence of a second Pulp Fiction. Well, not quite.

The movie is a show in originality, specially when Tarantino pulls out his unmatched ability for the long and ultra intense scenes like at the basement bar, another almost unparalleled brilliant moment with dialogs to die for. The way he plays with the German clichés is absolutely incredible. Unfortunately, neither Diane Kruger nor Til Schweiger were a match for the general amazing acting, which reached the climax every time Christoph Waltz entered the scene. Brad Pit's performance was in my opinion far below his capabilities too. He just seemed to be passing by. A big plus was the constant language change between English, German and French, which functioned extremely well.

My biggest negative note is the breaking of the movie in too many chapters, which stole some unity. By doing this, Tarantino highlighted the idea that the movie was not thought as a whole, but rather as many different sketches produced in his head over the years and then glued together as a single movie. I also had the impression that now and then, the editing got sloppy.

Anyway, a film full of wit and incredible moments. True cinema at its very best with excusable flaws. A solid achievement by Tarantino.",7

21 December 2021,Suspensful and gripping but lacks energy,"First important thing to say is that I am a massive Tarantino fan . He is my favorite director.

In general , I liked this movie too. It had some amazing , unforgetable scenes that really grab you and keep you glued to the screen like you are sitting with actors.

Acting is just superb , nothing less , nothing more. A definite standout was Christoph Waltz , his performance was very believable and well written just like every other Tarantino film.

Since this is a Tarantino film , the bloody fights and gore are still present however there is just too many characters in this one and no one really gets enough time to shine especially Brad Pitt.

Waltz steals every scene he is in but the plot just dragged for too long losing focus on characters.

I was amazed by the bar scene and everything about it but for every good moment in this movie there is at least 3 boring conversations and scenarios that are just not interesting enough because the characters are not interesting enough for me to care.

Reservoir Dogs was a much shorter film but did an incredible job with character , same goes to Pulp Fiction , same goes to Jackie Brown.

I am not saying this movie needed more action. It just needed more focus. For me , it was a great movie overall , I would recommend it to anyone but it is just not rewatchable in my opinion.

10 May 2019,"""I Think This Might Just Be Your Masterpiece""","Tarantino does it again helming a virtuous war / retribution film. There are so many unforgettable scenes. Hans Landa's interragation of the French farmer, Perrier La Padite is unparalleled. Lt. Aldo Raine's recruitment speach to the basterds is hilarious and brutal. Shosanna's vengeance film premiere is poetic. Lt. Archie Hicox's confrontation with the Nazis in a bar is intense. Its impossible to pick a favorite. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, settings, costume, score and acting. All the actors involved deliver realistic and superlative performances. In particular Waltz, Laurent, Fassbender and Pitt are commanding. The plot revolves around Lt. Aldo Raines whose mission is to seek retribution against the Nazis by putting together a squad of eight Jewish soldiers known as the ""Basterds"". The Basterds join forces with an undercover agent to take down the Third Reich. Their plan is set to take place in a theatre owned by Shosanna who is seeking to avenge the Nazi's slaughtering of her family. The plot is clever, funny, vengeful, gritty, intense, violent, poetic, unforgettable and has one of the most cathartic endings on film. The last dialogue in the film is delivered by Sgt. Donny Donowitz when he says to Lt. Raines, ""I think this might just be your masterpiece"". This viewer believes Tarantino was being symbolic and referring to the film as his masterpiece to date. The film is certainly a memorable and sublime work of art.",9
19 September 2009,What was Tarantino thinking?! :S,"I love movies and I love Tarantino's work. I must admit that I find his earlier work much better than his latest films but still I think he is a great filmmaker and I watch every film of his that I can. But Inglourious Basterds just ... well s_u_x. I read a review saying that this is Tarantinos best film but I think it's just the opposite. I don't think it's all bad. I think the actors did a good job at portraying their characters and the film was shot very well. But the story is just not up to the challenge. I never thought I would say this but you really wouldn't miss a thing if you don't see this Tarantino movie. Don't get me wrong. It's not the brutality that bothers me. I just can't get rid of the feeling the story is missing any kind of depth. It's like watching a commercial and you know how boring and idiotic those can get.

I have to say it was a waste of my time watching this and if I could I'd demand my ticket money back. This is not even good enough to download (if some of you are into that) :)

13 September 2014,Golden Acting from Waltz!,"I've always been a big fan of Tarantino films, and this was certainly a good addition to his line-up of entertaining films, even though it wasn't his best.

The overall plot, in my opinion, wasn't the strongest. It didn't feel like it was well drawn up and instead felt quite disorganised, in particular, I didn't feel as if the Basterds fitted in well with the rest of the plot. Their role in the movie felt rather forced, and the scenes with the Basterds were, in my opinion, the weakest scenes in the movie.

Yet, while the plot wasn't really rich, the film made up for it with its tense, memorable scenes and memorable performances. As expected with Tarantino, he builds up the tension with lengthy scenes and long periods of dialogue. Oh, and of course the comedic over-the-top violence that Tarantino is renowned for does occur in this movie don't worry, but at no point was it out of place.

But really, what made the film was the acting from Christoph Waltz. Before this film, Waltz was a relatively unknown actor hailing from Vienna, yet afterwards, he was transformed into a mainstream actor who all of the film directors are chasing after, and after watching Inglourious Basterds, you can see why. Waltz played the part of SS Colonel Landa to perfection. Honestly the character is one of the best villains ever in cinema history in my opinion. It was just the sheer competence, elegance and ruthlessness the man possessed made him absolutely compelling. Tarantino himself had fears that the role simply could not be played, yet Waltz completely smashed his fear, with style.

As for the rest of the acting, I have to give good mention to Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger, and overall the general acting performances were solid, although, I am critical of Brad Pitt. I felt, especially as one of the main characters, he didn't really create any connection with the viewer, and the role was relatively pedestrian and simple, so this shouldn't be a film that Pitt is renowned for.

Overall though, whilst the film wasn't Tarantino's best, it's certainly a film that was very entertaining and kept my interest the whole way through, so it's certainly worth watching, especially to witness the incredible acting from Waltz. I'd give the movie 8.3/10, which is what it currently is rated at.",9
22 August 2009,In a word- garbage,"Peoples reaction to this movie scares me. Despite Mr. Tarantino's obvious talent, his lack of good taste and infantile world view are what shine through here. He reduce a historical tragedy, the holocaust, into an opportunity to create a bloody revenge fantasy. He disregards historical fact as easily as he rips off or should I say ""quotes"" more original filmmakers. What he does do well is create set pieces that stand out and write snappy dialogue. However, there is not one character here that is more than a cartoon cut out. Positive reaction to this film is a sign that people are checking their brains at the door.

22 January 2016,"A brilliant movie, managed to surpass my extremely high expectations","No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz! He has won just about every award for his performance in this film, and he deserves every single one of them. Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo!

15 December 2009,I'm confused... Which one is the evil side again?,"The message of the film is clear. Americans can do everything better than the ""evil"" ones of the world: Americans are tougher than you, smarter, more clever, fight harder, and you'd better believe if we can't torture more sadistically than you too. Of course, as a rile-up-the-righteous-masses kind of film, it succeeds rather well. However, in demonstrating the ""better than thou"" virtues of the Jewish-American soldiers of the film's focus, the film paints them as reprehensibly worse than their enemy. They are committing atrocities as bad as their enemy, all in the name of fighting evil. The sickening and disgusting depiction of the actions (scalping, etc.) of this renegade group certainly does not help endear viewers to their cause (unless the viewer is either well propagandized or sick in the head).

Remember that in real history, no allied forces knew of the Nazi atrocities until near the end of the war, when the first internment camps were found. Therefore, this group of soldiers would be brutalizing Germans out of pure sadistic pleasure, not yet knowing the reasons which we as viewers today apply retrospectively to rationalize their actions. Most today have been sufficiently preconditioned to seeing the Nazis as the evil oppressors, and to seeing Jewish people as perpetually afflicted, so that any outburst of evil by Jewish soldiers is reflexively taken as a 'hurrah!', root-for-the-underdog moment. However, in complete contrast to its supposed goal, this film does not present the virtues of liberators, but rather the virtues that brought us Abu Ghraib and Guantanimo. The presentation of this film is one thing the American nation can well do without.",1
24 August 2009,Vintage Tarantino: YES!,"Not since his masterpiece, Pulp Fiction, has an audience had the chance to view cinematic originality, or at least the appearance of such.

IB is exactly what you would expect from a Tarantino film and more. You get a great shots, fun music, high action, drama, great lines, and a spectacular story. Going in, I was hesitant, but within 10 seconds, I was thrilled. The audience is sucked in immediately. Loved it. Loved it. Loved it.

Pitt's character is fantastic. The villain is evil as all get out. Everyone is just cool like New England breeze. If you dig Tarantino, but were disappointed with the Kill Bills, he's got you covered on this bad boy. Stop what you're doing and go see it - now!

8 June 2021,Not my kind of movie,"Well, I have to admit something kept me watching the whole thing but besides Waltz's performance and other few remarkable contributions, the film was too long and boring at times. I respect people who enjoyed this movie but I guess watching the whole movie was an accident in my case. Also, not respecting the historical truths, wasn't a great selling point and it only made it a bizarre phantasy, even though kinda funny too. To be brutally honest , I could never watch this again in this lifetime.

21 August 2009,Tarantino's supposed 'basterdisation' of World War II sees him zoom back to form with an enthralling; gut-wrenching and stylistic war-time thriller.,"Inglourious Basterds sees Tarantino 'glouriously' return to form. What was the debacle called Death Proof, one half of an 'experiment' entitled Grindhouse, has been tried; tested; acknowledged and now buried with Tarantino close to being back in top gear. The film is pure Tarantino, with the sorts of winks, nudges and acknowledgments that are subtle, and compliment the viewing experience, rather than bash you around the head by announcing the whole damn thing is a pastiche in the first place. We've returned to the sorts of Tarantino pieces that check progress with chapters; manipulate time; break the fourth wall; flashback; present us with interesting and dynamic characters that are brought to life brilliantly – even Tarantino's love for the female foot makes an amusing appearance when it transpires an entire plot point must revolve around a woman's foot/shoe. Yes, it's a mad, mad film; but it's as equally high in quality.

Tarantino is still operating within that realm, or aesthetic, of escapism; and while his past, more better, work unfolded under a very grounded umbrella of realism and seemingly real-life people thinking, talking and interacting amongst a plateau of realistic, mostly unfortunate, situations; Inglourios Basterds tears The Second World War a new one with a series of scenes that rip up the rule book; re-envisage, and even have its characters outwardly speak of how certain others, inhabiting certain spaces, at certain times can be fate or ""just an amazing coincidence"". What we get is what Tarantino has confessed to being a Spaghetti Western that just happens to take place in France, in the 1940s, and with a bunch of colourful characters of whom some are French, German and British. The film even makes room for cameo appearances from some of the eras more famous faces and possesses the sheer confidence to spend a good ten or so minutes filling in detailed back-stories to characters before completely removing them from the text.

The opening to the film is pure Tarantino; kicking things off in a lone, road side location as Christoph Waltz's Nazi colonel Hans Landa visits a French farmer. We are plunged into a game of fear, honour and suspicion. The scene is reminiscent of Jules' visit to the apartment full of young guys in Pulp Fiction, when retrieving a suitcase. The man is in total control; he requests a drink of milk more-so than Sprite and calmly banters with the hapless home-owner as he senses exactly what he's after is in very close proximity. His guards loom, ominously, just the other side of a muggy kitchen window out in the yard; out of focus but visible enough to tell us they're there and threatening. It is a brilliant start to what turns out to be an enjoyable romp; but never really exploitative of The Second World War. We do not enjoy any of the deaths in Inglourious Basterds; American, British, German, Jewish or otherwise. Nor are we excited by the shootouts, however well constructed they are.

The Basterds of the title represent a group of American soldiers in Nazi-occupied France; flitting from German platoon-to-German platoon and injecting fear into the Nazi war-machine by killing, maiming, bashing and scalping the enemy. They're led by Brad Pitt's Aldo Raine, a mostly expressionless lieutenant, who self-confesses he and his men are in the ""Nazi killing business, and business is a-booming!"" I was surprised by just how much Pitt's Raine was in it; that being not very much. All the build up, talk and promotional material seemed to include him or revolve around him and his Basterds of the title. Indeed, Tarantino spoke at length about how long it took him to write the character and how much he realised he needed Pitt in the role, etc. But Raine's there for a bit at the beginning, then for about fifteen at the end. It is in no way a criticism, merely an observation, but my guess is that the script was chopped so much that Raine became a supporting character around which Tarantino's finale (which he has stated he had great trouble coming up with over the years) was built up to; and that itself involved a whole new bunch of characters mingling in and around a plot involving raw film stock and a cinema.

Along with these Basterds; of whom Tarantino might be drawing on real life parallels with current American soldiers-come-involvement in brutal, immoral activity in foreign wars; even if I respect those that would disagree through lack of development of this idea; we are presented with a young girl named Shosanna Dreyfus (Laurent), whose family are killed by Landa and who has retired to a Parisian cinema to wait out the war. That premise alone might inspire a dynamic, revenge-fuelled, cut and thrust adventure set amongst World War II; but instead, she gets a chance encounter with a young German soldier, who is involved in film production through various reasons. Dreyfus' transition under her alias of Emmanuelle Mimieux, as a submissive and quietly nervous in the Nazis' presence, to a laughing; cackling, rather frightening face that illuminates the setting of the finale is equally refreshing to watch; the final stages of the transition is best highlighted by a montage of fetishistic close ups as she dons clothes and make-up for the climax of a screening.

The film is a sweeping display of tension, horror and distinct black comedy; forever flicking, effortlessly I might add, from the nastiness involved in the hatching of a dangerous plan between two lovers within the walls of a cinema; to an ever-diligent German officer attempting to piece everything together; right the way through to the ever-present, but relegated to looming in the background, group of Americans known as The Basterds. As a multi-equilibrium and frequently non-linear piece, complete with an array of influences and film references within itself, Inglourius Basters is, this time, a welcome addition to the Tarantino collection.",7
4 October 2021,A movie that really got into some details,"Tarantino never lets you down when it comes to cinematography. The scenes are just masterpieces, every one of them. Sometimes camera swaps to a first person and makes us feel the person's anxiety. Sometimes it goes crazy and make you feel like you are in this scene. It makes you feel like you are in this movie. Makes you happy, makes you sad as the movie goes on.

But we can't say same things for the plot since it got some corruptions. Althrough the movie got great metaphors (you probably won't notice them, look for a movie analysis after the movie) it still has got some basic disconnections, unexpected character behaviours that cause the movie to be more exciting. Of course we want movie to make us excited but it feels weird when you don't fill the hole between the character and behaviour.

Actors did a great job. Especially Christopher Waltz. He needs to be annoying in this movie and he performed very well. But without getting more attention than he needs to get. The actors were great about this. If you play your role unnecessarily hardly, people will notice and your role will be ruined. None of the actors did this mistake so not greatest but good acting.

The movie is very rich about languages, but I prefer to hear Germans speaking . This movie can be considered very good for an action movie. Well done, Tarantino.",9
7 January 2011,Booooooooooooooooring!,"I cannot believe this movie has scored anything beyond a 0.5. What a waste of time! The movie was so incredibly boring I quit watching it after an hour or so. Brad Pitt was funny, in what VERY LITTLE he was in. Other than that this was a ridiculously boring and uninteresting movie.

Apparently I need 10 lines to complete a review. I'm not really sure what else can be said about this movie to express how bad it was. It came recommended by some coworkers and after watching what I could of it I will never take their recommendation again. I don't think I have ever not finished a movie I rented. I paid for it, I already set aside the time, I'm going to watch the whole thing...Not this one! Just plain awful.

12 September 2009,"War is hell, but even hell has its humorous side","Not having read the user comments section of this web site before I saw the movie (I had read a couple of favorable critical reviews), I was quite taken aback by the divided response. No-one walked out of the packed session I went to. For one thing, it passed the watch test – in the 150 minute running time I looked at my watch not once. The blend of comedy, film buffery and action overlays some seriousness of purpose. Yes, in war both sides are capable of atrocities and generally commit them without much thought. Yes, some Nazis were witty, intelligent and charming, if not actually lovable. Yes, the world would have been a different place if Hitler and his gang had been disposed of in the summer of 1944. This is entertainment, not history, however, even if the German uniforms and wartime French bars are painstakingly reproduced.

I thought the whole thing was very well constructed. The 5 long ""chapters"", with their own denouements are all carefully linked. Apart from the final catharsis, they all feature the quiet build-up of tension through conversation to an almost unbearable degree – final moments of mayhem come as a relief. Yes, it's a very talky movie but the dialogue has many flashes of brilliance. I'm sorry for all those who don't like subtitles – I thought they were well used. But wasn't there too much sadism, blood and gore? That's war folks.

Even the sternest critics concede the Austrian actor Christoph Waltz put in a stunning performance as Colonel Landa the urbane SS Jew hunter. Brad Pitt's hillbilly chief basterd, Aldo Raine, was somewhat overshadowed, but it was not a very demanding part. Melanie Laurent as Shosanna, the young Jewish cinema owner bent on revenge, relied more on her beauty than histrionics, but her presence was unforgettable. It was nice to see that Rod Taylor at 80 can still do Churchillian tones. About the only below par performance was Mike Myers (""Austin Powers""), totally miscast as a British general. Daniel Bruhl from ""Goodbye Lenin"" was excellent as Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels' blue-eyed boy who falls for Shosanna.

As for the film buffery, some I appreciated, some went over my head, and some was below my radar, but I can't say it interfered with my enjoyment of the film. I didn't really see this movie as a spoof of the World War II film genre, a major part of my movie diet when I was growing up. Tarantino has added something of his own here – he's Spielberg with a sense of humour and an understanding of that allegedly rare American trait, irony. As the unfortunate (and unfortunately named) Lt Archie Hicox), film critic turned not terribly successful secret agent, might have said ""I await with eager anticipation and great trepidation this director's next work.""",8
30 August 2009,A welcome return to form after 15 years,"I still remember the rush I got when seeing Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction for the first time. I ended up seeing both multiple times and took something new away from each viewing. The media hype around Tarantino, which I believed at the time, was that he could do no wrong. It really seemed in '94 that he was not only the greatest director in the world, but would change cinema forever. Unfortunately his produce since Pulp Fiction was neither prolific nor impressive. The primary weakness with Tarantino's three works post Pulp Fiction and pre Inglourious Basterds was his constantly parroting or paying tribute to other works he had admired instead of going out and doing his own thing, creating something original. An excess of verbosity slowed the pace as well. Viewing the trailer and reading initial reviews of Inglourious Basterds led me to believe it suffered the same shortcomings. To be honest, the trailer for Inglourious does not sell the film I saw. And Tarantino's frequent arrogance and more recent track record have opened him up to a lot of criticism - much of it unjustified in the case of this film.

Anyone who has read any review of Inglourious would know that the villain is a sinister Col. Hans Landa and that the opening sequence is one for the ages. He is a unique movie villain like Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Men or Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs. He doesn't speak, he interrogates and interviews in a eerily calm manner. It requires nerves of steel to maintain your composure with him around! His audacity in the last 20 minutes is breathtaking. The opening sequence was worthy of Sergio Leone, whose Once Upon a Time in the West and Lee Van Cleef in The Good The Bad and The Ugly no doubt influenced Tarantino's handling of the entire sequence.

I actually liked the criticized bar sequence even more than the opening. Long yes, but it slowly builds up to a brilliantly directed climax. The twists and turns, the playful banter which turns into something deadly are among the memorable sequences of cinema history. Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus has given a performance that is almost on par with Christopher Waltz's Col. Landa. If his performance is Oscar worthy (not that that should be the yardstick!), his interview of her and her reaction when he exits is also equally worthy. I should mention here that the name star of the film, Brad Pitt, is really only one part of a great ensemble cast. His performance is superb and not the caricature that the trailer implies. A sequence where his hick officer is forced to act 'Spanish' is just brilliant comedy. He has the accent of a southerner down pat. I only wish he'd been given more time. I hope the director's cut adds something to his role.

In closing, I'll add that Tarantino's knowledge of cinema was never in doubt. His camera-work and understanding of the mechanics of film-making were always good, but he has exceeded himself in this film. There is something classical about the photography (beautiful long takes) and cinematography, which almost no director can emulate. As a former fan and later critic of Tarantino, I'm blown away by Inglourious and despite his cheek, I do think he may just have made his masterpiece!",8
11 December 2015,Favorite Movie Which I Saw in the Theater the First Time,"I remember that this was my second Tarantino film. A few days before, I watched Reservoir Dogs with my brother, introducing me to Tarantino movies, and I was ecstatic that my Dad agreed to take me to Inglourious Basterds since the trailers made it look like a good revenge film. I was surprised that the film went beyond this notion and was simply fantastic overall, leaving me smiling as I left the theater.

Let me just say, the early trailers for this film are deceiving. They make it appear that the premise is simply Brad Pitt and his men killing Nazis in a brutal manner throughout. This is definitely not the case, and actually touches on subjects I never would have imagined. Tarantino shows his knowledge for German cinema throughout as the main character of the B plot - Shoshanna - comes to own a cinema, and the Nazis are dealing with where they should hold the premiere for the new film by Joseph Goebbels - Nation's Pride.

The villain, played by Christoph Waltz, is such an amazing character to watch. At certain points, he exhibits intellect and detective skills near Sherlock Holmes levels, and at other times he makes us laugh with how out of touch he is with certain customs. The first twenty minutes of the film is almost fully dedicated to this Hans Landa, and it proves to be among the best sequences Tarantino has ever written.

I fully believe this film had a better screenplay than Django Unchained, but to me, it makes sense that the academy went with The Hurt Locker for best original screenplay. It makes sense not because The Hurt Locker fully deserved it, but because The Hurt Locker was a film that this country needed in 2009 to shape our perspective on the war being fought over seas.

While Inglourious Basterds is not an accurate depiction of World War II or one of the most important World War II films, it is certainly one of the most fun to watch. It is tense, funny, crowd-pleasing, and at the same time it is a very smart movie with well-developed characters, an intricate plot, meta characteristics, and above all, extremely well-written. This now holds the spot of my 2nd favorite film by Quentin Tarantino, behind Pulp Fiction.

4.0/4.0",10
29 November 2009,oh my god what a total waste of time,"This is a tragedy of a movie. The majority of the characters are soul-less and totally unrealistic. That would work if it was a comedy, but as far as i could tell the comedy was replaced with gruesome violence bordering on snuff. Pathetic, totally pathetic. Neither intelligent nor funny it is completely incomprehensible to me why anyone would fund this movie let alone rate it. The most abysmal and implausible plot; this is an absolute disgrace of a film. What's really tragic is that some of the the acting talent is exemplary but nonetheless cannot save what is fundamentally an entirely self-gratifying endeavour by Tarantino. One of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune to spend my time on, it literally leaves you flabbergasted at how shockingly unfunny and appallingly bereft in plot a movie can be.

3 August 2009,War has never been so much fun,"Inglourious Basterds is a funny, bold and very well-acted tale about a group of Jewish-American soldiers targeting Nazis in France during World War II. I'd say it's easily Tarantino's best since Pulp Fiction, and contains his trademark mix of serious violence, off-key comedy, and hair-raising drama.

It's also fuelled by Tarantino's favourite theme of revenge. The central characters are the highlight, and very well drawn; particularly the German Colonel Hans Landa, who's a mix of Hans Gruber and Dr, Evil. Equally standout is Brad Pitt's no nonsense Lt. Aldo Raine replete with thick southern accent, whose deadpan humour and stoicism run-up nicely against the film's macabre tone.

It's a long and dialogue-heavy film and some scenes run well beyond modern cinematic time norms, echoing the pace of 70s classics such as The Dirty Dozen or Bridge Over The River Kwai. It's also divided up into sequential chapters separating out characters' lives, but tells a story in a coherent way Kill Bill didn't.

There are a couple of scenes that are very long (particularly the basement rendezvous set-up) but they sort of torture with their tension and you remain hooked in. At times Inglourious Basterds is very violent and comically so, and that will turn some people off. It's also sort of flippant about serious themes (in the same way Guy Ritchie treats his subjects) and that might also bother some. Personally I laughed at the outrageous breaking of taboos and remixing of history and so did the audience. Tarantino shows in this film how much mastery he has in the difficult job of mixing the grotesque and the comedic.

There are also some nice, wry post-modern touches such as a film critic being recruited as an assassin. In Inglorious Basterds he does what he does best – great characters in extreme environments doing mad things in a funny and violent fashion Finally, the ending is excellent. Masterpiece indeed. I'd happily watch it again.

This was shown as a preview in London and Tarantino did a Q&A afterwards.",8
16 January 2022,Absolute masterpiece,"One of the most entertaining, funny and disturbing movies I've ever seen. I'm probably on my 10th time since I first watched it at the cinema.

Highly recommend.

19 April 2019,The best inaccurate war film of all time,"Inglorious basterds is without a doubt one of my favourite films, not just from the past decade but the past few years. It combines Taratino's classic satire and intense drama into one amazing viewing experience. Nothing can describe Christoph Waltz's excellent performance which is easily one of my favourite villainous performances of all time. The film is able to pace all of its scenes well and the time flies unnaturally quick. The violence is gory and shocking in the best way possible. Each set piece in the film is gorgeously paced and gripping even on multiple rewatches. I easily rank this with Pulp fiction as my favourite Tarantino flick, and I recommend this as a must see! (Also I have a soft spot for Brad Pitt's southern drawl)

25 September 2010,tragically bad. very poor choice of German actors doesn't help either,"I can only agree with the reviewers on the unstructured, badly paced patch work nature of this movie, and on the sad fact that the best scene is the first scene.

I can only assume, people who believe the ""bar"" scene is ""witty"" don't understand the German language. A native speaker should notice immediately, how bad the actors really are and how forced and unpleasant the ""Tarantino table debate pattern"" aches on the viewers perception.

What works in contemporary New York style short story dialogues does absolutely not apply to German ww2 era characters. Tarantino obviously tried to make it ""authentic"" by omitting all the vulgar street lingo, but thus fails cos whats left is just clumsy and cumbersome.

Another thing nobody mentioned (AFAIK), is the fact that Tarantinos casting agent selected only the worst of the German actors available to fill his ""native speaker"" roles.(I am from Austria, so I have the dubious advantage of being pestered with all of those actors for decades now). And no, those actors are not suitable for ""the trashy approach"", they're just plain tiresome. it's as if a french movie maker wants to shoot an ""authentic rapper"" scene in New York and then hires the first actor that springs to mind. because he can't be bothered : ""well, Denzel Washington is black, American and famous, no? That should suffice"".









I believe I ""get"" what Tarantino is after with this movie, and I think its a wonderful concept - however, sadly it fails. hard.",3
24 December 2011,Tarantino in pure form,"A movie directed by Tarantino can not be a surprise, Same laws and same ingredients, same atmosphere and drops of fights, same character in new clothes. Same style. This case is different. The same pieces are parts of a picture of one of most serious events. The war, the Shoah and the Nazi regime. In new lights, with new nuances. Essence is original. Skin is different and not to encourage a comedy or minimize a painful age but for understand. At first sigh, a game. Ridiculous, fullish , explosion of imagination. In fact, history ad usum delphini. With a special Brad Pitt and perfect Christoph Waltz. With charming Diane Kruger and a harsh gestures. A tale. Like many from childhood. Same subject, same victory. And shadows of sacrifice. A Tarantino is a show. Powerful, strange, iconoclastic. Same rule in this case. But movie begins after its end.

26 August 2009,Brutal and Delicious,"Anyone who has read many of my previous reviews will know i have something of a gripe with Quentin Tarantino. Despite his unrivalled genius when it comes to cinematography and dialogue i always find his films to be a strudel without cream; a most unsatisfying prospect as Colonel Hans Landa will attest to. The lack in his previous work of any real tone of emotion and overload of dialogue (no matter how well written) lead me to find his creations far less immersive than the work of many other directors. However, Inglourious Basterds is a completely different batch of strudel. Never before has Tarantino's work been so transcendental, and never before has he made a film that i have found so complete.

If you haven't yet seen the film, you have good reason to be confused by my mention of Hans Landa. He is a little advertised character in IB, but no doubt steals the show. Christopher Waltz plays the ""Jew Hunter"" in such a convincing way, that i have felt genuine hatred for his character. His grotesquely charming creation is not only defined by his actions, but also by his ability to manipulate everyone from a lowly milk farmer to the British high command. i felt a pull in scenes involving Landa that i have never before felt during a previous Tarantino film, and it seems a perfect example of the director and actor working together and making something truly memorable. He really does steal the screen from far more well known actors.

Despite this, there is a real intrigue behind all characters in the movie. Pitt, making his debut in a Tarantino movie is brilliant as Lt Aldo Raine. He is as funny and smart as he is deep. Everything from his crooked smile to the unexplained scar along his neck adds to his presence on screen, and this is a blanket feeling. Each of the Basterds has their own distinctly different traits and Tarantino explores these in their actions, names and nicknames given by the German forces making a richer tapestry of characters than i am used to seeing. All cast members do a great job at creating an atmosphere as immersive as that of any film, a testament to the casting team, who somehow managed to cast effectively in 4 languages.

While all this is going on, the classic Tarantino cinematography and dialogue is still present, and never before have i seen a film incorporate humor alongside so many deeper issues as seamlessly. There is a witty quality to the script that leads to even long periods of dialogue with little or no camera movement to still be immersive and humorous. The blend of laughter and tension in many scenes is a rare and original concept captured perfectly.

Now from this review it sounds like a complex film and this couldn't be more true. In true QT style there are numerous story lines interwoven and this leads me to my only major gripe with the movie. Towards the end, it all comes together in something of a mishmash. You lose track of the differing motives of the different parties involved and you aren't aware of how much the different characters know of the others involvements. However, it is some climax. Unexpected, emotional and as always, brutal.

I loved this movie. At nearly 3 hours it would have been easy to make a confused mess of different plot lines buried under a mountain of dialogue pouring out of every bodily orifice, but nothing could be further from what we have here. No dialogue feels wasted and all scenes are aimed towards making the finale even more delicious. There is a simple way to describe how much i enjoyed this film. To paraphrase Lt Aldo Raine, ""I think this might just be his masterpiece"".",10
5 January 2023,"My 1,800 review is a magnificent Quentin Tarantino film","A wild ride that may not be as enjoyable as most other Tarantino films but damn it's got a lot of awesomeness! An original story about lieutenants that take pride in taking down as many World War II foes as possible. So many great aspects top notch acting, exciting music, engaging smooth scenes, amazing action and great entertainment throughout! Christoph Waltz is outstanding as LT. Colonal he deserved the awards won back then. Even though I originally saw when released in theater I didn't start reviewing till 2018, only seen a handful of times glad I own Inglorious Bastards now. Movies like this are more deserving of awards than most anything.

28 August 2009,Worse than prostate cancer and aids combined!!!!!!,"Tarantino has managed to become a cliché all of his own.From the long corny monologues, to ridiculous characters, all Tarantino's failings are there.I honestly felt dirty after watching this movie.It felt like i was watching Quentin himself masturbate for 2 hours.This film was purely to massage his already gargantuan ego. Hes obviously in love with his own writing, but it just comes across as pretentious nonsense.Most scenes he just runs away with lots of this pointless dialogue.And its so corny and badly written, your quickly bored. The editing seemed to have been skipped in this film as large chunks are completely pointless.And with all the overly long scenes and drawn out dialogue, the film appears muddled.Even Brad Pitt seems embarrassed in some scenes, with the waste of his talents.Some of the actors do very well with what they're given.Christoph Waltz puts in a good performance, just a shame its all Quentins masturbating material. If you were wanting to watch the Inglorious Basterds, rampage through Germany.Killing dismembering any and all Nazi's, as the trailer hints, you will be disappointed.The Basterds aren't in the film much at all, 80% of the film is just conversation. In the end this movie was bad, very bad.And i think some of the actors should feel a bit of embarrassment for being involved.Christoph Waltz can hold his head high, but Pitt has got a major black mark to work off.Tarantino is way too in love with his work to make a good film anymore.And when he lacks he just copies from others, (just like Reservior Dogs which was unbelievably similar to a famous Asian film).He seems obsessed with becoming a legend or major name in cinema, like those who's techniques and styles he copies.He calls it homage i call it just plagiarism.While once he was original at least, now hes a self obsessed mad man.",1

27 May 2020,Hilarious Brad Pitt glorifies basterds in this Unstrain Classic by Quentin Tarantino,"Inglorious Basterds (2009) Brief Review -

Hilarious Brad Pitt glorifies basterds in this unstrain Classic by Quentin Tarantino. Who says Tarantino can't have fun? Who says he always makes disturbing movies? Well, i myself used to say so. But i can't say it anymore after watching Inglorious Basterds. A fictional writing of Tarantino on serious people like Nazis, Jews and Hitler isn't serious at all. Especially the lead characters of the film whether it is Brad Pitt as protagonist or Christoph Walts as Antagonist. This film is funny yet seriously made by entire crew putting all seriousness into it. I laughed, i gasped and i enjoyed a Tarantino Film without a single strain moment. Can you believe it? I didn't believe it for a moment. Then i pinched myself to confirm it. Yes, Tarantino makes a Fun watch yet delivers a Classic filmmaking upto his standard. Brad Pitt is truly hilarious in the film. Watch out for his smashing dialogues (Especially the one at the ending scene). Christoph Walts outshined in enjoyable antagonist's role and grabbed the deserving Oscar. Melanie Laurent and rest of the cast is fantastic with their small roles. Inglorious Basterds is neither allegory nor satire but still it has got some intellectual things to be noticed by movie buffs (i shouldn't be spoiling anything here) so watch out. On one rare occasion you are gonna love the basterds for their brutality. Tarantino doesn't lack anything from his signature filmmaking but he just added unstrain factors and little fun this time. This glorifying film of basterds may not be a thought provoking and mind shattering film like other War films but it just mixes two genres together like never before. Brad Pitt and Tarantino Fans just can't miss it and don't forget to indulge surprise package Christoph Walts and excellent use of background score. This film is ranked too high on IMDb considering the kind of content it has but still a Classic is always a Classic doesn't matter if it doesn't fit in all time greats.

RATING - 8/10*

3 January 2020,"Typical Tarantino-flick with some major flaws, although still extremely enjoyable.","Well casted, well acted, and well-written movie that subverts your expectations in logical and interesting ways while at the same time being filled to the brim of typical Tarantino dialogue, humour and nazi ultra-violence. However, apart from Waltz's Hans Landa , all the characters are quite one-dimensional and static, but that is not neccesarily the focus of this film, and it works more than fine without particularly well-rounded characters.

The movie is a classic for a reason and holds up very well ten years later.

24 August 2009,"Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho, To Kill the Nazis We'll Go. . .","Who would have the audacity to create a film about a group US Army soldiers, composed of Jews, that are commissioned to either capture, kill, scalp and swastika-brand any Nazi they come across in World War II? Quentin Tarantino, that's who! And he had a more than interesting time with the film, under the name, ""Inglorious Basterds"". Slightly sharing the name of a 1978 grindhouse take of ""The Dirty Dozen"" (the second ""a"" is purposely replaced with an ""e""), ""Basterds"" isn't a remake but another mark of art-house action by a mad cine-fanboy. Both are shameless and brave.

A character actor in an A-lister's body, Oscar nominee Brad Pitt (""12 Monkeys"", ""Snatch"", ""Burn After Reading"") is half-Indian Southern boy Lt. Aldo Raine (a homage to the World War II hero-cum-actor, who played Lt. Muldoon in the awkwardly pro-Vietnam War film, ""The Green Berets"" with John Wayne), an ambitious sort with a lynching rope burn scar around his neck, who leads the band into Nazi-occupied France, striking fear into the fear-mongers.

But there's a second narrative involving Shosanna Dreyfus (a fetching Melanie Laurent), a movie house owner/manager who's the sole survivor of her family's slaughter by the Nazis, conducted by the panther-like Col. Hans ""The Jew Hunter"" Landa (brilliant Christoph Waltz, who won the best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival, slightly echoes Richard Harris's role in ""Major Dundee"" and could be a possible Oscar nominee). Under an alias, Dreyfus learns her theater has been chosen to showcase a propaganda film, featuring the Nazi hero, Frederic Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), who has a ""love jones"" for her. Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich cronies are slated to attend, making this a trap for Dreyfus to execute. The Basterds, using the intel of double agent/actress Bridget von Hammersmark (the equally lovely Diane Kruger of the National Treasure films), get into the act, and the effect is a cinematic hellstorm.

If you expect ""Saving Private Ryan"" by Tarantino (Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction and the ""Death Proof"" vignette of the underrated ""Grindhouse""), get the **** lost and stay the **** lost. This is pure exploitation fare, bowing at the feet of exploitation classics like ""Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS"", ""SS Hell Camp"" and the original ""Bastards""(its'director Enzo G. Castellini has a cameo here) while using a five-part narrative that alternatives between the vengeful Jewess and the slap-happy ""Nazi-busters"" at 152 minutes. Sure, there's a lot of dialogue, but it's Tarantino dialogue; movie-referential, playful, intricate, campy and subtitled (the French and German languages are spoken).

Pitt and Waltz are sly dogs, and the ladies are too exquisite for words. The Basterds are polluted by violent and loyal oddballs. My favorites are baseball-bat swinging Donny ""The Bear Jew"" Donowitz (director Eli Roth of the Hostel films); knife-wielding Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger) and the dutiful Smithson Utivch (B.J. Novak of ""The Office, US version""). Comic Mike Myers is notable suitable as British c.o. Ed Fenech where there's a wish for more from Rod Taylor (""The Birds"" and the original ""Time Machine"") as infamous Britain P.M. Winston Churchill. Tarantino stock actor Samuel L. Jackson has a nice part, narrating on how a certain prop in the film is flammable.

The other Tarantino trademarks are here too: brutal violence, nods to older cinema (a movie trivia game is played among German soldiers, Ennio Morricone's spaghetti Western tracks, Dreyfus's escape echoes the ""doorway shots"" from John Ford's ""The Searchers"") and foot-fetishism.

""Basterds"" is the only summer 2009 film I've seen (""Watchmen"" spoiled me, being an art-house cake with blockbuster frosting, and I think its' villain, Adrian Veidt, is probably Landa's nephew) and it's damn good one, being a throwback to dirty tough action films. Vive Tarantino!",10
3 January 2010,As a QT fan--I say give this one a miss,"I'm a big time QT fan, especially of his now classics such as Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown. Kill Bill was downright awesome. Reservoir Dogs was brutal and amazing. The minute I saw his name on a movie, I knew I was in for something gutsy and cool.

Except for this one. Oh well, I guess even QT can suffer a misfire.

The long dialogs between characters were boring and did nothing to advance the plot. There were times during these long winded expositions and scenes that went nowhere that I felt like I was watching a made for TV mini-series rather than a QT flick (Winds Of War, anyone?).

I dunno, it just had a lot of the same old crap humming through it, with little substance behind it. People are brutally killed. War sucks. Psychopaths like killing people. Hitler sucks. Nazis suck. Blah, blah, blah. Homage to older movies. Lookit me, ma, I'm making a WWII movie! *sigh* Maybe it was the setting that was the problem--QT does well with eras from the seventies and onward, but I couldn't help but feel his tackling of the WWII era was forced and uncomfortable for him. The worst part is that it shows.

Brad Pitt's performance was downright awful. If the film was more comedic in scope, his overdone accent would have worked, but as it was he looked like a cartoon character stuck into a serious drama. Uneven and all over the map, just like the rest of this film.",1
3 April 2010,Where to begin?,"This is just about the worst movie I've ever seen, not counting The Forty Year Old Virgin (which I did not finish). Well, I saw most of this one. I fast forwarded through the majority of scenes. I couldn't figure out what was funny about the sadism that seemed to be the only thing driving the completely ridiculous plot or story. I'm not sure how long the actual film runs, but even in my sped up version it was tedious as well as nauseating. I agree there was some amusing silliness in some of the scenes, but the near total lack of coherence, other than the Nazi-hating sadism that attempts to hold it together, made it difficult to appreciate. Oh, well, there's no accounting for taste, or the lack of it, either.

26 February 2011,why can't we vote zero stars?,"this really needs to be addressed ... movies like this one don't deserve any stars at all ... but we're forced to give it at least one ...

this movie is not only flat as day old soda, it is boring ... BORING ... oh yes Tarantino kills and scalps and does his usual crap but please, you still need a story ... this is nothing but inane dialogue coupled with a tired 'alternate' history ... completely worthless ... i really don't know why i keep wasting my time on his movies ... he hasn't had anything worth watching since 'pulp fiction' ... that's from 1994 folks ... so that makes two outstanding movies he made ... 'reservoir dogs' and 'pulp fiction' ... two ... the rest are average at best and, as with this one, just plain terrible but once you've had a hit in Hollywood, all you need to do is keep making movies that make money ... they don't care if they're good ... just keep bringing in the bank ... why people keep paying for crap like this is beyond me ... it took me two years to get around to convincing myself to try this movie ... and I'm p*ssed because it wasted two hours of my life ...

that's the last time Tarantino ... you won't waste any more of my life with your tired pointless crap",1

21 August 2009,"A wonderfully insane pulp fantasy; Tarantino's best since ""Pulp Fiction""","""Inglourious Basterds"". ""Inglourious Basterds"". How I love this title. I first saw the previews for Tarantino's new film at the beginning of this year, and it seemed to me a non-serious version of Bryan Singer's ""Valkyrie"" (which I haven't seen). Not being exactly a Tarantino fanboy (I love ""Pulp Fiction"" like everybody else and know he will never do anything as good again, but moderately enjoy his other films mostly for their specific qualities than for the overall results, which don't always engage me), I was very excited for this - and not only wasn't disappointed, it exceeded my expectations.

First of all, to enjoy ""Inglourious Basterds"", you have to put aside any deeply moral or analytical issues about World War II - and definitely dis consider, just for the moment, Adorno's theories about the banality of evil after Auschwitz. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is by no means a seriously intellectual, let alone humanistic, piece of work; but a brilliant, unapologetically entertaining mix of pulp, fantasy and propaganda. In Nazi-occupied France, a group of Jewish-American soldiers, led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt, whose superstar persona and charm fits the part like a glove), kills and scalps Nazis throughout the Third Reich. Their paths will cross with a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent, who had a supporting role opposite Gaspard Ulliel in the criminally underrated ""Le Dernier Jour"" and shows her full range here), whose family was massacred a few years earlier and now owns a movie theater in Paris. Shosanna has some revenge plans of her own, after Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz, Best Actor at Cannes for this performance) and a young war ""hero"", Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl, of ""Goodbye, Lenin!"") decide that Joseph Goebbels's (Sylvester Groth) new propaganda film, ""Nation's Pride"", which stars Zoller as himself, shall premiere at her venue - with the Führer himself (Martin Wuttke) among the attendees.

Highly original, extremely violent (it's Tarantino, after all), and visually intriguing, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is more than just 153 minutes of bloodbath. Filled with all of Tarantino's trademarks (even his notorious foot fetish is back, with Diane Kruger as the victim this time), great soundtrack (more discreet than usual, appropriately with more instrumental pieces than pop songs) and unique dialogue (""Let's burn down the cinema on Nazi night"" and Pitt's deliver of ""Arrivederci"" are two of my faves), this is easily his most satisfying and ambitious work since ""Pulp Fiction"". Favourite scene: a momentarily shy Zoller introduces himself to Shosanna, as she stands on top of a ladder changing the titles on the marquee of her cinema. ""In France, we respect the directors. Even the Germans"", says she. A witty, almost tender moment that epitomizes what Tarantino really is: an overgrown film buff with lots of talent, who sometimes knows how to get the best out of his lovely self-indulgence, and presents us, geeky film buffs ourselves, with wonderful treats like ""Inglourious Basterds"". 10/10.",
6 September 2009,QT's Dirtey Douzen,"After the amiably simple pleasures of seeing some hot chicks kickin' the crap out of Kurt Russell, our favourite pulpinator QT is back in his self-glorifying Kill Bill mode, which means countless more or less dubious movie references, in-your-face violence and (oh-so-)clever verbal exchanges.

To be frank, Tarantino's dialogue is partly first-class, with the opening chapter being particularly effective. And his ability to create tension and make the Nazi terror palpable should be stated to all those grumpy critics and humourless spokespersons of political correctness who don't get the gist of this huge Jewish revenge fake history joke.

But all in all, the pic's just above average: some scenes go on for too long, some jokes fall flat, most characters remain opaque and while the cinema showdown features some nice gags, the last scene (concerning Hans Landa's fate, who's, by the way, brilliantly portrayed by Christoph Waltz) isn't half as clever as it should be.

9 October 2010,I'm Speechless. Wish Tarantino was.,"I love QT's films. All of them. Until today. Inglorious Basterds, in many reviews is accosted for being to ludicrously violent. It is that. But I'm not bothered by it. It's a QT trademark, after all. It is lambasted for its absolutely ridiculous fragment of a plot. I agree that what's there is frankly, insulting. But QT has often managed to do amazing things with such plots. Problem is: It is intensely boring. there is this thing that happens to famous directors. They forget there is this concept called editing. They come to believe that their vision, their every second of imagery is heavenly treasure; that to cut a line of dialog out of, for instance, the third 20-minute conversation around a table, is to cut the heart out of their child. We're here, folks. QT has become boring. His once masterful dialog may be in there somewhere, but it's buried in stuff that would make George Lucas reach for the scissors. And that is all this movie is--talking. Sure, there's some blood and explosions, but QT dashes through the action so that he can get back to yet another stilted, pointless conversation among characters who, frequently have no role save for that conversation. Boring, boring, boring. Stupid and violent, yes, but the boredom: thats' unforgivable.",1
28 August 2010,Nothing more than American chest beating.,"Firstly, the film has merits, the action scenes are pretty good, the gore is around abou right and it does depict the brutality of ww2 well in places although it goes a little over the top in terms of what makes a film good or like its trying too hard to be shocking.

I cant give this film a good rating simply because of how much it smacks of American arrogance. The sheer idea that a group of criminals can appear in France and kill Hitler so easily with brute force is simply ridiculous.

I know tarrentino is known for his films in terms of their violence and gore, and the kill bill series was good, this simply was not. Im yet to see a film made so ridiculous that the story is so bad it ruins what would have been a pretty good film.

Im told its a film to be taken with a grain of salt...but i think you need to take an entire pot of salt with it...its watchable but id certainly never watch it again.",4

2 May 2010,Don't believe the hype,"I love Tarantino movies. In the past all his movies have had razor sharp dialogue, brilliant set pieces, great pace and plenty to keep you compelled. And for this reason, I gave two hours and thirty three minutes of my life to watch it. I really wish I hadn't. With the exception of Waltz and Kruger, the acting is pure ham. Tarantino should definitely give up casting Hollywood ""buddies"". I didn't get any sense of perspective from the story - was there a point to any of it at all?! Rambling scenes followed, and the general pace of the film was slow and limp, asides from the occasional abrupt burst of violence which often simply stopped characters from developing further. I found it very hard to feel anything for the antagonist in the movie and Brad Pitt's constant over the top accent and overacting just made me want to watch his scenes with the sound muted. Definitely Tarantino's worst film to date...a far cry from the directorial skill behind Pulp Fiction.

29 December 2009,What A Bore,"Boy i was excited for this film especially that Quentin Tarentino was going to bed involved...2 hours 32 minutes later...i was very VERY disappointed.

The Story...dull as it could ever be.A bunch of soldiers who are angry at the Nazis and decide to become ""Nazi Hunters"" and do it as a sport.Sorry did not buy it at all.As for Mr Pitt himself his performance sucked...SUCKED BIG TIME.I could not buy him as an army general and his moustache really really involved.Everyone else was bad or maybe worse than Brad Pitt.Waltz's performance...now everyone is saying that its amazing and ""oscar worthy"".Not really.I mean its good maybe the best in the film but not ""Oscar Worthy"".

This has to be Tarentino's worst film yet.Nothing in this film was as enjoyable or good as his previous classics like Reservoir Dogs,Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill.Hell it is even better than Grindhouse a film that was cheesy as love itself.

Don't waste your time seeing alternative war films that make absolute no sense whatsoever.I wanted to stop...but couldn't.",6
30 September 2009,"It has been a long wait for Tarantino fans across the world. Question is, was it worth it? The short answer is yes.","When writing a review there are normally a handful of things that stand out (either good or bad) that I know I must write about. Unfortunately Basterds doesn't have a few, there are a multitude of elements worthy of discussion. The next problem is where do I start? Tarantino's famous ear for classic dialogue? Waltz's Cannes award-winning performance? The mesmerizing music and score heard throughout? The abundance of movie references and parodies used with affection? The list is almost endless. Well, hell, let's just begin with the man calling the shots.

Tarantino has been working on this script for well over a decade. Just when we thought he was ready to make it, he decided to take time out to make his kung fu epic Kill Bill. Then he put Basterds on hiatus once again to work with long-time pal Robert Rodriguez in making the double feature Grindhouse. It has been a long wait for Tarantino fans across the world. Question is, was it worth it? The short answer is yes. It may not reach the heights of Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill Vol 1, but it is an entirely different beast altogether and succeeds on its own terms. His lengthy talkative scenes are sometimes dragged out slightly but make no mistake, this is a master of his craft at work. No word is accidental or incidental, each conversation from the mood-setting opening scene to the tense talk-off between opposing officers and onwards to the closing scene featuring two fan favourites is pieced together with intricate care and a clear love for his work. In fact, Tarantino obviously doesn't care if the audience don't get the plethora of references to German cinema or old-school war movies, he expects you to go away and see these films then revisit his cinematic opus with an even greater adoration for what you hear on screen. But fear not, he's not stupid either. He realises 99.99% of viewers won't understand these bite-sized references so never do these moments hinge on your film knowledge, just your appreciation that there is more importance to the chatter then you may know.

A picture is worth a thousand words and QT ensures that your eyes are in for a feast as well. The action as it unravels in front of you may not be quite as captivating as the dialogue however there is still one iconic visual after another, evoking all sorts of emotions. Your heart will sink when you see poor Shosanna running from the fate of her family; great delight will wash over you when you see the sanguinary Nazi-turned-Nazi-hunter Sgt. Stiglitz (Schweiger) on top of a mound cackling away; the graphic violence will have you cheering then instantly feeling guilty afterwards; and the penultimate scene (to give any more info would to give too much info) will sear itself into your brain for better or worse. In one particular breathtaking scene with French actress Melanie Laurent, Tarantino combines striking visuals with a truly exceptional song to brilliant effect.

Then there is relatively unknown German actor Christoph Waltz. Many don't realise that if Tarantino didn't find Waltz this movie may have never been made. Tarantino was adamant that this role required both an astonishing actor and someone who could speak German, English and French with equal fluency. He famously said that he would not even begin making this picture unless he had the perfect person for the job, such is the importance of the Col. Landa role. He picked the right person. Waltz makes his vivacious 'Jew Hunter' both charming and nefarious, you want to hate him but at the same time you can't help but smile when he is on screen. He won Best Supporting Actor at Cannes this year and you would hope to see him feature come Oscar time. Don't forget about the headlining Pitt either. His Lee Marvin-alike Lt. Rain is tongue-in-cheek at its best. Clearly having a blast working with Tarantino, the more talented half of Brangelina oozes charisma as he hams it up as the half-apache leader of the Basterds. His flawless comic timing has never been so apparent before. Fassbender, Bruhl, Laurent and Schweiger all offer up top shelf performances but Kruger can't quite keep up with them and Martin Wuttke's Hitler is a touch over the top.

Basterds is a self-aware romp that exists in the same world as Kill Bill's martial arts assassins, Death Proof's heroic chicks and Pulp Fiction's gangsters. Never does Tarantino try to convince us that this story belongs in our reality and nor is he ever apologetic at warping history to suit himself. Like usual he has created this following his own rules – which is to say no rules – and we thank him all the more for it.

30 January 2017,Inglourious Basterds,"""I do believe this is my masterpiece""

The final line spoken by Brad Pitt in the 2009 film, Inglourious Basterds is one I have often hoped was a declaration of director Quentin Tarantino's. I do believe Inglourious Basterds is Tarantino's masterpiece, excelling his 1992 film Reservoir Dogs, and his 1994 classic Pulp Fiction. The script is airtight with every line of dialogue having a purpose. Starring Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz-- in an American breakout performance for the ages, Inglourious Basterds exceeds the film mastery audiences have grown to expect from Tarantino.

Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) has found a home in German- occupied France harboring Jews in 1941. Landa slaughters the family with the exception of young Shosanna (Mélanie Laurent) who is able to escape. Shosanna vows to get revenge against Germany and bides her time plotting after her escape. Three years later, the cinema she owns is selected to host an illustrious movie premiere to honor German war hero Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl). Zoller immediately takes a liking to Shosanna, convincing Hitler (Martin Wuttke) through his reservations about the venue. Shosanna isn't the only one plotting a massacre at the movie premiere, however. Unbeknownst to her, a group of Jewish- American guerrilla soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Raine also have a plan for a massacre at the cinema the night of the premiere. The group who does one thing only ""kill nazi's"" have developed a plan with German movie star Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) to sneak explosives and artillery into the cinema which will be filled with German military and the high command. The two plans are developed, independently of each other, ensuring that, one way or another, Hitler will meet his demise on the night of the premiere.

I am, unashamedly so, a big fan of Quentin Tarantino's. He's one of, if not the best, modern dialogue writers, in my estimation. A script carries a film, and if the script is good, the film will usually be good, as well. No one writes dialogue like Tarantino, with the notable exception of Woody Allen. The other unique thing about Tarantino is his lack of formal film schooling or training. Tarantino never went to film school, yet amassed a wealth of film knowledge from reading an extensive amount of film history, and screenplays. Every Tarantino film is riddled with bits of film history throughout the film, making his movies a cinephile's dream. Film scores are also incredibly important to Tarantino and pivotal to his films. He is able to arrange a film score that seems like it doesn't work, only to reveal that it's perfect. I could spend decades writing about how riveting the interrogation scenes are in Inglourious Basterds, solely due to the fine script, or I could spend an equal length of time talking about how many plot points Tarantino brings seamlessly together by the film's end; Inglourious Basterds, however, is simply a film that begs to be seen and experienced first hand. The lighting, the nods to classic cinema, and every Tarantino-esque moment comes together perfectly creating a film that will be difficult for the director to top.",10
15 December 2009,Very boring movie....,"Well what can i say... When i went to watch this movie in the cinema i was excited. The start is great.But then the peace slows down and the movie turns into boring and frustrating hybrid. Yes there are good scenes which are even funny (well considered the brutality,not always ). But then again there are very few and very rare moments which deserve higher rating. This movie is a hit & miss. Some people will comment positive just because they like Tarantino. But for others who seek a good movie,this just isn't it!

I don't really like the way the movie tries to tell you a story which just isn't there.The plot is plain and very few actors took it seriously it seems.

The movie isn't the worst but nothing special and for me it was just a waste of time...

27 September 2023,"Lazy, self-indulgent film-making at its worst","Recipe for a blockbuster:

1. Find good guys just about any audience will root for and bad guys just about any audience will hate. Let's see...Jews fighting Nazis!

2. Copy a style of film-making that you - as a teenager - liked a lot, ensuring that teenagers of all ages will also love the film. Let's see...spaghetti westerns!

3. Get the hammiest of hammy actors and convince him to overact as he has never overacted before, knowing that will infect the rest of the cast. Let's see...Christoph Waltz!

4. Give the film a runtime of 150 minutes, never mind that at least 60 minutes of that are filled with self-indulgent dross. Let's see...draw out every scene of the film as if it was the most important one.

5. Get so lost in contemplating your own greatness that you stop caring about anything else. Let's see...use the tragic events of WWII as a backdrop to your childish story.

6. Throw out the following items: your artistic integrity, your heart, your moral compass and your backbone.

Repeat the above steps ad nauseam.",1

16 September 2009,"War is hell... and a lot of fun too, apparently!","For years, Inglourious Basterds was one of those films many aficionados had heard of, but never actually hoped to see: originally conceived at around the same time as Pulp Fiction, it was postponed twice when Kill Bill and Grindhouse got in the way (three times if you count the kung fu movie QT announced in late 2004 and has made no further comments about thus far). Additionally, so many rumors started circulating, be it about the script's scope (Tarantino reportedly considered making two movies, or even a TV miniseries) or the casting (at one stage or another, the film was going to star - according to various rumors - Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Adam Sandler, Eddie Murphy and the dream team of Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger), that it was safe to assume Basterds would be just another promise the director just couldn't find the time to keep. Then, all of a sudden, there it was: script completed in the summer of 2008, green-lit in record time so that Tarantino could meet the Cannes deadline and released in theaters three months after its prestigious French premiere in a ""retooled"" version (it's actually just a minute longer than the cut shown in Cannes). Was it worth the wait and speculation? As ever with QT, the answer is a resounding ""Hell, yes!"".

Starting very boldly with a 20-minute conversation between two people (a scene that reminds of the Sicilian bit in True Romance, a parallel Tarantino himself also acknowledges), the film then sets out to introduce its first main plot: the story of a French Jewish girl, Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), who manages to escape while her entire family has been slaughtered and vows revenge on all Nazis, ideally represented by the suave but cruel Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). Her story intersects with that of the Basterds, a team of Jewish-American soldiers (played by the likes of Eli Roth, The Office's B.J. Novak and Freaks and Geeks' Samm Levine) under the command of Tennessee-born Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt). Their mission? To go to France and kill (and scalp) as many Nazis as possible, with some help of the British (cue the presence of Michael Fassbender, whose real- life first language is, ironically enough, German). Needless to say, Adolf Hitler (Martin Wuttke) isn't very happy to hear about this.

Although it takes its title (sort of) from a cult film by Italian director Enzo G. Castellari, called Inglorious Bastards in the US (the proper translation of the Italian title, Quel maledetto treno blindato, would have been That Damned Armored Train), Tarantino's new opus isn't a remake. Heck, it's not even really a war movie, just like Kill Bill isn't really a revenge flick. Sure, it's set ""once upon a time in Nazi-occupied France"", as the title of the first chapter (there are five of them) informs us, and it's about American soldiers fighting against Nazis, but the joy of the movie lies in watching the director take all war movie conventions and do whatever the hell he likes with them.

Nothing in Inglourious Basterds looks or sounds conventional: for one thing, the titular characters don't appear at all in two chapters, and Raine, the alleged protagonist, is the Basterd with the least screen-time. Furthermore, the director favors long dialogue scenes (the spectacular opening, of course, as well as the La Louisiane section) over action, although the latter is pretty visceral when it shows up: blood, dismemberment and a cheeky comment about Donny Donowitz's (Roth, in a surprisingly good role) habit of beating the enemy to death with a baseball bat being the closest these guys get to going to the movies. That thin line between absolute horror and pitch-black humor is best exemplified by the Landa character, a creation so astounding Tarantino has said he wouldn't have made the movie if he hadn't found the right actor. Fortunately he found the Austrian Waltz, who justly won the Best Actor award in Cannes and deserves several more for his chilling yet immensely entertaining portrayal of a man capable of delivering eloquent speeches in four different languages (another bold move on the director's part: half of the film is subtitled) and coldly murdering innocent people with the same ease. If you put him and Jules Winnfield from Pulp Fiction in the same room, it would be one hell of a battle of wits.

And what about QT's blatant love for all kinds of cinema? It's there, perhaps even more prominently than ever before: the soundtrack pays countless homages to Ennio Morricone, who was meant to score the film at one point (the tribute includes a highly ironic use of Morricone's theme from The Battle of Algiers, whose documentary-like realism is the polar opposite of Tarantino's many deliberate excesses), most of the characters' names (most notably Mike Myers' hilarious Ed Fenech) are based on revered B-movie stars (what else?), Brad Pitt is obviously goofing around with his celebrity image, and the entire, outrageous final chapter takes place in a movie theater (plus the comment about Donowitz earlier on). Additionally, Tarantino has inserted a couple of clever in-jokes at the expense of his own universe, with a discussion about the principles of a Mexican stand-off (which occurs during an actual stand-off), scenes that mirror similar ones from his previous films and vocal cameos by people like Samuel L. Jackson and Harvey Keitel.

Sure, some might object to the joyously OTT nature of the whole thing, not least the final line which will certainly be used by detractors to prove that Tarantino is just a self-centered, cocky geek. That may be the case, but given Inglourious Basterds is a shamelessly and intelligently entertaining piece of cinema, not to mention QT's funniest and most accomplished work since Pulp Fiction, that kind of conclusion is the perfect icing on a delicious cake that true fans will want to eat over and over again.",10
19 December 2009,"Vengeance, Tarantino Style","INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is a romp that takes a bit of horrendous history and makes an entertaining film about it. For those who admire the strangely off kilter Quentin Tarantino's films, this may just appeal as his best and fanciest production yet. It is a way over the top story about revenge as carefully served out by Jewish American soldiers known as Inglourious Basterds on the Nazis who during the occupation of France sought out and murdered thousands of Jews. This may sound like a grim topic for an entertaining film, but in Tarantino's hands it becomes not only a grisly look at reality but also an at times hilarious parody.

The cast is almost secondary to the story: Brad Pitt as the leader Lt Aldo Raine sports a scarred throat and a somewhat tiresome Tennessee accent but seems to enjoy every grisly moment of his command to have all members of his division gather 100 scalps from the Nazi killers; Denis Menochet provides a sensitive opening as the French father who is hiding Jews (namely one Shosanna Dreyfus- Mélanie Laurent - whose escape from her family's slaughter begins the lead seed for the story ahead), Mike Myers portraying a German parody as only he can, Daniel Brühl, Marin Wuttke as a pitch perfect Hitler, B.J. Novak as Pitt's sidekick, Sylvester Groth as Goebbels, etc. But the crowning actor in this film is the amazingly gifted Christoph Waltz as the multilingual, sinister, smarmy, yet elegant Col. Hans Landa who drives this wild tale to its grisly conclusion.

As with all Tarantino films this is not a film for the faint of heart, but it is surprising how entertaining this sprawling story is in his hands. It goes on a bit long and is chocked full of grisly incidents, but it is fine film making.

27 August 2009,lost talent,"Tarantino hit us with the awesome Reservoir Dogs then peaked with the fantastic pulp fiction, from there on out it was down hill all the way. Jackie Brown still remains an all time low but Basterds isn't far behind. Awful, simply awful. I'd rather watch an episode of Allo Allo for an insightful examination of wartime Europe than this turd of a movie. Tarantino, a triumph of style over substance. Just another vision of an American world view, can't wait to see him bring back the Vietnam war movie (no doubt with a cameo for Sly Stallone). P*** poor in every sense of the word POOR. No doubt it'll be a hit and raved about but that won't prevent it from stinking more than a week old kipper left out in the sun on a pavement outside a gents public convenience. AWFUL.

23 August 2009,Entertaining but Tarantino is stuck in revenge fantasy mode.,"The film was promoted with the phrase ""Once upon a time..."" both a tribute to one of Tarantino's heroes, Sergio Leone, and a tip off that the film presented would be a FANTASY. Tarantino has been stuck in strictly revenge fantasy mode since Kill Bill, as the two Bill films, Death Proof, and now Basterds are all nothing but revenge fantasies. He clearly let us know he was not making a film that presented us with accurate history. The Nazis in the film serve two purposes, comic relief and symbol of evil and the violent destruction of them fulfills the fantasy.

It is well known that Tarantino does not make films that are polite or in ""good taste"" he makes films that satisfy his childhood film fantasies. I can't imagine a person walking into a Tarantino film thinking they are going to get a history lesson or learn something. This has never been the point of a Tarantino film, he makes films to pay tribute to the pop culture and filmmakers he loves so much. He is not a complex filmmaker, he is a kid in a candy store and like that kid all he wants to do is overindulge himself. The ""fun"" in seeing one of his films is watching him do so with such glee.

This film is a big goofy mess, not meant to be taken seriously, the thing is you can either laugh along with Tarantino or walk away. I won't argue that there is plenty in this film, including the ending, which could obviously be seen as ""offensive to Jews"" and some of my Jewish friends have already told me they think the film is a travesty but I think the thing is you have to try to take into consideration Tarantino's intention, which was to make a film that would make the kid in him yell ""That's so cool!"" Is that sort of dumb considering Tarantino is an adult? Sure it is, but I guess watching the film is like watching kids open presents, they are thrilled and excited to be tearing off all that pretty colored paper...not very deep but it is true.",7

13 April 2015,"Some flashes of Tarantino gold, also Nazis","This film has one of the strongest starts I've ever seen. Waltz interrogating a farmer is an absolute triumph of tension building. Tarantino lingers here for far longer than other film makers would, and it's that that pushes the scene to another level. Subsequently any scene throughout the film where Waltz features earns a measure of this same tension. Sadly everything else here doesn't quite stand up. The scene in the basement did something similar and was also enjoyable, with a strong performance from Fassbender. Aside from that, pretty much everything else is frankly ridiculous, yet I didn't find this film funny especially. The dialogue just doesn't hit home in that way very often. The Basterds particularly were both basic and uninteresting, though perhaps that was intended, who knows... I also felt the tension drained from the film towards the end, which is really the opposite of what you want. The more ridiculous and violent the film is, the less compelling it is, but Tarantino wants to get all his tropes in there rather than go with the more serious and exciting film that this truly is at times.

14 September 2018,Ultimately unappreciated.,"Waltz delivers his lines impeccably. Diane Kruger is exceptionally attractive. Hitler, Goebbels, Janning, Bormann, Goering, Churchill are not convincing. The plot is over bananas, frantic and unreal. Zoller and Shosanna both excite unrewarded sympathy, and didn't deserve their fates. The violence is ultimately off-putting. Brad Pitt's accent is also unappealing. Watchable once, but dislikable. Nearly everybody is offed. Standard Tarantino. What exactly is the message ? Revenge is the crime ?

9 March 2010,Waltz gets The Oscar ......that's about it.,"I became a Tarantino fan rather reluctantly . To be honest I had formed quite an unfavourable opinion of the fellow after watching Kill Bill many years ago .

But as they when wisdom comes slowly it comes for good. In the light of Tarantinos entire filmography , I admit he has to be one of the most ingenuous brains around in the movie making business today.

Pulp Fiction need not be cited here as an example of his ingenuity. We all know how good the movie was. Our purpose out here , however is to analyse and then give judicious responses to the movie which was titled ""Inglourious Basterds "" thereby affording Microsoft Word the opportunity to cyclically raise the spelling and grammar check warning.

This movie friends is beautifully made and true to the Director's claims, falls right in the lines of the Westerns which preceded it. Playful screenplay. Some exquisite acting and a highly unconventional form make this film a delightful piece of 21st century cinema.

Christoph Waltz dominates the screen through some splendid method acting which never allowed anyone in the movie hall to take their eyes off him. He executed his role perfectly. Linguistically one the most refined and impeccable performances I've seen. I mean to speak to Languages for a character who in the movies knows none of them perfectly is surely one great concept conceived by the writer.

Brad Pitt is not as impressive but his presence can be tolerated.

The opening seen is perhaps one the best scenes in the movie and sets the ball rolling.

Like all his movies the Director sometimes succumbs to the seductive charms of his own proclivities , thus ending up in a slightly ugly area of moribund plot progression . But then such instances are rare.

Not his best by any means though better than most other films on offer today.

I give it 8 for Waltz, who has just earned an Oscar (he should have received it in the Leading role category..!!!!!) and for the Tarantino effect in the screenplay.",8

30 May 2017,I'd like a glass of milk or whatever the heck Martin Wuttke was on,"'INGLORIOUS BASTERDS' was directed by Quentin Tarantino and stars Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Melanue Laurent. It is the first year of Germany's occupation of France. Allied officer Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) assembles a team of Jewish soldiers to commit violent acts of retribution against the Nazis, including the taking of their scalps. He and his men join forces with Bridget von Hammersmark, a German actress and undercover agent, to bring down the leaders of the Third Reich. Their fates converge with theatre owner Shosanna Dreyfus, who seeks to avenge the Nazis' execution of her family.

Inglorious Basterds is a fantastic war movie. No it is not overrated. It is rated perfectly as far as I'm concerned and is one of Tarantino's best movies. Christoph Waltz is god damn incredible in this movie and provides a truly chilling, milk obsessed villain that will go down in the greatest of cinema. I'm not exaggerating. Tarantino was at his best with this retelling of history. You know what, screw it. This IS how WW2 went down. Tarantino has convinced me of that. I defy anyone to prove me otherwise!

Let me break it down how incredible this movie is. The story is a genius intertwining of two entirely separate stories that mould into one during a simple five chapter story. This movie is so well written that it changed history. Tarantino convinced me that this was exactly how WW2 went down. The ending is perfect and mirrors the entire movie as a whole. Well done Tarantino, you done did good!

To top of the excellent story, we have a stellar star studded cast to pimp out Tarantino's epic war movie. Honestly, if Christoph 'The Milkman' Waltz didn't at least get NOMINATED for an Oscar in this movie, I would have started a riot. This was probably one of the best performances in modern movie history and sends shivers down your spine. If one man can make me fear him for ordering a glass of milk, he deserves the Oscar trophy to be redesigned after him. Accompanying Walkz' Hans Landa is Brad Pitt's awesome Aldo Raine who, while having a smaller role than expected, elevated the movie above it's previous pedestal and made me think of Brad Pitt whenever I think of WW2. The jury is still out on whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. Diane Kruger was also great as Bridger Von Hammersmark as was Michael Fassbender as Archie Hirox and Daniel Brühl as the creepy Frederick Zoller. Melanie Laurent was good as Shossana Dreyfus. Martin Wuttke was on steroids or something as Adolf Hitler. Despite possible drug use, he was great as the most evil man to grace this Earth; good look adding that to your resume.

This movie is also nearly technically flawless. The effects were great and the inclusion of blood and gore was, while not necessary, a welcome addition that was the definition of Tarantino style. I will say, however, that some shots and scenes were overly comical and it took me out of the movie for a brief short moments.

One minor, minuscule gripe is with the dialogue. Not to say it was bad, it wasn't but the movie is VERY dialogue heavy and due to the majority of it being in foreign languages, it could sometimes be difficult too keep up with the subtitles and could be sometimes frustrating to decipher what was being said. Probably not an issue for many but was certainly one for me.

You can dislike this movie all you want, I don't care. But if you dare say this movie was made up and FICTIONAL(?), I will hunt you down and... I dunno... order a glass of milk... and then shoot your floor. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie, it will change your perception on history and is honestly just an amazing war movie that will stand the test of time.",9

20 September 2009,i cant believe this movie is liked.,"boring and predictable. stereotypical pulling at emotional heartstrings. weak character development. unnecessarily drawn out conversations. I expect this sort of mediocre quality, and have in the past few years come to expect this of quentin terentino. once a blazing hope in the world of entertainment, he is fast approaching the GI Joe film in terms of ingenuity and complexity. I honestly believe that three is an 'emperors new clothes' mystique about terentino that makes people love his films no matter how boring and predictable they are. Pulp fiction was his last great film. Kill Bill series was tolerable. then came death proof, which made me cry tears of boredom, and now this.

terentino is officially a part of the Hollywood mediocre film manufacturers association. i suppose it was inevitable. mr. terrentino, if you are reading this, get back to your basics of strong characters, real life plausibility, and true drama.

you owe me 36 bucks, mr. terentino (i brought my wife, who fell asleep, and her girlfriend, who left early).

seriously, are all of the positive reviews because the world has become less complex, or do your fans accept even the weakest trash nowadays? i had hoped death proof was a simple error. if mr. terentino continues on this path he should just stop making films before the illusion that he is a great film maker wears off and people see him for what he truly is: out of ideas.",1

31 August 2009,"Once upon a time, in Nazi-occupied France...","In case you weren't already sure, no, if you insist on historical accuracy in all films that deal with actual events, this is not for you. Same if you want an action flick, in spite of the fact that the trailers do sort of make it look like one. What we have here is Tarantino(who's *probably* pretty much completely out of his mind), one of the world's biggest movie buffs, doing his thing, an homage to a sub-genre apparently called ""macaroni combat""(like ""spaghetti Western""), flicks that deal with the cathartic fantasy of the Third Reich's ""finest"" getting a big ol' spoonful of their own medicine shoved directly into their mouths. He yet again takes something he loves, a certain type of cinema, and makes something new and different out of it, without distorting it to the point where it is unclear what the root is. This is pure Quentin... full of unexpected twists, it'll make you laugh, squirm in your seat, enjoy the tunes and plain and simple, get you involved and engaged for two and a half hours where, while you can never know quite where the ride that he designed will take you, you're assured it'll be interesting and unforgettable. There are images that will stay in your mind, ideas you can't help but admire, and lines you'll find yourself quoting for a long time. The dialog... it's absolutely incredible, always well-delivered, and the use of properly spoken German, French and Italian, having subtitles and really doing something with that was fantastic. Story and plot are great and well-told, the non-linear time-line that our writer/director masters is used marvelously as usual. This is epic and amazing. Cinematography and editing are spot-on. The acting... Waltz is beyond reproach. He deserved the Cannes win. Pitt is impeccable. Roth, Fassbender, Schweiger... I could keep going. Groth and Wuttke *demand* mention as well. Myers, I realized what he played a mere second before he left the screen. Every performance is so powerful and genuine. Over the top when they need to be(there are a lot of caricatures herein), underplayed when that's the proper choice. The suspense and intensity this accomplishes is magnificent. I urge you to avoid spoilers as best as you can before watching this, and try to forget or avoid what the advertisements show you. When this goes for it, it is nasty, violent, bloody, gruesome, disturbing, has strong language and there's also brief sexuality. If you don't think you have the stomach for this, well, you may be right. I recommend this to everyone who does think that they do, and is into what QT does with the medium. As long as you don't think that this is a realistic portrayal of World War 2. 10/10",10
30 August 2009,Wait for the DVD,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz! He has won just about every award for his performance in this film, and he deserves every single one of them. Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo! He is ULTRA polite with each one; and has supreme confidence in his scary, chilling, bold mannerisms.

29 September 2010,are you kidding?,"this jackie brown meets spaghetti ww2 feature earns 8 + stars? Are you kidding. I could barely get past the first half hour before ejecting the c.d. & was filled w/ regret I made the mistake of purchasing. What a horrible movie. 8 + stars. I am truly amazed how low the bar is set @ IMDb. From the start, I could tell production was in way over its head. In the first place German soldiers would not indiscriminately fire @ the floor hoping to strike their intended targets. Instead of making a complete mess, they would of captured their prey w/ the intent of identifying & questioning their captives. Finally, the scene 'bear jew' clubs the German sergeant was laughable. Before doing his Ted Williams dance, he asked if the Iron Cross, worn by the sergeant was given for killing jews. Any partisan behind enemy lines would know better. Message to Hollywood: world war two was much more than slaughtering innocent jews. Just ask those who lived in the former Soviet Union. Sorry, this payback movie is horrible

22 August 2009,It was......alright,"I'm a huge fan of Tarantino's, but this film, monstrous let down. Don't go into this thinking you're going to see 'pulp fiction' meets 'saving private ryan', because it just ain't gonna happen.

Personally, I had no idea what to expect, and therefore went in with nothing but an open mind. No expectations, no pre-decided notions about this film. Just nothing but nothing'.

At best, I can say, this movie was....alright. I'm not going to go into detail.

Still gave it a 7/10 as it did entertain, and is presumably better than any of the other crap we'll get this year. I'm glad I saved District 9 (til after). I'll need something decent to remind me this year was not a total waste. But this film really didn't do it for me.

20 December 2010,Quentin's Worst!!,"I watched this movie because I am very fond of Quentin's direction,specially his chapterwise description,cunning dialogs and different sense of music.But it is unfortunate to admit that this movie has nothing that can be praised except the acting of Christoph Waltz,Daniel Bruhl,August Diehl.

This movie is full of flaws & acting disasters.In second half of the movie Bradd Pit was acting like he is doing mimicry of Godfather's Marlon Brando.

I was surprised to see the ratings of this movie at IMDb.I would say that it is very overrated & 8 nominations in Oscar,what were they thinking?

15 September 2009,Waaaaaaaaay too much dialog,"Although the violence in this was brutal and graphic, I think this movie lacked action. 90% of this movie was them talking about the things they were going to do or already did. I enjoyed the story of the girl getting revenge on the Nazi's that killed her family much more than I enjoyed the ""Inglorious Basterds"". I liked how all the stories ended up coming together in the end. And speaking of the ending, that redeemed the movie completely. What the girl ended up doing in the movie theater was one of the most kick ass scenes I've seen in quite some time. But the ending doesn't completely make up for the utter lack of action and extremely slow pace of the movie. About halfway through I was about to walk out, but found that my buddy was asleep, so I decided to let him rest and finish watching the movie. If you plan on going to see it, prepare yourself for Quentin Tarentino's slowest, and most boring movie he's ever done.

6 September 2009,An 150 minute carnival tour through QT's bedroom with QT as host pointing out at his one obsession: movies.,"IB is a difficult movie for me to criticize because it does nothing Kill Bill didn't do first and yet I loved Kill Bill. It does what Death Proof and its talky riot grrl trashy aesthetic did but does it better and yet clocking at 150 minutes it's more tiresome than Death Proof. It's a man's movie done by a gleeful adolescent. It has interesting characters like Aldo Raine and Colonel Landa but wastes them in the wrong movie. It's a movie about QT's wild feverish love of cinema and yet it's a love of cinema reduced to incognito winks and nods and references aimed to satisfy the hardened cinephile who can smirk at himself bemused at identifying Emil Jannings and Antonio Margheriti instead of a love of cinema for its ecstatic combination of images and sounds, for that transcendental sum so greater than its individual parts which QT himself praised in Leone's GBU.

The movie vacillates between the banal (a Basterd shooting a wounded Nazi prison guard after he groans) and the tedious (the love subplot between Jewish girl and Nazi war hero) capping that off with wild explosions of violence. It is outrageous as much for its irreverent cartoonish treatment of a horrible war as it is for expecting the viewer to accept every improbable silly plot twist (Hitler Goering Goebbels and Bormann all attending a movie premiere in occupied Paris, Landa's defection) for the very reason they're cartoonish and irreverent. Much like a dead baby joke, IB's clever set up requires you to accept its silly outrageous premise for the very qualities that mark it as such, otherwise you're not in on the joke. And much like a failed dead baby joke, IB fails in that aspect because it doesn't push the boundaries of decency far enough, because this is a movie about a band of US scalphunters facing off with a charming but horrifying Nazi villain in occupied France saddled with a lifeless heroine who polishes Henri-Georges Clouzot's name in the marquee of her cinema and needless distracting Mike Myers cameos stretching out the tightness of the plot, because it must stop on its tracks to explain how inflammable nitrate stock is (dramatize dramatize dramatize!) and drop references to Hollywood moguls Louis B. Mayer and David Selznick, because IB is a movie about QT making a movie, insulated from reality archetype or myth, vicariously presenting love grief and loss not through real life but through other movies about love grief and loss, because unlike the best of cinema IB's parts are greater than the whole, set pieces lovingly constructed, their verbosity undercut with slow-burn suspenseful tactics, strung together to support a flimsy plot.

Watching IB reminded me of how I got my first movie ideas: I would drive around listening to rousing music (Morricone often enough) and I would imagine scenes to go with the music, set pieces, cool shots, openings and closings. But writing a story requires to turn off the music and put pen to paper, not to fill the mouths of your characters with fancy dialogues, but to layer and structure and hold back when necessary and invest in subtext and dramatize not with regards to small climaxes every twenty minutes of splinters of wood exploding, gunfights in basement tavers, and cinemas erupting in flames, followed by whole slabs of exposition (like the Basterds introduction), but one slow and steady climax of character and action.

This vacuous patchwork of quirks and eccentricities reflected in the title itself, rightfully INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS and not Once Upon a Time in Nazi-Occupied France as QT intended it to be at first, because in Sergio Leone's OUATITW, the patchwork of film references created by young cineliterate writers Argento and Bertollucci is subordinate to the story, layered inside, used as tools to expose myth and archetype, whereas in IB they're applied externally as quirks independent of the story. QT did the same thing in Kill Bill but there he had the wherewithal to reward both the genre fan who picked up on the Lady Snowblood/Sex and Fury homage and the casual moviegoer who didn't with great cinema, because he introduced Sonny Chiba as Hattori Hanzo (after the famous TV series) but made him a believable character. Occasionally funny, with a good opening sequence, an outrageous climax, and a charismatic scene-stealing villain, IB suffers because there's too much QT in the movie. If every movie is a ride through the artist's world, IB is a carnival tour through QT's bedroom because he never left it to see the world, with QT as host pointing out at his one obsession: his love of movies.",

29 September 2015,Amazing!,"This is one of my new favorite films! It proves itself to be incredible in every possible way! The acting (especially that of Christoph Waltz) is great, the filmmaking, by the always masterful Quentin Tarantino, is extremely well done (the stylistic choices really enhance the film), and the film just has the right amount of everything! It has comedy, drama, revenge, action, style, Nazis! It is entertaining, and rather fun for an over 2 and a half hour long film!

The historical inaccuracy is probably what will bug most WWII fanatics. You don't even have to be into history to know that a whole bunch of the history in this film is painfully inaccurate-but it isn't really history. Tarantino's film is not a historical war piece, it is a tribute to past nazisploitation films, while still being its own work.

Also, the climax of this film is one of the greatest moments in cinema history!

28 November 2009,The most boring non-Ssian movie you will ever see,"I am a huge Tarentino fan, as I'm sue most reviewers will state. I've never not liked a QT movie until now. Kill Bill 2 was a little sloe, and I should've taken that as a cue, because this was unbearable.

First of all, 80% of the movie is in subtitles. There is an hour scene at a table for an HOUR! It is incredibly slow and has nothing to do with the plot. As do most of the scenes.

The entire movie is molasses with islands of chili powder. There are several scenes of violence sprinkled throughout in true QT fashion, but they are NOT worth it. I had to watch this movie in 30x and it was still boring as HELL! For the love of god, if you like Tarentino, please do not watch this. This is 3 hrs of torture. QT is not go, and he can fail, so PLEASE do not be a pandering ass-licker.

31 December 2010,Unwatchable,"Tarantino has shown himself as a master at building dramatic tension through dialog. In its finest moments, this film showcases this talent; unfortunately for me, too much of the film is spent indulging the director in his less admirable qualities. His scenes of shocking violence are irreverent and integral to the cartoon story he portrays in Reservoir Dogs (in my opinion his only significant work), however they are wholly inappropriate here. He manages the incredibly difficult task of insulting the memory of the honorable men and women that served on both sides of this despicable conflict. Having said that, if the director's role is to encourage his cast to deliver exceptional performances, then I hope Christopher Waltz surpasses this performance in a film worth recognizing for its quality. He was superb.

11 September 2009,Quentin Tarantino Is One Glourious Basterd,"""Inglourious Basterds"" ain't your grandfather's WWII picture. And Quentin Tarantino would most definitely take that as a compliment.

Tarantino has made a career out of making art out of trash, and he does so again with his latest combustible and outrageously entertaining movie. He throws a bunch of B-movie tropes, some anachronistic music and his own version of historical events into a blender to make a WWII movie for a new generation.

Tarantino gives us several narrative threads to follow, and then, in a wink to his love of movies and to the delight of us cinephiles, has them converge in a Parisian movie theater during the debut of an epic Nazi propaganda film, where two separate groups have planned a mass assassination of the Third Reich's major leaders (yes, Hitler included).

One of these groups is the owner of the cinema, a Jew in hiding named Shosanna (Melanie Laurent), and her lover, who plan to use heaps of nitrate film stock to burn the theater down as payback for the murder of her family by the Nazis. The other group consists of the basterds of the film's title, a dirty dozen style tribe of Nazi haters who scalp most of the Nazis they come across and whose leader is a redneck American called the Apache and played by Brad Pitt. Bridging these two narrative threads is the character of Hans Landa, played ferociously by Christoph Waltz in an Award-worthy performance, a detective working for the Reich who was responsible for the murder of Shosanna's family and wants nothing more than to wipe out the basterds.

As usual, Tarantino's love of movies is apparent in every frame, but I think ""Inglourious Basterds,"" to the extent that it's about anything, is about not just the adoration of an art form but also respect for its power. The use of film as propaganda is a recurring motif throughout the movie, and the climax is nothing but one sustained image of the film's power made literal.

People who want to dislike this movie will have no problem doing so, as Tarantino certainly does not make movies that set out to please the masses. Groups will undoubtedly bristle at the disrespect with which Tarantino treats history, and I suppose they're entitled to do so, but I also think they'll be missing the point. Tarantino isn't out to make a historical document; he's out to make a movie and he asks us to have fun with it. I for one found it easy to oblige.

Grade: A",9
30 October 2010,Atrocious,"How this film managed to get the rating it has is beyond me since it is utter swill. I could go into detail and list all of the things so terribly wrong with it, but I feel that most of those have been covered by other reviewers who thankfully had the presence of mind to see it for the rubbish that it really is. And to think this came from the same director who made ""Pulp Fiction"".

To keep it short, this film is a waste of time and intelligence. I'd normally give this a zero star rating. Sadly, that's not possible. I'm glad I was able to directly delete it from my computer's hard drive.

Now if only I could erase this atrocity that easily and quickly from my memory. Ugh :(

3 May 2020,"Well, Well, Well, How the Turntables!","Set in Nazi-occupied France with solid dialogues in four languages, vivid violence, a young Jewish girl, bloodthirsty American soldiers, a grand Nazi night and plans to take down the Third Reich that you wouldn't find in any history books. Quentin Tarantino's attempt to right the wrongs of the past brings to life one of his finest films- a dark, comic fantasy.

Inglourious Basterds unfolds in five chapters and features one of the best opening scenes.The fifteen minutes segment introduces us to the ambitious, ironic and fantastical Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), Nazi Sherlock Holmes, interrogating a farmer for the whereabouts of the Jewish Dreyfus family. Waltz's impeccable performance blends charm with villainy and earned him the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.

The second chapter introduces the Basterds, led by the cool and comical Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), infamous for their barbearic (pun intended) ways of warfare. The British send in one of their own, Lt. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender), a film critic war hero, with a plan spiced up by the gorgeous German actress Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger).

Coinciding with their plan is that of the vengeful Shosanna Dreyfus' (Mélanie Laurent). Her story is the film's heart and helps connect the dots. Laurent plays the role our traumatised heroine elegantly. She is symbolic of what a persecuted people feel under tyrannical foreign rule which sometimes manifests itself as the constant annoying presence of Pfc. Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl), the poster boy for Nazi propaganda.

Not for the fainthearted, Tarantino stylises violence to the point of cathartic sadism doused with comic relief. Some scenes get so nerve-wracking that even four languages are not enough to describe them and rely on emotions. The movie culminates with a cataclysmic ending at Shoshanna's cinema. The outright unpredictability makes it engrossing from beginning to end despite its long runtime, leaving us wondering how the tables turned (pun intended).",10

27 January 2010,Not that good,"I figured since it is getting all these acclaims for Best Picture I should see it. Well, I wasted my time honestly. The only movies that are legitimate for Best Picture are Avatar and The Hurt Locker.

I didn't want to see this movie to begin with because I think Tarintino make STUPID movies anyway. Then a friend told me I'd like it...FALSE. This is another one of those STUPID movies he makes. All of the funny/good stuff was in the previews, that's it, save yourself some time and watch a trailer. The movie just drags and drags and drags. Did I mention it drags? My butt fell asleep it took the movie that long to get over with. Please, Mr. Tarintino, come up with something other than blood and gore. It was OK for part of the movie, then it got old. To be honest this movie was lucky I initially gave it 6/10...it honestly is really a 4/10, but I guess I was in a good mood from watching The Hurt Locker right before this one. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie.

8 April 2023,Somewhat of a turning point for Tarantino,"There's a scene in Inglorious Basterds where the Nazi's are cheering on a film depiction of one of their most highly praised war heroes, a sniper who killed over 300 Allies. As they cheer for ""our"" onscreen deaths, we as an audience wait in eager anticipation for theirs, for the cathartic fulfillment of a revenge fantasy. The Nazi deaths, when they come, are not cathartic, but sickening and appalling in their unflinching brutality. The film throws the audience's lust for violence back in its face. The impulse toward violence is not exclusive to Nazi's, but a common human trait.

The promotional material for this movie gives the viewer the false impression that it is a Dirty Dozen homage about a ragtag group of Nazi hunters who beat, shoot, and scalp their way across Germany. In reality the Basterds are but one of several intertwining plot threads. The film is more interested in emotionally charged conversations, hidden identities, and subtle expressions of body language than in a stock plot about Nazi killers.

Inglorious Basterds is often overwhelmingly suspenseful and engrossing, but I could never completely lose myself in the world of this film. It somewhat feels more like a well rehearsed and intricately constructed stage play than an immersive movie experience. Tarantino indulges in stylistic choices - occasional narration, cutaways, a character title card, frequent cinematic references - that are fun to watch but leave the impression that this is a movie that knows it's a movie, and wants the audience to know that too. The real historical characters in this movie - Goebbels, Hitler, Churchill - are seemingly based more on cinematic caricatures of those people than on the people themselves. Brad Pitt's character is a welcome injection of humor and warmth, but his character feels like it has been transplanted from a 1960's war movie. The Basterds are rarely given any depth beyond one or two characteristics. The best moments of the movie are when Tarantino released the reins and simply let's the story unfold itself, as in the opening scene with the hidden Jews and the conversation in the Nazi tavern.

There is a self awareness, a sense of tight, mannered control here that was not present to this extent in Tarantino's earlier films. Although I prefer movies that are more immersive, less self consciously stylized, I still must recommend this movie as a singular feat of filmmaking craft.",8
25 August 2009,I'm a well informed Tarantino critic . . .,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz!

Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo!

21 December 2009,Tarantino's Best Since PULP FICTION,"I never would've thought Quentin Tarantino could successfully apply his style of story-telling to historical fiction set in World War II, and I'll never doubt him again. This movie went above and beyond any expectations I had going in, and it's Tarantino's best film since 1994's PULP FICTION. I've read multiple mentions through the years that Tarantino would be creating his WWII epic but after a while, I figured it was just rumors. I'm glad to find I was mistaken. In the film, a series of plots to assassinate Adolph Hitler and the key members of the Third Reich are put into play by a French/Jewish cinema owner (Mélanie Laurent) and a Jewish-American strike force known as the Basterds, led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt).

Simply put: if you're a fan of Tarantino's previous films, then you will most likely love his newest. It's got everything we've come to expect: sharp dialogue, a great story with engaging characters, and the usual visual flair with a killer soundtrack to back it up (this time borrowing heavily from those films providing the writer/director with his inspiration. Just as he's done in the past (as with PULP FICTION and KILL BILL), the film is divided into chapters and culminates in a final chapter when the all of the plans come together into an explosive conclusion.

In an ensemble cast, it's rare that any one actor or actress should stand out so far above the rest but, while the entirety of the cast did an incredible job, it was Christoph Waltz who stole my attention in every one of his scenes. A German actor, unknown to American audiences, Waltz's performance as Colonel Hans Landa (or, as his enemies know him, the Jew Hunter) was amazing. He was charming, charismatic, well-mannered, and evil...a villain reminiscent of Hannibal Lector and just as memorable. All of the award nominations he's received for his performance here are well-deserved. I've also got to give credit to Pitt for a great performance as Raine, adopting a heavy Southern drawl and roughing himself up to the point where I lose him in his performance and forget for a while that I'm watching Brad Pitt.

To be honest, each of the cast did a fantastic job, with only one of them grating on my nerves a bit. Eli Roth did a fine job as Sergeant Donny ""The Bear Jew"" Donowitz but he was annoyingly over-the-top at points. Still, it's never enough to ruin a scene and you won't be pulled out of the movie. I absolutely loved this movie and I hope most others will give it a chance before passing judgment. I realize the 2.5 hour runtime will be a discouraging factor to some but I can reassure you there isn't a single moment in the movie where the pace slows. If you're anything like me, the end credits will start rolling and you'll actually wish there was more.",10
22 November 2011,Quentin Tarantinos crazy World War II show.,"After my second attempt to watch this film, i have to hold up my hands and admit that i was wrong. On first attempt, i felt the film was handicapped by Tarantinos writing style, i felt as though the characters in the film all sounded like Quentin which i felt was a problem. The second time i saw it, i relaxed a lot more and just let the film play. I must say, i enjoyed the strands of the story very much and the individual set pieces were very well acted and directed. The use of language was also very effective, French, German and English all play a crucial role in the film at various points. The performances are also a lot of fun and huge credit must go to Christoph Waltz for what is a the best depiction of a Nazi since Ronald Lacey in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. So, another big success for Quentin Tarantino, and a film that plays a lot better if you just forget he is in the directors chair and just enjoy it for all its madcap, gory brilliance.

15 December 2009,Outstanding,"During WWII, a U.S.Army Unit called the Basterds led by Lt. Aldo Raine (Pitt) go on a Nazi killing spree and attempt to end the war by getting Hitler and his chief officers in one fell swoop. Not a true story.

I almost didn't take this movie out because the promos made it seem like a unit of American soldiers went to Germany in the 1940s and acted like a band of wild Indians on a killing spree shooting and scalping Nazis. So the promos didn't do a good job of promotion for me. But, I took a chance hoping I wouldn't see what I saw in the promos: silliness, recklessness, ugly American behavior, and unfunny wise-cracks.

However, I did see and hear all of that, but not in the quantity the promos seemed to indicate. This was a very well done movie and things were spaced out quite nicely. The DVD box said this was a revenge movie (hey, you finally read one). In other words, the story was all fiction. Things didn't happen this way.

I got annoyed (here we go) with 2-things. Some scenes really took their time to develop, but looking back I see the sense of dragging them out (still didn't like it though, did you?). And, the other thing was the over-use of Sub Titles. Some sentences were too long and you had to focus on the words and not on the actors. Someone ought to make a law that declares over–use of Sub Titles are against the law. Hey, they didn't need them in Valkyrie, did they? Go back and take a look at the 13th Warrior and see how Sub Titles were handled there. Both are great movies btw.

What I didn't expect to experience in here was tension and there was that, and I suppose the dragging out of some scenes contributed to it. It worked.

There is some gore in here. Some scenes will show someone being scalped (like the Indians did it?) and that is not a pleasant sight (turned away, did you?).

The acting, dialogue and action scenes (no CGI?) were all terrific, outstanding in fact. Brad Pitt is always good, but special attention needs to be paid to Christoph Waltz who played German Colonel Lande. He played the always suspicious SS Officer to the hilt and was outstanding (using that word a lot, aren't you?)

Unless I missed it, the word ""basterds"" origin was never explained. I guess it just seemed like part of a nice title.

The promos could have given this movie more credibility. You just have to see for yourself.

15 February 2020,Quentin Tarantino's WW2 movie!,"Not repeating what others have said about this movie, I can only confirm the fact that the movie is great. It's acting and pacing are top notch, making every second of it a joy. Sadly, Tarantino gives himself liberty with the facts and while that doesn't make the movie less appealing and fun, it does make it to have a far less impact on us as the viewers that way. In the other hand, I'm glad that this movie isn't another ""Schindler's List"", but rather just a good WW2 movie that at the end of the day still doesn't take itself too seriously, while being about a serious theme. And that's Tarantino for you, ladies and gentleman. It's not a perfect movie. But sure is a very good one. 8/10 and a warm recommendation! :D

16 March 2017,Ingloriously Boring,"In German-occupied France, young Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus witnesses the slaughter of her family by Colonel Hans Landa.

Narrowly escaping with her life, she plots her revenge several years later when German war hero Fredrick Zoller takes a rapid interest in her and arranges an illustrious movie premiere at the theater she now runs.

With the promise of every major Nazi officer in attendance, the event catches the attention of the ""Basterds"", a group of Jewish- American guerrilla soldiers led by the ruthless Lt.

Aldo Raine. As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history.

Wow this movie is one plodding boring mess.

28 February 2022,One of the worst war movies ever,"It's typical Tarantino, just made up rubbish with a few factual references thrown in. The characters are ridiculous and make a mockery of some brave people who went through WW2. This ""film"" is an insult to their memories. As usual Pitt plays a hero who seems untouchable and gets away with every thing he wants to do, the rest are cardboard cutouts of people All in all I tried to enjoy this film but I found it dreadful.

3 January 2021,Well that was fantastic,"I was hopes was very high after reading the reviews and the size of the rating. Also for the fact it took Quentin Tarantino a decade to write it. I was confused for a little bit but then it all picked up and I understood what the hell was going on. I wasn't aware there would be so much subtitles so I had to put my phone down and be completely be locked in for it.

22 October 2019,Tarantino being Tarantino.,"Absolute masterpiece by Tarantino. Scenes are very well shot and crafted, especially the bar sequence in the middle. There is a great mix of Tarantino action, acting, and storytelling here. Christopher Waltz gives the best performance by far, but the supporting cast are all good. Tarantino always offers original storytelling and it is nice to see this in a franchise driven Hollywood.

14 January 2014,"Risky, Unique, Fresh, And Fun","Many people regarded Death Proof as a disappointment and they were all hoping that Tarantino will come back to his best form in his next film, though I did think highly of Death Proof, and what a come back he did. Inglourious Basterds is his 6th film and it shows Tarantino going back to the things that made his film great whilst doing something unique.

Inglourious Basterds is written by Quentin Tarantino, and he has definitely made something fantastic here. Tarantino here has brought back the non-linear approach to his storytelling. He dedicates the first three chapters of the film as an introduction to the key players of the last chapter, and having the 4th Chapter 'Operation Kino' as the driving plot point. It kept me hooked because with each chapter, as he adds on more information that we didn't know which builds it all up for the last two chapters of the film. The film shows off entertaining and quirky characters, which hasn't been found in his films since his 90's flicks. Tarantino has given his characters much more depth here than most of his previous films would give, and he continuous it with his next film, and it does allow me to connect with these characters more and understand their inner workings due to their given back-stories. The dialogue in this film is top notch, at times very reminiscent of the style that was used for Pulp Fiction, as it kept me more interested as more words come out from these characters. To some people, they may see it as a return to Tarantino's indulgent style of dialogue but that's what makes his films special in the first place, so the more the better.

Not at all did the film bore me, this is because Tarantino is in love with his own dialogue and he makes it the star of the scene. Tarantino fills the scene with dialogue, as a build up of sorts towards the violent and explosive ending that the scene needs in order to be relieved and pumped for what comes next. As I said before the non-linear storytelling of the film and using the bulk of the film to create and introduce it's characters, it doesn't get boring as it doesn't repeat itself and always give off something new. Some people find a lot of Tarantino's films to have a pacing problem and I can understand where they are coming from, but Inglourious Basterds is one of those films that felt like it moves forwards all the time regardless how still a scene may seem because it keeps throwing interesting things your way and in a lot of scenes, Tarantino was able to convey tension that keeps you on the edge of your seat thinking something might happen. Tarantino has used non-English dialogue with subtitles in his previous films, Kill Bill, and now he has put that up front with this film, using it as a style in making this film unique and allowing the film to feel more genuine.

Robert Richardson is back to do another of Tarantino's film and with each film I start to see a connection and understanding of each other's visions. Richardson understands what the film needs to create that homage atmosphere that Tarantino intends his films to look like. Richardson and Tarantino has brought back their trademark shots like long takes and the trunk shot. Because this film is a dialogue driven film, Richardson contains a lot more closeups than his previous films and this does allow us to get in touch with these characters and see the emotional rumblings that they hide behind the facade due to the current situation, especially Melanie Laurent's character. The film's photography seems to strip away the over saturation of it's colors, like Kill Bill and Death Proof, and takes a more darker and grimier look for the film.

The film doesn't contain a composer writing an original score, instead it uses soundtracks that are more score driven. The tracks that are chosen are Sergio Leone/Ennio Morricone inspired, which on paper would be an odd choice as it suits more of the Western era but after seeing this film, you hardly even notice it and at the end you realize that it actually works. There are specific moments that are supported by a track that makes the moment seem perfect but Tarantino has the habit of cutting it off and not giving the scene a proper conclusion, which gives off a comedic feel and prevents it from being too melodramatic.

Brad Pitt may be seen as the frontrunner of the film but the film is more of an ensemble piece. The first three chapters are dedicated to a certain character(s), and this allows these actor(s) to shine in their segments. Brad Pitt definitely brings a surge of energy in this film, working with a character that feels almost specifically written for him. The other standout was Christoph Waltz, playing a character that has a personality that I have haven't seen before. Waltz brings such charm and personality to a character that is regarded by most people as the ultimate Jew killer. Tarantino has used an international cast before but not as diverse as this film. Inglourious Basterds has made a star and showcased the talents of actors like Melanie Laurent and Daniel Bruhl. Though Michael Fassbender has been on films before this like 300 but this film put him on the map, the bar scene segment was tense and thrilling and a part of it is due to Fassbender's performance.

Inglourious Basterds is a remarkable film and a demonstration of Tarantino's ability to take something that has been used a billion times in films and make it feel fresh and unique. The film boasts wonderful dialogue, amazing sequences, fantastic performances front actors, smart choice of music, and excellent photography. Inglourious Basterds is a rival for the number one spot for my favorite Tarantino films.",10
10 May 2010,Really??!!,"First of all, i love war movies. I've watched more movies in that category than any other category.

This is not a war movie. Its a parody of a war movie. I tried to watch this three times and fell asleep every time. It was tedious, boring and dull. If you seek a war movie, this is NOT it. The overacting from Mr. Pitt is beyond Jim Carrey normal role interpretations. If you are looking for a war parody but without a sense of humour, you've found it.

What it seems to me is that Mr. Tarantino lost his way with this movie. I'd like to know what went through his mind making this movie. Did he meant it to be like a b-version of a war movie or he just tied up the bag before the cat escaped?

This cat should've been shot with a shotgun long before ever been exposed to camera...

12 November 2022,Buongiorno e Arrivederci,"My friend and colleague was looking for a good war film to watch for Remembrance Day. I discovered he had not seen this, and that was something I could not abide.

'Inglourious Basterds' also just so happens to be my favourite Tarantino film. Beginning to end, I find myself thinking how perfect the dialogue is. Waltz seems to have come out of nowhere and gives a performance for the ages, like seriously. We all know Pitt, and this is arguably my favourite character that he has ever played.

Needless to say, my friend could not believe he had not seen this before and was blown away. Waltz gave him chills, and Pitt gave thrills.

31 August 2009,Ehhh... Nothing Special,"This comment is a very generous 6 stars out of 10. This is not Quentin Tarantino's best. I realize when viewing a film you should willfully suspend your disbelief but that is not the problem here. I am more than willing to watch far fetched historically inaccurate movies. Inglourious Basterds was simply a horrible idea. This movie lacked any and all good qualities a movie should have.

Plot Development. There were some entertaining scenes that were preceded and followed by very long and quite boring scenes.

Dialogue. The subtitles are exhausting and take away from enjoying the essence of the acting, plot development, and cinematography throughout basically the entire 153 minutes.

Character Development. There were hardly any sufficiently developed characters. Brad Pitt had some comical dialogue but was hardly a likable character. Like all of the other characters(except Col. Hans Landa) his lacked any sort of complexity whatsoever. Christoph Waltz (Col Hans Landa) puts on a flawless performance and is probably the best and most well developed character. Waltz brings a delightful talent to the screen, which was unfortunately surrounded by sub-par and adolescent writing/direction.

I'm usually able to stomach distasteful gore in a movie if it can be supported by a worthwhile story but Inglorious Basterds was not one of these experiences. The film was not really even titled accurately. Certainly there were ""inglourious basterds"" but they didn't even contribute enough to have a whole movie titled after them.

In summary, this was 153 minutes of Tarantino's sick and twisted day dream. I am a big fan of his but this one just lacked the talent and creativity we all know he has. I think people who enjoyed this were probably just too excited to really watch and evaluate it carefully just because it was a Tarantino film. Plus it was exponentially better than Death Proof so I suppose he's made a small step up. ha.",6

No historical accuracy. some violence? If you liked the movie for its violence, then ...well then this movie is in your category. You must've liked the Hostel and Hostel2 too.:)

4 September 2009,Adolsecent and indulgent but such fun,"I deliberately didn't read reviews of Quentin Tarrantino's latest offering before seeing the movie, but it was clear that the ratings of the reviewers were all over the place. Since I knew that the story was centred on a ruthless bunch of American-Jewish soldiers in 1940s occupied France, I was expecting tons of violent action like ""Kill Bill Part 1""; instead I found a five-chapter construction with extensive scenes of dialogue (much in German or French) making it much more like ""Kill Bill Part 2"". As a writer, Tarrantino gives his actors some cracking lines and, as a director, he allows those actors time to deliver them with immense style. The soldiers of the title feature much less than one might expect and the shooting comes in short but vicious bursts.

Of course, this re-imaging of the Second World War represents an utterly preposterous narrative but, if one surrenders to Tarrantino's adolescent and audacious vision of how he would have liked things to have gone, then this movie is enormous fun and, for a semitophile like me, something akin to what one reviewer called ""kosher porn"". There are some excellent performances - including Brad Pitt as Tennessee leader of the Basterds and Mike Myers virtually unrecognisable in a support role - but Tarrantino's casting discovery Christoph Waltz is simply outstanding as SS Colonel Hans Landa aka 'The Jew Hunter'. It may be long (two and a half hours) and it may be self-indulgent, but it is full of suspense and holds the attention throughout.

Whatever the film's scale of commercial success (and it should do well), this is a piece of auteurism destined to be a staple of many a film course since its reverence for the movies and countless allusions to specific works imbue almost every scene. It starts with the title, a corruption of the American title for an 1978 Italian B-movie, where the mis-spelling is never explained but is the first indication of QT's compulsive quirkiness. It ends with the last line of dialogue - ""I think this just might be my masterpiece"" - in which the director (none too subtly) is telling us something. In between, we have music from spaghetti westerns, a character who used to be a film critic, frequent references to German movies, a bar game involving a film title, a climatic scene in a cinema, and much much more.",

19 August 2018,Politically tainted // Excellent cinematic experience,"Let's start with
the good: Tarantino every once in a while is going to get into a zone and produce a superb concept, style and atmosphere and this time he made Inglorious Basterds. The concept was really good here as far as a purely cinematic experience. It's realistic and enticing from that very first scene, arguably one of the best intros ever. The rest of the film is a succession of equally powerful scenes, intense/suspenseful or flat out explosive, sometimes graphic.


The characters are lots of fun, almost comic book like for some (well for most, really). The subplots and independent little stories each bring lots of positives and an ongoing dynamism to the film which never lets down pace wise. We're fed a ton of entertainment, but not in a linear or repetitive way (as with all action films), and with each progression there's new suspense or climaxes to be met.

Some characters have remained classics among the young mainstream, as well as certain quotes.

Technically, there's a great melding of all traditional cinematographic genres: romance, comedy, action, historic, drama... and the film is consistent at being just as good when it starts as when it finishes, without any drop in intensity, or quality, all the way til the end.

It's just got that contagious and exciting aura and movie magic that only very few pictures manage to generate. It's special, and if you're intrigued by the start, you'll not want to look away for all 2h33 of it.

-The bad: the film carries a strongly partisan view and hijacks over-the-top tongue in cheek comedy as a pretext to push its own agenda. This isn't a film that you could call politically neutral, at all. Too bad as the rest was so good as contemporary cinema, but the non-cinematic commentary and motive of the film taint it quite badly. Easily could've done without the politicizing, and just focused on the fun and strong cinema it is otherwise.",5

His psychological torture was excruciating and was never more evident when he ordered her a milk during the famous cafe scene. This was a subtle but undeniable form of dominance reminding her that he had not forgotten their brief encounter on the dairy farm.

29 April 2010,Well made garbage,"Inglourious Basterds is cinema of the immature, of the man-child, of the loser film geek, of the fan-boy.

It does not nourish the soul nor does it feed the mind. It's masturbatory and narcissistic... it might be the perfect reflection of what American culture has become. It's empty macabre fun, it's the cinematic equivalent of binge drinking.

Basterds is very well made bad film. Tarrantino's script is overly wordy and strains at being clever. Clichéd lines abound - see anything the Superstar Celebrity and terrible actor Brad Pitt spoke.

The film's biggest sin is that it is, yet again, a movie about movies. Tarrantino's last three films have been the same thing. When will he stop cribbing from the genres he loves and think up an original idea for a film? My guess is never. Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs were audacious flukes by a young video store clerk. The middle aged man who wants to re-imagine movies from his favorite film genres bores me.

Tarrantino chronologically- One Good movie, one great movie, one fair movie and the rest are garbage. His movies are overly examined and justified by sycophantic fans trying to find a touchstone to the ""true cinema"". A bit of advice to them- go watch the movies Tarrantino steals from for touchstones. His synthesis of regurgitated cinematic genres gives us nothing new... except for shining a light on the excesses of our pop culture -""oh dude! Did u see how that guys head came off with a samurai sword in Kill Bill 2?! AWESOME!"" This is what happens when a video store clerk/film geek/pot head gets to live out his fantasy.

The night of the 2010 Golden Globes, as Scorsese is receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award for a lifetime of achievement in film, the cutaway to Tarrantino after the film clips from Scorsese's career is jolting. Tarrantino is scowling. He looks as if something sour flashed across his palate. I then realized that Tarrantino barely belonged in the same room as Scorsese. Maybe he realized it too.",2
3 September 2009,Wer oder was ist ein gefreiter Butz? Great!,"I watched it yesterday and (not really a surprise there) it's really a great movie. the trailer promised a little more action than the actual film delivered, but thats OK. (kill bill 2 didn't have a lot of action and it worked just fine.) but i'd like to point out one aspect of the movie that really amazed me. being swiss, i'm very sensitive when it comes to German or French in American movies. i'm used to hearing awfully pronounced German lines in big Hollywood productions. i always say to myself come on, seriously? you couldn't afford a decent vocal coach, or do you simply give a f...? inglorious basterds is loaded with German and French and it sounds wonderful!!! what a pleasure! Quentin t, thank you for choosing German actors and by doing so making the movie a lot more authentic! he even jokes about the language problems by having brad Pitt killing the Italian word 'grazie'. hilarious! well, thats what i wanted to add to the (probably) hundreds of comments already existing. No need to point out the other good qualities of the movie, i'm sure thats already covers a dozens of times!

29 November 2009,Inglourious Rubbish,"This movie makes it obvious that Quentin Tarantino has a very narrow vision when it comes to creating movies. His interests are American low-lifes, violence and film-making. He is very aware that people hailed his movies for the clever dialogs, so of course he adds those as well. Picture this, now we take all of the ingredients above and turn it into a German WWII movie. Whereas the genre-bending style of Kill Bill was quite successful, in this case it is a complete failure. Most of the dialogues are just clever to be clever and have the overhand in the entire movie. Quentin already went overboard with dialogs in Death Proof, boring the viewer to death and partly saving the movie with the great final 15 minutes. I won't explain how much the movie fails in creating a realistic picture of WWII, as that was obviously not the purpose of the movie. The theme hardly adds anything to the story, except for the fact that killing nazi's is a tagline that Quentin has probably been wanting to use for a while. Overall the movie does have its moments in which it is entertaining, but overall it is more boring than entertaining. Of course the movie gets high ratings because it was made by Tarantino. As a big fan of his previous work I wonder how so many people lose their ability to see that this movie just isn't up to par with classics like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. Please Tarantino, stick to the US of A with the theme of your next movies and use the clever dialogs/situations when they are appropriate.",5
1 May 2015,Moronic Inferno,"I wish I could give this a zero. It's undeniable that Tarantino has some cinematic flair, though Jackie Brown is the only film of his I can tolerate. In this film he does create some interesting situations. But it's basically amoral trash that seeks to implicate the audience in its moronic inferno. It's the story-telling of someone who feels like an impressionable and highly unsophisticated adolescent. I can't really work my way into the world that Tarantino inhabits... His aesthetic is that of someone who has never lived, like some brilliant but tragically retarded child who has been deprived of humanity, locked alone in some film vault that happens to be filled with the best bad films ever made. The result is a series painstaking homages to exquisite awfulness. This film in particular is reprehensibly stupid and lacking in the basic human qualities that separate civilized people from the oh-so-evil Nazis. A fantasy orgy of revenge violence to what end? How is an audience that could enjoy a film like this any better than the people it parodies and so delights in tormenting?

11 April 2012,A Wild Ride,"Inglorious Basterds might be Quentin Tarantino's most complicated story line yet. World War II is the setting and it opens at at a French farmhouse where the owner is suspected of hiding Jews. He is interrogated by a Nazi Colonel Hans Landa; played by Christoph Waltz in an Oscar winning performance both chilling and hilarious at the same time. After denials, a hidden family is given up and one, Shosanna, escapes.

Brad Pitt is Lieutenant Aldo Raine, and his mission is to recruit eight Jewish-American soldiers to sneak behind enemy lines and kill as many Germans as possible. He requests 100 scalps as trophies from each man. Pitt is over the top in an almost comic book fashion, but this is Tarantino's baby.

In the meantime, Shosanna has become a French woman named Emmanuelle who owns a movie theater in Paris. She meets Zoller, a German hero who is the subject of a Lenin Riefenstal type of propaganda film and he introduces her to Joseph Goebbels and she offers her theater for the premiere of the movie, with the plan to assemble as many higher ups as possible in order to kill them in retaliation for the massacre of her family.

The last chapter is classic Tarantino, a complete fantasy with the Nazi's looking like Hogan's Heroes. Revenge is sweet and so is Inglorious Basterds.",9
21 November 2009,An unbiased review for everyone!,"Inglourious Basterds. Note that the five star rating is NOT because the film is mediocre, by any means. It simply falls in the dead middle of the spectrum. You'll either love it, or hate it, plain & simple.

Myself? Well first off, I had no clue what to expect from this film. Having not seen so much as a preview, prior to viewing it, my only knowledge on-hand was that it was QT's new flick, it had a good rating on IMDb, and that the gist of the story revolved around a ""secret"" US outfit sent in to terrorize/kill/maim Nazis, in order to spread fear among the German ranks.

After watching it, I left with the same impression as I went in with: It is QT's new film about a group of Nazi killers during WW2. I was thoroughly entertained, and that is pretty much that =] Was it groundbreaking cinema? No, lol, not in the least. Was it a Tarantino flick? 100%

After browsing the scores of positive reviews on this, I think that no matter who you are (and this is mostly directed at those who disliked the film), you have to admit one thing: Tarantino has his finger on the pulse of Generation Y. And that, in itself, is gold.

Pros:











Cons:







On a final note, I'll just say that any cons, including others that I didn't bother to list, can be easily dismissed with one fact: It's a Tarantino film. I definitely recommend checking it out and deciding for yourself. If not for originality alone - I have to give it a thumbs up =]",5

BUT, again, and to hint back to my title - this is re-writing history! What did George Orwell say about that? From STUDYING history I learn that the National Socialists were fighting Russia in the East AND THE UK AND U.S.A in the west! How about that huh? Without getting into conspiracy theory, suffice to say that what happened to the jews by the Germans is NOT what modern cinema tells u! Spielberg's SHOAH Foundation Proves this! These types of films simply continue to tell the lie. So 10 year old children will go online and say, ""I hate Nazis!"" - They do not even know what they are speaking about. Their actual words do not refer to ANYTHING! It really feels as though these films simply detract from honest history and In my opinion telling FANTASY - such as this film - only works against Truth.

I'm not against Fiction! I love some of Tarantino's work. Yes! Pulp Fiction, LOVE IT! But, we must have balance.",2
16 November 2021,Well made!,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz!

He is ULTRA polite with each one; and has supreme confidence in his scary, chilling, bold mannerisms.

5 March 2011,I'd recommend it as a sedative,"It took me at least 5 tries to finish the movie. I don't know what, but this movie gets me to sleep in an instant. It is that boring. Where can I begin, lets start with Hitler himself. He's portrayed more as a mental patient than as a dictator, and whats with the cut scenes ? It was like watching some old fashioned drama. This topic of holocaust has been beaten to death by most directors and this one tries to bring it back to life again. Move on guys, I mean there are many more dictators you can choose from, if thats all you can do. I for one will watch the movie again as an aid instead of sedatives. Its funny actually, I'm required to write ten lines for this movie :-D So I'm actually wondering about the reviews. How does it manage with such high scores? Do they have bots programmed to do this kinda thing. Cause I can't think of anybody with taste giving it full. Probably somewhere in the middle would still be okay. Or maybe its an online movement to support this sad excuse of meeting iron with iron.

28 December 2009,silly movie,"Hard to take this one at all seriously. Quentin was def attempting something, but he didn't carry anything off cohesively. It's a mishmash.

Tongue-sticking out refs to cowboy movies, good bit actors but dopey big ones, great cinematography and mostly good editing but some BIG goofs, plodding plot. Never has Hitler looked so simply wrong, or been played so buffoonishly to no effect. Churchill was unrecognizable. Brad is a hoot & that's not good. His accent is distracting, poorly done and laughable, and he looks like he's got marbles tucked into his cheeks.

The highlight, if you can call it that, is Nazi villain Landa, played very well, if over the top. IB is a lot like baseball: lots of standing around covered up with overdone dialog followed by a lot of action that's over very fast. Enjoyable silliness for the most part, it's definitely entertaining, but you will need a few beers to smooth over the long boring bits, and at about 2 1/2 hours, there are quite a few. If you smoke a lot of dope & are into sci-fi, this could be just the ticket to fritter away an evening.",4
2 October 2009,no no no no no!!!! I got embarrassed :(,"First point: The most boring movie, i have ever seen . Out of 2.5 hrs, half an hour was worth watching. Reminded me of Blade runner ...

Second point: After seeing the trailer .. I expected a Pulp Fiction,,. And i got garbage.... To be frank, the trailer was better than the movie.. I like Brad Pitt.. That pulled me to the theater...

Third point: The biggest mistake i did was to recommend this movie to my colleagues.. I feel so embarrassed , cause they lost money and 2 hr :30 min of their life because of me...

Fourth point: May be , jus may be, i would have liked this movie if i had been to the theater alone.

Fifth point: i am jus wondering how this movie grossed 114 million dollars and how it got a rating of 8.5 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1

22 February 2010,The film most objectionably sensationalizes violence.,"This is a warning that I did not receive before I saw the film: this movie contains EXTREME BRUTALITY which may cause you to lose sleep, appetite and concentration. As another reviewer sensitively stated - 'this film is a reminder of how dangerous, even flammable cinema can be.' It is a crime to subject sensitive minds to an exhibition of this kind of cruelty, horror and explicit and gruesome torture. The film may cause certain vulnerable sections of human society to believe that violence and cruelty are sanctioned.

My strongest objection is that the film sensationalizes violence. It is not the portrayal of truth, as Schindler's list was, but a deliberate effort to jolt the viewer with made-up shockers.

7 September 2009,Not as bad as expected,"This was a really well made film, but the story was just pure nonsense and probably disrespectful to some soldiers who died for their country during WW II. I am not happy to see brutal treatment of defenceless soldiers passed off as entertainment.

A band of trained Jewish American killers go on the rampage near the end of the war, brutally torturing prisoners of war. Some of the scenes were disgusting. Their objective is to take out Hitler and his acolytes, and so end the war.

It is a long film beautifully shot in northern France. Some of the performances are superb, and to be fair not all the Nazis are cardboard cutout baddies. Daniel Bruhl plays a German war hero who has romantic desires on a Jewish woman played by Melanie Laurent, who is also being hunted down by an SS officer played by Christopher Waltz. This drama brought little bit of sanity amidst the mindless violence, and those three actors were outstanding in this film.

Just as I was enjoying the film, the ending descended into B movie madness. On the whole it was an enjoyable film, but obviously (as is always the case with Tarantino) there is far too much graphic violence. I did expect a much worse film after seeing some reviews, but I think Tarantino managed to pull off a quite a controversial film in the end.",6
15 August 2018,More serious and deeper than most Tarantino films,"This film is more serious and deeper than most Tarantino films, but it still has his fingerprints all over it. Most of these stars go to Christoph Waltz, who plays a character who is both terrifying and entertaining. Colonel Hans Landa is the reason to watch this movie. However, I found it disturbing how the Nazis are portrayed as evil because of their blind hatred toward all Jews, and yet we, as an audience, are asked to blindly hate every German associated with the Nazi party.

4 August 2023,"Some brilliant scenes, if only it stayed brilliant","This is the most disappointing movie I've ever seen, because it could be a truly great masterpiece. The 4 suspense scenes: the opening, the strudel scene, the three-finger cultural difference scene, and the Italian accents scene, are all superb. Each one is a perfect textbook example of how to write, direct, and act. Christoph Waltz in particular is a real talent thankfully discovered by this movie.

If the rest of the film had kept up the quality of those wonderfully tense sequences, this would have been the greatest movie ever made. As it is, sadly Tarantino's undoubted gifts are lost amidst his childish indulgences. We get a silly, cartoon plot where Hitler and other top Nazi leaders die in a cinema. These Nazis, unless Waltz's Landa in the opening scene, are not cunning hawks but dumb clowns who let a French woman they know nothing about lock them inside and burn them all.

The French woman, Shoshanna, hatches this plot with her black coworker. The two have no chemistry, no real character depth, and the plot happens simultaneously with a similar plot by the Basterds of the title - you can take either out and the other plot still succeeds. The suspense scenes show Tarantino's strengths while the rest of the film shows his weaknesses: he can't create deep characters, he can't portray love or any emotional depth.

Compare the ridiculous Hitler of this to the fully-human Hitler of Downfall. Compare Shoshanna and her coworker to the romance between say Han and Leia. And you see Tarantino's shallowness. His inability to move beyond blood and guts to something deeper. It's frustrating because there's some wonderfully memorable scenes in this but the film as a whole fails.",5
22 November 2009,"Landau character was great, but that's all.","This movie is not worth a descend review, it just made me decide that I am not going to go see the next Tarantino film. And I used to love Tarantino's films.

Not artsy, not entertaining, not witty, not funny, nothing, just dull and stupid. If this movie would have been Tarantinos first, it would have also been his last.

Tarantino has to get a grip on himself, otherwise his next movie is going to be 3 hours of meaningless, boring and uncool dialog. It seems like he has fallen in love with his dialog - and his love is blind.

After you finish your popcorn's there's no reason to sit in a theater anymore.

21 August 2009,"A fantastical, imperfect, unapologetic, and totally Tarantino period piece","Inglourious Basterds really defies description. Like other films by Quentin Tarantino, the film revolves around a plethora of characters. There's the titular Basterds, a Jewish American gang of soldiers lead by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), who administer their own brand of justice to the Nazis they cross behind enemy lines. It also concerns Shoshanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), a Jewish survivor hiding out in Paris as a theatre owner. And at the same time, the film mainly revolves around Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), nicknamed ""The Jew Hunter"" for his habit of rooting out the Jewish people in France for the S.S.

Although Kill Bill was quite the bloody epic, Inglourious Basterds is his first true epic film in the sense of grandeur and scale. It is a fantastical period piece, combining his trademark dark humour, his great use of music, his adoration for homage and his love for blood soaked visuals. Make no mistake: this film is just as violent as every other film he has worked on. Look no further than when the ""Bear Jew"" Sgt. Donnie Donowitz (Eli Roth) makes good on a promise to kill a German official with a baseball bat to know exactly what I mean. From the moment the film opens up, Tarantino truly makes us believe we are seeing his vision of Nazi-occupied France in the early 1940s. When we are not listening to long conversations or watching people get killed in ways only Tarantino could have imagined, you may find it hard to believe that the film is a Tarantino one. The cinematography, set and costume design is just so well done that it almost feels like an epic in the proper sense of things.

But being a Tarantino movie, he turns that epic convention on its head and creates his most original work in years. While the man has always been of a different cut than most American filmmakers, Inglourious Basterds is unapologetically different from any other World War II film ever made. For one thing, Germans actually speak German, and the French speak French. Subtitles are almost non-existent in most war movies, and here they are on display for more than half the movie. Sure, there are a few historical inaccuracies, but the film relies on a style all its own. In more than a few instances, it is a historical epic that aims to tell the story of a large group of individuals in World War II era France. But then it also combines in the wit and bravura of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs to become something altogether different. It comes off as pure fantasy in some cases, but in others, it works to make it infinitely more watchable. I find myself hard pressed to think of a war film that ever looked or felt anything like this one did.

What brings the film down, and has always been a problem for Tarantino, is how winded some of the conversations get. Going in, you know that the film will be a very talkative picture, but some scenes (especially one lengthy scene in a village bar) just go on far too long for their own good. He got the formula down perfectly in Pulp Fiction, but ever since, has had a lot of trouble with brevity in his speeches. Inglourious Basterds is no different, and sadly, drag the film out a bit longer than it should be. This film could have been a lean and mean epic that runs just over two hours; it does not need to feel like it is thirty minutes short of three. The exchanges are always entertaining, but you can easily spot where some cuts could have been made. I loved the dramatic tension in suspense in almost all of these scenes (especially the opening scene introducing us to Landa), but a bit of a chop here and there could have only made them look greater.

What is immediately more impressive are the characters. Having such a diverse and large cast does lead to some characters being nowhere near as developed as others, but that seems to be okay for some.

Pitt is quite good as Raine, bringing what is essentially a tailor-made Tarantino bad ass to life in a way he cannot always pull off. He felt like a more subdued version of Tyler Durdan, albeit a whole lot more sarcastic. He spends the majority of the film as an enigma, ordering the Basterds around but from an arm's length away. Roth on the other hand, dives headfirst into what is one of the most daft and twisted characters Tarantino has ever created. This is a true headcase, and Roth is clearly perverse enough to make the ""Bear Jew"" work in ways that no one could (especially not Adam Sandler, who supposedly was the original actor up for the role). But sadly, none of the other Basterds really get a chance to shine (although all of them are good nonetheless), and even Pitt and Roth's work is sorely underwritten.

The most fleshed out and most extraordinary work comes from the relatively European-centric Laurent and Waltz. Laurent is both subtle and heartbreaking in her role as a Jew continuing to hide from the Germans. Her work is just as powerful as it is devastating. With the exception of The Bride, she is Tarantino's most fully realized female character. Waltz on the other hand, is simply marvelous. He is the heart of the movie. While he is not as disgustingly evil as Roth, his devilish undertones and intense ""What comes next?"" delivery is as nerve-wracking as it is frightening. His horrific atrocities go mostly unseen, but his eye-opening facial expressions are more than enough.

Inglourious Basterds is flawed, but it is still a great effort on Tarantino's part. He reinvents himself in a way, and shows his maturity as a filmmaker. A touch less talking could have only improved the film.

8/10.",8
18 January 2019,Am I the only one?,"I'm who hated this movie?! I'm not one to drool over Brad Pitt, but admit he can usually dole out a pretty good performance. *This* is not one of those performances. His accent seemed to change with every scene ... lots of Great War movies out there... go watch a different one.

23 February 2022,Waste of life,"There's a few hours I won't get back.

Beyond silly, mostly uneventful. The heroes were all totally unlikeable, the bad guys were pretty unlikeable too. In fact none of the characters were very believable, or likeable bar about 3 people.

The story was bland, I'm not impressed by shock factor things such as the scalping and violence in general. It has all been done before but with better films.

The ending was very unfulfilling and I could watch a Japanese film with no subs and understand what was being said better than Brad Pitt at any point in this film.

My girlfriend and I just kept looking at each other, seeing if the other had a clue as to what he said.

Yet another pile of overhyped Hollywood junk with a score way beyond its value.

Nearly three hours wasted, bored.",1

19 December 2022,Christoph Waltz Made This Film..........,"I feel like this film would be a low eight out of ten if not for Christoph Waltz's fantastic performance. I feel like this was a very ambitious film which credit where due, but I feel like it just kind of falls flat on some level. I mean for a director as great as Quentin Tarantino, one would expect perfection or near perfection from all of his work. It's just the bar he has raised for himself. But the film is tonely all over the place. The first couple chapters are compelling and you get very excited for what's going to happen throughout being introduced to Waltz's character being a horrid person. As well as Brad Pitt and his group of people. But it becomes then starts becoming a love story briefly and then all this insane craziness happens. But the film doesn't really do anything particularly entertaining to lead off with the big finally that it had. Overall while a good film, Its not one of Tarantino's finest peices of cinema.

12 March 2020,Another great scalp for Tarantino,"As per the Stars line up whenever Quentin is in town and this parody of the inglorious bastards is just classic Hitler piss take. I never really watched his films until my wife left, well apart from Pulp Fiction which i wasn't a fan of so i kept a distance on purpose. Ive only punished myself by doing so and if you don't watch this then you are missing out. OK not Django quality but still worth a bowl of popcorn n a big slurp size soda.

22 August 2009,"While it did drag a bit, it 's a great World War II film","Inglorious Basterds is Quentin Tarantino's new film.It's basically Tarantino's take on World War II. Of course the film is historically inaccurate, but they were not going for historical accuracy when making this film.Quentin Tarantino is a great director giving us excellent films such as Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill.Pulp Fiction was a masterpiece and he has yet to top it.Inglorious Basterds was a great World War II film though.The best? I'm not sure, but it's definitely up there.I'm usually not a very big fan of Brad Pitt, but he was simply excellent in this film.He plays the redneck commander of a squad called the ""inglorious basterds"", a team which specializes in killing nazi's.In my opinion, this is Pitt's best role! He is simply hilarious in an otherwise dark war film.Eli Roth and Sam Levine also play members of the ""basterds"".The plot of the film involves two groups of people who are trying to kill Hitler and the other nazi's.One group is ""the basterds"", the others are two people who run a movie theatre.The woman who runs it had her family killed by the nazi's years earlier and wants revenge.There is a German officer who is smitten by her as well.The acting & characters are top-notch.It is very violent, which is expected for a Tarantino film, though there is not too much action.A problem I had with this film was that it dragged quite a bit.A lot of Tarantino films do this, but a lot of the time, it works.Some of it works here as well, I found that the opening scene was somewhat of a nod to the apartment scene in Pulp Fiction.We knew something bad was going to happen, however the two characters just converse as the suspense builds.They could have definitely shortened this film a bit. The rest of the movie is great and any Tarantino or World War II film fan should enjoy it.",9
22 August 2009,Quentin Tarantino is truly a genius.,"You can call him crazy, you can call him violent, you can call him whatever you want, but I think Quentin has, with this film, proved he is a genius when it comes to making movies.

After it premiered at Cannes, many critics were saying it was a hot mess, beautiful and unorganized, entertaining but reckless. I agree with half of that; the film is beautiful, and really truly beautiful not just through the shots (some of which are incredible, no doubt) but through the atmosphere created by the film. It is like Tarantino took what makes him a genius and added a much needed dose of beauty and sophistication while still retaining his edge, his able-to-make-fun-of-itself-with-a-big-ego kinda attitude for his film.

I don't need to write a long review. This movie is incredible.

26 July 2010,Oh my....,"So I was planning on joining here for a while now and always knew it was going to take a really great or really bad movie to make this happen. Inglorious was that movie. I wanted to join not to review the film but to rate it as the awfulness I felt it was and to muse upon the fact that, while having a really high rating, when you go thru the reviews you will find so many more bad ones than good. You too will wonder where and how that rating came about, even if you liked the movie.

The actors mostly do an OK job with what they had to work with, especially Waltz. The plot is terrible, any tension non-existent, poor character building and the enjoyment nowhere. I'm not sure what QT's motivation was here but he failed in my eyes, he has been overrated for a while now and this film is THEE most overrated I have ever seen I think. Want to zone out on a Sunday afternoon? This one is for you. I would recommend going in with NO expectations at all. You might just be slightly surprised, but I doubt it. unless you are a fan of QT this one will probably disappoint. Predictable, pointless and puerile, that's all folks.

It wasn't funny or interesting at all or even revealing of anything, other than poor taste and bad ideas. 10 years to write this, are we sure this isn't some form of propaganda instead. Luckily for me at least I didn't have to pay for the 'pleasure' of this film. Worth $80m. LMAO.",1
17 September 2020,And the war is won!,"I found this film to be really interesting. It's not a ""Wow, that was amazing!"", but it tells a cute little story. Cute that is, except for all of the blood and gore, which my squeamish eyes had to be protected from. In that way it is very Tarantino, but in other ways it's a bit more Cohen Bros, with it's underlying humour, that makes you smirk, but not laugh out loud.

I was surprised by the films more thoughtful writing and substance and shocked by some of the deaths and twists, that I definitely didn't see coming.

I thought Michael Fassbender was excellent (And not just because he is my favourite Michael), the actor playing Stiltzig I found attractive for the first time too, which is strange because I've seen him many times before. Shoshana was brilliantly cast, I hope the actor got an Oscar, and Christoph Waltz is such a good baddy. I didn't, however, go much on Brad Pitt and actually found his accent, not Bender's German, to be the least convincing. I think the part should have gone to someone else perhaps, was it too small a role for him? He got a bit lost in there, a bit outshined.

I wasn't sure that I believed that any government would give permission for the Basterds to get away with what they were doing or that a group like that would really survive so long, but once you realise that it is, in some ways, tongue in cheek, you can allow your imagination to forget what's real.

I am finding a new appreciation for Tarantino's work.",5
13 August 2018,"Not a fan of Tarantino, but I can't argue with this!","I'm going to be honest, I haven't been a fan of Quentin Tarantino's work. Most of the time, it's just too much. Django Unchained (2012)? This movie played it nearly perfect though.

Tarantino's writing captures logic, thought, and, most of all, suspense in a way that few have. It's an excellent piece of satire with some of the most expertly written scenes I have ever seen. The opening scene might be my favorite opening scene of all time. The story was great, as was the plotting.

The performances are all around great. No surprise that Christopher Waltz sticks out the most in the cast. He definitely deserved his Oscar for his work done here. He plays Colnel Hans perfectly.

Tarantino's direction seems more confident here. And it reflects his own writing perfectly. Props to you, Quentin!

The production design is actually quite well done, surprised nobody pointed that out. It's something that seems glossed over but, for some reason, really stuck out to me.

Disclaimer: Don't watch this with your kids. Very gory and mature at several points.

Overall, it's a 9/10. Very well done.",9
26 January 2017,"Tarantino takes on Hitler, no wonder so many people chose to hate this movie.","Tarantino takes on Hitler, no wonder so many people chose to hate this movie. Baffling however, why they chose to watch it in the first place as it's likely very certain that they knew they were not going to enjoy it.

A quick scan through user reviews here on IMDb will show you an unbeieveble amount of reviews with 1/10 ratings claiming it's 'one of the worst films I have ever seen' or 'complete waste of time and money'.

Why watch a movie from a director you don't like, complain about violence, long drawn out dialogue scenes and unorthodox story- telling of a controversial historical topic? Why complain about plot holes and rate is as 1/10 because of this? People don't like Tarantino yet they still pay their hard earned money and spend their precious time watching his movies at the cinema simply to go home and give their two cents worth of how awful it was and how unintelligent you have to be to be entertained by such garbage.

Inglorious Basterds may not be perfect but it is exactly what I expected from a Tarantino film. It's violent yet not as violent as some of his other works, some of the scenes are graphic but nothing that I would class as morbidly excessive. The dialogue is impressive in stops and starts with a couple of the scenes in the movie being among his best work in terms of dialogue, the opening scene in particular was so tense and perfectly constructed that it truly did showcase Tarantino's skill at creating such great film. Setting the bar so high in the opening scene had a slight negative impact on the rest of the movie though as the remainder of the film couldn't live up to that first scene on the milk farm.

Split into 5 chapters which is essentially 5 long scenes, Tarantino tells the story of a Nazi-occupied France during World War 2, following the harrowing journey of 'The Jew Killer', the backlash of the 'Inglorious Basterds' and the story of a Jew with cold revenge on her mind. There is no sole focus on any one character as the story isn't told through anyone's perspective, the story simply moves through the different characters scene by scene.

We are lead to believe from the movie title and trailer that the movie will focus completely around The Inglorious Basterds. This isn't the case and they act as a cog in a big wheel of different characters, they never really feel like the main people, we are given little back story to them and develop no emotional attachment to them. Brad Pitt was the poster boy for this movie yet he didn't feature half as much as I thought he would and sadly the screen time he did get was quite disappointing. His character wasn't very interesting and contained far too many clichés, often looking out of place and struggling to adapt completely to his role. Some of his script did however add some humor to the movie but the better scenes in the movie were ones which he wasn't a part of. Christoph Waltz was fascinating as 'The Jew Hunter', his calm and somewhat friendly persona makes him so edgy giving you the feeling that he could do anything at any moment. His performance was completely faultless which was by far the strongest aspect of Inglorious Basterds and the best scenes of this movie are ones which he was in.

There are some big plot holes in this movie, which i will not go into as they would contain big spoilers. The plot holes didn't stop me enjoying this movie though as it isn't a movie of realism, you would be a fool to believe that Inglorious Basterds was trying to even attempt that. I don't necessarily think it is down to lazy writing either, I personally think that some of the plot conveniences were purely to move the movie along. Tarantino may have stuggled to fit all of the story he wanted to tell into the two and a half hour run-time and in doing so, possibly in the trimming down process to keep it a respectable length, some of the the plot lines got a little choppy and dysfunctional.

Overall, Inglorious Basterds is a movie made for my tastes so my rating will be high. I can see it isn't a perfect movie and I can acknowledge these flaws however I wouldn't be telling the truth if I said that I didn't enjoy it. The time flew by and i found myself completely captivated in the story, the tense scenes made me tense, the humor hit the spot, the violence was graphic and uncut and the climax to the movie felt fitting and powerful.

Tarantino creates a unique movie experience on a topic which was never going to please anyone. He made complete fiction out of one of the most notoriously disgusting people in the history of the world and did it completely on his terms. I have no issues with that whatsoever.
