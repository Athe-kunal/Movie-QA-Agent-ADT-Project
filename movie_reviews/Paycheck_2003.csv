3 August 2005,Better than expected action / sci fi flick,"Philip K Dick wrote many stories which seemed to have great film potential. I never thought of this as one of them.

I have seen Ben Affleck in a number of films, and felt that he was good in a few, OK in most, and positively annoying in some.

I saw the horrible, misleading trailers.

The soundtrack was simply bad.

So, needless to say, I went into Paycheck with very low expectations.... and I was pleasantly surprised.

Affleck plays a talented reverse-engineer, who sees the possibilities in new technology, and is able to carry it through to fruition. He takes on top-secret jobs and has his memory erased upon the completion of each. He decides to take on a project big and profitable enough to allow him to retire comfortably for the rest of his life. He completes the project, goes through the memory erasure, and then starts to discover what he has done, and, pursued by corporate hit men and the police, tries to recover his memory. Uma Thurmond, a biologist he had fallen in love with, is one of the memories he wants to recover, and also a target.

Paycheck is more of an action film than a sci fi flick. The plot serves the action, as do the somewhat one-dimensional characters. And there is so little chemistry between Affleck and Thurmond that the romantic subplot is almost just a distraction. Despite these flaws, I spent an evening being thoroughly entertained by this rehashing of the usual technology-run-amok / knowledge-is-power story. This film is very Hollywood, and uses a lot of slick and clich√©d camera-work, but nevertheless tells a good story and does it well enough.",6
5 March 2016,An Underrated John Woo's decent Sci-Fi action futuristic favorite flick of mine!,"Paycheck (2003) is very underrated John Woo's solid action futuristic thriller, that combines spectacular action sequences with a spellbinding mystery that keeps you guessing from beginning to breathtaking end. It is my John Woo's fourth personal favorite action film of his, that I absolutely love to death.

I know a lot of people don't like this movie because it is John Woo's movie and it is rated PG-13, I love it. I love Ben Affleck his made some of his movies that are favorite mine like are: Reindeer Games, The Sum of All Fears, Daredevil and of course this one Paycheck. Watching this movie I must say Ben Affleck can act and he gave one of his convincing acting performances I have seen. I have been from the beginning against his role Bruce Wayne / Batman which I thought they should have left Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy alone, but now after I have seen him in this movie I must say, if you gave Ben Affleck a good script, he will acted terrifically.

This flick is outstanding and Ben Affleck's character is well written and decent. Paycheck is a film that I feel is underrated (I enjoyed the story/ideas, the 'writing your own future, and then living the future you wrote after your memory has been wiped' aspect, the cast (I am a fan of Ben Affleck), the 'Sci-Fi' MacGyver aspect, the action bits which were there. I love the story I love Ben Affleck's character that he is a computer engineer who is working for company's and after he is done, they erasing his memories, he later accepts the job by friends company signs a three year contract and starts working on something big. Three years later, he thinks he won $92.000.000, but he is later double-crossed and chased by FBI and ruthless mercenaries. He finds an envelope with 20 subjects who helps him out of the trouble. The film is filled with mystery around, with what is all about. On the end of the film we found out, it is about a time machine, who can write a future and tells what will happened in your own future, which Michael Jennings build. Now Michael has to race against time, to go back where he started working on machine and destroy it, before Jimmy Rethrick (Aaron Eckhart) re writes his future by destroying the world.

About the cast a lot of actors in this film practically everyone in the main cast is connected to Batman in some weird way. Ben Affleck is the star of this movie and will be the next actor to portray The Dark Knight himself in Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice this month. Aaron Eckhart plays the villainous Rethrick but in The Dark Knight he played Harvey Dent s Two-Face and if I may say he was incredibly underrated. Aaron played outstanding villain in this flick. Uma Thurman plays Rachel in Paycheck but we all of course remember her as Poison Ivy in the 1997 clunker Batman & Robin. Also Batman's love interest in The TDK trilogy is called Rachel. Uma Thurman was very likely in here and I liked her very much. I more remember her as the Bride in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill: Vol. 1 & 2, Mad Dog and Glory and of course I mentioned a failure Batman & Robin. Colm Feore played my favorite character Henry Taylor in 24 Season 7, he was outstanding as Rethrick's henchman Wolfe. I had no clue Michael C Hall - Dexter Morgan him self was in here as an FBI agent, he was just awesome. The last one is Paul Giamatti who was Jennings friend he wasn't also annoying I love him! He only had three scenes and he acted perfectly. Honestly I dare to say Paul Giamatti is far way better actor than Rob Schneider is.

Paycheck is written by short story of the same name by science fiction writer Philip K. Dick., I have enjoyed the action scenes, the acting performances, the chase on motorcycle was my favorite scene in the film. I love this movie and it is John Woo's fifth favorite action film of mine. This movie get's a solid perfect 10 score by me.",10
18 January 2004,Good action but the gimmick is difficult to accept because it continually forces you to accept it,"Michael Jennings is a reverse engineer who, in exchange for big money, takes items apart in order to rebuild them for other companies. After every job his memory is wiped back to the moment he started the job. When he is offered a massive payday to do a three-year job for friend James Rethrick he accepts. Next thing he knows it is three years later and the job done. He goes to collect his money but finds that he has waived his right to it and replaced it with a package full of strange objects. When he is set up with the FBI he goes on the run and realises that the objects are all clues or aids in his mission - a mission that he himself has arranged.

There's nothing quite like a good action movie that allows you to accept whatever the plot is as it presents good solid action. This film almost manages it and it is ironic that the concept from Dick is what weakens it. The plot is a bit of a stretch but once you accept it you can move on - like Face/Off, once you get the idea and accept it you can enjoy the action. However with Paycheck you are only left alone for 10 minutes before you have to accept the stretched plot all over again. Every time an item perfectly fits a situation you have to accept the whole concept over again. The problem is that the items are far too specific. With the lottery number strip it works, however with the paperclip and the bullet it is too much of a stretch and took the enjoyment off the action a bit.

Happily it is only a bit. The plot as an idea works pretty well but has been done better elsewhere (Bourne Identity and Total Recall for example) it is presented too full of holes that appear with the slightest picking. It would have been much better if the items had been bigger in terms of meaning rather than very specific (e.g. the lighter and hairspray), bigger clues and so on would have been better. However the action is still pretty good, not quite classic Woo but full or good touches. The film has a good steady pace to it and it keeps it up for the majority - very quickly getting through the set up and jumping to three years hence. The action is enjoyably slick and makes good use of effects; true, some of the set ups in the scenes is stretched, and some of the stuff about the weapons is just dumb (a fired bullet with it's casing, a bullet being fired by a thick piece of metal etc), however if you can accept the plot then I imagine accepting that Woo often takes style over substance shouldn't be a problem.

The cast is so-so despite having a surprising amount of famous faces. Affleck is better than usual; because he is quite ordinary he plays an everyman pretty well and it is easy to see him as a `normal' guy. Eckhart is reasonably good but he has limited screen time. It's good to see him in big films like this as he is an interesting guy, but I hope he doesn't just turn off his skills. Giamatti is in the film briefly and is OK comic relief but Thurman has been miscast. She does most of the film pretty well but her early scenes as an expert biologist are laughable she is so inept! The support cast features a really good turn from Feore as well as good roles from Morton and the wonderful Hall - although the roles are practically cameos.

Overall this is an enjoyable little action movie but it is ironic that the story is both interesting and the film's weak point. The items are too specific and, each time Jennings uses one, it forces the audience to accept the unlikely premise all over again. Worth seeing for enjoyable action delivered by a director who recovers some of his form here.",
9 January 2005,"Intriguing premise is made mildly enjoyable, but ultimately unsatisfying.","Rating: ** out of ****

I wonder what it says about the state of cinematic science fiction that most of author Philip K. Dick's adaptations generally mix high-octane action with its interesting sci-fi concepts. Paycheck is no exception, hardly a surprise when you note it's from once beloved Hong Kong filmmaker John Woo, who's quickly reaching Michael Bay/Roland Emmerich levels of notoriety in the U.S. with each regressive film.

To be fair, Paycheck isn't unenjoyable, and it even gets off to a pretty good start. Set sometime in the near future, there's not much of a noticeable difference with our present time except for a few elaborate-looking gadgets and computers. Ben Affleck stars as Michael Jennings, a reverse engineer who's hired by major corporations to build products superior to all rival companies. Afterwards, his memory is erased by a partner of his (Paul Giamatti) and he's given a large paycheck for his time and troubles (usually the whole process takes about three months).

His latest offer comes from an old friend of his (Aaron Eckhart), who promises an eight-figure deal at the end of the transaction. The catch is that the whole procedure will take three years. Despite some reluctance, he agrees to the deal and when the three years pass by, Jennings, thinking he's a rich man, is shocked to discover he gave up over ninety million dollars in favor of an envelope containing twenty everyday household items. Now he finds himself on the run from both the FBI and the company that hired him, and must set out to discover what he built during those three years he's missing.

Uma Thurman also stars in the movie as Jennings' girlfriend during that three-year span, but she factors so lazily into the picture, she's obviously only in the film so that a) Jennings can have a love interest and b) he can also have someone to talk to about every little discovery he makes. Then again, function ""b"" could have worked just as well with Giamatti, but everyone knows a ""sexy"" chick is a better sell (I have to put quote marks around sexy because Thurman looks positively haggard for almost every minute of screen time she's present; I can't help but feel the much hotter Kathryn Morris would have done better in the role).

There are two concepts in this movie that specifically intrigue me (some moderate spoilers here), the first one is choosing deliberately to erase your own memory, but the notion is forgotten after the first half-hour. I was quite curious to know exactly what the process is like to the subject. Take, for instance, the fact that he lost his memory over the three-year span. Does the last thing he remembers feel like a three-year old memory or an event that happened just a second ago? Instead, all we get is a half-hearted (actually, not even that much) attempt at a sorrowful romance because he can't remember his girlfriend and she's not very happy about that.

The other major sci-fi concept, the ability to see into the future, isn't explored with much more interest and it leads to a number of baffling questions. You see (quite a few spoilers here), it's revealed Jennings sent himself those twenty items because they can come in handy at a specific moment that'll help him survive or escape from a dangerous situation.

But the thing is, Jennings couldn't have known each item would come in handy unless he used the device he built at least twenty times, because there's no way he'd know a motorcycle would come in handy if he never had, say, the bus ticket to escape from the FBI, meaning he used the device to see what he needed to escape the FBI, but still foresaw that he'd be killed in even more future events. That would mean this guy was originally destined to die or get caught in well over ten different scenarios (i.e. he had the bus ticket to escape, but if he didn't have the motorbike keys, he wouldn't have gotten further, and so on and so forth), but this is never really addressed.

By John Woo standards, there's surprisingly only a modest amount of action in the film, but at least the material is competently handled, even if it's not entirely believable. What might work in movies that establish their characters as supercops with impeccable aims doesn't come off quite as well in action scenes that feature scientists beating up a large number of armed goons. But if you suspend disbelief, the action scenes are pretty fun (especially the motorcycle chase and the laboratory battle), and coupled with the relatively fast pace, keep the movie perfectly watchable despite the poor script and mediocre acting (I never got into specifics, but this is Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman we're talking about).

When all is said and done, Paycheck is a wasted opportunity and is never as memorable a mixture of science fiction, mystery, and action as Minority Report, but it's likely to do the trick for undemanding fans of any of these genres. If you expect more, well, you'd do best to remember this is John Woo we're talking about, not Steven Spielberg.",
15 April 2006,Sci-Fi Action That Is Intelligent,"Don't let the naysayers keep you from giving Paycheck a look. I found it to be intelligent, inventive, action-packed fun. Ben Affleck does a very credible job playing a man that finds the secrets of new technology out for big paychecks and then has his memory erased. He is offered a huge amount to do just that but lose three years of his life in terms of what he remembers. Well, the film picks up quickly after the three years and Ben Affleck has been played foul by his employer or someone. The science fiction aspect is very involved but presented in a pretty comprehensible style. The film chronicles Affleck's collection of simple, every day items that have been sent to him by - himself - and each has a purpose he must soon discover. Director John Woo mixes lots of gritty, sometimes over-blown action sequences here and there(especially at the end), but they only enhanced the suspenseful nature of the film. The film works primarily because of its thoughtful, engaging script and the adequate acting of Affleck, Aaron Echhart, Colm Feore, sultry Uma Thurman, and always humorous Paul Giamatti. The profound(albeit somewhat lost in the action)lesson in the film's end resonated strongly for me and had me thinking about my future and OUR future here on planet Earth. If a film can do that, it can't be all that bad in my book. The film is based on the science fiction writing of Philip Dick, a great mind and perhaps a soothsayer to what lies ahead for all of us. A great theme for this film might be little things mean a lot OR thanks for the memories!",7
9 July 2004,some clever plotting done in by man-on-the-run cliches,"Though futuristic in look and tone, John Woo's `Paycheck' is really a throwback to that oldie about the man who wakes up one day as an amnesiac only to find himself being pursued by the authorities for a crime he may or may not have committed (just about every other Hitchcock film seemed to be built on this premise to one extent or another). The difference is that Michael Jennings is an amnesiac by choice, a brilliant engineer and scientist whose job it is to develop top-secret inventions for hi tech corporations. Once he's delivered the goods, he allows his memory to be erased ¬ñ thereby rendering him innocuous as a security threat - in exchange for the lucrative paychecks the companies offer him.

Yet another of the many recent adaptations of a Phillip Dick story, `Paycheck' begins in the present day, a strange choice on the part of the filmmakers actually, for in this film's view of 2004, the technology for memory erasure seems to be in full swing and widely accepted (perhaps the producers didn't want to have to deal with the expense or bother of creating futuristic designs for their sets and costumes). The majority of the story, however, takes place in 2007, after Jennings `wakes up' from a three-year stint working on a secret project about which he can remember nothing. The trouble is that things haven't quite worked out the way Jennings planned as he finds himself the quarry of both the FBI and the organization for which he was working. Of course, Jennings doesn't know why. As is customary with films of this type, we uncover the clues and piece together the picture right along with the increasingly more enlightened main character.

It's that piecing together that is the sole factor of interest in `Paycheck,' for Dick is clearly a writer with a fertile imagination and a gift for mind-bending storytelling. When the film sticks to unraveling its plot complications, it is generally sharp, intriguing and thought-provoking. Too often, though, the film degenerates into a collection of man-on-the-run, action movie clich√©s. Although the special effects are occasionally impressive, the far-too-frequent chase sequences defy all logic and believability. In fact, a number of scenes actually elicit a few unwanted giggles, so ludicrous and over-the-top are the setup and execution. Director Woo, past master of action spectaculars, is clearly working on autopilot in this film.

There isn't much to say about the acting, either. Although Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman - as the woman Jennings fell in love with during the three years, but whom he can no longer remember - do their best with the characters assigned to them, neither is given much chance to expand beyond the stereotypical confines of their respective roles.

When it comes to all those involved in this film, I suspect that Jennings isn't the only one here working solely for the paycheck.",

17 March 2004,It's like a 50s Sci-fi tale.,"This movie questions playing god with technology. In this case, the technology provides the ability to forsee the future. Ben Affleck plays Michael Jennings, a pretty suave computer engineer who hires out to various technology companies seeking to improve their product. His work is so promising that they require that his memory be erased, I suppose, so as not to leak trade secrets. With the expectations of a lavish paycheck, Jennings is willing to give up three years of his life to work on a top secret project. Except, when the project is complete and the memory erased, he runs into the snag--being out of cash and on the run from a fleet of wild gunmen hired by the company.

It's a good story, and one reminscent of a good 50s episode of the Twilight Zone. You'll even notice some old noir camera effects such as Jennings staring into a mirror with the camera at a cocked angle as he tries to figure out his dilemma. The story is also reminscent of Memento, in that a person with no memory who has left himself clues must solve the mystery.

I was reluctant to find good in this movie before I had even seen it because of two reasons: Ben Affleck and John Woo. John Woo, though working with a good story, lays on thick those couple of minute action scenes with everyone coming so darn close (yet so far away) from getting their heads chopped off by flying cars and all that mess. It really wasn't pivotal to the story, nor to the mood, but understandably, it is the director's trademark. Ben Affleck was pretty much inconsequential in his role as Michael Jennings, playing the same charming nice guy character he always portrays in nearly every role he's been in. Uma Thurman, as Jennings girlfriend and Watson to Jenning's Sherlock, got some cheers from the theater, as most of her quick kung fu leg work and perfectly timed reactions manages to knock out a few of their armed adversaries.

But, despite the flack that Affleck gets, or misdirected Woo's (which is pretty much any John Woo film...at least according to Homer Simpson), this is a pretty good science fiction story. Especially, given that somewhat undermined, but valid, examination of the technology race and what it could mean for the future of mankind.",
20 September 2006,Minority Report meets The Bourne Identity meets... hack producers and plain bad writing,"First, let me debunk the myth that this is ""an awful movie"" as I keep reading ¬ñ because it has some interesting (albeit unoriginal) notions and it often executes them well. More importantly, it will generally keep you interested by navigating futuristic concepts in a fast-spinning pace that will unable you to yawn or look at your watch. Secondly, in spite of its technologically-ridden science fiction premise, Paycheck does not fall prey to the fatal ""style over substance"" crime because it at least tries, which is more than I can say for its peers (Equilibrium, The Island, etc).

So the effort is at least there and 1/3 into the film, you feel that things are really well-sewn together when the plot starts unfolding. Then it completely falls apart. This is understandable, because it's pretty off-the-wall: Michael Jennings is an expert engineer hired by high-profile corporations for a reverse engineering technique which usually takes about 3-4 weeks depending on the task ¬ñ then his memory is wiped clean and he receives a big paycheck. Well, this process tears on him and when the opportunity for a big-budget, 3-year-long job presents itself as ""the last job"", Michael takes it. He also meets a girl during this time called Rachel (an unusually rough-looking Uma Thurman). With a clean slate post the completion of the job, Michael discovers that he has declined the paycheck and left an envelope for himself filled with clues as to what happened in the past ¬ñ and what lies ahead in the future.

It may sound intriguing but because this was originally written as a SHORT story by Philip K. Dick, all the characters are completely unexplored, flat and downright uninteresting. It does not help that Ben Affleck botches through the story with his usual puzzled look that only ever seems to fit in Kevin Smith productions. Thurman also inhabits a truly badly-written role here, and the banter between her and Affleck is self-referential in the most cringeworthy way (they quote their sappy first meeting, etc). They also mostly resort to meaningful glances to convey their love. That's the central performances for you, and sadly the ONE character that could have saved the others from the mud is Michael's buddy Paul Giamatti. Unfortunately he fades quickly and is later only ever used as a comedic sidekick to make up for the lack of clever things to say.

If you do not mind half-hearted acting from the leads, and perhaps you are only interesting in seeing this because it's a John Woo movie, then you will also be disappointed because there is little of Woo's dynamic, adrenaline-pumping, Mexican stand-off laden, martial arts-spinning action in this story. I remember one motorcycle chase that took me back to M-I-2 and strangely also The Bourne Identity (in which Matt Damon is being chased while on the search for his identity post-amnesia) but it was lacking in oomph; there is also a brief Woo-like face-off on the subway tracks between Affleck and the key henchman but this is the most daring John Woo will allow himself to get ¬ñ the rest of the time he blindly follows the standard formula for modern sci-fi/action fare. In other words, Affleck looks at an item in the envelope, has a startling revelation, sets out knowing exactly what to do and when to do it, being effortlessly aided by conveniently appearing objects and doors ¬ñ then some henchman interrupts him.

I think this is one of those films that continuity spies could OD on, because the plot really is thinner than an Olsen twin. For example, how could Michael be such an expert genius engineer if he keeps on erasing any technical information post completion of a work task? He'd have to start from scratch every time. You just have to look past the stupid goofs, the flat characters, the mediocre acting and the safe action if you want to enjoy Paycheck (2003) ¬ñ but then... there is not much left.

19 January 2004,"Philip Dick Reduced to a ""McGyver"" Episode","""Paycheck"" is yet another adaptation of a Philip Dick short story that tones down his political criticism and cynicism to make a sci fi adventure flick, this time pretty much as an expensive and clever ""McGyver"" episode. You can tell how this is expanded from a story where the hero had five items/clues and now he has 20.

Ben Affleck is a bland Ken Doll of a hero, though Uma Furman has almost as much spunk as she did in ""Kill Bill, Volume 1.""

As a John Woo movie, of course the chase scenes are the best part. But the fight scenes are simply perplexing -- uh, why does Affleck's work out consist of electronic samurai stick fighting such that when the poorly-aiming bad guys all come at him with guns Uma throws him a stick to pick them off?

While I did see the movie on a scratchy print with tinny sound, I don't think that explained the confusingly bad continuity in the hair and make-up such that I thought they had been time-traveling at some tropical vacation in between scenes.",
29 July 2011,Sometimes Great Seeds Germinate into Hideous Things,"This adaptation of a Philip K. Dick short story tries so hard to get things just right that it's almost embarrassing to watch it fall down a steep set of stairs in the second act. Ben Affleck is at his Gigli-esque worst, displaying a grand total of two emotions as the genius-level intellectual willing to wipe the memory of his work after every assignment in exchange for a few extra dollar signs. Affleck doesn't deserve the full blame for this film's failings, though, as even Uma Thurman and Aaron Eckhart can't perform any miracles with a script so overcooked. Stiff, senseless dialog, uncomfortably dated pop culture references and an inherently flawed plot may have doomed it before the first role was cast. John Woo brings the goods during a few meaty action scenes, but even those suffer due to a loose interpretation of physics, a series of facepalm-worthy resolutions and a star who's simply not believable as the action hero he's playing. The high-concept introductory chapter works very well, but once this film sheds the skin of Dick's imagination and tries to take a few steps on its own, it stumbles in a series of bad directions.",3
1 January 2004,Better than I thought,"I went in to this film with relatively low expectations. Other reviews I had read led me to believe that this was a cookie cutter, run of the mill, made for tv-esque amnesia story. Nothing could be further from the truth.

The main plot of most amnesia types is trying to find out who they are and why someone erased their memory. With Paycheck, however, our protagonist already knows why his memory was erased, and since it's only been three years, he of course knows who he is.

The plot device is that at the end of this little memory wipe he's supposed to be 92 million dollars plus richer. Imagine his surprise when he finds out he's forfeit the money, and instead mailed himself some apparently worthless junk. Oh, and the company that hired him is trying to kill him.

This is what a Sci Fi movie should be, relying on an interesting premise, with future predictions based on current technology. Sci Fi is not space with explosions every five minutes.

Although there are a few minor plot holes, I found the movie very engaging, and thought the acting was competent, to say the least. Those who enjoyed Minority Report might also like Paycheck. It's worth a look.

8 November 2006,Good Example Of 'Rambo Mentality',"One of film critic Roger Ebert's pet peeves in the movies is when the killer hesitates before knocking off the good guy. He begins talking, instead of doing the job, and by then he is killed. I agree: it's stupidly insane.

My pet peeve is what I call ""Rambo mentality."" That's where the bad guys shoot tons of rounds of ammunition at the good guy from point-blank range and never hit him, while the good guy hits everything in sight! Well, that was the case in the second half of this movie.

Too bad, because the first half of this was very good....until the action started to really kick in and that ""Rambo mentality"" took over. There must have been at least 100 shots fired at Ben Affleck in this film and none - zero - hit him. Hey, I know ""that's the movies,"" but the film was trying to be a serious one. At that point, it lost me. There were credibility problems elsewhere, too, in this get back-the memory-and expose-the bad guys-film.

Even though he can be stylish and fun to watch, I should have known this might be stupid when I saw Hong Kong action guru Jame Woo was directing this mess.",5
9 July 2010,Entertaining Sci-Fi!,"Paycheck is actually a better movie than I thought it would be. Ben Affleck is not the best actor in the world. I tend to shy away from his movies because they all look bad and they do receive negative reviews. The only movie I have seen with him(other than this one) is Pearl Harbor.

This movie is about a guy whose job is to take other company's technology away from them and use it as his own. But after each job, his memory is erased. But, someone from the past is hunting him and he has no idea why.

I only saw this movie because I am a big fan of the science fiction genre. This is a good movie with plenty of action. I rate this film 8/10.

15 November 2014,Like the ideas but not the execution,"In the near future, Michael Jennings (Ben Affleck) is a brilliant engineer who is a hired gun reverse engineering technology for a price. After his work is done, his memory is erased by Shorty (Paul Giamatti). His former schoolmate billionaire James Rethrick (Aaron Eckhart) offers him a big job that would last 2 or 3 years, but the longest memory wipe ever is no more than 8 weeks. John Wolfe (Colm Feore) is his henchman and Dr. Rachel Porter (Uma Thurman) works at his lab. When he comes out of his memory erasing, he finds $92M in his account. He goes to settle his account, but he finds that his personal items have been replaced and his shares have been forfeited four weeks ago. The FBI arrests him for treason and murder. They want him to implicate Rethrick since only his name is on the new patents but they don't have any memories to extract. He escapes and tries to find what happened in the lost 3 years.

The sets don't look good enough especially that lab. The acting especially Affleck isn't good enough. His character is not particularly likable. He's a douche and I don't see the point of rooting for him. When Wolfe injects the marker, it's the perfect time to jump forward in time but the movie goes on for awhile despite the logic. The interrogation is laughable with the rotating chair and the escape is almost as bad. Overall, I like the ideas in the story which I attribute mostly to Philip K. Dick. John Woo isn't able to bring it to life. It feels a little like Face/Off but that movie reveled in its campiness. This one is suppose to be serious.",5
30 June 2009,Decent sci-fi action thriller,"Philip K Dick wrote many stories which seemed to have great film potential. I never thought of this as one of them.

I have seen Ben Affleck in a number of films, and felt that he was good in a few, OK in most, and positively annoying in some.

I saw the horrible, misleading trailers.

The soundtrack was simply bad.

So, needless to say, I went into Paycheck with very low expectations.... and I was pleasantly surprised.

Affleck plays a talented reverse-engineer, who sees the possibilities in new technology, and is able to carry it through to fruition. He takes on top-secret jobs and has his memory erased upon the completion of each. He decides to take on a project big and profitable enough to allow him to retire comfortably for the rest of his life. He completes the project, goes through the memory erasure, and then starts to discover what he has done, and, pursued by corporate hit men and the police, tries to recover his memory. Uma Thurmond, a biologist he had fallen in love with, is one of the memories he wants to recover, and also a target.

Paycheck is more of an action film than a sci fi flick. The plot serves the action, as do the somewhat one-dimensional characters. And there is so little chemistry between Affleck and Thurmond that the romantic subplot is almost just a distraction. Despite these flaws, I spent an evening being thoroughly entertained by this rehashing of the usual technology-run-amok / knowledge-is-power story. This film is very Hollywood, and uses a lot of slick and clich√©d camera-work, but nevertheless tells a good story and does it well enough.",7
30 June 2014,Underrated Ben Affleck Jaunt?,"What seemed like a breezy idea for a reverse engineer (Ben Affleck) to net him millions of dollars, leaves him on the run for his life and piecing together why he is being chased.

The source material for this film comes from a Philip K. Dick story (""Paycheck"") that amounts to little more than thirty pages. The general premise is the same (the erased memory and the knick knacks) but much has been added to flesh things out, the objects have been changed and the world portrayed is more like ours (with the FBI) than the business versus government one portrayed in the story.

While it might be hard to believe someone would trade $92 million dollars for useless junk, that is part of what makes the film compelling -- the burden is on director John Woo to convince us that Jennings made the right choice. And, being Woo, we will get plenty of action along the way -- chases, firefights, etc. With more than just a little inspiration from ""North by Northwest"" to add some class...

The film also, successfully, keeps the mystery in place of what Jennings was working on. Those who read the story will have a good idea, but keep in mind the screenplay changed the objects -- it could change the invention, too. Mystery, suspense, action... and a very impressive score from John Powell (a Hans Zimmer prot√©g√©)... this is a good one.

Reviews seem heavily mixed, with AV Club and Film Threat praising it, others criticizing the allegedly poor acting (this helped earn Affleck a Razzie, though that was mostly due to ""Gigli""). Roger Ebert said the film ""begins with a thought-provoking idea from Philip K. Dick, exploits it for its action and plot potential, but never really develops it."" That may be fair, but also, there was only so much to work with. All in all, a solid film.",7
15 April 2023,"what if you know what is gonna happen next, but dont remember why?","I remember this movie, is literally about that...what if you can see the future, but you dont know why? The movie begins as a spy thriller and goes deeper.this is one of ben affleck best movies, ever. The movie uncovers the plot while you watch it. So go watch it and discover why he can see the future, and why everything happens for a reason...this movie is so good that in some way is supernatural, is a sci-fi thriller about seeing the future but not knowing, till the protagonist knows why.

The movie have a great car chase, many thrilling scenes, many twists, and many moments you dont expect. Is better if you already like this kind of stuff.

Go watch it and thank me later.

15 June 2005,"ingenious and lots of fun, although admittedly too many plot holes","I love almost every movie tangentially based on something by Philip K. Dick, although honestly I haven't been as impressed by his books. Anyway, this is the basic Dick-based movie concerned with the vagaries of memory. I found the idea of having a bunch of stuff that will come in handy at some point in the future pretty nifty. It would actually work well for the premise of an inventory based adventure video game.

Paycheck is one of those movies that has some interesting sci-fi ideas but still has to be considered mindless action. But it does mindless action very well. Some sequences are rather ingenious, like the fight in the weather control area, making it a sort of smart mindless action movie.

There were a bunch of holes in this. I posted the ones that bugged me the most in the forum thread called Plot Holes so I won't bother repeating them here, but there were a number of unnecessary gaps in logic that I personally could have fixed if I'd had a half hour alone with the script. But if you don't think too hard this is loads of fun.",8
3 December 2004,Paycheck!,"One of the most thrilling and exciting action films ever in My opinion is Paycheck! The movie stars Ben Affleck, Aaron Eckhart, Uma Thurman, Paul Giamatti, Colm Feore, Joe Morton, and Michael C. Hall! All of these actors acted very well. Eckhart has a great performance as a villain and he has a phenomenal presence in this film. Feore also has a good performance as a villain. All of the characters are really good. The action is really incredible. I was amazed by the chase scenes! The music by Media Venture John Powell is great and its arguably his greatest score to date! The film is directed excellently by John Woo and this maybe the best film that he has directed in My opinion! If you Ben Affleck, and want to see Aaron Eckhart in a great performance and want to see an exciting action Sci-Fi film then I strongly recommend that you see Paycheck today!

24 October 2004,Great Sci-Fi Adventure,"In the near future, Michael Jennings (Ben Affleck) is a 'reverse' engineer, specialized in 'opening' state-of-art technology and development of new products for competitors. When the assignment is accomplished, he receives his paycheck and has his recent memory erased by his friend Shorty (Paul Giamatti). Michael receives an invitation from James Rethrick (Aaron Eckhart) for a three years job. In return, he would make his financial independence, receiving ninety million dollars. Michael accepts the contract and in the plant of Rethrick's company, he meets the biologist Dr. Rachel Porter (Uma Thurman). Three years later, without his memory of this period, he realizes that he returned the amount to the company that hired him, keeping just an envelope with twenty common objects and the FBI chasing him. Wow, John Woo recovered his shape and released this great sci-fi adventure. The story is full of action and it is an excellent entertainment. I liked a lot and recommend 'Paycheck' for fans of sci-fi and action movies. My vote is eight.

Title (Brazil): 'O Pagamento' ('The Payment')",8
19 June 2004,"If John Woo ever had it, he's lost it now.","Philip K. Dick would be furious if he saw this latest adaptation of one of his stories. Things that shouldn't be explained are (e.g. the future machine sees into the future with a really powerful lens that can see around the curvature of the universe... THEN HOW DOES IT SEE INTO BUILDINGS?). Things that need explanations (like why people don't pull the trigger when they have a gun pointed at their enemy) don't get explained, probably because there is no rational explanation.

Every cliche in the book is on display here. The jocular banter between people is as bad as any 70's cop show. The action sequences are tired and overblown. In one ridiculous scene, just before the protagonist is set to die, a dove flies in through the door leaving the audience to wonder WHAT IN BLUE BLAZES?!?!?!

Hardly any of the main characters come off well. Uma Thurman looks about 50 years old for some reason. Ben Affleck can't act as usual. The scientist from Terminator 2 is in this playing some kind of bad-guy good-guy or something. I didn't bother thinking too hard about it.

The sad part is, I could see the brilliance of Philip K. Dicks story poking through the garbage once in a while. The premise is ingenious, but unfortunately every time it peeps its head out, John Woo takes a massive dump on it.",
6 February 2005,"Dumb premise, bad acting, good suspense","Paycheck requires a lot of suspension of disbelief. That's for starters. It also requires tolerating Ben Affleck in one of his worst performances for a couple of hours.

Still cool with that? Then this isn't a terrible movie. It's got tight pacing, good suspense, and it moves faster than a roller coaster. It's easy to get caught up in the cat-and-mouse game that Affleck's character leaves for himself.

If you're like me, though, you'll probably be yelling at the writers for hours afterwards about all the pointless plot holes that are at least the size of the Grand Canyon. Really, this is dumb, brainless entertainment, and there are a lot of entertaining films out there that are also good. This isn't one of them.

24 January 2020,"Underrated decent, good awesome sci-fi futuristic action thriller my fourth personal favorite John Woo film","This is the most underrated and hated sci-fi futuristic action thriller from Hong Kong action master director John Woo. This is my fourth favorite John Woo movie and the last movie John Woo directed in USA. It is my favorite Ben Affleck movie that he ever did. Paycheck is underrated, good, decent awesome sci-fi futuristic action flick. Yes I love this film to death! For John Woo I only watch 4 of his movies and they are my favorite action films and they are just my movies that John Woo directed. Hard Target (1993), Hard Boiled (1992), Broken Arrow (1996) and this one Paycheck those rae the only ones I watch. I don't like his other movies like Face/Off (1997), A Better Tomorrow 1 and 2, The Killer, Mission: Impossible II, Windtalkers, Red Cliff 1 and 2 I just don't like those movies some of them I do have in my Blu-ray collection.

I know and I understand why people hate this film, why this film is people's not favorite from John Woo. Because it is rated PG-13, it has less shout outs, it is not bloody and it does not have a lot of body's and blood. Even with rating PG-13 this movie it is still solid and good. It still has action Ben Affleck is still in his best shape. He does a good fine job as the hero. Uma Thurman is sexy, gorgeous and likable. Right after Kill Bill Vol 1 (2003) she went and make this movie, after this movie she made Kill Bill Vol 2 (2004). Aaron Eckhart from The Dark Knight and The Expatriate aka Erased (2012) is in this movie and he does a great terrific job as the villain. We have Joe Morton from Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) my favorite film and Michael C. Hall from Dexter (2012). To me it is an excellent cast.

John Woo directed perfectly this film I have no problems with this film. So what if it is not tons of blood and action from John Woo I enjoy it. Most of the people does not get this film. It is based on the short story by science fiction writer Philip K. Dick the same autor wrote a short story that later made the film Total Recall (1990) with Schwarzenegger in the lead. This movie does not have Schwarzenegger in here, but Ben Affleck took over. This movie is about a time machine in which you re write your future.

Michael Jennings (Ben Affleck) is a brilliant computer engineer hierd for top-secret projects. After each job , Jennings short term memory is erased so he cannot recount any project information. Emerging from his latest assignment , a three year contract with an eight-figure paycheck given to him by his longtime high school class mate (Aaron Eckhart). Jennings is jolted when he is told that during the end of his assignment, he agreed to forfeit all payment. Jennings has no resource until he recives a mysterious envelope containing clues to his forgoten past. With the help of a beautiful scientist (Uma Thurman) he once loved but now cannot remember. Jennings races to solve the puzzle while a terrifying discovery waits on his future.

This movie has everything: sci-fi, mystery, action on MacGyver way. Jennings builds a time machine in which you can re write your future. Jennings memorie is erased and with help of 19 objects in envelope Jennings is hunted by FBI and mercenaries from the man that hired him to build the time machine. There is a lot of martial arts and fight scenes. Affleck uses his martial arts on the bad guys in self defence in the mall. You have great his speed car chases.

My personal favorite scene is Motorcycle that helps the main characters Michael Jennings (Ben Affleck) and Dr. Rachel Porter (Uma Thurman), to escape from the car chase. Afllect and Turman ride excellent Motorcycle while mercenaries are trying to kill them with their cars, You have a killer shooting from his car on Rachel with his gun. I love the second act in which Jennings escapes with help of envelope subjects and is on the run from a killer squad and FBI wanted for a terrorism. This movie still has some action sequences on a John Woo action style. John Woo did a different turn and he got crap for it. I understand people hate this film, I don't I love this film to death!!! It is better than nowdays crap movies. I don't care if it is CGI in here, the effects work perfectly.

This is my favorite science fiction futuristic film with RoboCop, Demolition Man, Aliens and The Road Warrior it is up there with those classic movies. I enjoy this movie MILES way more than Minority Report and yes I saw that movie in movie teather with my class in 2002 and no it was not a movie I liked. This movie I enjoy and I love. I never read short story from Philip K. Dick, but the film is great in my opinion. Uma Thurman is sexy as Rachel plant biologist she is a kick-ass biologist.

You still have explosions, even tough Jennings almost dosen't kill anyone, you still see a lot of handguns and automatic guns. Jennings still uses his brain by defeating the bad guys, by using MacGyver methodes, by not killing anyone. I enjoy Music by John Powell I thought it was solid done music score tune.

Paycheck is my personal favorite film from John Woo and Ben Affleck. I only watch Hard Target, Hard Boiled, Broken Arrow and this movie Paycheck for John Woo. For Ben Affleck I enjoy: Reindeer Games, The Sum of All Fears, Daredevil and this one Paycheck. Those are the only films from Ben Aflleck I watch, own in my Blu-ray colelction , love and enjoy. I never saw Argo I don't own the film and I have no interest watching it. I hate Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League because Ben Affleck is no Bruce Wayne/Batman he does not act like Cape Crusader we saw in animated series and Christopher Nolan trilogy. Ben Affleck is the best as the lead hero Michael Jennings.

There is alot of female lead in John Woo movies. In Hard Target we did had Yancy Butler in Hard Boiled was Teresa Mo in Broken Arrow was Samantha Mathis the main lead in here the main lead is Uma Thurman her great performance. The movie it still filed with action, mystery and sci-fi so I enjoy it and I love this film to death. John Woo's most undarreted movie of all time.",10
11 January 2004,"Woo's direction can't be touched, however I got a tad bothered at times by Affleck being cast in a role that didn't really suit him","Paycheck, from a story by Philip K. Dick (which in Dreamworks and Paramounts' hands gets PG-13 treatment like Minority Report), is a story that is told from start to finish, however, the structure is scrambled for the hero. Ben Affleck plays Michael Jennings, a man who gets paid a lot to ""reverse-engineer"" certain companies. He gets asked by Aaron Eckhart's character James Rethrick to go under a new kind of experiment not under the supervision of the government. He drifts off into sleep, and when he awakes it's three years later and everything that happened after he really became awake is wiped from his memory. When Jennings finds out he was supposed to have waken up - and gained a love in his life via biologist Rachel Porter (Uma Thurman) - things get complicated. There isn't much else to expound story-wise, except that Dick's running theme of a man being chased by dangerous people is kept strong here as in Minority Report and Total Recall.

The turns the story takes aren't terribly complicated, though that is a minor problem for Paycheck. It's nothing that a viewer can really sink teeth into like MR, TR, and Blade Runner, and nearly all of the films action scenes and main story points are left on the shoulders of Affleck. Now, Affleck can show his stuff here and there (it's usually under a great script or when he gets only a few scenes to show his chops like in Boiler Room) yet under such dialog it's not a good place for him. He's done starring vehicles before, and I'm really seeing a pattern through them that's starting to bug me- in a lot of these big-money, Hollywood-ish high-octane thrillers there isn't much for Affleck to do except acting like himself. Woo tries to garner a performance that resembles a Hitchcock-ian lead like Grant or something (the Master was an influence on Woo to make this picture), and I just didn't see it working. Luckily, a supporting role for the lovely Uma Thurman as the romantic interest who can kick a** isn't squandered - her work here is solid enough to hold up enough scenes.

And then there's John Woo, who has come a ways since his Hong Kong shoot-em up thrillers. I would most likely pick The Killer, or even MI:2, before this one on a Woo best-of list. Never-the-less, it's hard for me to complain about his style with the material, and the general look of the film he contributes. You can tell he's working with a lot more money than his Hong Kong days, which is perhaps bitter-sweet for his hardcore fans of his days with Chow-Yun Fat. Is it a bad action film he's directed? Not necessarily- it may depend on how much a viewer can take of the acting and story vs. Woo's techniques to pull it off. With a dependable crew to work with, like DPs Jeffrey Kimball & Larry Blanford and editors Christopher Rouse & Kevin Stitt (not to mention the designers and such), there's some stuff to look for here in regard to the craft. There's one sequence- a chase on a motorcycle with Affleck and Thurman- that feels like it could be better on a repeat viewing.

Bottom line, there isn't a whole lot Woo can show in true Hong-Kong grit, and the PG-13 rating constricts him in up to a point. But as I said, (maybe more-so in the quieter scenes) at the least Woo keeps a viewer awake like a pro. He could be given a script written by a twelve-year old and make it sort of entertaining, and here isn't an exception. B-",6
16 December 2016,An Absurd Story-Line,"Michael Jennings (Ben Afleck) is well-groomed and wears exquisitely knotted ties and tailored suits. He is a self-employed contractor who accomplishes tech jobs for participating companies; that is, reverse-engineering new computer breakthroughs. He improves the computer products originally developed by others. If one thinks about it, his work is borderline ethical at best. He is very well compensated for his work, and when his contract is over his short-term memory of the work is erased so that he cannot reveal secrets. The job may be risky but it pays well. His largest contract has been for two months, but now his old square-jawed friend, James Rethrick (Aaron Eckhart) of Allcon offers him a job that will last three years and pay tens of millions of dollars. It involves a system that will change the world by predicting future events. Wow!

Jennings agrees and when he awakens he soon discovers that not only is he NOT getting compensated, but that the FBI is on his trail. The FBI is involved because the program that Jennings improved upon was originally designed by a former FBI scientist whose project was terminated. He has been set up by his pal Rethrick, and all he has is a manila envelope with 20 personal items. They include a passkey, a ring, a silver coin, watch, sun glasses, cigarette lighter, a matchbook, bus pass, a partially-completed crossword puzzle, and others. Jennings needs these articles as they are clues to assist him in his personal mission; he has to determine when to employ each to save him from predicaments. Jennings is immediately on the lam, accompanied by sexy Rachel porter (Uma Thurman). He cannot fully remember her as their relationship occurred during the three years that coincided within the same period of his memory removal. Helping out for a very short screen presence is his assistant, Shorty (Paul Giamatti), who is in charge of memory erasure.

We find out through convoluted reasoning there is a danger of World War III. The theme is weak while most characters are ill-developed. Screenplay is sub-par. You as the viewer know this is true when a director tries to pad his plot holes and weak story-line with absurd choreography, very long high-speed chases, explosions, constant and annoying screen flashes, and quick editing (don't blink). Riding a motorcycle (with a passenger!) he can outrace and outmaneuver hardened armed men in cars who are shooting at him. Then Dillon, a computer nerd and up to now not a he-man, suddenly morphs into a superhero to save the world from nuclear destruction and takes on . . . and defeats . . . a series of trained and tough security men! Then the last one, the top honcho, snickers with his handgun, figuring he finally has Jennings. Hey, buddy, you just lost your entire gang. Oh, never mind, you'll get yours anyway!

Dillon's 21st century movie choices have mostly been less than favorable, and this one proves it. Here the man tries hard enough, but still cannot save the show.",3

2 people pointing a gun face to face and the Dove thing were the only 2 signatures in the movie. But thats it. I was expecting slow mo or something. But in this there was none.

a very different john woo film and a good sci-fi flick.

This is probably one of the most positive reviews i ever gave to what alot of people call a bad movie.

21 November 2011,What More Do We Want!!,"Yesterday, I saw the movie ""Paycheck"" and against the so-called rating I found the movie pretty good. This movie has everything that one can expect from a sci-fiction action thriller which carves it way beautifully during its course. The reviews have unnecessarily demeaned and underrated this movie and has spread bad-word which is not at all deserved by the movie.

The movie revolves around a protagonist Micheal Jennings- an reverse engineer(Ben Affleck) who does Technical Jobs for various organizations and whenever he's done with his work, his memory is wiped out within that period and he gets a handsome paycheck in lieu of his services.

The Twist comes in the movie when a billionaire James Rethrick (Aaron Eckhart) offers him a new assignment that would take 2-3 years of his life and memory. The movie comes to a leap where in it has been shown that the assignment is finished and Jennings comes into the real world only to find out that he has given up all of his paycheck in exchange of some offerings i.e 20 Items which would help him in situations to come. The main plot here is that he was working on Machine that enabled him to see his future and he saw that he will be killed by Rethrick. So to survive he beautifully engineers his way out of this situation where FBI, Cops, Rethricks men all are running behind him.

This movie do have some lapses but it scores on strong vision of director, good performances and gripping plot. This is a breathe of fresh air for a sci-fi fan and should be appreciated.",8

14 December 2004,Starts off pretty well.... but loses momentum,"With the great stalwart Spielberg adapting Philip K. Dick works (Minority Report), apparently John Woo wanted to join the race. Obvious references to the former are bound to be drawn - owing to common baseline of knowing the future and the author Philip K Dick.

With an tnteresting premise, the movie starts off pretty well and keeps audience grasped until the hero discovers that he has traded off his paycheck in exchanged for a bag of worthless objects. Soon after that - it falls into the gambit of a cheesy action flick with hard to digest logic.

Action sequences which are the forte' of John Woo have been executed well. Was I missing his slow-motion peace white-doves? No - its there but again at a hard to digest situation.

The chemistry between Ben and Uma starts off pretty good, but wanes as the movie progresses. Ben carries himself pretty well, no doubts about that. Uma obviously is a miscast here - she does try to liven up the screen but lacks the sharp one-liners which could have helped to bring out the character.

It is widely rumoured that Philip K Dick was slightly mentally unstable and I guess it requires a person of Spielberg's caliber to grasp and potray the way writer envisaged. And John Woo you can do better!!!",

19 January 2004,A waste of Philip K Dick material,"What starts off as a reasonable fix for dedicated sci-fi addicts spins along quite reasonably for a while as Ben Affleck (a reverse technology engineer) does jobs that require having his memory wiped afterwards so he won't know how he hacked into competitors' technology. Of course it all goes a bit wrong and Uma Thurman joins in as a kick-ass biologist and love interest. Based on yet another story from fashionable sci-fi writer Philip K Dick, this would seem to have all the ingredients for an above average near-future escapade with overtones of Total Recall and Memento, but the addition of predictable box-office draws (fights, car chases and explosions), the removal of any trace of political or social comment, and a resultant plot with more bugs than Windows 95, dooms this undisciplined thriller to mediocrity.

17 October 2005,"Dull, Duller, Dullest","Formula: take an OK story snippet that involves enough sci-fi buzzing sounds and light effects, give it to John Woo with a huge production budget, add Ben Affleck, Uma Thurman, Aaron Eckhart, Paul Giamatti, Colm Feore, Michael C. Hall (each of whom is far superior to the tacky script and tired body shenanigans), add a very loud and noisy score by Paul Horn, James McKee Smith, John Powell and John Ashton Thomas, and mix it with tired contrived gimmicks that perhaps at one point in time were meant to defy belief, and voil√†! You have PAYCHECK.

One wonders when Hollywood will realize that the market for this particular clone of movie is saturated and move on to something else. Or perhaps it is viewing this turkey immediately after viewing the brilliant and budget-limited film ""11:14"" that points out all of its weak points. But that is being kind. This movie simply isn't worth your time. And these actors should have passed on the project. Grady Harp

6 August 2011,"Ironically, this was probably done for the paycheck","Jennings makes a living developing high-quality technology and then having his memory wiped, for a massive reward. He takes one final job(haven't heard that one before), and when he wakes up, having forgotten what he's done, and finding he swapped the millions for a parcel of seemingly random, useless everyday objects. Next thing, he's being interrogated by the FBI, and it turns out that these things might prove vital. This follows the short story by Philip K. Dick pretty well, if it arguably doesn't make the points that does. The concept remains the same, and this does have some fun with the idea of a bunch of seemingly meaningless stuff can be amazing in the right situation, and the lead having predicted what he'd need, and him figuring it out as he goes(guessing what will be used to what effect is enjoyable). Some of the settings and events can be memorable(and futuristic), but on the whole, this is pretty lacking. As expected, there are plot holes and the logic is missing, in addition, the FX are meh, and Woo's style isn't as present in this as it could and should be(yeah, he continues to not be that impressive in Hollywood... other than Face/Off). The dialog is uninspired, as is the action(and does anyone buy Affleck in the lead in this genre? Plus, he and Uma don't have chemistry), which is also remarkably disorienting, and while the chases can be reasonable, vehicular and otherwise(the train bit has been done much better, though), the shooting is nothing special and the martial arts(a bo staff? It's great, don't get me wrong, it simply feels completely out of place) are decent and well-choreographed. I think the biggest problem is that this offers so little to remember(...sorry. Had to). It's 105 minutes of your life that you'll mostly find ""passable at best"". I recommend this to those who badly want to see this plot in visual form(if you don't need it in this medium, simply read the original). 6/10",6
4 May 2016,Total recall,"Paycheck is a modest futuristic action thriller by hard boiled Hong Kong director, John Woo.

Based on a story from Philip K Dick you just get a feeling that Total Recall (1990) did this a lot better even though Woo tips a hat to Hitchcock's North by Northwest here.

Ben Affleck plays Michael Jennings, a reverse engineer in the near future. He gets a big pay cheque for figuring out how rival's products work for the corporations who hire him. The only catch is that after the job his memory is wiped so no one else can extract the information from his head.

When an old friend of his (Aaron Eckhart) promises him a vast deal which means instant retirement for Jennings after the project he is tempted even though it will be three years of his life.

After three years have passed, Jennings thinking he has over ninety million dollars in a safe deposit box is shocked to discover an envelope containing twenty items some mundane. Suddenly he is on the run from the FBI who want him for corporate theft and the goons from the company that hired him.

Jennings needs to discover what he built during those three years, why would he trade so many millions for these items which all of a sudden become useful over a period of time. As if they were clues in unlocking a bigger puzzle.

The film hints at the invention of a doomsday device which Jennings recognises the danger of and feels the need to stop it. Despite the hi tech near future setting this suddenly becomes a man with lost memories on the run with some ability to have glimpsed into the future.

It lacks the bone crunching hard violence and humour of Total Recall or immersive story and dystopian style of Spielberg's Minority Report which also adapted from a Philip K Dick story.

What we get is a routine action thriller as if Woo is really in it for the paycheck himself.",5
30 October 2019,Pretty good,"This film was on TV last night and as I did not have anything better to do I watched it and it was pretty good.

The film was interesting whole time to me and somehow I felt it did not have anything that was missing or making it bad.

Uma was great and Ben too. I only remember I thought that his laugh was not appealing. Not the sound but how he looks... and Uma was really pretty.

Anyway... 8 from me. Did not know anything about it before I watched so it was a good surprise.

28 January 2004,James Dwan's Paycheck Review,"Set in the near future Ben Affleck stars as Michael Jennings a 'reverse engineer' who hacks into new electronic technologies for rival companies to duplicate. To protect his client's confidentiality Jennings agrees to have his memory erased, but after a highly paid top-secret assignment for the shady James Rethrick (Aaron Eckhart), Jennings is awoken to discover that he has forfeited his paycheck. In return he receives an envelope of seemingly meaningless items, which may well later become integral to his survival. Jennings must discover what he has been working on in the past two years before his memory was erased, and why he's been accused of murder, but time is not on his side, and he must piece together the clues he left for himself before the Feds or his former employer catch up with him.

Paycheck starts promisingly as an intelligent story with intriguing fast-paced action, but unfortunately the chase becomes relentless and the action tedious, as the characters remain underdeveloped and the script underwritten. Based on the work of sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, Paycheck doesn't live up to other cinematic adaptations of his works such as Blade Runner or Total Recall, and Dick's warped and paranoid futuristic world is unrealised in John Woo's under-designed future. This film is ultimately a disappointment which falls short of the intriguing story promised by its trailer, but nevertheless it is a better than Affleck's and Woo's respective disappointments with their previous projects Gigli and Windtalkers. On the other hand Uma Thurman has taken a backward step after her success with Kill Bill by playing such as diminutive role as Rachel the 'plant biologist,' even if that is an ass-kicking bitch of a plant biologist.

This film is at times completely unoriginal, borrowing and in some cases completely ripping off other recent films such as Memento, Minority Report and Die Another Day. Paycheck is ultimately rescued by its chase scene into which Woo crams cars, motorbikes, helicopters and a few well placed discarded pipes, topped off with a few explosions Woo shows us why he's still one of the best action directors and although this film isn't bad enough to demand your money back its not one to remember either.

30 December 2005,Good Story - But Stretches Believability,"Michael Jennings (Ben Affleck) is a reverse engineer: i.e. someone who takes other people's design, figure out how it's done and help reproduce the design for another party. He has just about one goal in his career, and that's to make big bucks. This time he bites off more than he can chew by getting into reverse engineering U.S. governments 500 billion dollar top secret program for the pay of 90 million dollars. After 3 years, and completing the project, both the company who hired him and FBI is interested in capturing him. First to silence him, the other to bring him in for a trial. But Jennings has few ace in the hole up his sleeves too (in fact, he has 20 !). He's sent the articles he needs to survive by mail. How did he master mind his plan ? Well, you'll have to see the movie.

The story is intriguing, and a interesting story to watch, but you can tell that it was written, produced, and directed by people who aren't familiar with how technology development, and reverse engineering works. The details in this area is just plain silly. One example is how impossible it is for only one person to reverse engineer the entire program of this magnitude in 3 years. I understand that technical accuracy is not the crux of good story telling, but along with the improbably high ability to predict and control random events by the main character spoils the movie's believability to a great extent.

The basic idea of this story is good, and casting Ben with Uma Thurman was a success. She's believable as an intelligent woman who wouldn't be frightened by the kind of trouble the main character is going through. Director John Woo's style of human drama amongst chaos is very evident in this movie too. One character that was bit of a stretch to buy into was Paul Giamatti's Shorty. Not that Paul's acting was unbelievable, but how can a character be a martial arts trainer and a florist at the same time ? So, at few points, this movie will leave you incredulous, but as a thriller/entertainment + action the movie hits a high mark.",4

5 April 2008,"""Once you show someone their future...they have no future!""","If one is apt to buy Ben Affleck as a brilliant computer engineer, offered millions of dollars for his expertise, then the rest of ""Paycheck"" might work for you. From Philip K. Dick's short story, this frenetic yet stilted thriller takes place in a technologically-advanced era wherein memory cells are commonly erased ""in a barbaric fashion"" when dealing in stolen and/or advanced computer ideas. Affleck is offered over ninety-two million dollars to work on a top secret project for three years, and then have those years completely removed from his brain once the machine is finished. Trouble is, the people he's dealing with are corrupt corporate cutthroats, and now they--as well as the Feds--are after Affleck who, post-amnesia, is reconnecting with his former life in minute ways which allow him to predict his own future. Pitting adversaries Affleck and Aaron Eckhart against each other never comes off stylistically (the actors both look and sound like they came out of the same jar); Affleck, acting with one side of his face, juts out his jaw and occasionally flashes his teeth, substituting smarm for charm and cockiness for acting (it's a deplorable performance). Uma Thurman is just as lousy playing a smitten chemical biologist who, after escaping flying bullets, cars, and a helicopter with Affleck on his motorcycle, asks him with a teary voice, ""You don't remember me, do you?"" The villains are the assembly-line kind who seem to be experts behind the wheel of a car but can't hit anything with their guns. Midway through, Affleck uncovers a vital clue to the mystery while in a high school classroom, suddenly spouting off on the evils of technology and how none of us should be so advanced. Apparently, director John Woo wasn't listening. *1/2 from ****",4

6 November 2005,A 100% stinker and silly besides,"This is supposed to be some sort of high tension thriller, but it deteriorates into one howler after another due to laughable science, engineering idiocy and plot holes large enough to get the moon through. I watched this movie after the first few minutes more to be amazed at how sloppy the entire thing was than to care about the plot or the dimbulb characters.

Another reviewer said this one was material for MST3K and I agree. I only wish I'd seen it in the company of my daughter so we could have made those 'misty' comments as this loser unfolded. How this one could have escaped into release utterly baffles me. Maybe the makers thought it'd be good fodder for kids looking for a movie they'd not be interested in watching so it'd make a good platform for making out in the theater. That's the only motive I can think of here.

4 September 2004,Unemployment line,"John Woo's casting for this film is what probably didn't make it work out. Ben Affleck, as an action hero registers nothing! Maybe with another actor this movie would have fared better.

Other than that, the film has a lot of elements from other films. We know from beginning to end how it's going to end. It's a shame that the story by Phillip K. Dick doesn't go anywhere. It was obvious a vehicle for its star.

Aaron Eckhart fares much better than Ben Affleck. There is no chemistry between Uma Thurman and Affleck. The chase scenes at the end in the Seattle area are about the best things, but that too, has been done before.

Watch it at your risk.

29 April 2015,Stunning Affleck Film,"Ben Affleck gives a terrific performance in this adaptation of a Philip K. Dick story from director John Woo. The writing is outstanding, with a plausible science fiction scenario and sharp dialog that grabs the audience. Woo's direction is especially good. He builds the tension and suspense like a sculptor and he gets outstanding work from an excellent cast. It is Affleck who astounds in his role as the hapless schmo who does work for a mysterious corporation in exchange for a big paycheck but ends up facing some serious consequences. Affleck is a highly underrated actor of incredible depth and power and after this film his gifted artistry should be recognized.

Don't miss this one if you are into Hollywood moments and dialogue that will make you toss popcorn. I am glad I was ""at work"" when I saw this matinee otherwise it would have been a total lost. I bet Affleck wishes they could erase his memory for the past year for making stinkers like this and Gigli. If you're a Philip Dick fan than this movie isn't for you either as this is the worst adaptation of one of his stories. What was Affleck's paycheck?

The movie started of fairly well, the premise was very interesting, but it was never developed to it's full potential (nowhere near). It's a pity, this could (should) have been a much better picture. I was disappointed to see such an acclaimed director like John Woo make something so trivial, so unimpressive.

I have to say also that I agree with the Razzie awarded to Affleck for his role in this film. His acting was terrible, he was completely unbelievable in his role. To say the truth, not everything was his fault, he was totally miscast for this motion picture. Uma Thurman on the other hand is OK.

22 October 2005,Good concept but average movie.,"""Paycheck"" is by no means a bad movie but it fails to become above average.

There are several problems with this movie. One is the story. The concept of the movie really isn't that bad and actually is quite good, original, mysterious and tense. The execution of it all is however done very uninteresting. The movie rips-off a lot of other movies (mainly ""Minority Report"" of course) and it doesn't even try to hide this. Not even Woo's style is enough to make this movie above average.

Another problem of the movie is Ben Affleck. Now, I'm not a Ben Affleck hater but he simply isn't much of an action hero, at least not in this movie. He also has absolutely no chemistry on screen with Uma Thurman who plays his love interest in this movie. Affleck is simply terribly miscast.

The villains are also disappointing. There are too many evil villainous characters and it's not always clear who is the 'big-villain' of the movie.

The story is filled with missed opportunities and fails to become interesting or as mysterious as I could had been.

The action is good. To be honest, I wish that there would be more action movies with sequences like in this movie. There is no doubt that John Woo is a fantastic action director. Watching a Woo movie is always a feast for the action movie lovers, ""Paycheck"" is no exception. It has some fantastic action moments but in this case action sequences alone are not enough to save the movie.

It's a somewhat enjoyable action/science-fiction flick but it misses the depth that this kind of movie needs.

18 June 2023,Fine for a While. But only for a While.,"'Paycheck' is not good. Oh, it's got a great beginning and a fine overall idea but it's execution is horrible. Blame Director John Woo. Not Philip K. Dick, from whose story the film was adapted.

Here's the story. Ben Affleck plays a future scientist who creates products for manufacturers. But the products are to be kept secret and so Affleck's memory of the design process is (voluntarily) erased once he completes the job. That way the manufacturer can be sure their product will stay secret till they want it released. But one product designed is so dangerous, both the manufacturer and law enforcement are searching for Affleck so that they can (a) make sure he doesn't spill the beans (manufacturer) and (b) get him to spill the beans (police).

All that is fine. But when Affleck becomes a Jason Bourne like fighting-machine the film defies credibility. When he navigates a motorcycle in an all but endless chase scene, it defies credibility even more. Add Uma Thurman as the love interest and the film descends even faster; she plays her role as a scientist as though she were a high-school cheerleader. Aaron Eckhart is the CEO of the manufacturing company and, incredibly, he's every bit as good a fighter as is Affleck's 'Bourne' character. There are chases and explosions and a secret laboratory right out of a bad James Bond film of the Seventies, and all and all we've got a giant mess on our hands, and we stop caring, stop paying attention, and begin hoping that the end will come soon.

And end it does. But sadly, not soon enough.",3

I saw the horrible, misleading trailers.

The soundtrack was simply bad.

So, needless to say, I went into Paycheck with very low expectations.... and I was pleasantly surprised.

Affleck plays a talented reverse-engineer, who sees the possibilities in new technology, and is able to carry it through to fruition. He takes on top-secret jobs and has his memory erased upon the completion of each.

Uma Thurmond, a biologist he had fallen in love with, is one of the memories he wants to recover, and also a target.

Paycheck is more of an action film than a sci fi flick. The plot serves the action, as do the somewhat one-dimensional characters. And there is so little chemistry between Affleck and Thurmond that the romantic subplot is almost just a distraction. Despite these flaws, I spent an evening being thoroughly entertained by this rehashing of the usual technology-run-amok / knowledge-is-power story.

25 May 2005,a better mystery than I expected,"Since this movie did not do well at the box office, I figured it was just another bad Ben Affleck film. But, it turned out to be entertaining, even though it wasn't very original. It came out to close to Minority Report.

Affleck, plays Michael Jennings, who helps come up with a machine that sees the future. After he does this, his memory is erased. He goes to collect his paycheck to find out he forfeited his 90 million and sent himself 20 seemingly meaningless items. It's not long till he's caught by the FBI who are on the trail of the guy behind it all, James. Michael escapes and finds he needs those items in the envelope at the appropriate times to escape. He meets up with his girlfriend and the two are on the hunt to find out why he's wanted dead and what he did for the past 3 years.

FINAL VERDICT: It's science fiction, so of course there are plot holes. But at least there aren't a bunch of unbelievable stunts. I think it's worth while to watch, not only because it's mindless entertainment for 2 hours but also to see a Ben Affleck film that isn't terrible.",6

9 July 2017,This film deserves to be erased from the sci-fi genre,"""Paycheck"" is the umpteenth adaptation to the big screen of a text by Philip K. Dick, writer of science fiction short stories that has given genre films such as ""Blade Runner"" (Ridley Scott, 1982), ""Total Recall"" (by the Dutchman Paul Verhoeven, 1990), ""Minority Report"" (Steven Spielberg, 2002) and the less popular ""Screamers"" (Christian Duguay, 1995). These films did justice to these three novels with tremendously complete feature films, mixing with a watchmaker's precision: mystery, intimate drama, sci-fi and action. But unfortunately, the Hong Kong director John Woo focuses only on the latter: action, and it only shows traces of sci-fi and criminal mystery very little matured and detailed, setting everything in a contemporary world with buses and cars from few years ago, something quite illogical how we have been able to evolve both in some sectors and in others not? Farewell then to be able to enjoy in ""Paycheck"" of unforgettable symbolic allegories, and of reflections and situations matured of dramatic weight. Of course no one here expects a monologue on mortality to the ""all those memories will be lost in time, like tears in the rain..."", no, because ""Paycheck"" is limited to the action of a very basic conspiracy with persecutions and a mystery overly simplified and superficial.

The story is about Michael Jennings (Ben Affleck), an engineer who spends a whole year working on a project for a company but, as they agreed, at the end of the task, all the memories he had from that last year would be erased from his memory. When he is paid the large salary agreed, he receives a package with a series of strange utensils, which he has never used or is difficult to get used to...and it seems he sent it himself. There are a couple of situations where he sees that these objects make him escape from death or avoid being stopped by the police and strange men in suits. He does not know why he is pursued, he does not know why he sent himself these objects or if it has something to do with the mysterious project he has been working on for the past year.

Interesting, right? For everything is spoiled because then the mystery evaporates, the solutions come by the easy way of sci-fi more fictitious, the rest of the scenes are action without rhyme or reason, things that if you haven't done in their life James Bond, Jason Bourne or Frank Martin, how the hell are they going to make a damn engineer who only knows how to design and tighten nuts? Is this guy trying to be cloned off as the future's answer to MacGyver? Plus, even when he's offered a gun he refuses. He is such a wuss.

It's easy and predictable, disgraceful to see a plenty of actors so good in a stupid and boring turkey...I mean Aaron Eckhart, Paul Giamatti, Joe Morton and Uma Thurman. Affleck is a good screenwriter, but his Interpretative level is to the one of ""Paycheck"". Thurman, who came from starring in ""Kill Bill"" as a kick-ass heroine, in this film was reduced to a just a damsel in distress. She should be kicking butts, like Ben.

You know, if you want to laugh with this utter garbage (with this waste of such a good idea), download it, even if I'm against piracy, because paying to see it is an insult to your own intelligence. And those who liked that movie, I'm sure they praise it because was directed by a Chinese director...go watch the Japanese sci-fi/anime movie ""Akira"" (Dir: Katsuhiro Otomo, 1988), instead.",2
31 December 2006,"Affleck in a Woo film: can you spell ""idiotic""?","Another dumb John Woo film with another lousy cast: Affleck and Thurman. Affleck is truly bad (nothing new there) and Thurman is her usual mediocre self. Much more talented and intelligent directors have tried their hands on time-travel and come short on logic, so it is no wonder that Woo's variation on this theme is at best muddled and full of illogic. Still, by his standards this isn't even as dumb as one might have expected. (If you've seen ""Broken Arrow"", ""Mission: Impossible 2"", or ""Face/Off"" than you will have seen Woo at his absolute worst ¬ñ which is very, very bad, indeed.) The action is rather stupid, of course; this is one aspect of film-making where Woo doesn't want to disappoint the legions of his bird-brained fans. Check out the dumb scenes when two adversaries point their guns at one another and talk trash: this is as dumb and dull as it gets.

29 May 2004,Predetermined,"There was potential; it's based on a Philip Dick (author of the novel that lead to ""Blade Runner"") story, and John Woo (of ""Face/Off"") directed. Nevertheless, ""Paycheck"" is worthless. It's not imaginative, interesting, complex, or ambiguous--it's not even thrilling, or exciting. Ben Affleck pretends to be a character who pretends to have a gifted mind. This character, Jennings, must do exercises with a pole to test his reflexes. Why, is it because this is how his mind works? Nah, it allows Affleck to be ""believable"" when he does well in some fighting action. At least, to say something nice, this movie isn't annoyingly bad; those who don't demand much of science fiction might enjoy it. I've seen these future-telling computer gimmicks before; Steven Spielberg did it better in ""Minority Report."" (This movie is predetermined in much the same way as the future in it is.) The ideas here could have been absorbing and interesting, but aren't.

29 December 2003,When filmmakers are too dumb to understand the ideas of their story,"OH dear... what a mess. But if you (like me) adore cheesy and ludicrous sci-fi films, this is gold! It's awful, but it's fun awful.

It's QUITE apparent that the director and especially the screenwriter aren't quite up to grasping all the ideas presented by the story, and consistently turn away from the genuinely interesting aspects of the story to focus on generic and not-very-exciting action pieces. It's amazing how there could be so many cool ideas undermined at EVERY turn!

Let's consider many of the individually ludicrous elements of this film. There will be SPOILERS:

I love the idea that you can remove individual memories by zapping specific neurons. And then there's the thing about Ben's brain being cooked if it goes over 40 degrees... which it does later, and no one notices. Obviously just one of those things inserted to have an action! moment every few seconds.

I also love the moment later when the police detectives quickly give the entire discourse on quantum mechanics, as if every police detective has a deep and profound understanding of the topic! They also deliver the entire sci-fi ""hook"" of the movie in such a quick, apologetic way--anyone else would spend longer here since it is a) fascinating, and b) the crux of the whole film--but no, let's just get it over with so we can cut back to the generic chases!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE the convention that when someone sees their own visions or memories that it's from the perspective of a camera looking at THEM. I also love the recent convention that a bullet flying in super slo-mo gives you an opportunity to say something to the person next to you, then jump out of the way! Just because the bullet's in slo-mo, doesn't mean that everything else is in regular motion! Oh, except in this movie, where it does.

Wouldn't you think that if Ben is being chased and shot at and everything, that he would take his 19 items out of that bulky and clumsy envelope and put them in his pocket or something? But, uh, no.

Uma was terrible. Sure, she's cool, but can she act? Not really. Though I think the blame lies mainly with the ABYSMAL script and having a non-native English director. Still, why does her every line--even when she's being shot at--have to be delivered in a perky sing-song voice, as though she's telling you that she's baked you a surprise birthday cake? The overall effect makes her character seem quite demented. And WHAT'S with that hair?

Ben looks great, though again his overall tone seems at odds with the movie. Maybe Woo was directing them this way? And Aaron Eckhart... are you ever going to do a decent movie again? Or is it Hollywood all the way now?

And if Ben's seen the future, why does he need to see it again? Just for kicks? I know it doesn't add anything to the movie.

There are SEVERAL good things about the movie, like the overall story, and little things like the clue in the Einstein stamps, but each of them are completely undermined by the clumsy execution, which obviously doesn't place any trust in the ideas of the story itself. For example, why don't they remind the audience beforehand that Ben doesn't remember Uma, explaining why they could send in the replacement Uma and he wouldn't notice. They tell you right in the middle of the scene, so you go, ""Oh, I guess that WOULD HAVE been cool.""

It's too bad they made this now, thus ruining the chances that a CAPABLE director and screenwriter could have made a great movie out of it or could remake it soon.

Nevertheless, this is right up there with END OF DAYS in terms of a movie enjoyable for how consistently stupid it is. Next time, fellas, have someone smarter than you explain what's going on in the story before you set down to write/make a movie!

29 December 2003,We Have Seen The Future... But Need We?,"Beginning with as unchemical a prequel to the eventual pairing of Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman as could be filmed, no aspect of this film makes one care about the characters. Special effort is made to spare us any real background for any of the players. This is hard to get past as events unfold. And the events indicate that two attractive people sharing only one adventure in the future will bring as unlikely (and as wincingly Thirties B-Western everybody-is-happy) an ending as could be contrived. This is the major problem with the movie. None of the human interaction makes us care about any of the characters. Car and motorcycle chases become distractions as one tries to spot a moment of real interest, real human emotion, some kind of meaningful revelation perhaps. But no, we have here a snapshot far less compelling than seen in ""Memento""; the slippery slope has begun for movies shot in that manner to satisfy the audience discovered when that picture was released. Lack of chemistry, total reliance on a rapidly patched together series of seemingly disparate circumstances and some pretty thin special chase effects keep this film from realizing...anything. Generally special effects do not intrigue this author very much, but the moment Uma disabled one assailant with the toss of a bike helmet I had to groan. Just like the ending, this must have been inspired in a moment and was just as lovingly crafted.

Not the worst film in the theaters, it is just not smart enough to occupy a niche higher than ""average movie"". Fast and flashy it is, but that can never intrigue a viewer like a story with a big payoff. Or at least it shouldn't.",
31 August 2004,An Action Film With No Substance,"""Paycheck"" is one of those films which help you spend two hours of average fun, but there is nothing beyond that: In the same way that it happened to Michael Jennings (Affleck) in the film, my mind completely erased the memory of this movie after I woke up the next morning.

It is a pity, because the ingredients of ""Paycheck"" are quite promising: A good cast (Affleck, Thurman) and a reputable director (Woo) provide us with an interesting plot: It is the futuristic story of a gifted reverse engineer working for a hi-tech company, whose strict confidentiality contract obliges him to have his memory erased after each major project is completed; everything goes well, until he decides to accept a very important assignment which proves to have rather unpleasant consequences.

So why does the movie fail to deliver? The answer is simple: It totally lacks any substance. The plot rolls out in a completely unconvincing and superficial manner, while John Woo tries to raise our adrenaline with action scenes which only manage to increase the overall boredom. As far as the actors are concerned, I would definitely expect more from them; Uma Thurman in particular is a disaster in her role as a a sweet lovecat trying to save her lover.

Amazingly, despite all the above shortcomings, the film still manages to help us spend those two hours, thus deserving a pass grade of 5/10. But don't ask me to grade it again after a few days: It will be totally erased from my memory...",5
5 November 2017,Great sci-fi plot set-up becomes routine action film,"Ben Affleck and John Woo basically do a sci-fi version of The Bourne Identify. Loosely based on a Phillip K. Dick story, Affleck plays a computer engineer who willingly has his memory erased to prevent him from sharing trade secrets, but after he's done working on the secret project he finds that he left himself a mysterious envelope with 20 seemingly random objects that are actually clues about his memory-wiped past. It's a decent set-up worthy of a Phillip K. Dick story, but the film quickly devolves into a series of entertaining if forgettable gunfights and chase sequences. Affleck makes a subpar action hero and his attempts at martial arts pale when compared to his buddy Matt Damon's work as Jason Bourne. Woo provides plenty of his usual slow motion gunfights, dramatic zooms, doves, and Mexican standoffs, although he also still has his penchant for overly dramatic of performances, which seem out of place in English language films. Production values and special effects are solid and outside of the wooden Affleck, the film boasts a strong cast the includes Aaron Eckhart, Uma Thurman, Paul Giamatti, and Joe Morton. Overall, ""Paycheck"" is never boring and had a story with real potential (""Memento"" meets ""Total Recall""), but is squandered by a poor lead performance by Affleck and what is ultimately one long forgettable chase.",6

The last scene should have littered the cutting room floor. Surely some rewrite expert could have been found to actually end the story. One more miserable film by Ben Afleck, and he should be the clear winner for the Kevin Costner Award.

23 February 2009,How Do I Erase This Film From My Memory?,"Lots of whiz-bang computer graphics, magnified sounds of computer keyboard clicks, tech-speak, super fast action, smoke, screeching tires, stereotyped Fed figures, explosions, gunfire, stilted dialogue, and manipulative background music here, but not much story, no characterization, and a muddled plot.

Jennings (Ben Affleck) sells his soul to the devil (a.k.a. corporate lizards) in exchange for wealth. But when he tries to collect his ""paycheck"", there's no money. Then, Jennings gets chased by the Feds ... or something.

I don't know what this story is supposed to be about. After the first thirty minutes, I really didn't care what it was about. We don't know from scene to scene if Jennings is in the present moment, the past, or the future, in a story that I guess fits in the sci-fi genre. The plot is a big muddled mess. All of the characters are stereotyped, including a shallow, irritating Jennings who is totally not interesting. He is an idiot for agreeing to such a scheme, so how can we viewers respect him?

Action is fast and furious. ""Paycheck"" is a popcorn flick aimed at fourteen-year-old boys. The cast is annoyingly photogenic. Acting is irrelevant.

The story's underlying premise might have had some promise, at the concept stage. But the Hollywood urge to soup up the action and mask the plot's inanity with CGI and heavy-duty special effects erased what interest I might have had in the story's puzzle. ""Paycheck"" is boring, irritating, and is typical of the Hollywood mindset to churn out dumb, thoughtless movies aimed at viewers with a juvenile mentality.",1
16 June 2009,Weak Casting Combined With A Generally Unimpressive Story,"In this sci-fi/action tale, Ben Affleck plays Michael Jennings, an apparently brilliant computer programmer who hires himself out to companies, and then has his memory erased for the time he worked for them, apparently because he was working on top secret or shady (or both) stuff. If I may be blunt, Affleck was the first problem with this movie. He was trying too hard to be a sort of combination of Tom Cruise and Matt Damon, and I didn't think this type of movie suited him at all. Worse, from my perspective, is that he was teamed with Uma Thurman (of whom I've never been a huge fan)playing (somewhat unbelievably) a hot-shot biologist with the latest company Jennings loans his talents to. The mystery comes from the fact that Jennings gave up three years of his life to work for this company (the three years being erased) but then discovered that the $90 million paycheck he was promised is gone. There's some potential in that mystery, but I didn't think the story was very well constructed (in the first 30-45 minutes, especially, very little of consequence happens.) It's not a movie I would watch again or personally recommend. The last ""erasing memories"" movie I watched was ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind."" This was a bit better than that disaster. I gave ""Sunshine"" a 1, so ""Paycheck"" gets a 2/10.",2
14 July 2007,Some of the best things in life are mistakes.,"Screw the Razzies. They named Ben Affleck the worst actor in 2004 for this and Gigli and Daredevil. I don't care what you think about the last two, but he definitely did a bang up job in this John Woo action film.

When it comes to action, Woo is the master. Sure, his American stuff is no where near as good as his Chinese films, but they are still great. This one took a while to get started, but once it did, it never stopped until the finish. Affleck and Thurman were made to star together and they were magnificent in this sci-fi pic.

What more can u you want out of life than saving the world, $90 million and Uma Thurman? Does his get one, two, or all three? You have to invest your time to find out, but I assure you it will be worth it.

13 January 2005,Oh how the mighty have fallen!,"Paycheck sounds good on paper - directed by the Hong Kong Action master John Woo, penned after a short story by Phillip K Dick (who's short stories have been turned into some pretty good sci-fi movies including the awesome Total Recall), and starring some pretty ""hot"" actors including Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman.

It is a story where a top engineer, whose memory gets erased after each job, wakes up from a job with no ""paycheck"" and heaps of bad guys after him.

What might sound good on paper - turns out to be a really mediocre movie. The acting is all fairly lazy and unconvincing, the special effects (and sadly the action sequences) are all very TV sci-fi looking and unspectacular. The plot is definitely a case of ""been there... done that!"" - and for this sort of movie - there are not enough intelligent twists.

I'm a huge fan of John Woo - but his American movies have been getting worse since Face/Off and M:I-2. Oh how the once mighty have fallen.

Please - give this movie a miss!",4

5 September 2014,strange but intriguing plot in this action movie,"It's time for some brutal honesty about myself as a viewer of movies with car chases, athletic fight scenes, and things blowing up -- if they're entertaining, I don't analyze them like they're supposed to be Citizen Kane. I just enjoy them.

So in spite of its faults, I really liked ""Paycheck,"" starring Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman, directed by John Woo, adapted from a short story by Philip Dick.

Affleck plays Michael Jennings, a reverse engineer. He figures out how technology products are made and replicates them for companies. When he's done, his memory is wiped out to the point that he is about to start the job, so he doesn't remember what he did. He's paid very well for his efforts.

When he's offered a job at a friend's company for a massive amount of money, he's tempted, as the money will be so much that he can retire. But it's a long one - three years. He decides to take it, even though it means virtual captivity within the area, and he has to surrender everything he has on him.

Before he knows it, the three years is up and he's the recipient of $96 million in stock options. When he goes to pick up his money and his personal effects, he finds out that he waived his rights to the money; also, the items that he's given are not his personal effects.

The FBI then arrests him for murder and treason, but he escapes and calls a friend (Paul Giamatti) who meets him and tries to help him. Michael soon realizes that he sent these items to himself because, with the machine he worked on, he was able to see his future, and he would need these items to survive. (He doesn't know what work he did, but something he sent himself tips him off that it was the future.) The FBI isn't the only group that wants him -- the company he worked for wants him too, and it's not for a good reason.

I thought this was a clever story and very exciting. As far as performances, Ben Affleck I can usually take or leave; I love Uma Thurman, she has such a presence; and Paul Giamatti is an excellent actor who did not have a large enough part. One of the finest actors on the planet is Colm Feore, who plays the part of a man working for the company and is trying to kill Michael. Feore is Canadian and a magnificent stage actor. It's always a pleasure to see him.

So I will not say the acting was bad, I didn't go frame by frame and look for continuity problems, and I didn't overthink the plot. I can never believe that people pick apart a plot like this which is preposterous to begin with, and become irritated because it doesn't make sense. It never made sense, so take it for what it is.",8
25 December 2007,explosive nothing,"This is really messy. Early today i reviewed Blade Runner's director cut, it had been about a year since the last time i saw it, it's always healthy to review those beautiful pieces, it let's your imagination work visually and it prepares you to face stuff like this with a stronger basis. How can someone neglect Phil Dick's stories in a such a way that they become a simple run and chase with some enigma to solve in the middle? What is the meaning of making cinema if one doesn't care on solving visually the challenges the story has? Hitchcock always used simple stories, many times uninteresting (or just interesting enough to give the film somewhere to go) . This was because he knew that what mattered was visual storytelling, so he stayed out of ""trouble"" regarding deep concepts in the text, because he had visual ideas he wanted to explore. Italian opera composers would seek for similar uncompromising stories so they could concentrate on the music. Making this Dick's story as it shows here is like taking a romance by Balzac and making a soap-opera out of it; it's not that it isn't possible, but it's picking up great concepts which come involved by a story to demonstrate them, striping off the concept, and you leave the naked useless story. There are great hints on memory in this Dick's creation, what is real and what is implanted, the meaning of creating memory, creating future (past?) creating destiny. This is really good material, and well, i have seen Blade Runner early today... the ambiguity, the posing questions without feeling the need to see where all the pieces of this envelope fit in the set... get it? Here we only get noise, lots of it, explosions and the useless fighting scenes. we get nothing... The performances are not that good either. Afleck is arrogant and likes to get noticed. Uma does her job, i guess, but she has limitations, even though we don't have to get to them to see where this totally fails.

My opinion 1/5 there are projects in which content is really taken to consideration. This is not one of them",
26 December 2003,a 1980s throwback.,"A few years ago this would have been an Arnie/Stalone/Van Damme movie. Bad dialogue, a hokey premise and a lot of thundering anti-climactic music over fairly average action sequences featuring cardboard characters and no heart. We're supposed to like this character? A guy who spends the beginning being an arrogant whizzkid, who cares nothing for the people around him, who - if he grew any in his intervening years has lost all that anyway because his memory was erased and his sole reason for doing what he's doing seems to be why he was doing what he was doing in the first place - Money. Crap on a stick.

15 September 2017,Huge Disappointment from John Woo...Fluff and Stuff for the Multiplexes,"A John Woo Movie Rated PG-13 is like a Disney Movie Rated NC-17.

This Piece of Fluff has a Good Cast, the Story is from the Now Hot Property and Prestigious Philip K. Dick, No Budget Restraints and so, What went Wrong?

There are so many Bullets Flying and Missing their Mark followed by a Slow-Motion Poof of Debris that after about the first 50 times this happens Audiences and Woo Fans throughout the Land are Nodding Off.

The Memory-Loss Story is Handled OK, but it is certainly Nothing New and is somewhat Engaging. But the whole Film has a Wispy Wondering Tone where nothing seems at all Threatening or Suspenseful.

It's just Scenes Tacked Together to make a Whole and it's almost like a Walk in the Park or an Amusement Ride for our two Protagonists (Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman). Paul Giamatti as a Friend in Need Barely Registers.

In Fact the Film Barely Registers on Any Level other than the most Mainstream, Multiplexed Mediocrity. It's a Misfire, a Missed Opportunity, a Manufactured Movie that Takes No Chances, No Style, and No Winner by Woo Standards and Disappoints to the Extreme.

Overall, Recommended for those that like Their Action Films with a Tongue In Cheek Tone, No Danger, and is Nothing More than Pretty People Collecting a Paycheck (this includes the entire production) with as Little Effort or Artistic Input as Possible.

This is Product Pure and Simple and Nothing More than a Fast Food Fast Buck for Everyone.",5
19 January 2004,I'm cured!,"Of my insomnia.

A dull tale, dull writing, dull acting and dull action. As Michael Jennings, the genius for hire who'll have his memory wiped afterwards, Ben Affleck labours through this tale as he discovers how to predict the future. Maybe he should have discovered how to be more selective with his scripts too.

Uma Thurman's better as a brunette.

17 August 2015,Mediocre,"One of the weaker adaptations of a Philip K Dick novel/short story. The central premise (predicting the future) lacked substance. Plus, in trying to draw this short story out into a full-length movie, the fill-in plot was fairly light, mainly involving chases, fight scenes, guns and explosions.

Not entirely bad though. The mind-wipe idea was interesting, and if that was used more effectively, and the predicting the future stuff better thought-out, or replaced with another idea, and the action sequences kept to a minimum, this could have been a good movie.

Not sure Ben Affleck was the best choice to play the lead character. The action sequences suited him, but it is hard to convince me that he is a technology genius (or any sort of genius, for that matter!). Uma Thurman is more there for eye-candy, and even that gets screwed up: she often looks disheveled, especially towards the end.

Aaron Eckhart's performance is probably the best of the bunch: villainous roles suit him.",5
27 December 2003,phillip k dicks great premise in a poorly told story,"i have to admit i didnt read the phillip k dick story that this movie adaptation comes from. but im still qualified to rip on a bad flick. once again i went to see ben affleck hoping he had found material that suited his acting ""style"", and once again im disappointed. of course it's bad to put the burden on just ben or any of the other cast members. the script was doomed. it spends too much time developing pointless plot issues. the dialogue is ridiculous. the script repeats those two blunders over and over.

the opening of the movie takes a long time to introduce us to ben afflecks character, who rips off technology ideas and improves them for competing companies. he then has his memories erased so he cant break any confidentiality agreements with said companies. i accept that this is possible, because they dont spend any effort explaining how they erase his memories. in the story, its just a plot point. nuff said.

ben affleck is then hired for a for a 3 year project..... the catch is he will have to have 3 years of his memory erased upon completion of this project. the movie makes it a point to tell us no one has ever had that much time erased before, but never cashes in on the problems it might cause.

after he is done with the project and his memories are erased, he discovers he has actually designed a machine that sees into the future. in another script blunder, they actually try to explain how this is possible. i feel that if you are going to explain it, it should be plausible, and the rest of the story should stick with the explanation. the script would have us believe that if you had a really really clear telescopic lens you could see ""around the curvature of the universe"" back at yourself into the future. i could almost buy that, but at the conclusion, when we finally see the machine in action, it not only sees around the universe, but through walls to tell us what action is actually going to take place in a super secret bad guy lab. the blunder here is the screenwriter forgot that seeing into the future was only a plot point. we dont really need to know how it works. we just need to know it works, its bad, it must be stopped. little to no explanation will take the audience farther than a bad explanation. of course none of those are better than a believable (or just not disbelievable) explanation.

good sci-fi always has a morale to the story, something that speaks to a universal humanity. nothing in this script asks the audience to invest any of their humanity. instead of telling the story in a way that develops a good sci fi genre pic, its an average action pic.

i havnt seen a john woo hollywood movie that i like. i hear his asian stuff is pretty good. some of the other comments on this board say that he plays these action scenes by the numbers. i really didnt have a problem with the chase scene. in this day and age of all the digital special effects, the action itself is becoming more and more unbelievable, and so too the story. the fight scenes were a little too fantastic for my taste. if you cant convince the audience that the hero might lose, why should they watch?

i give it 4 out of 10 stars, good premise, awful script, mediocre acting, average action, awful cinematography

you would be better to rent this one. your not going to miss anything by watching it on TV",
1 January 2004,Where's MY Paycheck for Seeing This Floppy Flick?,"My fourteen-year-old Techno-Teen wanted to see this film arguing, with some right on his side, that it would balance the many art films and documentaries I make him view. Fair is fair but ""Paycheck"" isn't a good movie.

John Woo often has something interesting to say but in this muddled story, Ben Affleck as a reverse engineer isn't convincing and even with suspension of credulity the story doesn't hang together.

Affleck's character makes a lot of money solving problems for companies by unraveling competitors' hardware and software secrets. Apparently the trust level in his work is high, in his discretion not. So after each job his memory is wiped clean by a process that leaves the rest of his personality and recollections intact while removing every trace of his just completed duties. ""Wired"" magazine might just run a futuristic piece on this outstanding promise of technology in the service of stealthy and sinister commerce.

And then he goes to work on a super secret project. His recruiter, the outfit's honcho, has that smile that signals the audience ""Foul Play Dead Ahead!"" Who should he meet on the job but the beautiful Uma Thurman, a biologist of sorts. She's cutesy and has the depth of Popeye's Olive here.

What follows is swift paced disintegration of what might have been an intriguing plot. Most of the action takes place in 2007 with a law-disregarding F.B.I. on the trail of evil seekers of a potentially history altering product (well, Ashcroft might still be around then so this part of the film is less sci-fi).

I don't recommend ""Paycheck"" as a rental for a Saturday night stay-at-home because of a blizzard evening.

20 August 2017,I'd do it for $10 million!,"""If you show someone their future, they have no future. "" Kind of blows your mind huh? Well, that is what the basic plot of this movie does! The premise is, would you give up three years of your life, and all memories of those years, for almost 100 million dollars? What if you fell in love during that time? And what if you changed your mind about the money? And instead, traded it for an envelope of, well, stuff? Those questions, and more, are what Michael Jennings must deal with in this movie, and it makes for a pretty good plot and premise! Now, the short story that it is based on moves much quicker and feels like a tighter, better written version of this. But this movie is good, and though the action sequences could be much, much shorter, I think it stays pretty close to Philip K's tale. My only problem with this film is the editing. I think it gets pretty loose with the location of the characters, and twice I was completely dumbfounded as to where the characters were, even after I rewound to try to figure it out! It felt sloppy. But I liked the movie, even the cheesy ending!

12 June 2004,Atrocious actors combined with slow direction make for a dreadful film,"This is the first Ben Affleck film I have ever seen and I would like to make it my last. 2 hours of watching Ben Affleck is 2 hours too long.

As for Uma Thurman, why does she keep getting cast in films when she is ugly as sin?

John Woo's slow direction doesn't help this film. It is possible that he is washed up. Either that or it is just a fluke that he directed a few excellent films(Hardboiled, Hard Target).

Shame on you Mr. Woo for make such a stinker.

Even though Affleck looks like a decent sized guy, he is unconvincing as an action hero. The site of him throwing guys throw windows is laughable.

Avoid this film at all costs.",1
5 March 2010,Not bad at all,"Philip K Dick wrote many stories which seemed to have great film potential. I never thought of this as one of them.

I have seen Ben Affleck in a number of films, and felt that he was good in a few, OK in most, and positively annoying in some.

I saw the horrible, misleading trailers.

The soundtrack was simply bad.

So, needless to say, I went into Paycheck with very low expectations.... and I was pleasantly surprised.

Affleck plays a talented reverse-engineer, who sees the possibilities in new technology, and is able to carry it through to fruition. He takes on top-secret jobs and has his memory erased upon the completion of each. He decides to take on a project big and profitable enough to allow him to retire comfortably for the rest of his life. He completes the project, goes through the memory erasure, and then starts to discover what he has done, and, pursued by corporate hit men and the police, tries to recover his memory. Uma Thurmond, a biologist he had fallen in love with, is one of the memories he wants to recover, and also a target.

Paycheck is more of an action film than a sci fi flick. The plot serves the action, as do the somewhat one-dimensional characters. And there is so little chemistry between Affleck and Thurmond that the romantic subplot is almost just a distraction. Despite these flaws, I spent an evening being thoroughly entertained by this rehashing of the usual technology-run-amok / knowledge-is-power story. This film is very Hollywood, and uses a lot of slick and clich√©d camera-work, but nevertheless tells a good story and does it well enough.",7

23 January 2022,Highly entertaining.,"'Paycheck' is an action thriller with some amazing action sequences in the vain of the 'Bourne' films.

Ben Affleck stars as a brilliant computer engineer, Jennings, who must analyze a computer for a rival company. Once done, his memory for the time period it took him to do the job, is erased. His good billionaire friend, Rethrick, then offers him a job that could last up to three years. When Jennings accepts, the film jumps ahead three years, leaving the viewer wondering what the hell he did.

The plot then thickens when Jennings is told he forfeited his share, and is given an envelope with everyday items instead. Jennings then finds himself in a cat and mouse game on the run from the company - and Rethrick - he worked for. With only the contents of the envelope to unravel the mystery, the film is an interesting concept, and the viewer unravels it together with Jennings.

Uma Thurman serves as the film's love interest, Rachel.

'Paycheck' has a great production design and great action sequences and visuals. Although not always believable, it was a lot of fun! This was highly entertaining!",7

28 December 2003,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you go and see this movie after reading this review you get what you deserve. Ben lays his second stink bomb in a row. In a movie called ""The Game"" a few years back the whole movie hinged on the main charicter making split second decisions under impossible pressures and the next domino falling would not do so unless the decision was made and exicuted perfectly by this charicter that has no idea what is going on around them. If it sounds impossible it is, just like this film. The chase scenes are nothing special, there is a thick fog on the floor in the main building that no one even thinks or ses is strange, there is a huge garden lab with it's own weather that no one bothers to explain why it is there in the middle of this high tech company, even though some charicters see the future were they are going to get hurt and killed they just walk into what they know is coming. It just go's on and on. I was laughing by the end, well at least the popcorn was good. The people who gave this movie anything above a 5 are on crack!

28 May 2011,Paycheck - wait the people in this film received one for this?,"I had heard about this film many years ago and the negative reviews on it. I don't normally believe all the reviews I read and saw this DVD in the library so I thought 'hey why not it might just be a dumb fun action flick'.

Action flick it is - barely. Dumb however, it totally is, not to mention extremely boring. The film manages to hold itself together until it actually gets to the main point of the plot - which is never a good sign. Ben Affleck plays a guy who does some sort of freelancing type jobs and then has his memory erased after it so he won't remember what he did - sort of like the companies are protecting their intellectual property. Then he accepts a three year assignment from his friend played by Aaron Eckhart then discovers later on there has been a big mistake with what he did.

From then on, it gets really confusing and I wasn't entirely sure what was going on as I was trying to get down to how everything all worked. The film goes at way too fast a pace for you to really absorb what has happened and uses too many flashy techniques which only make it feel more like they are adding it in for the sake of it. Uma Thurman who plays the love interest has absolutely no chemistry with Affleck and both of them give pretty bad not to mention unbelievably boring performances. Thurman actually looks pretty bad considering she is a very attractive woman - the make up department obviously neglected her. Affleck just looks uncomfortable in his role and really doesn't fit in with this sort of science fiction thriller.

And the music score was horrible! It didn't add anything for the feel of the film. If it was trying to build up suspense then it did a terrible job. Sometimes the music felt more like 'comedy thriller' like rather than suspense thriller. I really don't know what they were doing.

Nothing worked in this film. The concept was interesting but what they did with it was total nonsense that ended up turning into a whole sci-fi weirdness that didn't really make sense and created some very dull characters. The plot isn't developed properly but it didn't matter because after the halfway mark I was well beyond bored.

Don't use your hard earned money to see this film - paycheck's are valuable you know.",2
26 December 2003,Didn't meet expectations,"Sorry but this film just did not do it for me on any level. I like the stars and thought I would at least like the story and all the blowing up of stuff. But I have to say that this movie was just boring. I am a big fan of Mr. Dick but this film does harm to his reputation as a writer. My hope is that people in Hollywood will still use his work when thinking about making a movie. I think the major problem is that, if you are going to make a sci-fi based on someones work, you should at least try and keep the movie thought provoking. In the end that is what makes a good sci-fi. This movie had so many holes in logic that it was painful to watch. Add that to the bad acting and no amount of blowing up stuff can save a film.

6 May 2022,Oh Why Oh Woo Oh Why!,"At first I thought this would turn out to be a good movie and with my new found love of Affleck after seeing The Accountant and looking back to a few good films until I saw this!

However, this one isn't his fault as he plays his usual role but then I noticed the slight overacting and then the unnecessary running and people getting knocked down followed by the unbelievable chases and I was getting suspicious and then it was confirmed by the slow-mo, and I thought, ""It's bloody John Woo isn't it?!"" and to my dismay it was.

Why try and do a thoughtful science fiction and let Woo direct it? It's like letting Tarantino do the next Disney Christmas movie, somethings were not meant to be!

I understand that modern movies with big stars are a suspend disbelief, turn your brain off and just laugh and the bad writing/directing but most movies nowadays are taking this gift a little too far and this is definitely one of them!

Having said all that, the actual story is decent but needed to be told by an adult.",4

9 April 2005,Disappointing way to deal with a nice story,"This movie is a really good story that performs ""under par"" due to its director (or at least thats what I believe). Its a great story from the expert (Philip K.Dick - Blade Runner, Minority Report) of science fiction stories but as a movie it seems that it tries to become an action movie rather than a great puzzle-suspense thriller.

And all this is due to John Woo (Mission Impossible 2, Face/Off) ; because he gives emphasis on the far-fetched action scenes (a scene that ""glues"" into your mind due to its silliness is the one where a car chase is stopped when Uma Thurman slides on the ground and little stones fly through the air - like bullets - on the car: and this makes the car driver loose control - crash and explode).

All in all its worth a viewing (especially from sci-fi lovers) but it would probably have been a much better movie, if perhaps, Spielberg, Nolan or Fincher directed it.

28 December 2008,Look Where You Can't Go,"""Michael Jennings (Ben Affleck) is a brilliant computer engineer hired for top-secret projects. After each job, Jennings' short-term memory is erased so he cannot recount any project information. Emerging from his latest assignment, a three-year contract with an eight-figure paycheck given to him by his longtime friend (Aaron Eckhart), Jennings is jolted when he is told that during the end of his assignment, he agreed to forfeit all payment,"" according to the sleeve's synopsis.

""Jennings has no recourse - until he receives a mysterious envelope containing clues to his forgotten past. With the help of a beautiful scientist (Uma Thurman) he once loved but now cannot remember, Jennings races to solve the puzzle of his past... while a terrifying discovery waits in his future.""

Philip K. Dick's original story would make a great film; unfortunately, this poorly executed and overproduced ""Paycheck"" doesn't really cash it in. The film could be used as a guide on how not to bring Mr. Dick's ""Paycheck"" to the big screen. Still, it's mildly fun to watch protagonist ""Michael Jennings"" sort out, and use, the 20 items he mailed to his amnesiac self. The acting and direction (John Woo) is obvious. Ivana Milicevic gives it as much PG sex appeal as she can muster.

13 May 2004,A (supposedly) great book being wasted.,"If I am correctly, this is the third movie done based on a story by p.k. dick, and this time they blew it. I watched ""A.I."" and loved it, I watched ""Minority Report"" and loved it, and I watched this one and was utterly disappointed.

First of all, the acting sucks. Ben Affleck is not able to play a major role, he is simply a small fish who did (for strange reasons) get invited to play with the big fishes. He is simply not up to it. The only good performance I ever saw done by him was in ""Boiler Room"", that was exactly the thing he can do. But here he totally chokes. Uma Thurman seemed incredibly absent, I dunno what she did besides that movie at that time, but I got the strange feeling she was somewhere else in her head while doing this one. The supporting actors are not a great help either, all small shallow stereotypes.

John Woo is a good action-flick director, but here he blows it totally. It seems he gets very bored if there are more than 5 minutes of reel running without an action scene, he either sprints from action scene to action scene or does such an uninspired, bored job that its painful. I have not read the book on which the movie is based on, but I could see its potential and I have to say its totally wasted. I mean, a man loses his memory and sends himself 20 objects to figure things out, this is such a great base to make a great thriller/mystery movie, but there is nothing of this in this movie. He basically does not even use half of these things, he just shoots his way around, very stupid. Also, the action scenes actually made me laugh, all done so cheesy and stupid, it was a pain.

on the bright side, atleast the overall look and feel does compare to ""A.I"" and ""Minority Report"", the futuristic look was very interesting and nicely done, but thats about it for the good things on this movie.

Next time, please get the spielberg/cruise team together again, ""Minority Report"" was such a great role for Tom Cruise, he went from ""ouch"" to ""wow, he *is* good"" for me with this one, and spielberg is simply a fine director who can do the best of such a script and material.",2
16 June 2005,"Shades of Total Recall, Memento and Minory Report ...","... but none of the greatness of any of those movies, unfortunately.

I finally got around to seeing ""Paycheck"" last night. Having liked all of the movie adaptations of P.K. Dick's work so far, I thought that this one would also be at least a decent watch for an evening. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy this one at all. A hammy script and poor acting by the leads were just some of the problems I experienced while watching this one, but the major difficulty I had with ""Paycheck"" was simply the predictability of the plot and the derivativeness (similarity?) from the other works mentioned in the title of this post. The action scenes were alright, but unbelievable that an engineer and a biologist could kick butt in the way they're depicted to.

Watchable for a rental, but ultimately unsatisfying. Go see one of the above movies instead.

19 June 2004,Nothing Special Here,"I am disappointed and my wife too. I thought that this one could follow the successes FACE OFF or BROKEN ARROW or MISSION IMPOSSIBLE II. But what we¬¥ve got here is very poor. Yes, it is in fact the worst John Woo-movie I have ever seen. First of all I expected more action sequences. At least they were well executed. Second I think it is not a fast paced thriller. Third, the story is simply too understand but it¬¥s too predictable and lets some questions opened at the end. Ben Affleck played a solid part and he could be no doubt Mister James Bond in future Bond-films. If you liked this film you¬¥should not miss TOTAL RECALL or THE SIXTH DAY with Arnie Schwarzenegger. Paycheck is the first Woo-movie that I will not include in my best of DVD collection. Rating: 6/10 that matches nearly the actual vote of 5.9 of IMDb.

30 October 2004,you get for your paycheck,"I liked 'Paycheck'. I am a science-fiction fan, and while i have seen a number of times people saving the world, as well as people succeeding to change the future (on screen, of course), I found these two themes combined have been getting a successfully direct and fair treatment in 'Paycheck'. The result is a film that is clear and easy-to-follow without losing the minimal doses of mystery and surprises to keep the interest alive. Ben Affleck looks better in 'Paycheck' than in other recent roles, and succeeds to create some emotional interest for a change. Uma Thurman is a good partner for Affleck, although one may wonder where the frail doctor in biology shes plays gets the martial arts talent from (answer - probably from playing in 'Kill Bill' :-)). According to IMDb director John Woo has no less than six films in different phases of production or preparation - I am definitely look to seeing them. The film is worth the tickets or rental price, it's good entertainment. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.

5 September 2004,It could've been so much more.,"The premise is great but there's no follow through.

The dialogue is pure velveeta, the action situations are often so far-fetched or predictable they're laughable. I'm not sure if the actors are really as bad as the bad acting or it's bad directing/script.

Maybe in light of the trend of remakes in Hollywood, this one will get remade by someone who cares. The director and screenwriter obviously didn't.

Philip Dick, who wrote the original short story, probably rolled over in his grave when this one hit the screen. (Check out his other credits.) Too bad Philip, cause the story was really cool.

21 June 2011,I should have been given a Paycheck for sitting through this garbage,"Philip K Dick wrote many stories which seemed to have great film potential. I never thought of this as one of them.

I have seen Ben Affleck in a number of films, and felt that he was good in a few, OK in most, and positively annoying in some.

I saw the horrible, misleading trailers.

The soundtrack was simply bad.

So, needless to say, I went into Paycheck with very low expectations.... and I was pleasantly surprised.

Affleck plays a talented reverse-engineer, who sees the possibilities in new technology, and is able to carry it through to fruition. He takes on top-secret jobs and has his memory erased upon the completion of each. He decides to take on a project big and profitable enough to allow him to retire comfortably for the rest of his life. He completes the project, goes through the memory erasure, and then starts to discover what he has done, and, pursued by corporate hit men and the police, tries to recover his memory. Uma Thurmond, a biologist he had fallen in love with, is one of the memories he wants to recover, and also a target.

Paycheck is more of an action film than a sci fi flick. The plot serves the action, as do the somewhat one-dimensional characters. And there is so little chemistry between Affleck and Thurmond that the romantic subplot is almost just a distraction.

8 January 2008,Wrong Ending,"Ben Affleck plays everyman. He has a bland, pleasant face. He has no memories and no unusual ability. He is just as confused by his predicament as we are. He has no idea whom to trust, and neither do we. He is betrayed again and again in ways that made me wince.

There is the mandatory car chase demolishing uncounted automobiles. The on-foot chases are much more exciting and original.

The movie starts out extremely enigmatic and dark then the secret of a brown envelope of knick knacks is revealed and from then on the movie proceeds with the predictability of a fairy story where the hero is given various gifts that you know will later come in very handy.

The plot premise, a machine that lets you see yourself in the future, is great fun. It could be spun out into dozens of movies.

The ending was disappointing. It was like the ending of a comedy when the cast come out and laugh for no reason at all. It was an idiotically sanguine ending tacked on a quite bleak body. It was trite to the point of being corny. The movie needs to be redone with an ending more in keeping with the rest of the movie, without such a jarring transition to silliness.",6
27 June 2004,Unbelievable,"I'm guessing this is not just a clever title. All of the actors involved must've been on the set for one thing and one thing only....a ""Paycheck"". Did J.Lo need Ben's net worth to be a little bit higher to pay for the wedding? Did Ben phone in his performance on this one? And please....how the hell did Johnny Paycheck get out of the high security complex to purchase the lottery ticket that was so cleverly placed under the birdcage? There were so many plot holes in this movie that it was laughable. Absolutely unbelievable.....this movie makes Johnny Pneumonic look like an Oscar-worthy film. This was a free movie rental and I would still like my money back.

13 January 2004,It doesn't surprise me.,"You know, it didn't surprise me when I heard that there are people out there who are paid to write positive reviews and give a rating of 10 for bad movies on IMDB; in hopes that it will help persuade people to go see them. Don't believe any of the positive reviews on this one. They are trying desperately to separate you from your money. On the other hand, it wouldn't surprise me to find out that there are people paid to write negative reviews and give ratings of 0 on (good or bad) movies released by rival studios. Anyways.. Avoid this one at all costs.

4 August 2004,Boring,"""Paycheck"" is a boring film. Ben Affleck wastes his talents in this mindless cinema. Unfortunately, Uma Thurman is equally wasted, since she has a smaller but staring part which is just as insipid as that of her costar. John Woo has directed a movie which seems to consist of a series of still photographs. There is little to hold it together. Even the transitions are weak. Affleck plays a physicist who is blessed or cursed with the ability to see the future. This future includes his own death, except for the fact that he is able to foil the plot at the last moment in each case. Uma Thurman plays his lover, who is a PhD. in botany. Her performance is unconvincing as is his, and the entire show is boring to the point of monotony. I would not recommend this film for moviegoers who are serious about their time. It is on the don't see list.

23 September 2013,It's payback time,"Here is another ingenious Philip K. Dick science fiction story, set in the foreseeable future, brought to the screen with particular skill. It is directed by the Chinese-born director 'John Woo' (real name Wu Yusen). Aaron Eckhart here plays a sinister industrialist who doesn't care who dies, as long as he becomes immensely rich. And he certainly carries the 'greed is good' philosophy much too far. He has been hiring his old friend Ben Affleck, a congenial young engineering genius, to design more and more exciting high-tech devices, and paying him handsomely, on the condition that Affleck go through a 'memory wipe' after finishing each job. That way, secrecy is assured. Affleck doesn't care, as he likes the easy life in between. His 'in-house times' are generally two months of confinement inside the business premises, where he is isolated from outside contact. But one day Eckhart ups the ante, and says he will give Affleck $90,000,000 (yes, you saw those zeroes right) if he will do a three-year stint inside. Affleck hesitates but finally agrees, because the attractive Uma Thurman is part of the team and he is irresistibly drawn towards her. Cut to three years later. Affleck is given his 'memory-wipe' and told to go pick up his paycheck for his $90 million. That's the paycheck of the title. But things don't work out that way. He turns up at the bank and is informed that he has voluntarily refused the $90 million and signed a form to that effect. The trouble is, he cannot remember because that was during the time for which his memory has been wiped. He protests strenuously, and things begin to turn even more sinister. He has left an envelope for himself of apparently senseless small items. These all become of life and death importance to him as the story progresses. Then people start trying to kill him, which makes him rather uncomfortable. And the struggle commences to try to find out what he did during those three years and why the corporation wants him dead ASAP. This is a really good and exciting yarn, highly recommended.",8
24 February 2020,Overpaid Cheque,"Wham, Bam, Crash, Smash ! Another film where the director seems to think if you have plenty of explosions and fireballs it makes for an exciting movie, it doesn't, it just makes it dumb, and detracts from any good acting there may be taking place.

I have watched 6 different sci-fi films in the last week and this is by far the worst, and that includes one from the 1920's.

Ben Affleck is a good actor, I know, I have seen him doing great acting in some films, but this is a below the par performance, and he seems to do quite a few movies of this ilk, must be for the money? Uma Thurman is the best, everyone else seems to be just going through the motions, the reason why ? :- the director (John Woo) seems to think that gun-play, explosions, fireballs and the like is better than watching good acting, good action and good drama. John Woo is an acclaimed director but I don't know why, does he use these techniques to make movies that westerners will like ? I am a westerner and I don't like 'em. Maybe he just had an off day ?

The story is a great one, although a little hard to believe, a genius engineer has his memory erased about a machine that he built that can see into the future. Unfortunately the machine in the movie does not look very well thought out, futuristic-ally designed but with lots of knobs and buttons and fancy lights, a bit like an amusement arcade game, if they paid more attention to the story rather than flashy contraptions, fancy lights and explosions, it could have been a good film, so right story - wrong director!

The screenplay was not great, but not too bad, photography was ok, music average, its reasonably well paced, but some of the scenes don't make much sense, and the continuity is a bit poor, and the flashback/flash forward images are not good, just confusing.

For the type of film it is, its certainly not the worst, but still a long way from being the best, I saw Looper recently, a similar type of story, but that was made more sympathetically and was twice as good as this.

If you took the same story and same actors, but a different director/editor and better screenplay, I am sure it could be made into a much better movie, how about a remake Mr Affleck?, Go-on, you know you can do it....",4
4 January 2004,Excellent script & acting,"This is by far one of the best screenplays written in a very long time. The imagination & detail were excellent. The writer takes you on a journey that causes you to think & eventually reflect on what is important in life. Not only your own personal life but how your decisions and actions can create an effect that ripples throughout the world. It shows what if you had a second chance, what would you be willing to give up for that chance. Affleck did an exceptional job in bringing the writers words to life & you empathize and are fascinated by the process that he goes through to regain his past memory.Affleck & Thurman did an excellent job. Would highly recommend for story plot & cast!!!!

30 August 2006,It's a pretty good movie...,"I mean, it's an excellent movie. I don't know why anyone wouldn't like it, and I don't mind any goofs. The actors are good, the plot is good, the acting is good, and I like the futuristic look of the background city in the movie. For example, when Michael tries to stop the train from hitting him, he opens a control box for the train, and in the box you can see clearly PCI cards and motherboard chips. (I liked that...) And if you look at the date that he signed the exchange of the personal items it says May 20th, 2007. I liked the idea of a focused lens for looking into the future... (And when he turns on the machine you can see a blue curve.) Oh, and I wanted to say that I found it interesting, while the FBI was extracting latent memories, you can see (if you play it back slowly), how he once (when he was viewing the future) typed a date for which to view, and I must note that it was brilliant to put those ""newsletters from the future"" onto the Einstein post marks.

In a nutshell: the movie is excellent, and if you didn't, I suggest you watch it.",10

8 November 2010,underrated film,"I don t know why people hate this film, it's not great but it's certainly not bad. I has its flaws but for a basic entertaining scifi thriller, you can't go wrong.

Ben Affleck is not bad either. I have read some of Phillip Dicks stuff and this is just based on the story (as is everything Hollywood makes of his) but nonetheless, it's entertaining.

There are your basic flaws and a couple ""aw come on"" moments here and there but not enough to go negative on the movie.

Now Daredevil, yes, you can complain about Affleck in that one. That was a stinker. Paycheck is okay.

6 July 2004,"Stop! If you watch this movie, you will implode!","This film has to do with being paid. My advice to Ben Affleck is: Ben baby, you will never receive another paycheck in your miserable career if you continue to make films as poorly conceived as this one.

It had not one redeeming feature, so I had to give it a ""1"", the worst possible rating. Usually, I can find at least one thing that was good, even in a lousy movie i.e. score, sound, one charismatic actor, etc. In this case, even the usually luminous presence of Uma Thurman was wasted. Her hair was ratty, there was absolutely no charisma between her and Affleck, oh, what the hell, it was a horrible movie. Do NOT rent it!

7 February 2015,not at my table,"A heaping ladle of the protagonist & his squeeze being chased around by all the dangerous people shooting guns at them - from trains, cars, motorcycles, and so on. One long, intensely boring and repetitive car chase that makes you question the meaning of your existence (if you were born to watch this, maybe better to shoot yourself).

When is Uma going to stop doing love movies? So you were ugly in high school. Lots of us were. Get over it already. You have a brain. You have no excuse.

I really doubt if the Dick story had long car chases in it. It is like a huge, bland casserole sprinkled only a tiny bit with Dick's tasty ideas. So, if you are addicted to those ideas, you have to swallow the whole greasy mess and be sick for a few days.

8 December 2018,Ben Affleck and John Woo's disaster,"How could you John Woo? Aside from a couple of signature flourishes, there's nothing to mark Paycheck as the product of acclaimed action director John Woo. In fact, there's little about this movie that makes it worth anyone's time and money. With a script that waffles between being hilariously absurd and insultingly stupid, and action scenes that won't cause anyone's pulse to skip a beat, Paycheck is less appealing than a lump of coal in a Christmas stocking. The screenplay has apparently been written with lobotomized teenagers in mind. Rarely does a character react to any situation intelligently. Suspension of disbelief is virtually impossible. Villains and heroes alike can be counted on to do the most idiotic thing in nearly every situation. And there aren't even any good action scenes to redeem this mess.

19 January 2004,Dire Total Recall wannabe,"I went to see Paycheck because it is based on a Philip K Dick story. Alas, what genius was in the story has been well and truly purged in this cynical cash-in swamp of turgid drivel. Plot - corporate conspiracy, CEO uses contractor and then wants him dead, as do the Feds. Actually, the only interesting idea in the whole movie was that memory erasure would be used in the future as the ultimate Non Disclosure Agreement. The rest is unsuspenceful chase action.

The scenes between Affleck and the love interest, a no-longer-sexy Thurman, were laughable. In an opening scene, where he chats her up, the acting is quite simply of teen soap standard. Excruciating. Everything about the action was unexciting. The chases were unexciting, the putting of two-and-two together was unexciting. When you see the Weather Machine, you just know it will be used against a baddie or two later on, and when it is, it is a joke. The acting was appalling. The bad guys were not menacing. The ending was abysmal. All the stuff in Paycheck, and more, was done with uncountably greater style, expertise, charisma, excitement, effects, class, novelty and balls in Total Recall, a which is also based on a Dick story.

Paycheck bounced. (Erk!!).",2
14 October 2020,Insufficient,"Plot holes galore, and over-the-top attempted murder by multitudinous bad guys via relentless gunshots, even throughout a drawn out motorcycle chase, without one single hit. The gov't agents are pathetic, and stay 2 steps behind. Afflack manages to pull off a happy ending with a green Uma Thermon's help, leaving everyone a step behind, including the viewer. Somehow its still a fun watch, with a good final act.

14 March 2004,John Woo tries his best to kill an intelligent plot.,"What a waste.

If the movie had been directed by someone like Terry Gilliam, and the main character had been a middle aged somewhat clumsy geek, who had to rely on his intelligence to handle situations, rather than simply picking up a karate stick and beating up 10 people at the same time. It could have worked.

The plot is nothing short of brilliant, but the movie is so filled with carchases, shootouts, fights and big explosions that its hard to notice. It also doesn't help that some of what is going on is just plain dumb. The bad guys fire a hundred bullets but miss every time, or how about a lab thats secured by a two feet thick steel door but with a big ventilation shaft making an easy escape route.

17 January 2004,Another bad John Woo movie,"Philip K Dick wrote many stories which seemed to have great film potential. I never thought of this as one of them.

I have seen Ben Affleck in a number of films, and felt that he was good in a few, OK in most, and positively annoying in some.

I saw the horrible, misleading trailers.

The soundtrack was simply bad.

So, needless to say, I went into Paycheck with very low expectations.... and I was pleasantly surprised.

Affleck plays a talented reverse-engineer, who sees the possibilities in new technology, and is able to carry it through to fruition. He takes on top-secret jobs and has his memory erased upon the completion of each. He decides to take on a project big and profitable enough to allow him to retire comfortably for the rest of his life. He completes the project, goes through the memory erasure, and then starts to discover what he has done, and, pursued by corporate hit men and the police, tries to recover his memory. Uma Thurmond, a biologist he had fallen in love with, is one of the memories he wants to recover, and also a target.

Paycheck is more of an action film than a sci fi flick. The plot serves the action, as do the somewhat one-dimensional characters. And there is so little chemistry between Affleck and Thurmond that the romantic subplot is almost just a distraction. Despite these flaws, I spent an evening being thoroughly entertained by this rehashing of the usual technology-run-amok / knowledge-is-power story. This film is very Hollywood, and uses a lot of slick and clich√©d camera-work, but nevertheless tells a good story and does it well enough.",1
27 January 2004,Surprisingly much worse than expected,"When I chose to see this film, I really did not expect anything particularly special, but at least some straight action flick, with a nice sci-fi background, featuring Uma Thurman, an actress that I really enjoyed in Kill Bill Vol I and Pulp Fiction.

If you plan to watch the movie for the same reasons - DONT.

I'm usually not too picky about flaws in the storyline, normally I don't even notice them. But here, the story features such a tremendous number of flaws that it feels like it continuously hits your forehead, saying ""OK, you managed to believe this, but will you also be dumb enough to swallow THAT without leaving the showroom screaming loudly??"". Yes, this is an action movie, and yes, you will reduce brain activity in certain areas of your brain when you watch an action movie, but unless you're completely autistic, you will feel insulted by the fact that it constantly presumes that you again didn't notice that the previous scene was completely absurd. I had a slightly similar feeling when watching M:I-2, but compared to Paycheck, M:I-2 has a very convincing and logical storyline.

The second reason why you should avoid the movie is Uma Thurman. If you liked her in Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill, you will constantly wonder why on earth she accepted to appear in this movie. I was constantly telling myself ""Uma, this is not the kind of movie you were meant to act in. Why did you accept this EXTREMELY poor storyboard?"". Her acting is so unconvincing and superficial, you will start to believe that you were wrong before, that she really is a bad actrice, and that only Tarantino knows how to unlock her well-hidden talent.

4/10 on the generous IMDB scale",4
7 July 2004,Piece of junk,"This movie starts promising. In the end it is a piece of junk you'd rather have missed. Philip K Dick is good material for movies, no problem there. Sadly enough there's still no movie that does him justice. But that's okay, as long as you get something to chew on. No, the problem here is the most tedious directorship of all time.

John Woo is not without talent. I rather enjoyed Face Off. But here he is completely one-dimensional. Through camera movements and surely much too much time allowed in the cutting room, he is taking the viewer on a leash. Watch this, now close in on that. Now jump through the hoops of these dozen quick cuts to see the motorbike chase. It's the kind of thing other directors use for at most four seconds, in the culmination of an action scene. John Woo uses it continuously, making the most unwatchable movie in history. He has lost the viewer long ago, but continues pumping in dramatic music, well-balanced camera movements from both left and right, cuts, cuts and cuts... He should go look at some good movies to learn a thing or too.",1
14 October 2007,"Half Hitchcock, half Woo, and no Dick whatsoever.","Although I only listened to half of John Woo's commentary on the DVD of this film, I don't recall him ever once uttering the name of original story author Phillip K. Dick.

In fact, Woo took on this project entirely because he thought he saw some of the same identity-displacement that Alfred Hitchcock so artfully plays up in ""North by Northwest"". And Woo has accomplished a remarkable feat in the first half of this film - it actually does have much the look and feel of Hitchcock's film, similar camera angles, similar lighting and color schemes, similar set-design.

In the second half of the film, this effect gets lost, as it becomes clear that Woo, who certainly has made some dynamite action films in the past, doesn't quite get Hitchcock's manipulation of potential action scenes for suspense effect. The amazing set-pieces in ""North by Northwest"" are so effective because of the way Hitchcock holds on to them, not in the way the action actually pays off. (We're expecting something bad from that infamous crop-duster long before it buzzes down on the unsuspecting Cary Grant).

Suspense of this kind is simply not Woo's schtick; so he reverts to what he does best and gives us an over-the-top display of chase, explosions, and gunfights.

This film is not a bad action film, it's just schizophrenic.

And the decision to make a Hitchcock tribute out of a Phillip K. Dick story is ill-advised, to say the least.

Woo needs to spend more time considering his sources before he makes another film with these kinds of references.

Entertaining, but not what it could have been.

One last point: Ben Affleck is nothing exceptional here, but Uma Thurman, whom I never expected to consider beautiful again after ""Kill Bill II"", does a nice job of looking like a young Angie Dickinson here, and for me that's quite a compliment.",7
11 February 2010,unbelievable,"any movie where the hero gets shot at and never gets hit will never get a rating of more than 5.

having your hero shot at and not hit and die will never be grounds for a good movie.

if you can't kill the hero and heroin, then don't have the guns and crossfire. shooting at will never works for mindless action - it's offensive, and stupid.

11 July 2016,"A good ride, after watching ones future.","As the memory formation takes place, the structure of neuron changes. The part in the movie where (getting rid of certain memory) this is shown is brilliant. Although going through every neuron one by one, changing in multiple numbers (for ease) would have been better. A technology where this would be possible would be very difficult to obtain. In my opinion that's impossible. It may be for the factors like human rights.

Yet the movie is better in generating thrill across ones spine.

There's part where the movie plays dumb. The lottery ticket that's obtained . . .is obtained from a cage below the paper. It's very obvious that the birds would have made the paper dirty. A little better scripting could have been resulted in an even more awesome movie.

26 December 2003,Rip it up along with Woo's DGA card,"If you like bad movies make sure you see this one. The acting is horrible, the direction is cliche' and the story has been brutally turned into a mirror image of what Hollywood believes the future will be like. The world that sci-fi writer Phillip K. Dick created is a darker and seedier world rarely represented correctly in today's films. Our future, if the cyberpunk generation is to be believed, is a dark and grimy world that has the individual person constantly in search of personal gratification and wealth. This future will be ruled by technology but not in the antispetic way so many filmmakers have created. Look to films like Blade Runner, eXistenZ and others in the cyberpunk genre to see how Dick saw our future.

Instead of a creative look at our future involving a man left to solve his own mystery we are left with a typical action thriller that looks no different than every other film out there. John Woo attempts to pay homage to Hitchcock, most notably in the appearance and actions given to Ben Affleck's character, but in doing so he cheapens the work of a great director and only reinforces the fact that he should quit making films and move onto something else. Affleck and Uma Thurman are only along for the ride and I can only assume her performance in this film will destroy any chance she has at winning her most recent Golden Globe nomination.

Resist the temptation created by what is a creative story and instead invest the money in a boxed set of Phillip K. Dick stories. Trade one bad movie for a future filled with multiple nights of enjoyment.

You can see that he wanted to break out of his typecast, as an action director ... but it just seems that he can not convey the same style with his other ingredients into an American market. Most of his US Films have not been well received by his (core) fan base. And although I always liked most of them in one way or another, this too is an example that shows me, that his HK output was much better. Not a Ben Affleck, nor a Paul Giamatti nor Uma Thurman can save this movie, for being ... dull! Shamful but true

21 December 2003,Interesting Plot!,"This was a rather good movie. Ben you have made mistakes before, but this movie is not one of them. I saw this movie Dec 20 at a very special screening. I must say the plot was quite ingenious, never seen this idea yet in the movies. Acting was very good, and there was a share amount of suspense, and finally a Hollywood movie that does not degrade to the lowest denominator resorting to human lust for sex to advance the plot or keep the action going. Good action movie, when it opens Dec 25 go see it, its a good time filler for couple of hours. Hope you are as impressed as I was! Keep up the good work Ben!

28 November 2020,Ridiculous drivel. For lovers of the Transformer series only,"Philip K Dick wrote many stories which seemed to have great film potential. I never thought of this as one of them.

I have seen Ben Affleck in a number of films, and felt that he was good in a few, OK in most, and positively annoying in some.

I saw the horrible, misleading trailers.

The soundtrack was simply bad.

So, needless to say, I went into Paycheck with very low expectations.... and I was pleasantly surprised.

Affleck plays a talented reverse-engineer, who sees the possibilities in new technology, and is able to carry it through to fruition. He takes on top-secret jobs and has his memory erased upon the completion of each. He decides to take on a project big and profitable enough to allow him to retire comfortably for the rest of his life. He completes the project, goes through the memory erasure, and then starts to discover what he has done, and, pursued by corporate hit men and the police, tries to recover his memory. Uma Thurmond, a biologist he had fallen in love with, is one of the memories he wants to recover, and also a target.

Paycheck is more of an action film than a sci fi flick. The plot serves the action, as do the somewhat one-dimensional characters. And there is so little chemistry between Affleck and Thurmond that the romantic subplot is almost just a distraction. Despite these flaws, I spent an evening being thoroughly entertained by this rehashing of the usual technology-run-amok / knowledge-is-power story. This film is very Hollywood, and uses a lot of slick and clich√©d camera-work, but nevertheless tells a good story and does it well enough.",3

15 March 2009,Another Dick shot,"Ben Affleck designs products for companies that make them untold millions of dollars, and then has his memory erased after each development, and sent home with a very fat pay check for his efforts. His latest effort, three years in the making, has him running from assassins and the FBI, and Affleck finds he's short about $90 million. Instead, he has an envelope with several found objects to help him survive. Sound like a P.K. Dick plot? It is. The movie never amounts to much of anything, but the action is nonstop and Affleck is fun to watch as a brainy guy trying to remember what he has been made to forget. Uma Thurman is a scientist and his love interest, but she is not given nearly enough to do. The normally affable Aaron Eckhart is the bad guy. Worth a look.

29 March 2006,Paycheck: When the Price Wasn't Almost Right **1/2,"Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman star in this thriller about a guy who agrees to give up 3 years of his life to participate in a study. Actually, he is working on a machine that can predict the future.

When the 3 years is up, Affleck discovers that he has been taken in by an elaborate scheme of up and coming actor Aaron Eckhart (""Thank You for Smoking."") Paul Giamatti costars as a faithful Affleck pal.

There is plenty of action since Affleck at first doesn't know what's going on except for the fact that he is taken by the FBI and accused of treason. What results is plenty of action with car chases, fighting and all sorts of mayhem. The film then becomes a matter of destroying a machine which shows the future. Evidently, the future is not that great.

Thurman has a Ph.D in biology in this film. You'd need that degree from the first part of the film to figure out what's going on. Miss Thurman looks like she is suffering from anorexia in some scenes.

To survive, Affleck must go through precisely what he has done during the past 3 years. Thank the lord we don't have to wait that long.",6
11 January 2004,John Woo not right for Philip K. Dick,"Philip K. Dick must be rolling in his grave right now. Not because this is a bad movie. The movie isn't bad. However, it is not a Philip K. Dick movie. You see, there is more to a story that the plot and characters. There is tone. Philip K. Dick has a very distinctive tone in his works (a tone better captured by Minority Report and Blade Runner). This movie does not have a Philip K. Dick tone.

John Woo is very good at what he does, one of the best. He makes very, very good action movies. That's just the problem. Philip K. Dick stories are not made to be action movies. They are more philosophical than anything. They are about the possible dangers of technology. John Woo does not do philosophy. John woo does explosions. Lots of explosions. The lesson in the movie is that in the future, the explosions are more elaborate.

This movie is based on Dick's work the way Dreamcatcher was based on Steve-o's work, or The Ten Commandments was based on the Bible. As a movie, this is decent. As an adaptation, this is crap.

If you want to see a good adaptation, rent The Green Mile or The Client. If you want to see a decent action movie, go see Paycheck.",

26 December 2003,Oh my God was this a bad flick!,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Ben is one of the most vacant, wooden, expressionless actors to ever grace the big screen. He writes a great script, he dates some hot women - but the man just can't translate any emotion from the script to the screen. And speaking of scripts...did anybody read this one? I don't care if it is a few years in the future, they'd never let two strangers just walk into a high school, stroll into a lab and then allow them to start using a microscope! And why do all of the shipping containers that they race through have no back ends on them? And during said chase seen can we try for just a LITTLE continuity in the weather instead of sunny then cloudy then wet streets then dry all within the same few seconds? And why give up the money to begin with to then just reaquire it at the end? And why did Uma look so bad through most of the movie? And are there any two people who have less chemistry than Ben and Uma (OK, Matt and Franka in 'Bourne'), And why don't people who are trying to kill people just shoot them when they have a chance instead of concocting some elaborate, inane plot that gives the opposition plenty of time to concoct an equally implausable escape? And Woo! Get rid of the goddam dove! What a waste of film - not one single character that I gave a damn about. BTW, I didn't want to see this but everything else was sold out at the AMC 30.",1

16 March 2007,Paycheck is well worth the money,"""Paycheck"" was very reminiscent of the movie ""Memento"". ""Paycheck"" had a similar plot, with enough variances to not be a mimicry. Like ""Memento"", ""Paycheck"" kept each sequential event a mystery up until it was discovered by the main character, Michael Jennings (Ben Affleck).

Michael was an engineer that had a particular talent for reverse engineering certain products and devices so that the company he contracted for could use the design and/or improve upon it. Part of his contract, and part of the reason he was highly paid, was that he had to have his memory of the entire event erased after completing the project. His final project was the biggest payday of all, but once he had his memory erased and went to check on his funds, he had nothing but an envelope with some miscellaneous items.

I have to give John Woo kudos on this project, because it was well done. I'm not particularly a John Woo fan because I think most of his movies are over the top with the action and stunts, but this was relatively tame. Action and stunts were not a primary or significant component of this movie. The aim of this movie was to keep you guessing and figuring and ultimately rooting for the main character to achieve his goal so that you as the viewer could understand the meaning of everything that happens. It was a very good story that was matched by its directing. Paycheck is worth paying to see.",8

24 August 2004,It's all about second chances...,"What if you had a chance to change your future, change what you would become? Would you embrace the challenge, or would you simply give up to fate? These are questions Michael (Ben Affleck) faces after he creates a machine that allows you to see around the curve of time into the future. I really liked the 'If you see your future you no longer have a future' concept as well as the second chances theme--I felt they were appropriately explored and executed.

The most I could say for this movie is that it started off intelligent and intriguing, but then the similiarities between it and Minority Report make it feel all too familiar, not to mention overall, it just sort of strings you along. Plot points took too long to be executed, and consequently, I soon lost interest. It was also a bit sketchy in parts-- inconsequential things were made to seem important which detracted from the story. Then you consider that there's a lot of action, though it's certainly not indicative of other John Woo films. Somehow, it just winds up being what I can only describe as boring action--it's there, but you just can't get into it--it feels forced and uneventful. Then there's the characters. Ben Affleck puts in a solid effort as the confused but ingenious engineer, but he just can't seem to follow through. I thought Uma did a wonderful job as the honest and hearty biologist--kudos to her.

Overall, I don't think Paycheck lived up to its full potential; it started off promising, but didn't really deliver. It was entertaining, but not particularly suspenseful or thrilling as one might expect. Normally movies like this I endeavor to decipher what's going on and how things will turn out, but while this movie tried to have this element present, you had the overall sense that you basically knew what was going to happen, so you just wind up letting it play out. The best action/suspense movies suck you into the plot and you don't even realize you were sucked in till the credits roll. You just don't get that with this movie.

Verdict: Definitely worth seeing, but don't expect your conventional John Woo action flick...

29 December 2003,MISFIRE AGAIN FOR PHILIP K. DICK :(,"PAYCHECK (2003) ** Ben Affleck, Uma Thurman, Aaron Eckhart, Colm Feore, Paul Giamatti, Joe Morton, Michael C. Hall. Middling adaptation of Philip K. Dick's short story about a callow free-lance engineer who sells his wares in place of his memory only to have it catch up to him in the long run when he is marked for assassination and can only rely on some odd clues from the past he sent from the future. Affleck is ok as the bland hero but Thurman is wasted as his amour and Eckhart is coasting as a baddie in this half-baked Hitchcockian thriller wannabe logily directed by John Woo (!) of all people! A misfire on all accounts.

The title is very interesting PAYCHECK....I think it's an inside joke or something....it's very curious how appropriate that title is....that's all it was for the directors, actors involved....one big paycheck. Ben Affleck...what's going on? Am I upset, yes. THe movie is about as implausible...as messed up of a plotline...as meaningless....as one could imagine. Do I have a strong dislike for movies like this...you can tell right. I'm serious folks, do yourselves a favor...honor yourselves...and save the money....that's my advice. I'm serious...if we all started expecting more quality and not supporting and paying for meaningless neon lights like this.....we would we quite literally have a much more interesting world. The quality of the products we produce....is a reflection of the society we create and live in. When we waste our energy and talent and money....our world can be as meaningless as this movie. With a movie like this being produced, it's no wonder that our country is in such a mess.. is all one big picture.

28 December 2003,"Terrible, such a disappointment from John Woo.","I was excited about seeing Paycheck, being a big fan of John Woo's previous work. Needless to say, I was terribly disappointed with the movie altogether. Affleck was horrible in this movie, and I am beginning to think that he should stick to the only thing that I have enjoyed him in, Commentary tracks from Kevin Smith DVDs. Words cannot describe the disappointment that I had in this movie, I think that the only thing that was enjoyable was the score. Uma Thurman was totally forgettable in this role, Aaron Eckhart's hair was the only thing worse than his acting. Mr. Woo, please go back to making great movies again, I have forgiven you for MI:2, but Paycheck made me think that you have lost it. Everybody, do yourself a favour and save your $ for something better at the theatre. If you are in dire need for some great John Woo Action, check out Face/Off.

9 June 2004,"I too am an ""unemployed critic,"" but . . .","am far less impressed. It is only fair to say, however, that Dick has been getting a lot of cinema credit lately, and that is good.

Too bad PAYCHECK has been reduced to teeny-bopper fare. Affleck was advertised and ""smart and sexy,"" but as a male I am unimpressed. The character is totally unbelievable. Moreover, the knock-out who inevitably becomes his girlfriend, Ph.D. in biology who looks like a cover of COSMOPOLITAN and acts like a Vegas tart -- and really comes through super-liberated in a fight -- is likewise.

I know: what an old foof, you say. He wants his geniuses to look like Jeremy Brett and his heroines to look like Helen Mirren. Well, not quite, but it would be an improvement. This software genius, collar ad, hell-bent motorcycle jockey (for the INEVITABLE car chase) and martial artist is simply too much. The most believable character, not, sorry to say the fine Canadian actor Colm Fiore, is the goofy bearded side-kick and comic relief.

This is pure Generation Y stuff. It is built upon a clever premise and loused up in the delivery and exploiting of ""sexy"" principals.",
24 May 2004,A miss from John Woo,"This is decent popcorn fare, but I cant help feeling it could have been great had it been handled better via a better script, a better lead star and more coherency with the plot. The story is a fairly original and intelligent one, which is based on a short story by Phillip K. Dick, the brains behind the stories that spawned better Sci-Fi films such as Blade Runner, Minority Report and Total Recall. In this movie, Ben Afleck plays a computer expert that is paid to do a job, and then have his memory erased, usually because these jobs require him to partake in illegal activity. All is going well for Ben; as he says himself ""it's a good life"", until he gets a job offer for a three year job that will make him 'rich beyond his wildest dreams'. That's where the trouble starts.

Ben Afleck's character is poorly developed, and all we really get to know about him is that he's greedy and likes money, which we already know after the first few minutes anyway, rendering the rest of the movie devoid in the character development area. The development in this movie is a far cry from Dick's other stories, such as Blade Runner and that is a real shame as the audience isn't made to care or feel anything about the guy; and that ultimately costs this film. The supporting cast isn't much to shout about either, as their roles require them to be little more than ornaments for the plot. This unfortunately includes Uma Thurman's character, who feels the brunt of poor writing more than anyone else, and even comes across as superfluous for the majority of the film. Still, Uma can at least take pride in the fact that she was in one fairly good movie last year after the lamentable Kill Bill. However, despite the writing, as with all John Woo films, the main star of the film is the action sequences, of which this movie has plenty; most notably the motorbike chase, which is very nice indeed. However, good action sequences alone are hardly enough to completely carry a movie, and they aren't enough here either.

The film has a relatively good first forty-five minutes, which null you into believing that you're in for a movie that is a lot better than this one actually is. The first forty-five minutes, despite script problems are intelligent and doused with a strong sense of anticipation as you watch Ben Afleck wonder exactly how he has found himself in the situation he's in. However, as previously mentioned; this is, unfortunately, short lived, and it doesn't take long for the movie to descend into the realms of rubbish.

If all you want is to be entertained for a couple of hours, you can certainly do a lot worse than Paycheck, but on the other hand you can do a lot better also. It's entertaining enough to narrowly avoid being a bad film, but it's only narrowly and I would recommend watching something else overall.",6
26 July 2019,my notes,"Terrible. perfect example of old movies sucking. filled with old movie attributes. so many cheesy and corny parts, so much to make fun of, so many dumb moments, some bad acting (maybe, but sometimes i wonder why the director/editor would keep that shot in the movie, might not always be on the actors). filled with flaws, lots of plot holes and things you can question. i loved this movie when it came out. that's cause i was young, dumb and an inexperienced movie viewer. (about 3 viewings)

15 July 2007,"The leads can't act, the director isn't the right one for this material.","Philip K Dick wrote many stories which seemed to have great film potential. I never thought of this as one of them.

I have seen Ben Affleck in a number of films, and felt that he was good in a few, OK in most, and positively annoying in some.

I saw the horrible, misleading trailers.

The soundtrack was simply bad.

So, needless to say, I went into Paycheck with very low expectations.... and I was pleasantly surprised.

Affleck plays a talented reverse-engineer, who sees the possibilities in new technology, and is able to carry it through to fruition. He takes on top-secret jobs and has his memory erased upon the completion of each. He decides to take on a project big and profitable enough to allow him to retire comfortably for the rest of his life. He completes the project, goes through the memory erasure, and then starts to discover what he has done, and, pursued by corporate hit men and the police, tries to recover his memory. Uma Thurmond, a biologist he had fallen in love with, is one of the memories he wants to recover, and also a target.

Paycheck is more of an action film than a sci fi flick. The plot serves the action, as do the somewhat one-dimensional characters. And there is so little chemistry between Affleck and Thurmond that the romantic subplot is almost just a distraction. Despite these flaws, I spent an evening being thoroughly entertained by this rehashing of the usual technology-run-amok / knowledge-is-power story. This film is very Hollywood, and uses a lot of slick and clich√©d camera-work, but nevertheless tells a good story and does it well enough.",5
17 April 2004,Alright,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs

From Philip K Dick,the scribe behind the likes of Minority Report,Total Recall and Blade Runner,comes another high concept vision of the future.

Michael Jennings (Ben Affleck) is a 'reverse engineer' who has been hired for a special mission.After completion of the task,however,it is three years later,he has waived all his rights to any financial assets he may have owned and he finds himself married to the beautiful Dr Rachel Porter (Uma Thurman).All of which he has no memory of.Also,for some reason,the FBI is on his trail.The clock is ticking...

Despite the reliably wooden Affleck and a confused and,surprisingly considering it's source,not that interesting story,this is actually an okay action film.It has a nice soundtrack and there are occasional flourishes in the script that entertain and engage.The action's watchable more often than not,though not of the standard of what could be called John Woo's best.Much like with MR,the concept is a bit more far fetched and ridiculous than genuinely thought provoking,though a bit more conceivable despite this.Paycheck is a slightly more enjoyable film than MR to boot,and in my book,that would make it one okay film.***",
7 January 2013,"Interesting Premise, poorly acted by the lead","This script has twists and turns in it that keep the audience in suspense, yet they could have found a better lead, who walked his way through the part.The movie is worth a look, if only to watch Uma Thurman walk across the set. If you have two hours to waste, this movie in its entirety I would put ahead of Mickey Mouse goes to sea. Watch it on cable or dish, don't waste a dime purchasing it. The premise of this movie, controlling outcomes before they happen, is not new in the scifi genre, as exemplified by Minority Report, which takes a different approach to a similar outcome. This movie was not role to make it's lead a star, yet he forges ahead with a movie way over his head. 2 1/2 stars for this non-masterpiece.

27 February 2021,Would Have Been Better Minus The Woo!,"Paycheck or Paycheque sets up a really interesting story, then in true Americanised John Woo style, shoots itself in the foot.

How?

Action sequences that step way outside the characters realm.

If Woo had restrained himself to Clear and Present Danger level of action, Paycheck would have been something special. However, as he went for JCVD level of action it completely undermines the strength of the story.

Its a real shame, but if you can ignore the action absurdities then the movie is great.

2 March 2004,"Check Baby, Check Baby, One, Two, Three, Four....","A migraine-headache waiting to happen is the best way to sum up ""Paycheck"". It is one of those films that tries to dazzle with confusion, but ends up being a stupid and down-right dumb attempt to bring in people looking for mindless explosions. Reserve engineer Ben Affleck literally makes millions as an expert who works on products designed by others. He does this to discover how the machine works and eventually improve on it. Thus big futuristic corporations come to him in droves, but when shady associate Aaron Eckhart comes Affleck's way the suspense builds. Affleck, who has been having memories of his work erased, is offered a huge pay-day of over $90 million after he completes a job for Eckhart. Naturally though there is a major catch---the work will take three years to complete. Affleck weighs the options and of course decides that the money is just too much to pass up. All seems to go well until Affleck denies himself his paycheck and he does not know why (because of his memory being erased). An envelope with 19 clues are the keys to why Affleck did what he did. Is it also possible for Affleck to foretell future events now? Scientist Uma Thurman is also along for the winding ride as the lover that Affleck has forgotten. ""Paycheck"" is pure science fiction trash that makes itself out to be clever, but is never intelligent. The performances are fair, but are almost hard to notice because you are so busy trying to figure out what is going on. Really there is no clear answer to the myriad of questions involved here. I had to ask myself repeatedly what I was even doing watching this. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",
28 December 2003,"Uma should kill Bill, Ben should hang with JLo","""Sometimes the best times of your life are mistakes."" that was the best line of the movie. Unfortunately, I could not say the same thing for the movie itself. Yes, it was a mistake, but it wasn't even close to best time. It was my mistake to expect something like Face/Off, but the John Woo, at least, must have done something better to continue his MI2 reputation. The movie is simple Hollywood movie. The idea actually is not bad, but the plot and events are so simple that diamond ring becomes less important that an clip. Let's do ""reverse engineer"" everything and assume that I didn't pay $7.5 and didn't see the movie and didn't write this. Shortly, I love Uma in Kill Bill! and I love Jeniffer Lopez alone, without Ben.

11 January 2004,SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR A LOT BETTER MOVIE,"I have watched tons of movies in my life, both good, bad, in between, and this one, at it's very best is in between. I saw this movie at the 10 PM showing at our local theater tonight along with my wife, and maybe at the very most, 15 other people and not counting the one couple that left out in the first 20 min of the movie saying what a yuk movie. Those two things should have told me something right there!! I can really say this is one of the most boring and dull movies I have seen lately to be a so called Action movie. It did indeed have a few minutes of actual very exciting chase scenes that could actually make you think it truly was an action type film in those precious few minutes, but it was short lived and so late in coming it was too late to salvage the boring beginning of the story. I actually had to nudge my wife several times during this movie just to keep her awake long enough to know anything about what was going on in this complicated nightmare of an action movie. That itself is indeed a very rare occurrence, as she loves movies as much as I do and unless a movie is absolutely terrible would never doze off in a movie. I am also not going to be a Ben basher, but I must say this is not a movie seemed to really be best suited for him as the leading role. He just seems to lack the excitement of a true action actor. Uma was also a really bad choice as well for the leading lady for this movie in my opinion. Her face looked like it had been cooked in a deep fryer around her cheek area and she looked like she was about 15-20 years too old for the part. What was up with all that? I hardly even recognized her at the first of the movie, had it not been for the short blonde straggly hair and her voice. This movie really was so boring during the first half of the movie that most people would have been asleep by the time the real good stuff even started, what little of it there even was of it. I kept thinking it was going to improve early but it was almost to the end of the movie before anything of notable mention even began to transpire. I really wished several times during the movie I had made a different choice for a flick to see for my weekend out, but maybe next time I will not go with my instinct to see an action movie just because it was played up to be just that. Like I said before, save your money on this loser and wait until it hits the cable box and don't even waste the cost of a PPV, as it won't be a long-lived feature there either. At it's very best I would rate this movie a 4 out of 10. Kars",
24 January 2004,Unresaonable expectations,"Not sure if this is a compliment or not when I say that people often have unreasonably high expectations of Hollywood. As one who has read over 90% of Asimov's science fictions, many of them over three times each, I totally agree with the comment that suggests that Hollywood should discover The Dean. (Hollywood has in fact tried, with Bicentennial Man, portrayed reasonably well by Robin Williams). However, a lot of people seem to have the aspiration of going to a Hollywood flick for two hours and emerge a PhD (especially those who saw the actions flick Matrix series). Hollywood movies are essentially to entertain. Those desiring an education should attend a more appropriately operated institution.

Nor can a generally highly esteemed director be expected to invariably maintain his high aspirations in every movie he makes. Those who feel that Paycheck is not up to par as a John Woo movie may wish to consider that making a movie, inasmuch as an endeavour in creative art, is also a job. In Paycheck, we do see two standard John Woo stand-offs, one dove, plus an exciting climax action finale that serves adequately, if not superbly, as Woo's signature. Also, he wisely refrained from indulging in too much of the touching sentiments here. While they worked well in some of his other Hollywood movies (Face off, MI2), to overdo it, however, would be a mistake.

Once these unreasonable expectations are out of the way, Paycheck becomes an enjoyable action flick (I even refrain from saying Sci Fi). The game the moviemakers play with the audience on the 'twenty items' is fun. Affleck and Thurman are doing just fine, but it's the villains that I love. Aaron Eckhart is one of the two male non-big-stars that I most enjoy watching, although obviously Paycheck is nothing in comparison with Possession. (The other is Josh Lucas). Colm Feore, as I mentioned in my comments on Chicago, I saw filling in as Professor Henry Higgins in a performance of My Fair Lady I attended at the Canadian Stratford Festival in the falls of 2002. The regular (which happened to be the Artistic Director of the Festival) got sick. Instead of putting in the understudy, they called in Feore in the last minute. He won a standing ovation with his performance. Although neither of their roles is really worthy for Eckhart and Feore, just having them in the movie is great.",
21 May 2004,When will the Doves Cry?,"I used to THINK that John Woo was a terrible director. A director who fills the boring spaces between over the top action scenes, with poor acting and

laughable dialogue. Now..... I KNOW that he sucks.... Maybe 2 horrid movies in a row will end the torture that is John Woos career as a director.... (Windtalkers)

Here are a couple of things that make know sense in this movie.... 1. He never establishes that futuristic cigarettes dont make smoke.... (how they would explain that I have no idea....) 2. The ONLY item he sends him self that is remotely clever is the crossword

puzzle. 3. How did Uma and Ben ride around on Motercylcles?.... They clearly stated that he could not leave the complex. 4. Is it not pathetic that Woo has tried to give him self a signature shot? The White Dove In Slow Motion (WDISM) wasn't cool the first time he used it in Hong Kong.

In MY opinion, John Woo has never made a good movie. He has made 1 or 2

OK movies... He should become a stunt director instead......",2
9 January 2004,Ben is the luckiest man alive,"One bad film after another and the man just keeps on trucking. Gotta give him credit... I can't act either but I don't have his millions.

I give this film 1/2 out of 10 stars.

The premise is very interesting but Ben Affleck is pure poison. After Chasing Amy... nevermind...

One question: how did they happen to know exactly how long the reverse engineering projects would take? Wouldn't they have to know exactly what they were going to do in order to schedule exactly two months for completion? And, if they know what they are going to do, why did they need Ben?

14 November 2005,high tech movie with low tech action,"the movie was set in a high tech frame, but the substance of the movie kept reverting to predictable action spots with guns, fists and glass breaking. not very high tech or futuristic.

the acting was OK. shorty was the best role in the movie. he was the most real of all. affleck and thurman are just OK. cannot seem to get to see affleck in a really good role for him or a movie where he jumps out. he is just OK. villains are all just that, too. OK. the plot was an interesting one, trade 3 years for 90 million? a good question most would have a had time answering, if you are 30 years old. the plot twists somewhat kept you on edge, but too much time on the same old macho type of ""action."" boring!

overall, i am glad it was on a free movie channel. would only rent this movie as a ""2 for 1"" deal.

11 December 2021,Decent plot but ruined with shoddy direction!!,"Paycheck is a science fiction action film directed by John Woo. The film stars Ben Affleck, Uma Thurman, Aaron Eckhart, Paul Giamatti, Michael C. Hall, Joe Morton, and Colm Feore.

An engineer who was offered a hefty paycheck to develop a machine due to which his life comes in danger, now with his memory erased he has to start joining the missing dots.

This film is a perfect example of how to ruin a prefect script. There is no doubt that the film has great potential but the shoddy direction and cliched screenplay ruins what could've been a perfect Sci-Fi film.

The acting is average and none of the character looked impressive, Ben Affleck, Uma Thurman and Aaron Eckhart all of them are seasoned actors but fails to impress. Even the chemistry between the main characters is also missing.

The screenplay of the film is also average and doesn't have the ingredients to keep you engaged. The film progresses with too many flaws and illogical scenes. Actions scenes are just average and climax of the film is senseless and unimpressed. Please avoid if you can.",4
4 January 2004,This movie sucked... Don't waste your money on it...,"This is the second time that I've been greatly disappointed by a movie that was based on a short story. Before seeing it I thought it's going to be a ""Bourne Identity"" but with the brother's switched (Ben/Matt). The movie is nothing of that nature. All it is is a big action flick with a lots of shots being fired and lots of fighting, let's face it - it's John Woo, however his movies of late have become really bad (Windtalkers?? MI:2?????) and this one is no exception. I don't even want to go into the individual faults of the movie because I'll be typing away until tomorrow and that is more time I'd be wasting on such a bad movie.

I honestly wish I could have my wasted time back...

18 June 2004,THIS MOVIE IS BETTER THAN THESE REVIEWS,"As I read the reviews here, complaining about this and that and the other, all I could think of was how illiterate the youth of today is. They can't wait to come to the IMDb and put their incoherent blather out there for all to see - anonymously, of course. They can't spell, they can't construct a reasonable sentence, well, you get the idea. Of course, the young ones (and believe me, they're YOUNG) who bashed this are the same people who get all hot and bothered over equally idiotic fare like Independence Day, Spiderman, Daredevil, and all that junk.

I really don't see the difference between this and those films. They are what they are, and you either like them or not. I'm no fan of Ben Affleck, but here his presence is at least the equal of other action ""stars"" like Keanu Reeves. That's not that much of a compliment, but he's not the terrible actor here he's been elsewhere. John Woo is a terrific director. A lot of the ""reviewers"" here blame the entire film, plot and dialogue on him. Note to ""reviewers"": Mr. Woo was the DIRECTOR. He did not write the short story the film is based on, nor did he write the screenplay. You don't like the script, don't blame the director.

As it stands, the film is solidly paced, with some terrific action scenes, and I actually enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Why the ""reviewers"" can't accept the plot points of this film but accept the plot points of awful movies like Independence Day and Spiderman is beyond me. It makes no sense to me - certain bad films (really bad hit films) they're happy to suspend disbelief for, others they cry foul. It's really the height of idiocy when you think about it. This was designed as a typical now action film, and in that regards it's no better or worse than the plethora of garbage that Hollywood calls movie-making today. Want to know the true villains of the movie business? Not John Woo. No, Robert McKee and Syd Field. If you don't know who they are, do a little research. These idiots are the screenplay gurus who singlehandedly have done more to hurt the movie business than anyone else. Oh, and of course, neither guru has ever written a successful screenplay.",
15 January 2023,"""I was eating pie!!!""","Reverse engineer Michael Jennings is offered the deal of a lifetime; he's offered an 8 figure sum by billionaire Jimmy Rethrick, but the catch is that he will have to give up 3 years of his life (once the 3 year period is up his memories of the last 3 years will be wiped). However, when Michael attempts to claim his 8 figure sum, he soon realises that no money is there and he also find himself on the run based on things he did over the 3 years which has no recollection of doing...

There's a well-known saying in life that if something looks or seems too good to be true then the chances are that it probably is and I get the feeling that Paycheck acts as a sort of dark social commentary on this subject matter. Despite being warned by his friend Shorty not to do this job, Jennings ignores the advice given by his friend which is what ultimately puts him in the mess that he finds himself in (clearly Jennings was just seeing dollar signs from the outset).

Outside of the story, the film is pretty good as an actioner; John Woo (if nothing else) is a good action director and creates many fast-paced and exciting chase sequences. Although it is exciting and fun to watch it isn't perfect in some technical areas (the editing is a bit choppy and some of Woo's trademark slow-motion shots can sometimes look a bit cheesy), but in the main Paycheck is packed with incident and there's rarely a dull moment.

The acting is another selling point here; Affleck can be a bit hit and miss in my book, but he makes for a likeable lead here and does fairly well. Eckhart and Feore are superb as the villains of the piece. Giamatti and Thurman are also very good as well.

Some may criticise the film for not being particularly original and whilst I agree with those people what one has to remember is that some of the films that Paycheck is similar to were, like this film, penned by Philip K Dick so this can hardly be considered as a big surprise.

Paycheck isn't the best Philip K Dick adaptation that I have seen, but it's still a worthy entry which I found to be very enjoyable.

HONOURABLE MENTION: It's the first time that I've ever seen a film that I can only acknowledge as being a battle of the bum chins (between Eckhart and Affleck) and whilst totally inconsequential to the film I felt it was worthy of mention.",7
16 September 2022,Ben Affleck Is Great In This Pure Sci-Fi Popcorn Action Thriller.,"Ben Affleck plays Michael Jennings a reverse engineer who does technical jobs for big companies & then has his memory erased for big Paychecks but this last job given to him by a shady millionaire played by Aaron Eckhart (The Dark Knight, Olympus Has Fallen) is supposed to be Jennings final big Paycheck but it all goes wrong. Jennings worked for a few years, the most he's ever done, for a huge Paycheck that he never has to do this again but when his memory is erased he finds out he's wanted for treason & murder. Paycheck is a damn good action thriller directed by action master John Woo who has made a purely entertaining piece of futuristic science fiction action. It's an interesting concept of working on top secret jobs that after you finished you have your memory of it erased & Affleck plays it well as likeable Jennings. Affleck is on the run in Paycheck & has to outsmart his former company & their hitmen as he pieces together what he doesn't remember. A fun & interesting sci-fi concept.

Paycheck is a fun special effects type action film with a solid cast with sexy Uma Thurman as Jennings love interest & Colm Feore & Aaron Eckhart.

Paycheck is a movie that has mystery, corruption & suspenseful chase sequences all held together by a big leading man star Ben Affleck, who at this time of 2003 he was a huge star that starred in big films like Daredevil & Changing Lanes & The Sum Of All Fears for example. Affleck was a big rising star in his early 2000's glory days (i hated his silly Rom Coms though) I always thought Affleck was a likeable lead actor & I've always been a fan. Paycheck is definitely a big fun action popcorn blockbuster that was made purely for a fun thrill-ride & thats exactly what you get.

I think Paycheck is a very underrated movie that no one ever seems to mention or like but I'm a fan.",7

21 January 2004,For the love of Pete,"Someone, please stop letting John Woo make movies. He commented that science fiction only serves movies in that it creates good opportunity for special effects. He took a perfectly good plot with a lot of potential and turned it into nonsensical drivel. When Michael Jennings (Ben Afleck) dispatches hoards of nameless armed henchmen with a broomstick, you can nod your head in understanding that this is all made plausible because the director showed him practicing earlier in the movie.

23 May 2004,Action-focused Woo vehicle...,"1st watched 5/22/2004 - 4 out of 10(Dir-John Woo): Action-focused Woo vehicle leaves about the same taste in your mouth as his other films. Typically, Woo chooses a gimmick(this one is the idea of losing your short-term memory after each paycheck in a time-travel kind of setting), and then makes the action the main focus making the viewer lose interest in the story and tires you out from caring about the rest. I almost fell asleep on this one a couple of times due to the fact that the action seemed like the only thing that was important. Ben Affleck is the man who is promised money to do a job has his memory set and then removed when the job is done and is handed a paycheck(usually a large one). In the latest deal, he meets looker Uma Thurman briefly before the job begins and, of course, interacts with her during the job. We never get to see what happens during the job but for some reason he doesn't receive the money this time but is given a few items in an envelope that help him survive various attacks throughout the movie. What we find out is that the idea of traveling into the future is accomplished and that's why he received these items instead of the money. OK, now that I've got you confused, watch the movie but maybe have a couple of cups of coffee in you to keep you going.",4
4 June 2004,"As normal, A poorly written yet large budget flick.","I personally can see Ben A. in some very moving rolls, i have seen his talent in lower budget films by the insanely fantastic Kevin Smith. Yet even a great actor can get sweep up in a poorly written sceenplay such as this, or maybe it was the lack guidance throughout the film. Both Ben and Thurman are compatible looking people but there was not any movement to their attachment. I feel that we as a whole are being taking for a ride at experience of our intelligence. Ben is going to go on to great performances, i wish that maybe the large paycheck was equal to a large performance but in a world of 120 day productions and cram it down the publics throats attitudes, i believe we will only see more of the same. To all actors when is the 20 mil paycheck enough, how much money does one person need. Maybe some will see this and go back to what they started, entertaining. I will always like Ben and Thruman but will always feel cheated and ask the question, would Hepburn do it for the money, or to see the look on the face of person that they took away from all there problems for a short time with there performance. Please excuse the spelling i'm worn out.

22 May 2004,Bounched Check?,"Dialogue more fit for a poorly made Manga film; should be named the-film-where-everyone-states-the obvious. Bad acting, scripting, and what else. Purely bad - and should most likely be called ""bounced check"" instead as it's more fitting ;-). I sincerely hope that Hollywood soon sees the light, and gets to make something original, believable and with good actors. Maybe they should send all the directors, producers and actors to film academies in Europe so they MIGHT learn something. Not sure if I can manage to add anything constructive to this review; except please do avoid this film at all cost. Hopefully Mr Woo will find his way back to his true talents such as was shown in Face-Off.

Affleck plays a talented reverse-engineer, who sees the possibilities in new technology, and is able to carry it through to fruition. He takes on top-secret jobs and has his memory erased upon the completion of each. He decides to take on a project big and profitable enough to allow him to retire comfortably for the rest of his life. He completes the project, goes through the memory erasure, and then starts to discover what he has done, and, pursued by corporate hit men and the police, tries to recover his memory. Uma Thurmond, a biologist he had fallen in love with, is one of the memories he wants to recover, and also a target.

Paycheck is more of an action film than a sci fi flick. The plot serves the action, as do the somewhat one-dimensional characters. And there is so little chemistry between Affleck and Thurmond that the romantic subplot is almost just a distraction. Despite these flaws, I spent an evening being thoroughly entertained by this rehashing of the usual technology-run-amok / knowledge-is-power story. This film is very Hollywood, and uses a lot of slick and clich√©d camera-work, but nevertheless tells a good story and does it well enough.",8
1 May 2022,unique and interesting plot,"This film might sound like other types of this genre with the action and coverups and such but its not. Woo has done something more unique here bringing the threat of technology into the mix. I particular liked jennings envolpe of items which was pretty interesting to be made and I liked how each played out. The cast all did well. I enjoyed afflects performance here along with uma thurman and everyone else for that matter. Altogether a pretty interesting and action packet movie that i throughly enjoyed.

22 November 2019,"Awesome When I Was Thirteen, Now It's Just Watchable.","I was thirteen when this film first hit theaters, and I loved it when I first saw it. It's fast paced, filled with 'really cool' sci-fi quasi-tech, there's enough action to blow the socks off any Mountain Dew-fueled preteen, and it has more twists than a Sheepshank knot. It is, in short, exactly the kind of flick I thought was cooler than Miles Davis and Shaved Ice put together when I first saw it.

This film also thinks it's cooler than it really is; it has a techno-poppy soundtrack, it uses dozens of weird editing techniques to make things look flashier than they actually are, and the design for some of the tech inside Allcom (the Bad Guy's Company) is so farfetched and silly that it makes the ice fortress hideout in ""Die Another Day"" seem somewhat plausible. This movie is nothing short of ridiculous, but it's also a decent amount of fun; rewatching this film last night certainly came with its fair share of nostalgia, and I actually enjoyed it far more than I had anticipated (I half expected to be ruining a childhood favorite with my rewatch). This movie isn't good, but it certainly provides enough entertainment to warrant one watch.",5

This movie isn't generally well received, but I like a clairvoyance story. It's always fun to have fate itself be an antagonist.

Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman do action well and play off of each other surprisingly well.

29 May 2004,Read the short story. Don't see the film.,"The only good thing about this movie is the story told based on the short story from which the storyline was conceived. Get the point? Read the short story, skip the film, and save your time.

It's certainly not Dick's best short story, but I'm a Dick fan and just enjoy Dick.

The movie is insulting to me in many ways. The action sequences are f'in ridiculous. Engineer Affleck is now James Bond. The James Bond actors aren't even credible nowadays by today's standards, much less lanky gangly Affleck. Affleck's character (his general character, not in this movie, I mean) is that he's as sweet as a puppy. He then should be used primarily for romantic comedies and perhaps romantic dramas.

Woo should should be ashamed for the goofy action sequences that leave much unexplained as to several of our hero's escapes. This is perhaps Woo's worst effort at film-making.

You can observe that the film is very low budget and also that it was rushed in the making. I think Woo was thinking to himself ""Let's just get this film(making) the hell over with. I have no passion for this project and want to move onto to something else. Let me collect, in essence, no pun intended, my ""Paycheck"" now.",
23 April 2023,Paycheck is a good early noughties thriller with a great cast,"Paycheck is a good early noughties thriller with a great cast. The plot is typical of films based on the works of Philip K. Dick. In general, the very idea of erasing part of the memory is not badly beaten. Paycheck as a thriller successfully keeps the viewer at the screen, there is suspense and a predictable ending. Moreover, the predictability of what is happening still has a plot explanation. Paycheck was undeservedly received by the audience. This is a really smart thriller, in which action scenes are well placed that do not allow you to get bored. Every thing in the film has a logical explanation.

10 April 2020,Paycheck (2003),"Directed by John Woo. Starring Ben Affleck, Aaron Eckhart, Uma Thurman, Paul Giamatti, Colm Feore, Joe Morton, Peter Friedman, Michael C. Hall, Ivana Milicevic, Kathryn Morris. (PG-13)

Tech-engineer-for-hire Affleck does shady work for companies for big payouts, the condition being that his memory of his employment tenure is erased after the completion of each assignment; after completing his latest job working for CEO Eckhart, he finds himself targeted by goon squads and law enforcement, with only an envelope full of clues and tokens he must use to decipher the puzzle of his predicament and keep one step ahead of his pursuers. Intriguing premise, expanded and amended from a Philip K. Dick short story, loses its way rather quickly, devolving into a series of chases and fights where the headier elements are all but forgotten instead of given balance. Unusual for director Woo, even the sleek action scenes lack pizzazz--a motorcycle chase has a few inspired moments, but is ultimately overlong and all too far-fetched, while an incident in a subway tunnel is jaw-droppingly stupid. Aside from the typically reliable Giamatti, performances trend toward the pallid side. Woo's ""dove cameo"" reeks of self-parody.

21 February 2004,Intense action layed down on a poor thesis,"As the trailer supplies... this movie is about an engineer that has his memory wiped to hide what he has spent years working on. Why? The idea of wiping someones memory is okay if the wipe is being done by the enemy but in fact he volunteers for this treatment from his boss. Huh? What does his boss need to wipe his memory for everyone on the inside of his black project knows what it is about. Oh well, if you can ignore this question then the movie is a nice action film. Car chases, shoot outs, infiltrations and lots of stuff blowing up. The acting by the main characters was also good. Uma and Ben stood out in this film but even in the end their characters degraded to some perverse James Bondlike characters. Ben, an engineer, and Uma , a biologist take out dozens of armed thugs using engineering kung fu and biologist robotic acrobatics. Oh well, if you like action see it but don't think to much it will hurt.

26 November 2004,"Stop. If you have rented this movie, return it.","Hope I get to you before you waste your money. Or your time. Absolutely one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. No wonder I have been reading so much bad press about Ben Affleck. If he keeps signing on for movies like this... I will never see a John Woo movie again. I wasted two precious hours watching this refuse. 120 minutes I'll never get back. The sad thing is for the budget Woo had to make this foolishness, the debt of an impoverished Central American nation could probably have been paid off. Tragic. They say I have to write 10 lines to publish this comment. The truth is, this movie is not worth 10 lines. But I can sum it up in five syllables: Absolute rubbish.

25 March 2006,paycheck - why was it made?,"Ben Affleck...for the first time, sucked!

This movie was so boring i almost couldn't finish watching it!

don't get me wrong, it looked good, but other than that id rather watch the Partrige Family on repeat!

before, how i said Ben Affleck sucked, once is totally wrong, he was in Dare Devil wasn't he,

which of course i only watched because his wife starred alongside him!

i honestly think he is not at his finest here, this movie really takes him to the bottom of the barrel!

the stupidity of the whole idea, bores me!

paycheck is not worth the time, if you want a good movie, then this is so not what you are looking for!",1
3 April 2004,Not that bad...,"This movie seems to have gotten a very bad rap, but I didn't think it was that bad. OTOH, I have to say it wasn't terribly good, either. As sci-fi movies go, it was rather pedestrian and not terribly involving. But it was a pleasant watch that did keep the attention fairly engaged. The action scenes were well-crafted, though not terribly necessary for the story.

Some people say Uma wasn't in it enough, but I thought she had plenty to do. Overall a nice distraction if you've got nothing better to do (and the FX aren't bad), but great art it ain't.

The gimmick that Affleck's character was working on can't even be mentioned without spoiling the movie, so I won't touch on that. (Though I'm sure others already have...)

6 November 2006,Yaaawwwwwn,"Director John Woo was an unknown quantity to me before viewing this turgid yarn. Now I know to avoid his films like the plague. This supposedly fine sci-fi story by respected novelist Philip K Dick has been transformed to solid, stereotyped Hollywood ""action movie"" pap of the type that seems to continue earning box office dollars despite its repetition, sterility and total lack of originality, invention or interest. Even the luminous presence of Uma Thurman fails to drag this turd out of the gutter. The wooden presence of Ben Affleck is perhaps ideally suited to the piece however. Please, Hollywood, no more of this timewasting.

8 March 2005,Not just another paycheck for Affleck,"While Paycheck is certainly not a cinematic masterpiece, it certainly isn't a cinematic failure either. The story is very original (what else does one expect of Philip K.Dick) disregarding the predictability of the core story and it actually isn't as much the high speed action-packed thriller the trailers made it out to be. The latter being a good thing! The only pity is, that the actors didn't fit too good. Ben Affleck didn't evoke much sympathy; Uma Thurman despite being a great ass-kicker, felt a bit out of place for me and the bad guys just weren't scary enough. Also I felt that some of the fighting scenes were a bit childish (playful) for a serious action film and I must say I really can't stand the sight of white doves anymore, you know. Sometimes a trademark is just overused. I mean if Woo ever make a film like Star Trek or Star Wars there'd probably be white doves flying around in outer space. Still this film was OK to watch and not the worst choice Ben Affleck has lately made. The script was very original and actually quite good. Too bad he (and some others) didn't fit 100%.

2 January 2004,overrated!,"i saw this movie last with fairly high expectations (i dont' know why)) and was thoroughly disappointed. too many holes in the plot, too many characters that i didn't care about, too boring of a script. i should have been tipped off during the previews of the movies; the only trailers that they showed are sure to be awful (if not straight to video). ben affleck was terrible in daredevil and while i didn't see ""gigli"" i heard it sucked too. his best acting as of late been on celebrity poker. and a bit of advice for uma...unless quintin tarrintino directs it, stay away from it. and for everybody else in the movie who i had never heard of...i'm sure you

we're all excited about making this movie with the big stars and all but i'm afraid you'll have to piggyback your careers off something else. don't expect this to stay in the theaters too long..

28 December 2003,If only.......,"Leave it to John Woo and Ben Affleck to ruin a very promising story. The truth is, this could have been a ***1/2 out of **** movie. Affleck is an engineer who helps design a device used to see the future, only to have his brain erased of everything he did while he was working on the machine. Affleck saw this coming and knows that if this machine gets into the government's hands there will be war so he leaves himself 20 items for after his brain is erased to help him survive and destroy the machine. He doesn't know what each item is going to be used for until it comes time to use it. After the plot becomes clear, however, it's all downhill. This movie has the most holes in its story of any movie I have ever seen. The flow is interrupted with meaningless five second scenes. Look at what Spielberg did with Minority Report. This is a similar movie because it's complicated and futuristic, however Woo is not up to the challenge. See this movie only if you want to laugh at some incredibly stupid scenes or if you enjoy Paul Giamatti as much as I do (although his role is very small.)

6 March 2022,Action sci-fi miss from John Woo,"In the near future an engineer has his memory wiped after working on a top secret project. Upon completion, when he is arrested by the FBI, all he is left with after the project is an assortment of random small items. Stars Ben Affleck.

Fairly ridiculous plot full of holes but I liked the mystery of the random items. That was a nice touch.

Not a great John Woo movie. It could have been a good sci-fi plot but comes across as too far-fetched.

This movie has rightly now been forgotten.

29 May 2004,"Good Philip K. Dick adaption, but not as good as the others","The works of Philip K. Dick have steadily been making their way to the big screen. Here is the latest addition.

It's a good mix of action, suspense, and plot. Michael Jennings rips off technology for the highest bidder and then has his memory erased, voluntarily, to keep the deed under wraps. After completing his latest assignment he is told that he gave up his paycheck, voluntarily. It was worth well more than enough to set him for life. So why did he do it? The bulk of the movie is Jennings trying to figure it all out and he soon realizes that he left a trail of clues for himself and that something bigger is underneath the whole situation.

Most of Philip K. Dick's work is set in a dark, dreary world, like the one seen in Blade Runner, but here we have a seemingly nice high-tech future, that doesn't seem to be far off since the cars and such are all ones that you can see daily out on any street. Seems odd for an adaptation of P. K. Dick, but I must say it has its merits. The danger is more hidden that way and the conspiracy seems much more dangerous when it provides what is only a mere illusion of safety and haven. However, an adaptation with less gloss and glitter and more gritty and grim would have been better. Or at least one more high-tech than this, because a Ford Crown Victoria isn't exactly what I imagine in a story by Philip K. Dick.

The action is all Woo; complete with slo-mo, flying doves, and most of the things for which John Woo is known for. However, the action and violence is much less intense then Woo's most known and loved action movies which might off set cult followers. 7/10",7
20 July 2004,"A whip-cracker of a concept, action scenes up the yin-yang.","Ben Affleck agreed to a memory erasure after a recent technology-engineering job - so he's in quite a pickle when he discovers his 90 million dollar paycheck for the job is gone, leaving in its place an envelope full of assorted odds and ends, and some nasty men are after him for whatever he did during the job. Affleck discovers that somehow the contents of the envelope help him when he's in danger - so its a wonderfully fun moment when we realise that all the contents of the envelope will come in handy during the course of the movie.

The Bennifer ordeal seems to have permanantly wiped the smirk from Ben Affleck's face. His face seems permanantly fixed straight - and on those rare occasions where the script calls for him to smile, it looks like he's really struggling to do it.

With this tasty new techno-thriller on his resume, though, he should feel he can smile once again.

He was a perfect choice for Phillip K Dick's everyman hero, and looks at home with the coiffured hair, grey suit and white trimming, as if he stepped out of a 1950's photograph, which is the idea i think.

Action directors love Phillip K Dick's stories, because they're not only great futuristic concepts, but they're just sketches, which leaves room for as many action scenes as you can fit into a two-hour movie. This is most true of this John Woo movie, and Total Recall.

Paycheck is a sci-fi thriller with a whip-cracker of a concept

3 April 2005,Action movie not Sci-Fi,"Philip K Dick wrote many stories which seemed to have great film potential. I never thought of this as one of them.

6 March 2004,interesting,"Paycheck was overall a good movie to see.

Every second was pretty exciting to view, no long dialogues and every scene was needed to make sense of the movie...too bad there was not enough scenes to clarify some things up. If one sees himself die in the future, how does he prepare for them? i dont' think the screen showed Michael's future after he died so how did he know what he would need to change the future? or did he really change his future? that movie itself doesn't make much sense and the ends dont' meet. i'm glad, however, that it ended in a happy ending. kind of like a disney movie. i was afraid porter may have been a spy...

Yes, the first 15-20 minutes aren't very good, the events of the film are beyond stupid, most of the dialogue is terrible, it's insanely unsubtle, there are many point in which the film crosses to so bad it's good territory, everyone literally explains everything like even when there's news papers on a wall showing you the story and the film gives you lots of time to read them, Ben still explains the whole thing But!! This is one of the most entertaining films ever, for that and the quality craftsmanship I can look past the wealth of flaws, especially since many of said flaws add to the enjoyment.

3 April 2004,Paycheck - Enter with your high expectations checked at the door,"PLEASE; Ignore critics with agendas. Paycheck is a film that, granted, may on the surface be just another action/thriller. And that is exactly what it is. Do not enter the cinema if you expect a tour de force, indie, uniquely unique film.

However, do enter the cinema. But leave your high expectations checked at the door. Paycheck is a welcome relief from massive epic films, such as Cold Mountain, Last Samurai, King Arthur etc (don't get me wrong, I love those movies), it is great to see some real popcorn action back in theatres. It has an interesting idea behind it, and some great scenes. It's highlight is, of course, character actor Paul Giamatti, brilliant as usual. So go see Paycheck, and strap yourself in for an Action Adventure Sci-Fi thing. It's worth it, to escape reality for a couple of hours.

Cheers

26 December 2003,Paycheck: 7/10,"John Woo sure does like glass breaking. In any one of the numerous action scenes in his newest movie, Paycheck, you can assure that glass will break at least once in each. If you think about it a little, it's a pretty cheap thing to do for some thrills. A sudden, jolting noise and easy special effects is all that is done. So, with all of the glass breaking going on in Paycheck, you would expect it to be one of those stupid, lame thrillers, when it is anything but. Based on a short story by Philip K. Dick (as it seems most sci-fi movies are now), it seems to be stuck in time, because some things are very futuristic, and some seem to be very basic and even old for 2003 (Minority Report had the same problem).

Ben Affleck (who I think gets ridiculed too much for his acting; he's not good, but he's not horrible) plays Michael Jennings, a `reverse engineer', a person who creates various electronic programs for a company by stealing it from another and then his memory is erased so no secrets can be revealed. After a big three year job, his memory is erased but instead of getting an eight figure paycheck, he gets twenty items he sent himself to help get the money. With help from his girlfriend from the three years he can't remember (Uma Thurman), he tries to figure out what has happened.

If you can get past the obvious product placements (such as a BMW dealership and a pack of Altoids), many of Paycheck's action scenes are just plain clich√©d fun. There's no real reason for them, but I found the motorcycle chase scene here better than the one in The Matrix Reloaded simply because it's nothing new. Of course, with all chase scenes, it's obvious that the bad guys will be stupid and the good guys will be smart. For example, Jennings drives a motorcycle through a small barrel that's been made into a tunnel. Then a car tries driving through it. It actually made me laugh how stupid and clich√©d these people were.

Much like Minority Report, the futuristic aspect came and went (as I said earlier), but some of the graphics used were very cool. One problem I had with it, though, was that I couldn't tell what time period it took place in. Was it a few years in the future? Or now? I just couldn't tell, which really bothered me. In addition to that, could someone who just had a large part of their memory erased and who had never ridden a motorcycle before actually be able to drive one perfectly?

Affleck does what he can, and since he isn't a terribly strong actor, he doesn't do much. Thurman does her usual, too, and she's a pretty good actress in general. While I remember, did anyone else notice that her `replacement' in the restaurant scene was named Mya, while Thurman's name in Pulp Fiction was Mia? I also appreciated the whole `seeing the future' aspect. I love time travel movies, and this added another little twist onto it. It kind of reminded me of the end part of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, where they say that they will do things afterwards and time travel back so it will be there, but I digress. It was something new, and that's what was so good about Paycheck, in my opinion. It has a lot of clich√©s to it, but just tacks on something new and something to make the same old thing enjoyable.

My rating: 7/10

Rated PG-13 for intense action violence and brief language.",7
15 February 2004,Not actually a John Woo movie,"First of all Paycheck is a mystery thriller, not an action movie. If you expect John Woo style slow motion gun acrobatics, this is not the movie you're looking for. In fact, it only contains one mediocre shoot-out in the end and one chase sequence and thats it. Apart a flying dove and two Mexican stand-off's you wouldn't recognize the director.

Story sets a few years into the future, not much since there's not much any future visions of technology or so. Main character is Jennings (Affleck), reverse-engineering specialists who steals others' ideas and then gets his memory erased by the contractor so he doesn't know anything what he has stolen and to whom. Then he gets his paycheck and leaves, never to return. But after an unusually long three year job, he finds out that he has given up his 92 million paycheck for a pile of seemingly useless items and has FBI after him. Those items help him to solve the mystery.

Even though it was little disappointment when I expected a genuine Woo film, it wasn't so bad after all. Story was interesting and fast paced and the film should fit along the other Philip K. Dick film adaptations.",7
5 January 2004,Entertaining thriller,"Action/thriller with Ben Affleck as a computer programmer who does secret work and then has his memory wiped so he won't remember it.. this time he gets caught up in something big and everyone wants him dead.

Affleck is perfect for this part as the cocky computer wiz and Uma Thurman shows up as his obligatory love interest. As fluffy pulp action flicks go, this one is worth your time. GRADE: B

21 August 2004,Give me a break...,"What a disappointment. An unfortunate example of starting with brilliant material (Phillip K. Dick) and turning into empty Hollywood drivel. Just about everything that can go wrong with a movie does go wrong here. From the abominable script, to the weak performances (certainly one of Uma's worst), to the awful cinematography, and pathetic special effects and action sequences...this movie never had a chance. A pitiful reworking of the original material renders the plot incomprehensible. And what's up with the half-assed attempt to include a pseudo-martial arts scene toward the end. Ben Affleck swinging the staff around like some Kung fu master??!! Give me a break. From a die-hard fan of Science Fiction and Fantasy, take my advice...don't waste your time with this one.

29 December 2003,Poor writing holds it back,"""Paycheck"" had some of the ingredients to be a very good and perhaps great science fiction/action movie but there are several things that keep it from achieving that status. Dean Georgaris, whose only previous credited work was the script for the inane and uninspired Tomb Raider sequel, delivers another listless product here. Some of the dialogue is laughable, almost all of it is rather dull, none of it interesting or humorous. This is amplified by the fact that there are several very long stretches with no action scenes. The premise, as well as the situations the characters face, are very interesting but the writing is so wooden that it makes certain parts drag. Had a more skilled hand adapted Philip K. Dick's short story for the screen, the film would have stood on firmer ground from the beginning.

Another issue is the role of Ben Affleck in the lead. Mr. Affleck is a solid actor who, despite delivering two duds with Daredevil and Gigli this year, does have some strong performances to his credit in the past and will undoubtedly have more as his his career progresses. But he seems out of place in the role of Mr. Jennings. It is difficult to explain why this is, although the dismal screenplay likely has something to do with it. And Affleck is not the biggest problem by any means as Aaron Eckhart turns in a dreadful performance as one of the key villains in the film. I have seen Eckhart in several films prior to this and he was equally bad, meaning that poor casting rather than anything else was most to blame for this problem.

But despite these problems the film is not without merit. John Woo proves again that he is one of the best action directors around, delivering several riveting action sequences filled with slick chase scenes, gunfights, and plenty of explosions. Woo's visual style creates tension and excitement where many directors would have failed given the poor writing they would have had to work with, and this saves the film from being a total bust. Is it worth multiple trips to the theater or a purchase when it's released on DVD? Not in my opinion. But I do feel that it is worth seeing if you are a fan of action and science fiction movies, if you're anything like me you won't be astonished but you won't be completely dissapointed either.",
14 April 2004,A poor cousin to Cypher,"I saw Paycheck on a plane from US to UK. Granted this is not the best environment in which to see a film, but I did not expect to laugh at a film which was supposed to be an action thriller!

Having seen the excellent Cypher last year, I was expecting good things from this film. The plot is similar but Cypher was much more ingenious and interesting.

Ben Affleck's acting I thought was good - but what a waste of the brilliant and normally gorgeous Uma Thurman!

The film seemed to me to be all focussed on action and effects - with the result that many of the scenes were ridiculous and therefore laughable!

What a disappointment.",3
17 July 2009,Mystery of writing a good sci-fi thriller,"Philip K Dick wrote many stories which seemed to have great film potential. I never thought of this as one of them.

I have seen Ben Affleck in a number of films, and felt that he was good in a few, OK in most, and positively annoying in some.

I saw the horrible, misleading trailers.

The soundtrack was simply bad.

So, needless to say, I went into Paycheck with very low expectations.... and I was pleasantly surprised.

Affleck plays a talented reverse-engineer, who sees the possibilities in new technology, and is able to carry it through to fruition. He takes on top-secret jobs and has his memory erased upon the completion of each. He decides to take on a project big and profitable enough to allow him to retire comfortably for the rest of his life. He completes the project, goes through the memory erasure, and then starts to discover what he has done, and, pursued by corporate hit men and the police, tries to recover his memory. Uma Thurmond, a biologist he had fallen in love with, is one of the memories he wants to recover, and also a target.

Paycheck is more of an action film than a sci fi flick. The plot serves the action, as do the somewhat one-dimensional characters. And there is so little chemistry between Affleck and Thurmond that the romantic subplot is almost just a distraction. Despite these flaws, I spent an evening being thoroughly entertained by this rehashing of the usual technology-run-amok / knowledge-is-power story. This film is very Hollywood, and uses a lot of slick and clich√©d camera-work, but nevertheless tells a good story and does it well enough.",7
13 February 2021,Particularly well directed.,"The direction in this is exceptional. All action scenes, and there's a ton of them, have heightened clarity. There's never confusion on what or who is happening. Outstanding descriptive visual sequences. Very nice editing too.

The story is cool, however we were not informed on how the once engineer protagonist obtained his 007 style skills! Have a look if you like action and appreciate clever direction.

7 July 2005,But wait...if you could see into the future like this...,"Maybe I am just a big dummy when it goes to time dilation and perhaps the fictional application of twin paradox theory and whatnot...but if you theoretically look around the universe and into the future like they do in this movie, wouldn't you only be able to see the things that happen outside? I mean, if someone is shooting a bullet from inside a building, how could you see that using the technology in this movie? I would think you would have to be physically OUTSIDE to be visible, and since literally nothing he saw occurred under the cover of blue sky, but rather inside some space (bus, building, caf√©, whatever), how could it ever be seen by this laser vision business? Just seems like that would render the whole damn thing moot in the first place. Just a thought

23 July 2004,direct deposit,"Ok Mr. Woo we get the slow motion bird flying thing. What's with that? Is that your staple? It's in all his movies. Here it had nothing to do with the movie except that John Woo wanted to make sure everyone knew they were watching a John Woo movie. Once upon a time Woo's style of direction, especially action sequences, was unique, but now it's tired. Woo is more concerned with slow motion birds and 1980s action sequences than bringing out the best in his actors. The quote-unquote acting was laughably bad. Particularly Ben Affleck, who is picking all the wrong roles. Ben, you're not an action star. You were good in Good Will Hunting and Chasing Amy, those are the type of movies you belong in, where you play regular guys. The larger-than-life action star thing isn't working for you, although your bank account says otherwise. Uma Thurman's character, if you can use the word character, was barely human. Just a piece of cardboard with skin on it. And Aaron Eckhart I've been disappointed in for years. Here's a guy who was absolutely brilliant in In The Company of Men (1997 I think), and he's never remotely matched that shocking performance. Since then he's been reduced to chubby side characters. Aaron, fire your agent.

When, O when, will the sheeple tire of these mindless, brain cell-less, useless, action movies. When. I guess never, and soon I'm moving to Mars and starting my own production company.",3
2 January 2004,Turkey Alert!!!,"The works of the late Phillip K. Dick have been adapted to the screen a number of times and (with the notable exception of ""Blade Runner"") the results have been generally unremarkable.

""Paycheck,"" however IS remarkable. Remarkably awful.

The plot concept, interesting enough, is terribly mishandled. Logic and suspense are both tossed aside in favor of dull predictability...and ""action.""

Ah, action! A word that has become synonymous with stunt driving and orange explosions...and brain-dead scripts. John Woo specializes in this sort of drivel.

Want a definition of ""inert?"" Try the ""chemistry"" (or total lack of same) between Affleck and Thurman. These two just phone it in, although given the lines they have to deliver, it's not entirely their fault.

The hackneyed fadeout reminded me of the signature ending to all episodes of ""The Cisco Kid,"" the laughing ""Oh, Cisco!"" ""Oh, Pancho!"" between Duncan Renaldo and Leo Carrillo.

Dick's works deserve better, but at least his heirs are cleaning up.",
6 February 2004,Really not very good,"Paycheck taught me one thing above all; Ben Affleck cannot carry a movie. He lacks charisma, wit, and that personable approach which endears the truly charismatic players to their audience.

The story here is about memory erasure, based on a Philip K Dick novel, and Affleck is Jennings, a top-level engineer who is paid to rip off ideas from other companies and have his memory erased afterwards. Quite *why* he has to have his memory erased is never truly explained in a believable manner, he just 'does'. Uma Thurman is Rachel, the love interest who's a biologist at the company Affleck's been headhunted by with a view to joining for 3 years. They want him to do one last job which will pay him for the rest of his life. However, as expected things don't run smoothly and he finds himself on the run from....just about everyone.

The problem here is that the story is just badly told. It's a decent premise but the way it's handled seems to ruin any potential it had. The direction is messy and boring, preventing the movie from being genuinely gripping. The performances aren't particularly passable either, with unconvincing dialogue and uninspired characters.

Add to this that the ending seems to be far too sweet and 'wrap it up' in style and you're left with a hollow movie which fails to really do anything right.",
18 May 2004,Great,"This is one of those movies that get lost in the Christmas time rush. When you see it on video and DVD, you'll realize what a entertaining movie this is. I like how clever this movie is. Ben Affleck's character has 20 items that will help him decipher the clues to his lost memory. Does the movie make a lot of sense? Not really. Is it worth the ride you go on? You bet it is. Not surprisingly, this movie is based on a story by the author of Total Recall, Minority Report, and Blade Runner. I think this movie is right up there with Total Recall (I think Minority Report and Blade Runner are overrated). Now that his romance with JLo is over with, we can start to pay attention to Affleck's movies rather than his personal life. That is the way it should be. 8/10

8 June 2004,Woo-Pee,"Ok, bad pun - couldn't resist.

I am not one of those people who bash movies because they are unrealistic. That's what science FICTION is supposed to be. You think, ""Hey, what if....?"" If the premise is interesting, the story will be too, no matter how implausible it is. And this movie was interesting, from start to finish.

First, the good things:

1. Uma. 'Nuff said.

2. Paul Giamatti - Stole the show, wish he could have been in more of it.

3. The motorcycle chase scene. Way Cool.

4. The 20 items. I love the way such a complex story centered around the where, when and how to use them all.

Now, the not-go-good:

1. Ben. I'm sorry, but the guy has yet to prove to me that he can actually act. Just like Keanu Reeves, thinking you're cool doesn't make it so.

2. John Woo's trademark of two characters holding guns on each other despite the fact that they are stading only a few feet apart. Check out any John Woo movie, you will see that. In this movie, we saw it twice!

3. Aaron Eckhart's George McFly 'do.

Some movies are enjoyable because they make you think. Others are enjoyable because you don't need to think. And then there are movies like this, which want to make you understand what is going on but it's not required. I liken this movie to ""Total Recall""; lots of action (although TR was way more violent), a sci-fi setting, and a plot that made us think. Granted, Ben has about 1/10 the screen presence that Arnie has, but that doesn't make ""Paycheck"" any less enjoyable.

My score: 9.",9
22 February 2004,Not what I was expecting...,"I just saw this yesterday in the theater, and I was somewhat disappointed. I was expecting something a little bit more interesting and enticing. Rather, I was let down with a copy off of Vanilla Sky and a bad science fiction film from the 1950s. Ben Affleck was alright in his role that he played, but Uma Thurman was definitely not right for the character she portrayed. There were a few things about this movie that didn't really add up. But, before I get to that, let me tell you a little bit about the story.

Basic Plot: Affleck plays a engineer who has his memory erased every time he completes a job for people. He runs into a friend of his, who offers him $90 million to complete a specific assignment for him. However, it will take him three years, and once he's done, they erase his memory and three years of his life is gone. When he ""wakes up"" so to speak from his memory loss, it's been three years and he's ready to pick up his PAYCHECK. He discovers that there are a few things wrong with the situation and it becomes a mystery and a race against time for Michael (Affleck).

Here are a few things that were wrong with the movie: 1. How is it possible that Affleck had such a great tan from working indoors for three years (in Seattle btw.)? (Well, I can't really name any of the other things because I don't want to ruin it for anyone else who hasn't seen it yet.)

So, I think that Uma Thurman's character could have been played by just about any actress with a little talent, and someone possibly a little younger. But, I did like Aaron Eckhart. He did a very convincing job playing the bad guy and I liked him in it.

Some of the story didn't make sense to me, and the acting wasn't anything noteworthy. And although I really do like Paul Giamanti, it was a horrible role for him, and I wish he would get better parts.

I give the movie a 5.5 out of 10. I liked it enough, that if I were forced I might watch it again, but definitely not what I expected from the previews. And by the by....for those of you (not that any of you are even on IMDB, but anyone who knows someone in the subtitle industry), who are involved in the subtitle business, you guys did a horrible job translating the movie from English into Hungarian. Just to let you know.

Thanks for reading my review. I'm outtie!",
29 December 2003,Excellent movie,"I enjoyed the whole film. Maybe I have lost my edge, but this movie unfolded without me seeing where it was headed all the way through. It wasn't as predictable as other similar films.

The action was superb and the script wasn't as contrived as it could have been. Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman both delivered convincing performances.

The film brings up some interesting questions about seeing into the future, the conclusion is, we are better off not knowing what the next day or moment will bring. It is encouraging us to live in the moment and not explore too far ahead. It also made me think about man's arrogance. Man thinking he can control everything including future events is absurd. When man tries to control the future it causes mass destruction to life. Very interesting and could have been developed a little more, but this is John Woo.

I enjoyed this film from start to finish and was not bored at all. Cold Mountain on the other hand, left me dry. In comparison, this film is much better!",10
11 January 2004,Why?,"After leaving the movie theater, with my wallet $25 liter, I asked myself...Why? This movie had no meaning or purpose what so ever.

Giving credit where credit is due, there was one decent action/chase scene involving a BMW motorcycle and several police cruisers.

The only talent in the movie was, Aaron Eckhart, whos part was only so-so.

Please do yourself a favor and avoid this movie. Ben Afleck is one 'washed-up' actor.

8 November 2005,Solid action movie,"Let's get something out of the way first: this movie is not nearly as good as similar movies like ""Minority Report"" and ""Total Recall"". Those movies also dealt with amnesia and/or precognition, but did so in a much better way, offering really well-thought out stories and plenty of surprises. ""Paycheck"" initially looks like it can also go in the direction of those movies, but unfortunately falls a bit short.

That's not to say that it's terrible, on the contrary. The premise is very interesting and the story is decent, with some very clever parts. It's a shame that there also some gaping plot holes and that the story doesn't really hold up that well towards the end, but as long as you don't give it too much thought, it certainly is good enough to carry the movie.

I'm not usually a fan of Ben Affleck, who is usually way too fond of himself, but here he actually does a good job, along with the always fine Uma Thurman. Granted, the characters in this movie (especially the bad guys) are a bit thin, but the dialogs are OK and the pace is constantly high.

What really makes this movie shine are the action sequences, admittedly Woo's specialty. In general, ""Paycheck"" offers some great action sequences that are very spectacular without going too much over the top. Also, thankfully, this movie doesn't over-indulge in CGI, although Woo should have really left his trademark (CGI) dove out of the movie.

""Paycheck"" is a solid movie that, although the promising story ultimately falls a bit short, has a decent enough plot, dialog and characters to tie some pretty good action sequences together. It's not essential viewing, but it's entertaining enough to warrant a look.

28 March 2005,Another Woo film that blows.......and I'm a Woo fan!!!,"Here's another attempt at the Hollywood execs, and producers trying to homoginize a John Woo film. Actually they DID homogonize it. Ben Affleck, who seems miscast as the lead, does the best he can with a script that is, at best, a watered down version of the Phillip Dick story. There are virtually NO Woo trade marks in this movie. No slow motion, no extravagant stunts or action sequences or even flashy gun play. I NEVER thought I would ever say this about a John Woo movie. PAYCHECK is boring!! The only bright spot is Uma Thurman who is radiant and very sexy. The villain is a lame. Aaron Eckhardt, who is a good actor, is also miscast as the bad guy. He reminds me of those loser librarians whose thinks he is hot sh*t at the library and always trying to catch people talking and not studying. Meanwhile, when he's not around everyone mocks him and laughs at him. You know the ones I'm talking about. He's no real threat but a mere annoyance; like a gnat buzzing around your head. I felt that Affleck could beat him with one punch. Affleck, on the other hand, seemed lost or confused through most of the picture. Then there was that guy who plays the gay brother from SIX FEET UNDER who was supposed to be some bad-ass with a gun(which we saw very little). I kept waiting for him to throw down his weapon and say(lisping), ""SSSSSSSSTOP you sssilly bitch before I scratch your eyes out!"" I didn't get a very threatening or menacing feel from his character at all. I can only surmise that the Hollywood execs and producers kept telling Woo to, ""Keep it more cerebral than visceral."" Woo can be both when left alone. Let him do what he does best. Look at HARD TARGET, BROKEN ARROW, THE KILLER, FACE/OFF, and HARDBOILED to name a few. And to John Woo, I'm sorry I didn't much care for your film but I suspect your hands were tied and NOT by that guy from SIX FEET UNDER.",5
25 December 2003,Ben at his best! Uma not so bad either.,"An action paced drama with a spin that will have you thinking and guessing as to what will happen. Ben is great in this role and Uma is the cherry with the topping. Lots of action, cars, planes, trucks,guns, you name it. Great for Sci fi lovers and at the same time Computer wizards. Don't miss it.

4 July 2004,one-trick pony that explains too much,"Disappointing once you are hit over the head with the main plot twist (presented about 1/3rd through the movie). From there it unravels in dismally predictable fashion, put together in such a way that the thickest of minds can follow it. Good science fiction doesn't hit you over the head with explanations of the technology and its effects on the characters, and yes, good character development is allowed. Please, I want to believe the characters in SF. I don't need simple car chases and shoot-outs. Uma is acting well, even Ben to some extent, but their performances go completely to waste. I expected much more from Woo. A key problem with this film is the presentation of snippets that should be from the point of view of particular characters (through their eyes) and yet a shown in a detached view (equivalent of 3rd person omniscient). Makes no sense for the technology involved and dumbs it down considerably. Changing these scenes to be shown literally through the eyes of these characters would have improved the film tremendously by adding a slight but interesting mental challenge (i.e., whose eyes are we seeing through?). Much as you see in the far superior Minority Report.",2
22 June 2004,Two Thumbs Up.,"A future movie ""for guys who like movies,"" 'Paycheck' is a decent, by-the-numbers sci-fi/action that John Woo should be happy about. Even Affleck should be thankful, for this is one of his professional highs during a time when his status exceeded it. 'Paycheck' is far from original, let alone stand out in anything. But it is good and a better time killer than other stuff out.

Jennings works for a paycheck. Therefore he doesn't mind having his memory slate wiped clean after stealing a job and taking the next step. His last job takes three years however with a little bit more at stake.

Unfortunately for Woo, his own movies have a sense of art that always does not mesh with reality. 'M:I 2' is a good example of that implausibility and 'Paycheck' here is no different. Affleck and Thurman are mysteriously miscast too, with little chemistry. Oh well, the movie is good anyway, and Woo fans will eat it up too.",6
12 July 2004,Watch Minority Report Instead,"John Woo's bad taste is almost palpable in this one, especially in the unnecessary, drawn-out motorcycle chase scene. Paycheck reminds me of how Woo and Tom Cruise collaborated to turn Mission Impossible into a mindless action movie from an interesting thriller. The mystery in the plot only proves disappointing when parts of it are solved, and Ben Affleck, for playing a supposed genius, is pretty slow to pick up some basic clues. What art there is in the cinematography is painfully overdone or marred by its juxtaposition with the other elements of the film. The least they could have managed is a tragic ending. If you like John Woo, go ahead. If you're tempted to see this film, watch Minority Report instead.

7 July 2004,I Got Paid,"After watching this movie, I felt I got paid. Okay, so I didn't get any cash or anything for watching the movie, but the entertainment I received was of value to me.

This movie is another cinematic realization of the work of Philip K. Dick (Total Recall, Blade Runner, and Minority Report). The author takes us on another sci-fi journey in this story, one that involves a man named Jennings who is a master at reverse engineering. And for companies of the future, what better way to compete in the technologically sophisticated marketplace of the future than by taking apart your competitors' products, seeing how they work, and devising a better product with the technology? This is the role Jennings (Ben Affleck) plays. However, there is one catch, as always. Jennings has to have his memory wiped after he completes each reverse engineering contract as part of his ""non-disclosure"" agreement. Nice, huh?

When Jennings takes on a contract that has him being hunted down by the feds and shot at by his former employer, he has to try to figure out why, with no memory of the attributing previous events. An envelope of ordinary items are all he has to discover what he was working on that now has him as a marked man.

Paycheck combines the sci-fi brilliance of Philip Dick's work with the action-adventure talents of John Woo (Mission Impossible 2) to create a movie that has both story/plot and an adequate amount of adrenaline.

It parallels Minority Report in that if you saw the future, could you escape your foreseen fate?",7
1 February 2004,"A little out of date, but not so bad for that","The nicest part of Minority Report was the escape through the mall with the help of future sight. This gimmick has been stolen wholesale for Paycheck but its perfectly serviceable.

No, the film is not as bad as all that. The Total Recall situations and violence are dated but are entertaining. The basic premise is no worse than we are used to. It is impossible for sci-fi plots to remain sensible after the usual number of defensive rewrites and bad edits, but the holes don't interfere with your enjoyment, and are par for the course in any film involving time travel.

Uma Thurman looks perfectly fine. I don't think Afleck really wants to go through the 'personality wipe' that Cruise has gone through to get the Hollywood hero roles, but if he does I guess things could be worse.

26 December 2021,"Even with all the flaws, I still liked it.","Ok...I live in the city this was filmed.

I lived in several neighbourhoods of this city and I know this city inside out and backwards.

Almost every street, almost every building - almost every detail about Vancouver. I know this city really well.

I used to drive it day and night and I made a really nice income from it.

There are simply too many holes in the entire story for me to like it too much and because of the chase scenes which take mere minutes but in reality couldn't even happen because of the design of the city - it totally loses me.

There's no possible way that a motorcycle chase can exist between all the locations in this city in a matter of minutes and it certainly couldn't last more than 3 minutes because there's simply too much traffic and too many obstructions and the locations are so far apart.

For me that totally killed it more than the plausibility.

Because I know the very fine details of this city, the entire story comes to a fast halt. Nothing makes sense to me - because nothing would develop like it did in this town. There's no way. There simply isn't the opportunity with the way this city operates on any given day or night.

Then there are major holes in plot development - too many to list.

It's an interesting movie and one that I felt somewhat entertained me - but still had too many issues with stability in structure and ending -especially in an environment where cameras and tracking equipment is so prevalent in the 20th century.

This story may have worked in the 1950's or even the 1980's - however since computers and electronics and security has grown so rapid since the 1980's, this story fails to deliver.

The methods of surveillance don't work - and even after he saves the day, he would still be on the run and his life would always be at risk. There is no fun easy life for him after everything ends.

The circumstances which led him to the point of destruction of the science lab would always be under investigation and even if he managed to escape at that time - he would be consistently on the run for the rest of his life - simply due to his involvement with such massive destrction and so many deaths and the involvement of everything pertaining to his adventure.

There would be years of legal matters for the local police, FBI and for him personally and having an easy and carefree life after all that mess would not happen.

He would need to be on the run everyday - and being in one place for too long would put him in jeopardy all the time.

There were also issues relating to the time he picks up his envelope.

He looks at his bank statement and it shows 902 million dollars - it's already deposited into his bank and verified upon his logging in.

However, when he goes to sign the papers, it states that several weeks before - he signed it all away.

That is a major flaw in the story.

If he signed it all away, when he goes to log into his account - nothing would show up. There would have been no transfer.

There is also a matter about Rachel having two apartments.

If the corporation knew that he was meeting her - why would they not have both places covered?

Lots of holes - lots of flaws.

Don't even get me started on the ability to see himself from different angles while he's looking at the future.

It's a cool story in it's own way but has so many flaws in it's design and final product.

Putting some more thought into the production of this would have made this movie totally awesome - but the director, producer and other staff didn't do this - and this is the reason it never became a massive hit...because there were so many problems which detracted from a good story.

Maybe when it will get a rewrite, the next director and producer will be able to fix the problems and make it mind blowing.

Right now - instead of mind blowing...this just blows my mind.

I'm a very skilled driver and I've done some truly awesome things with a car - but even I can't travel all that distance what he did with a motorcycle and cover all that ground and not get locked in daytime traffic and endless congestion.

That is some real suspension of belief..

Try driving at top speed in this city and get more than 2 blocks...good luck.

Being in a car chase is damn near impossible.

I've been in car chases - but believe me...it's not going to happen in this town...no way.

That's why cops never have to chase a car in this city...it's impossible to have a car chase in this town.

The real adventure here is how he can even get a block down the road and not encounter construction downtown...that is the real movie.",4
23 November 2007,Fast Film Fails..Not,"After all that we experience from Mother Hollywood, ""Paycheck"" brings no novelty. However, it's pace is incredibly rhythmical and fast. It stops at no moment to analyze, to think, to give time to the viewer. It has two sides: great action but lack of...script.

Just enjoy the ride: the premise is good but nothing extraordinary. It's twist will twist your mind into deep, enlightened understanding. Phillip Dick, a visionary on Science Fiction, owes credit for this. Non stop action, with some smart touches will plastify you to the seat, and you won't move even to go to the bathroom.

Yet, it's not relevant neither changing. It's high class entertainment, by John Woo, that sometimes hits the smart wall.

3 March 2023,Passable Sci-Fi Action that Doesn't Ask Too Much of the Viewer,"PAYCHECK (C+) is a generic sci-fi action film from director John Woo based on a short story by the great Philip Dick and starring Ben Affleck as a ""reverse engineer"" expert. Affleck's character takes the electronics products of other companies, locks himself in a room for two straight months, and emerges not only having figured out their tech, but having made it even better. To protect the illegality of the situation, the company then wipes Affleck's memory of it (but not anyone else involved for some reason). This is a neat concept, but apparently that wasn't enough for a sci-fi / action / mystery film as they add another sci-fi concept on top of that one (which I won't divulge to save from spoilers). Unfortunately, it never really feels like this second concept is exploited and integrated into the story as well as it could be. There are several chases in the film (Woo wanted this to be his North by Northwest) but they are fairly generic stuff. It's almost impossible not to make comparisons here to a Philip Dick adaptation from a year earlier, Steven Spielberg's Minority Report. When putting both side by side, you can see how each production team were working on different creative levels. Paycheck passes the bar as acceptable sci-fi action entertainment that doesn't ask too much of the viewer. Just don't expect any more than that.",5
2 January 2004,Woo/Afleck...we should've known better.,"Unless you're a fan of the HK kung fu movies and think that's how all action movies should be, I don't see how you could ever like a John Woo movie. I LOVE the old kung fu movies. Five Deadly Venoms!?! Awesome! That's not the philosophy that should go into a modern day American action movie.

John Woo is like a child with a new drum set for Christmas. ""Hey Mom! Look at how cool every scene looks in slow motion!""

At least in Paycheck, he has his addiction to slow-mo under control. But now his foreshadowing is out of control.

I don't even know if it can be called ""foreshadowing"". In Paycheck, the hero's friend is performing the very delicate and dangerous procedure of erasing his memory, when all of a sudden; a clumsy onlooker jostles the keyboard resulting in a dangerous temperature increase in the brain. ""At 43 degrees, he's a permanent vegetable."" As the temperature monitor says; 42.7, 42.8, 42.9, 42.9, 42.9, 42.8, 42.6, 42.5. Phew! Catastrophe averted. Never mind that reverse engineering has been working without erasing people's memories for quite some time. But wouldn't you know it; the FBI's memory reader also approaches the dangerous 43-degree limit later in the movie. Why that's important to the movie, I'm not sure.

Then, as part of the recovery and evaluation from the near fatal brain-meltdown, the hero goes through an exercise in which he's pitted against 3 high-tech man-sized pillars that make sounds that the hero is supposed to use to aim his attack with a staff. The hero stands inside the triangle made by these 3 pillars. Guess what happens in the climactic conclusion of the movie. Yep, 3 men surround the hero and he defends himself with a staff.

Uma's character uses a wind generator in her bio-tech lab to play a joke on the hero. Guess what, the wind machines are used to disorient some bad guys later on.

Beyond the foreshadowing, the absurdities abound: bullets that fire under very dubious conditions (no one on the set told Woo the primer has to be ""struck"", merely pushing it against something won't cause it to fire), bullets that fire at high speed even though they're not in a chamber, the world's slowest BMW Rockster, security badges that can't be locked out, etc, etc.

After MI:2, my wife and I agreed to avoid seeing anything with John Woo directing and had actually planned on never seeing Paycheck. We must have blocked out that information when we went to the theater. The other 6 people in the theater must have wondered what we were groaning about as John Woo's name appeared in the opening credits. We'll try to do a better job of avoiding John Woo and Ben Afleck movies. The best thing I can say about Paycheck is that if a very close friend invited us to watch a movie and our choice was between Paycheck and Hollywood Homicide, we would choose Paycheck.",3
15 November 2005,Just sit back and enjoy!,"I cannot understand why this film did not get the reviews it deserved in other words poor!. This film is brilliant, what more could you ask of an action film. The people that have reviewed this film and have rated it poor must not list action as their favourite genre! This film has fast paced action from start to finish with decent acting especially Uma Thurman discovering a mellower role for her. A British villain played by Aaron Eckhart who was perfect for the part as he was always sinister even at the beginning when the viewer thinks he is a good guy. If you like a good action film then this is it! John Woo is brilliant and Ben Affleck is always delivering the goods as the targeted man in this superb thriller.

12 August 2005,Good Idea Poor Execution,"Take an interesting story by one of the best and most imaginative science fiction authors who ever lived, chuck in some action, get John Woo the god of all action directors to make it and sure fire success beckons right? Unfortunately wrong as they then decided to get a half baked script that will confuse most people and cast Ben Affleck as the lead. You would have thought bringing in Uma Thurman would make up for this but this is not to be as she barely features in the first 40mins and when she does appear she sleep walks through her scenes, chemistry between her and Affleck is zero. Also the film tries to walk the thin line between intellectual sci-fi and all out action and ends up falling short on both counts.

On the positive side there are some nice touches in the special effects and action but the film is so badly damaged by a lack of focus and poor lead performances you'll hardly care.

The sci-fi/action genre is becoming the hardest for any filmmaker to succeed in with budgets spiralling films are expected to appeal to everyone. Catering to the pure action fans and those who want something more intellectual is always going to be difficult. Unfortunately this is one thats caught in the trap.

It's a shame for all the talent involved this didn't work out 4/10.",4
28 April 2018,6.3? There must be a lot of bots in that figure,"Awful. Especially given the cast. The writing was almost incomprehensible and the acting equally bad. This could have been a Leslie Nielsen or Mike Myers parody, it is so improbable.

28 December 2003,Love it...,"Paycheck(2003) Ben Affleck, Uma Thurman, Aaron Eckhart and Paul Giamatti.

In this Cat-Mouse Thriller, a guy, Mike Jennings(Affleck) memory is erased. He lost 3 years of his life . He recieves an envolope with 19 items in it. With these, he tries to discover the last 3 years of his life. His girlfriend Rachel(Thurman) helps him. Jimmy(Eckhart) is the guy out to kill the two.

The first 20 or 30 minutes of this go slowley, and its confusing. I didn't like it. But when it gets going, it's a great movie. I love it! You get so immersed in the plot and it keeps you guessing its hard to resist. And there were actually some funny parts. This is very hard to dislike. I love this and would recommend it to anyone from 11 to 70.

PAYCHECK - ***1/2 out of ****

PG-13 for action violence and some language.

6 February 2019,stupidity fest,"I have no clue why this film has been made. The actors are completely miscasted. The story has been cut down to meaningless drivel, the fighting scenes look very cheap and are useless for the plot. The characters are not believable and one dimensional.

6 December 2004,Good plot thought not great,"I have to admit that the idea behind this movie was good. The thought of trading three years of your life for a dream job is interesting plot, especially since if you won't have any memory of what it was he did. I have never read the short story, but I am familiar with Philip K. Dick and he creates his worlds and characters.

That being be said, I have to say by the end of the movie it was just a typical action SCI fi. I was expecting a twist or a deep thought meaning in the end, however I didn't receive either one. I knew how this was going to end and was hoping that something else would happen. As I said before, I didn't read the short story but it would seem odd if its ending were so straight and uninteresting as the movie's ending. It was simply bland; there is no other word to describe it.

I thought Affleck and Thrumen were good choices, though I wasn't expecting much out of them. This movie didn't require a lot of acting skill from what I saw so I suppose anyone could have really done it. I think having those two could have overdone it by adding big names like that.

Not the best movie out there, however it's good for a night if you want to rent something.",6
30 July 2008,Reverse engineered for your enjoyment.,"This is a fun concept movie that, yes, could have been more profound. But as it is, it's fun to see how they work the various items into Jennings' master plan in unpredictable ways. I've read the story by Philip K. Dick, and there are points of the story where it has been changed, and the machine works differently here, but the core concept is kept intact. And the question remains: Even if you could see the future, do you really think you'd be able to change it for the better?

Affleck doesn't really amaze anyone here, but he also doesn't detract from the story. Uma is fine and Eckhart is delightfully over-the-top towards the end. This is a man who has received a glimpse of the power he could have if he simply got rid of the obstacles, and he is determined to achieve that power. Even if one of the obstacles is his good friend Jennings.

There are some scientific improbabilities here along with some basic errors, but the driving force here is the philosophical concept, not the scientific possibilities. And the pacing is generally fast enough that you can just relax and watch the action sequences if that's all you care about.",8
13 September 2006,Thumbs up!,"I saw this in the theatre twice; once with my family, once with my girlfriend at the time. I almost never see a film twice in the theatres, so that's a good indication this movie is worth it. Years later, I bought the DVD and I think I've seen that at least three times as well. It has one of those plots that's confusing at first, but everything comes together amazingly in the end. Also, it has some of the best action sequences I've seen; I attribute that to John Woo. While it's been criticized that it's a knockoff of The Bourne Identity, I think it's mostly original and it remains one of my favorite action/mystery movies I've ever seen.

22 May 2004,"Ignore the bad reviews, it's really not that bad","Can't see what people are complaining about this movie for. It is pretty entertaining. About the only problem with this movie is that it requires us to suspend our disbelief quite a bit.

For example, you wonder how the hell the Ben Affleck character is able to cheat death by disciphering danger signals from some of the most mundane types of clues that he left for himself? Well, the answer is that he's leaving the clues for himself, and he's choosing the exact right clues that are required for each moment.

Some of the stunt work is also unbelievable, but of course that's typical John Woo. To his credit, Woo has left the stuntwork tastefully limited. This movie doesn't really need stunts: its story is entertaining even without action sequences. I may have liked this because I seem to be constantly drawn to Philip K. Dick's stories.

5 January 2004,When you think about this film it just falls apart.,"Philip K Dick wrote many stories which seemed to have great film potential. I never thought of this as one of them.

I have seen Ben Affleck in a number of films, and felt that he was good in a few, OK in most, and positively annoying in some.

I saw the horrible, misleading trailers.

The soundtrack was simply bad.

So, needless to say, I went into Paycheck with very low expectations.... and I was pleasantly surprised.

Affleck plays a talented reverse-engineer, who sees the possibilities in new technology, and is able to carry it through to fruition. He takes on top-secret jobs and has his memory erased upon the completion of each. He decides to take on a project big and profitable enough to allow him to retire comfortably for the rest of his life. He completes the project, goes through the memory erasure, and then starts to discover what he has done, and, pursued by corporate hit men and the police, tries to recover his memory. Uma Thurmond, a biologist he had fallen in love with, is one of the memories he wants to recover, and also a target.

Paycheck is more of an action film than a sci fi flick. The plot serves the action, as do the somewhat one-dimensional characters. And there is so little chemistry between Affleck and Thurmond that the romantic subplot is almost just a distraction. Despite these flaws, I spent an evening being thoroughly entertained by this rehashing of the usual technology-run-amok / knowledge-is-power story. This film is very Hollywood, and uses a lot of slick and clich√©d camera-work, but nevertheless tells a good story and does it well enough.",

27 December 2003,"Ben & Uma for Oscar....eh,eh!","A great script not always creates a great movie. The script of this movie is really great. The story is as original as full of surprises but the movie is an average movie. John Woo's directing is very professional, perfect but not charming. The real disaster in this movie is the acting. I like Ben Affleck even if he is so ridicule in his new old fashion look but his acting...........I could like him on the screen, but his acting..........Why a such nice guy who earns 20 million dollar per movie does not feel the must to learn his job. How long he can think to go ahead if his acting is such a disaster. The only thing for what I still like see him is just because he makes me laughing and sooner or later I'll even want to watch the infamous ""Gigli"". (In Daredevil he made me so laughing with is unbelievable acting and when he was crying in ""Changing Lanes"" I was on the point to die suffocated by my own laughing. And Uma.....no comment about her acting too. By the way as the story is very good, if you like action movies you can go and see it. My vote is 6.5/7 because this movie is fast, nice scenery and a very cool subject.

8 February 2004,"It's not bad, it's horrible","Paycheck is the worst film I have seen in a long long time. It's a great pity to as the idea behind it is a good one. A reverse engineer has his short term memory wiped everytime he completes a job to protect the identity of the companies he is working for. Trouble starts when he gets picked up by the FBI after one of these memory wipes because he has actually worked on a machine that could destroy the world. Armed with only 20 ordinary items to remember what he needs to save the world, this movie would seem to be a cracker.

What makes it so bad, first and foremost is the script. Some of the things said are out of a poor comedy. At times you wonder whether you are watching a version of ""Scary Movie"" except this is making fun of science fiction rather than teen movies. The sad thing is this movie takes itself seriously.

Aside for the script the acting is certainly not the best. At times the villains and heroes seem to be very deliberate in their actions, in the way you would expect in a movie meant for under-10s.

Action sequences are not bad but we have come to expect more from a John Woo film.

Save your cash and time and go watch something else. If not pop Minority Report back into the DVD player, you may have seen it many times but it will still be better than this.",3

28 December 2003,Great Sci Fi! See it now - ten stars!,"Nice update on Dick's 1953 story. Good solid SciFi, great storytelling, good casting, without all the crap that keeps the little airhead fanboys in their seats. You actually need a triple digit IQ to get this movie.... too much work for the regular fanboy who is mesmerized by the same things that amuse my cat.... bright lights, fast moving objects, and anything that goes ""boom!"" There's no spoon-feeding of blood and gore, no useless nekkid sex scenes, and no repetitive dialog for those who don't *get* it to play catch-up with the storyline. Fast-paced storytelling with plenty of well-choreographed chase scenes and action shots. Good movie! Saw it three times and loved it. You don't have to be a SciFi fan to enjoy this movie, but you *DO* need enough maturity to differentiate between a video game and good film.

17 February 2010,Good start and then gets a bit silly,"Paycheck starts out very solid, with an interesting premise and great early plot development. This is ""cashed in"" late in the movie by burdening a great sci-fi mystery/suspense plot with a typical Hollywood action movie climax. And that's a real shame, because the first half of the film is stellar. I found myself playing catchup to an intricately woven storyline that probably stays relatively true to the novel that inspired it. But once I caught up and figured out what was going on, suddenly it was like the movie had run out of tricks.

Not knowing where to go next, the producers settled for a silly action ending. But still; great plot, good acting, good cinematography, make for a solid film overall - the latter part of the movie isn't so terrible as to ruin the great work done early.

Worth a look.

25 December 2003,No defining moments.,"I can't stand ben. I love PKD stories and the films based on them. I love John Woo. This movie was good, it was entertaining and was faithful to the story and presented a interesting mystery but all in all the cheezy moments were the only moments I remembered when it was over.

John Woo is usally a master and creating little moments impossible to forget will not this time. That being said it was indeed entertaining just not at all amazing. If you want Woo stick to his chinese stuff.

20 September 2020,"Sci-fi thriller, chock full of paranoia and suspense","John Woo's tech thriller stars Ben Affleck as an engineer who takes on a high-level assignment for a shadowy corporate conglomerate which culminates in his entire memory of the duration of the assignment being erased. After his assignment is completed, he quickly discovers that the enormous financial reward that he was promised to be a mirage and he suddenly finds himself at the center of a national security firestorm.

Let's get down to brass tacks. This film is plagued throughout by serious logic gaps which compromise its credibility early on and although the climax has a lot of tense action, it cannot save the plot from its dependency on implausible twists and cheap escape hatches. That's why this isn't a great film or even a good one either.

Affleck is at the top of his game here as the protagonist who grapples with splinters of a memory and walls closing all around him. Paul Giamatti chips in as his lowly colleague/chum and Uma Thurman as a lab-worker-turned-love-interest offers solid supporting work. Aaron Eckhart is the conniving corporate boss and Colm Feore is his smug enforcer. Michael C. Hall and Joe Morton are clueless FBI agents struggling to keep up with the corporate back-stabbing and intrigue. The final action sequence is a twister that will keep you guessing until the very end. Tightly directed, this film delivers the goods. Strongly recommended to action fans, John Woo devotees and, of course, engineers.",8
18 April 2020,Not the worst,"Except that Jennings was a thief. He stole in the name of others...why should he be rewarded? Also, something strange were some hidden Chinese characters at scene 1:33:01 to 1:33:05. Weird huh? (Look at Jennings hand).

5 March 2004,"Disturbing, original, thrilling, unpredictable.","As usual movies based on this Philip K. Dick's books are pretty solid original stories, disturbing too, which is always nice, this is a very action packed movie of it, but it's John Woo, so that's what you should expect going into this movie.

First off i though this movie had a very interestling storyline that kept me interested for most of the time, and also it was very unpredictable most of the time which is always very nice, because i really hate it when i already know the end 10 minutes into the movie, this one kept me guessing a long time which was nice, the problem though is that towards the end it is like the movie runs out, they basically tell you how it's going to end and from there it's no longer so thrilling, so the first half is very good, but a bit into second half the thrills and unpredictions slows down which is sad i think, i'm not going to say there wasn't taken fully advantage of the storyline, i guess tha'ts just how it is, but towards the end the mystery fades out and John Woo's usual action takes over.

Having read a lot of negative reviews and the movie has pretty low rank here on imdb, something i feel is undeserved, i don't see where people see the major flaws, i mean yes it's not the movie of the year, but it's definitely an enjoyable movie even though they storyline goes a bit flat towards the end, then i don't think that it is something that destroys the movie.

As for the actors and characters in the movie i must admit it, i am not a Ben Affleck fan, and even though he does a better job in this movie than he usually does i still, there is just something with his attitude or something that i dislike, and i don't think the guy got much talents, and that's also one of the negative sides of the film, because Ben is acting his usual shallow acting you don't really get personal with the character, at least that is how i felt it, it's maybe not all Ben's fault, maybe with less action in the end scenes it would have gotten more personal. Uma Thurman on the other hand is really showing herself as one of the leading actresses atm, nice to see she's finally getting some use of those talents.

13 September 2004,I should have been eating pie,"Saw this last night. Must say Ben Affleck has the unique ability to make a somewhat interesting premise boring beyond belief. And his style of action makes me want to forever become a pacifist. John Woo continues his reign as the most ham-fisted director on either side of the Pacific. Please, do we need another slow-mo shot of everything? He would take a slow-mo of a old lady using a walker. And Uma Thurman demonstrates once again that she should never speak a line that isn't written by Tarantino. This move stunk.

Needed two hours to air out the house from the overpowering stench. Only good part was making fun of the ridiculous dialogue and incoherent premise. Even Paul Giamatti was horrible. The whole movie was overwrought, overly complex an dull as can be. And the line about eating pie was just a typical example of the horribly lame screen-writing. Can't believe anybody earned a paycheck on this dud. Avoid at all costs.

7 January 2004,"A great ""B"" action movie","Ben Affeck looks great in this movie. Uma Thurman looks old for some reason, but she delivers her usual acting flair. The story is totally unbelievable. John Woo delivers the usual action packed scenes. It has a good ending. Not as great as I thought it would be, but it's a good popcorn movie.

When this movie comes out on video or DVD, it would make a pretty good rental if nothing else is on TV. I'd buy this movie for teenagers and other fans of sci-fi movies.

Could've been a better movie if it was less contrived and a bit more realistic. But what the heck, it's a good movie to see if you want light, mindless entertainment.

10 November 2022,Better sci-fi/adventure than 2022 garbage,"CGI effects, sound and OTT graphic violence has come a long way since this vintage, almost 20yr old movie. But all I can say in response to the negative reviews posted (mainly from the olden days) is that this is way more intelligent and exciting than the big ole blockbusters of modern times... if only you guys had known what crap was to come in the future! I honestly find that I have to put my stupid hat on to appreciate the new sci-fi adventures. Ben Affleck & Uma Thurman are great in their roles with good chemistry going on between them, but the bad guys - Aaron Eckhart & Colm Feore along with the FBI team are a bit one dimensional. Paul Giamatti as usual stands out above this lot in a small role, but somehow manages to be the most believable. This was really great fun to watch.

7 February 2005,need a check to watch the whole movie,"OK - i don't like Ben affleck, he never made a good movie (dogma and daredevil suck most). OK I've never seen a really good john woo movie. but I wanted to give the them another chance so I tried watching paycheck. Mr affleck showed once again how charismatic you have to be to get a Hollywood leading role. my friend said affleck is : farm guy from Oklahoma who gets to the big city and becomes a star, I agreed. back to the movie, Thurman appeared, I know tastes differ but she really isn't the wonderful girl she supposed to be for this role - totally hilarious their first meeting in the laboratory . after a short while I realized how badly crafted this flick was: confusing lame story, stereotypes over and over, the totally ridiculous ""kick the magazine"" scene.. after about one hour my friend asked if we should finish the movie or interrupt, i smiled because I thought it would be over soon, i saw on the DVD cover its about 2hrs long so I decided to stop the DVD and never try it again. my tip: don't put it In your player at all

20 March 2004,An excellent thriller!,"I was excited about this film ever since I first heard about it months earlier. I heard this film was based on another of Phillip K. Dick's short stories. I had very much enjoyed the last film based on one of Phillip K. Dick's stories 'Minority Report' so I thought this film must be good. It also interested me that the main actor was Ben Affleck, I thought that if he could play a comic book character well i.e. 'Daredevil' then let's see how he looks in a science-fiction thriller. When I heard that John Woo was the director, I thought it was great to see how he could direct a science-fiction film, since he had directed a number of great action films.

I certainly wasn't disappointed. This film is a great science-fiction thriller. Ben Affleck played his character just as well as Tom Cruise did in 'Minority Report'. Phillip K. Dick has come up with a number of interesting ideas for science fiction stories so I certainly hope there will be other films based on Phillip K. Dick's short stories.

17 June 2013,Bloated Sci-Fi Actioner,"Philip K. Dick story. Directed by John Woo. Sounds promising. Unfortunately, it falls flat as a bald tire on a nail strewn highway. This movie is bad but it's also pretty entertaining if you close one eye. If I had seen this movie when I was 10 years old, I would've loved it.

Paycheck bares John Woo's signature. In this case, he pressed the pen a little too hard. This story does not cry out for his typical, obvious touches. The last half hour of Paycheck is exactly like any movie directed by John Woo.

It's a beautiful piece of garbage. The sets are terrific and it has a killer chase scene. Dystopian? A little. Why do characters in a futuristic movie talk on clunky land-line desk phones from the 1980s and why isn't the main character ever concerned that his calls are most likely being monitored and thus his location revealed?

Ben Affleck, at the height of his bulky pretty boy career-phase plays the main character, Michael Jennings with gee whiz aplomb and I don't mean that in a good way. Jennings is a genius reverse engineer who gets paid big bucks to analyze and replicate complicated technology that his employer basically steals from other companies. In order to keep Jennings from blabbing and for his conscience to remain clear, his employer erases Jennings' memory after each job.

Aaron Eckhart contributes a paint by numbers performance as Jennings' employer, ruthless billionaire, Rethrick. Rethrick offers the boy wonder of reverse engineering a huge paycheck for a three year job that will make the young man mega wealthy and set him up for early retirement. Trouble brews when the scientist realizes that he's building a machine that's bad, very bad. Before he get his memory erased, he puts together some implausible clues and sends them to his upcoming memory-free self. This collection of clues sends him on a mission to undo his evil creation. This mission involves lots of action and places his character and his pals in life-threatening jeopardy.

Paul Giamatti plays an over the top version of Paul Giamatti as Shorty, the lovable sidekick. Uma Thurman shows up in the movie apparently to pick up a paycheck of her own. She plays Jennings' love interest but they have absolutely zero chemistry.

If you're like me and you enjoy loud stupid movies that play out like roller coaster rides, you'll probably enjoy this.",4

20 January 2004,Chain Reaction meets Minority Report,"The sci-fi premise is too cute, but Affleck is good at running away, running around, running everywhere. Reasonable effects & camerawork, not much emotional depth, a fairly good plot (well it is from Philip K. Dick after all). 7/10.

3 March 2004,woo is over the hill,"if you're going to watch this film and expect realism or a brilliant romantic action film then you should probably change your expectations. i knew what this film was going to be before i watched it. i know that woo is over the hill and that this was going to be a pretty stock studio film. philip k. dick is like the junior sci-fi version of stephen king - he's got a few good ideas that he just keeps recycling in semi-different ways...this one is a cross between total recall and minority report. ben affleck was suitable in the sum of all fears where there was less of an emphasis on action scenes, but he just doesn't have the chops for a john woo flick. the story was fairly obvious, but still sort of compelling. it had an interesting plot device built in - all the normal close shaves that a typical hollywood hero might encounter were foreseen by affleck's character because of the machine he helped build. as a result the audience is allowed to suspend their disbelief just a little bit more, knowing that affleck has already given himself the tools to conveniently get out of any jam he may find himself in. this eliminates the macgyver/batman problem wherein the hero has to find a way to justify to the audience his ability to get out of every scrape. john woo can still direct action sequences and that's where the strength of the film is. john woo still has some skill as a director - he just needs to get the right script and core cast. not very good, but it could have been worse. C+.",
21 August 2022,Terrible,"This is a laughably stupid movie. It employed all the cliches from all the bad movies.

Too many close calls.

Very dumb and unlikely decisions to forward the weak plot.

Stereotypical characters.

The best part of the movie was it being over.

I really get into movie if it deals with time travel or something about seeing the future or future events. Ben Affleck does a really good acting job. The plot it all out amazing and how they use the clues he has recieved.

5 July 2006,"Perfect story: action, thoughts, emotions","Absolutely the best film for me!! The story is revealed during all the film, and the more you watch at it, the more you are involved and interested.

The actors are, no doubt, incredible, and the music is perfectly suited for every scene.

I watched this film 3 times in two days, I was amazed by the way the story evolves.

There is a lot of action, but also the mental aspect of the story in very important. The emotional side is sublime, sometimes I recall the first met between Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman, with her eyes and the sweet music.

Of course you will love this film if you are technology-oriented, because of the high technology content it exposes.

I really advise this film, completely enjoy the action, the music, the intricated story and the emotions it gives.",10
21 May 2004,Really liked it,"I have read the short story this movie was based on and I think I liked the movie better cause I'm more of a visual person. I guess basing it on a story means, just that, cause there were many things in the movie that I don't remember from the book. Anyway, I really liked it. You want the bad guys to get what they deserve and you want the good guys to as well. I really liked how he has to figure out how all the things he sent to himself would help him along the way. Uma was pretty good in this as well. As with any movie with Ben Affleck there's NO romantic chemistry that you can see between the 2 characters but thankfully that wasn't a lot of screen time set aside for that. It's pretty fast paced with very few lagging spots.

1 January 2004,"Action Packed, Good Acting, But...","Why is it that every ""average"" Joe who gets thrust into danger, happens to know Kung Fu, Bo and Karate? Paycheck is a good movie that could have been great. The acting and action are both done well. However the story has the same clich√©s from a thousand other action movies. There's the car chase, the fight scene and the inevitable face to face showdown with the hero and villain. Why can the villain or hero ever just slip and fall to their deaths? It wouldn't be hard in this one because the last third of the movie they're crawling around a huge machine that's exploding around them. I thought Paycheck would show me something new but all it showed me was some action. It's a nice movie to watch once or twice then forget about it.

31 August 2004,By The Numbers,"Although this had a promising premise (provided by Philip K. Dick) , the ultimate delivery proves to be a waste of good material.

The direction by John Woo suffers from overly choreographed action scenes, which in my view renders these pointless and the script is so so at best.

Add to this the film's insistence on the usual Hollywood essentials, i.e a romantic interest, the intermittent appearance of the awkward sidekick (Paul Giamatti) and dimwitted (and in part morally corrupt) FBI agents and you have a disappointing film that plays it purely by the numbers.

3/10

9 July 2022,"Ridiculous Hollywood action gossip, time wasted!","I have no idea how many shots were fired at the heroes again without hurting them. But shootings aren't about life and death either, no, where from? We behave like we're at a paintball battle.

I watched the movie because the story is by Philp K. Dick (Bladerunner). So we live in a future where it is possible to erase memories down to the hour. But that can be done in two completely different ways: first with a kind of ""radiation"" (in which the brain temperature takes a roller coaster ride up to 42.9 degrees but the brain is ""vegetable"" from 43 degrees, of course), and then with two injections, one marking and an erasing injection. Why not a third variant: frying pan on the brain!

And then there's that screamingly stupid poop about the miracle machine that lets you see the future - and that 20-item puzzle that Jennings sent to himself. Question: did Jennings choose what items to put in the envelope himself, or did he just let his miracle machine show him what he was packing? Question for the mind of Philip K. Dick!",3
25 May 2004,More original than you think,"I've read some reviews for this movie saying it wasn't original or did things that had been done 1,000 times before. Do a little bit of research and you'll find that Philip K. Dick wrote the story quite some time ago. Frankly I think the idea is quite clever if not a little rough around the edges. Maybe I'm biased because I've read the short story but I enjoyed this movie to a certain extent. I don't think there was as much John Woo going on as people have said. His action sequences were there but not in great abundance. Affleck is decent and Uma is OK but doesn't have much to do. Overall I think it was a clever plot and a good plot by sci-fi standards, but again I've read the original story so maybe I'm seeing it a little more into it. F.Y.I. the ending to the short story is better than the movie's, and I believe Uma's character is different.

15 August 2004,Enjoyable scavenger hunt,"After reading many of the thesaurus-clutching critics vitriolic literary masterpieces, I have one comment for them....get a life!! I watched, and enjoyed ""Paycheck"" on pay-per-view, as I was tired of paying $9 a head to see critically acclaimed horse manure. So what if the acting wasn't Sir Laurence Olivier? Get over it!! Besides, I could never stay awake more than a few minutes of Sir Larry. And for all the anal-retentive nitpickers who were horrified by a few plot flaws, there is a remedy, get off the couch, turn off the television and computer, and get some sunshine and fresh air. ""Paycheck"" was light, fast paced, and kept one on one's toes. The movie was exactly what John Woo intended, so I urge everyone to lighten up on his vilification. My only complaint is that there was not enough of the lovely Uma Thurman, and I question where they found all those bad guys who were such bad marksmen? This film is no ""Citizen Kane"", besides, I have yet to get through that one in its entirety. I score ""Paycheck"" 8/10.

22 January 2004,Pretty good movie,"I'll describe the good and bad of this movie. The bad: The movie starts off really slow. The ending is predictable like most movies. The last moments of the movie are sort of a waste. The good: All of the performances are very good. It has some nice solid action that satisfied me. It is a rollar coaster ride in the middle of the movie. It has some suspense in it that will have you guessing what's going to happen next on some parts. John Woo did a great job of directing this movie unlike some of his other work. Overall: 8.3 out of 10

21 December 2004,Much better than anybody wants to admit,"Okay, I'll be honest: I'm not the biggest Bennifer fan. In fact, the guy sometimes annoys me. But his performance in this well-scripted piece of cinema was quite acceptable to me.

It seems to be a rare thing these days to find a SciFi-Action movie that isn't so awful it has been exiled to Direct-to-Video or Direct-to-Cable status. Fortunately, Paycheck does not fall victim to the curse of SciFi-Action movies. While it isn't exactly award-worthy, the film definitely entertains and keeps you wanting to find out what's next.

The plot has all the makings of a good head-scratcher: some self-induced amnesia, a large sum of money now missing, a dose of conspiracy, and a number of seemingly benign items that will provide answers to the questions the plot raises. The fighting sequences are placed at just the right points in the film, as is the comic relief, keeping the audience entertained as the suspense builds. The fight sequences are well-choreographed as well, especially the large one towards the end of the film. And most importantly, the plot is almost completely devoid of the plot holes one would expect from a SciFi-Action film such as this.

One other thing which I found quite noteworthy: the ""secret"" of the film is given away in the first half-hour, yet this barely detracts from the suspense of the film at all, and in some cases adds to it.

Final verdict: 8/10. Well worth a watch if you're a SciFi fan, certainly worth purchasing. And the soundtrack is kinda catchy too.",8
23 February 2006,It holds up well in the face of those films that came after and before...,"I give this movie a good solid five because although Affleck plays a part that could have been done by anybody, including his buddy, Bourne, I mean Matt Damon, or Paul Ruebens or Rutger Hauer or The Rock, for Crom's sake, the film holds together as a useful effort by all concerned. Uma's part could have been played by Dolly Parton or Ru Paul.

The script is a little too complicated for it's own good, but who cares? The supporting players could have been anybody not busy on the lot that week. This movie stands on it's own two feet as an honest and workmanlike effort by John Woo, his cast and crew. None of them have any reason to be ashamed of this movie.

It has it's stupid moments, sure. It has it's plot holes, of course. It has errors of physics, logic, and sheer plausibility, granted. It's a movie.

I found it entertaining and worthy of watching several times, including with the director and the scriptwriter's commentaries on the DVD. It stands above some other efforts to film Philip K. Dick's work and it holds together better than many other action-thriller flicks. I recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it.",5
25 December 2003,"Not bad if you like ""Dick Flicks""","P.K. Dick's dark paranoia & hollywood's obsession for action movies with happy endings make for an interesting tension in any film treatment of this bleak geniuses' stories... but try as they might, no studio has managed to totally dumb-down a Dick story. While this would make a fine 60 min episode of a sci-fi anthology series like 'Outer Limits', the nearly 2-hr running time & unnecessary big-budget treatment, didn't slow down or dilute the storyline completely. I didn't find it nearly as lame as reviews led me to believe. Maybe it was the low expectations going in that made it seem better than expected, but it's a satisfactory Hollywood action movie. John Woo certainly serves up the chases, explosions & fight scenes. And while Uma Thurman's presence improves any film, when she gets to kick butt too, it's an extra pleasure. It may not be a future classic like Blade Runner, but I'd put it on a par with Minority Report. If you're in the mood for an action movie that can give you something to talk about afterwards, it's certainly worth the price of a matinee ticket.

4 March 2004,John Woo not playing up to the mark!!!!,"Paycheck,starts in a good way and promises to be an ideal sci-fi thriller but just after the starting pace up the movie loses its nerve and drags itself into a confused action movie.Ben Affleck ,as an engineer,is okay could have been much better.Uma Thurman with very little scope in the movie plays her part well and looks good.But the main set back is John Woo he has delivered some good movies in the past but this time he turns all the hopes down.the second half races in between the streets with a weak storyline and even worst screenplay which turns the movie into a very routine one.**1/2

23 May 2004,Better then I thought it would be,"Being a woman and generally not an action movie lover, I was suprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. John Woo seems to come up with more creative and interesting action sequences with every movie he directs. This movie capitalized on that talent, and the result was a great action flick.

The only thing I disliked about the movie was Ben Affleck. He just didn't seem right for the role. In fact, I would have preferred him to switch roles with Aaron Eckhart, and see Eckhart as the hero and Affleck as the heavy. That definately would have given the movie an interesting dynamic. But alas, I am not a casting agent. Uma Thurman and Paul Giamatti turned in convincing performances, and kept the movie rolling along at a good pace. I just would have liked the movie better if they had chosen a different actor for the lead.

So all in all, a pretty decent action flick.

12 June 2004,Totally good movie!!!!!,"Everybody should watch this movie because of it's action and comedy. This movie has the right amount of good movie style to fullfill your day which means that it is a real good movie trust me! My favorite actor in this movie would be the blue guy from Big Fat Lire. My favorite actress in this movie would be Uma Thurman who plays in Kill Bill vol. 1 and Kill Bill vol. 2 which are very popular movies. Out of a rating from one to ten my rating would be 9 out of 10 because of it's comedy and action. My favorite part of the movie would be when the cop looks into his future and finds out that he is just about to die and then he does. I would recommend this movie to anyone who like action packed movies and movies with alot of comedy in them because that's what this one's like.

28 December 2003,John Woo has ran out of steam,"The story had a lot of promise even with Ben Affleck's wooden performance. However, if you read through some of these reviews, you'll see an familiar re-occuring comment about how cliche and tired Woo's action sequences are. Instead of thought and depth that you'd expect in a PKD Sci-Fi thriller, we get lots of glass breaking, slow motion gun play, mindless fights, explosions, a boring chase scene, and of course, his signature computerized slow-mo white dove. And true to all of Woo's action film, you will not care about the protagonist because you know they are never truely ever in danger- another slo-mo gun pose will eventually save the day. *yawn*, 5/10, if you can stay awake to the end.

19 May 2004,Plot holes a-plenty....,"Philip K Dick wrote many stories which seemed to have great film potential. I never thought of this as one of them.

I have seen Ben Affleck in a number of films, and felt that he was good in a few, OK in most, and positively annoying in some.

I saw the horrible, misleading trailers.

The soundtrack was simply bad.

So, needless to say, I went into Paycheck with very low expectations.... and I was pleasantly surprised.

Affleck plays a talented reverse-engineer, who sees the possibilities in new technology, and is able to carry it through to fruition. He takes on top-secret jobs and has his memory erased upon the completion of each.

Paycheck is more of an action film than a sci fi flick. The plot serves the action, as do the somewhat one-dimensional characters.

Despite these flaws, I spent an evening being thoroughly entertained by this rehashing of the usual technology-run-amok / knowledge-is-power story.

31 January 2004,Not too bad,"Reading all the criticism for this film almost made me pass it by. I'm glad I didn't. Though it's not any where near the scale of Lord Of The Rings in greatness, it's still an enjoyable night out at the cinema. Affleck was pretty good in the role and Thurman was cast well too. I really thought Eckhart had the best part as the bad-guy and he worked the role decently. Too bad it's become too costly to film anything in America (such as this film) because the bland and boring Canadian cities that film makers use as their backdrops all just run together without enhancing the movie whatsoever. At least this trend to film elsewhere cheaply hasn't spawned in the U.K. (thank God).

20 May 2006,I'ts not a waste of time,"Paycheck,a movie with some different feelings,i thought after watching this John Woo picture... OK,some people could say;this movie is unrealistic,but i think:who cares? Since the beginning we knew that,because everyone reads reviews about it,and in this one are specified what kind of movie,you are going to watch:everyone knew it: that is a sci-fi movie... The problem is...a lot of people after seeing this movie said that it is absurd,something with no sense,another weak screenplay directed by John Woo,as happened with MI:II. But for me,that is a grievance...This movie has some interesting sequences and we see a lot of philosophy here...Yeah...i'm not getting crazy,i'm just retracting what's my feeling...I saw that idea in the chapter that Affleck search answers in stamps of Einstein...For me that moment was magnificent,and remembered another deep movie Artificial Intelligence... OK,talk about the human being destroying the world is a little bit out-of date,but we can see some delightful moments, as action sequences and all dialogs between Affleck e Thurman(they were great,and we could feel all that love between the characters) My unique disappointing,is Paul Giammati...Despite,acting great,he received a small role,an absurd for a great actor like him...He's the next academy award for me, and that character could be better... Finally,i would say:People,don't create bad feelings about this movie,it's not a masterpiece,but it doesn't a tragedy as you said...",7
26 December 2003,Minority Report meets Bourne Identity,"The subject line says it all: this is a pure cross between Minority Report (also from a PKD story) and The Bourne Identity (starring Affleck's buddy Damon), with the usual John Woo car chases and explosions from MI2 thrown in for good measure. As semi-futuristic thrillers go, this isn't bad, and will probably provide an enjoyable evening at the movies for you. To put things in perspective, it isn't as good or quite as thought-provoking as Minority Report, but it is better and a smidgen more coherent than Bourne (which bore absolutely no relation to its source material).

I'd recommend this film to families with teenagers; the PG-13 rating is right on target and the violence, while spectacular, isn't the nauseating blood and gore that seems de rigeur in R-rated stuff these days.

25 December 2003,disappointing,"Its strange that this movie come out now, cause i already saw it, and it was called bourne identity. I'd feel embarrassed to be ben right now, cause matt damon is probably yelling a him for making a movie about the exactly same thing, but crappier. Poor ben, two bad movies in a row, now thats either bad luck or he just didn't read the script, but j-lo made him do the flick. I'm just praying Kevin Smith takes out j-lo from jersey girl, so it won't be a latin cheese ball fest.

7 May 2004,Pure Popcorn Brilliance,"Wow! What a great film to see! Twists and turns abound in this candy covered film, I enjoyed it immenseley. This is a pure popcorn ride that tittilates the eyes and ears without remorse. Ben does a good job as the lead, and does his best to ""love"" the leading actress - Uma Thurman - A goddess in all my books! - Nuff of that. This film is using aspects from others in the past if one want's to look deep enough. However as a poor bloke dragged into the theatre on a wet Saturday just coz the Mrs wanted to see Ben, I was delighted to enjoy a good yarn performed and delivered with twists an turns that made my attention focus on the whole film. Maybe everyone needs to be dragged into the cinema on a wet Saturday afternoon by their better half's. What a great way to let your girl (or guy) drool over Ben and have a good time as well! Sure there are plot holes, this film was not designed to be a blockbuster but it does deliver at the end.

Enjoy.

*****/5 for fun and the ability to switch off and ride with the story.",10
12 April 2004,Not even decent actors could have saved this movie,"Mr. Woo has unfortunately none of the characteristics left in him of what made MI2 a fairly decent movie.

Paycheck is nothing less than an attempt to stay in the front line in the genre of futuristic movies. Unfortunately the movie turned out to be nothing more than a miserable attempt. The movie is lacking in everything that makes a movie pleasing.

Ben Afflecs and Uma Thurmans performances are among the worst ever. It is safe to say though that even good actors could not have saved this movie.

14 February 2005,payCHECK,"his is roughly a film along the lines of ""Minority Report"" by Steven Spielberg. This John Woo movie is also based on seeing the future and planning for it, etc. So, for those who do not want to or like to use their memory in watching movies, this may not be the one for you.

Ben Affleck stars in this movie in the lead role and he is an Engineer who performs his tasks to perfection and is offered a highly confidential project, in which he would have to give up 3 years of his life in exchange for a huge ""paycheck"". The catch is, his memory after completion of the project will be erased for all the 3 years he has been on this project. Affleck agrees and completes the project but is fooled. The rest of the movie deals with why he gave up the huge sum of money and some clues he gave himself to get something bigger.

What's new? The movie, unlike Minority Report has clues that solve a jigsaw puzzle for someone who does not remember the past, but can somehow predict the future and has things with him from his past, which help him get out of sticky situations in his present. If you are already confused, stop reading and go watch the movie! ;-) Noticeable: Some good clues and concepts.

Verdict: This will be a nice movie for someone who likes to read mystery book. It falls short of the Minority Report. Overall I rate this movie above average for its concept.. but just about average for execution.",6
11 January 2004,Man gets mind erased and tries to figure out what he was doing before his mind was erased.,"This movie is a lot of fun. The action is intense and cool and the acting if not the best doesn't matter because of the great action sequences. The story is not as confusing as the critics said and is very clever.The only thing was somewhat wrong with this movie was the fact that a scientist could become a kick-ass killing machine.

26 August 2004,pretty cool,"I was enthralled with this movie the first time I watched it. It's almost perfect. It has action, but it's not gory. It has romance, but it isn't mushy. It is a mystery, but you can follow it. It has enough fact to seem believable, but it doesn't make you question any basic truths. At least, it didn't make me question any. Now for the bad news. I don't remember if they swear in this movie, but that doesn't mean they don't. I do, however, remember that the main character...I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet...so I'll just say that he doesn't believe in abstinence.

Thankfully, the camera gets almost as shy as I do and didn't watch it either. Much of it. To make a long story short, I would definitely watch this again (and probably again), but I don't like the sexual references.

26 December 2003,Insultingly stupid movie,"The whole premise of this movie was stupid. It was also as predictable as the sunrise.

The acting was atrocious, as well. I'm beginning to believe that Ben Affleck couldn't act surprised if you dropped an anvil on his foot.

Overall, I'd say save your money. Buy a book and read it, instead. Any book would do.

4 January 2004,The value depends on the expectations.,"Paycheck is not a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. But it really depends on your expectations. I enjoyed the movie, but being as much into film as I am, I can't help to think that such a great plot could have been filmed and acted in a better style. I believe that John Woo is a great director and his style is actually really good. I have nothing against Ben Affleck either and think that he has given us some good performances. I have always loved Uma Thurman and thought she was great. But I don't think that they were really the best options for this movie. It may just be me, but there seemed something off. Everyone is great but it just didn't seem like they really fully connected. I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I did enjoy watching it actually, but there are just a few people who I think good would have fit some of the roles better, that's all. They all gave good performances, and I will say that this is a fun movie to watch. The plot is actually pretty clever, I have to say. Worth seeing I think.

19 May 2004,A riveting and exciting thriller,"There may be inconsistencies in the story and in the effects (our hero stands planted firmly on his feet while baddies can hardly stand up against a man-made gale), however this is a riveting and exciting thriller.

The basic premise is interesting and the envelope, of seemingly everyday items, that holds the key to much more, is also a good idea. The special effects are limited and we rely on the story for the thrills, which to my mind is always much better.

Affleck is better than I have seen him in a long time and while he may not be a great actor this performance is at least good enough.

Thurman is unfortunately under used but lights up the screen.

21 April 2004,should have name it paycheck for loss,"Another one of those futuristic Sci-fi movie

My verdict : In the basket, again

Is there anything new about this movie ? Oh yeah - Here it is an engineer who turns into an escape artist, who doesnt even have the least idea about the past three years of his life because his memory cells have been wiped out except one which shows his death. But even though his memory is at a lost he cleverly most ingeniously some silly things like some crosswords, glasses (which he traded for a 100 million bucks) and gets away with it but using them is a very very accurate order.

Can u believe it ? I'm sure this one was also invented ""in the toilet"" by the script writer Philip.K. Dick

And Ben Affleck has a knack for getting this kind of crap movies First DD then this. Oh man I think his career will come to a sudden stop IF he doesnt become selective.

And Uma ?I havent seen her this terrible since batman (Poison Ivy)

My verdict : Money loss My rating : 5/10

The only thing that will impress you will be the bike stunt which is an exception as it is Uma who does the stunts for a change (like throwing a helmet AT THE POLICE). Whatever.",

20 March 2004,Not a bad action flick - just leave your analytical engines at the door...,"Yes, an above average action/suspense/thriller, that requires a fair degree of 'suspension of disbelief' for you not to get too critical. All the plot holes we've come to expect from Hollywood & some poor casting decisions. Even though there are no wows, ooohs or aaahs, it's fairly 'gripping' (I use that term lightly) stuff from start to finish; nothing edge of the seat, but entertaining nonetheless.

If you'd like a comparative analysis, try Minority report (even though I thought that title a little better overall, plus more sci-fi-ish to my taste). It's hard to imagine they wrote this without begin 'influenced', at least to some degree, by that title. 7/10

1 November 2007,leave the future to future,"I have watched several movies recently, some of which are related to time traveling or prediction of future, such as Click and Paycheck. Especially the later one reminds me of some old scientific movies like Time Machine, Back to the Future, or Terminator. It's all about changing the destiny of certain people or even the mankind.

The movie tells a story of a reverse engineer named Michael Jennings who works for some companies in reprogramming and improving the technologies they plagiarized from their rival enterprises. It's highly confidential and illegal actually, so his memories of the works would be wiped out after the missions are completed. Later, a rich guy, James Rethrick, offers him a 3-year contract which would provide him 8 figures payment in return. Michael takes it.

After three years' hard working, Michael finds his 90 million dollars was replaced with 20 irrelevant items, which are not even his belongings. It is himself who has done all these incomprehensible conducts. Things go quickly and soon he realizes that these items are not irrelevant or unconnected at all but very crucial to reveal the truth and save his life at the meantime. Eventually, he finds out all the clues and traces back to the vital memories he has lost.

I think it's quite a good movie and worth being watched. If you didn't yet, please stop here and go to find out what happens next by yourselves. If you did, let's move on.

All these 20 items, 19 in an envelop and 1 in disguise, are the hints he tries to give himself, the memories-lost one. The project he has endeavored on is about a future-predicting machine, by which he foresaw a war ruining the entire earth and the death of his own. Therefore, he decides to destroy the trouble making machine, change the doomed tragic endings, and leaves himself the clues.

We fully understand the power of time and widely fear the unknown, which result in human's persistent pursuit of the possibilities of time traveling or future prediction. People wish to change their lives into better ones and presume that they're able to avoid the tragedies and create fortunes if they know what is going to happen in advance. I've no intention to make this prose a scientific research paper on the possibilities of time control. I'd only like to think about whether the future is convertible by human's power. Back to the Future shows YES while Time Machine presents NO. Terminal tells NO and Butterfly Effect¬Öwell, I don't know how to identify.

Take myself for instance. If I knew in advance that I would possess a bright future with successful career, beloved husband, and smart children, would I keep fighting hard now? If not, who would guarantee a slothful and indolent woman a favorable future life? If my future was prophesied to be a total disaster, who dared to say my great efforts wouldn't rescue myself from the mess and create wealth and health with my own hands?

Future is indefinite. One thing here is for sure that make another option in present life does lead to a different destiny in future. But is it the one we expect? Is it really a better one? No one knows. Michael in Paycheck said that if you show someone their future, they have no future; if you take away the mystery, you take away hope. It may not be accurate but very close I think. And what Rachel (Uma Thurman) said is even more impressive: I'm not gonna change our time for anything. Some of the best things in life are total mistakes.

Let just grasp the present moment and leave the future to future.",7
25 December 2003,Worst movie of the holiday season,"This movie sucked so bad. First of all, what idiot thought that it would be entertaining to watch a movie about erasing parts of a person's memory for no apparent reason. They should be fired from Hollywood. But anyway, I am a person to fall asleep during movies. I'm usually upset because I miss good parts. I fell asleep today and I was not upset. The movie was bad when i fell asleep and it was bad when I woke up. Maybe even worse. Ben Affleck has been pussified by J-Lo, and I hate everything about him from his fake tan to his stupid cleft in his chin. Enough about the jerk-off...the movie's plot was ridiculous. Affleck's character had his memory erased or some bullshit like that and he was allowed to leave some items to collect after three years. Suddenly, during the project, he realized how crappy this movie is and tried to escape from it. Unfortuantely, he was trapped inside the gayness and proceeded to be chased by a bunch of business men in suits who just happened to have guns and stunt driving techniques. In this one scene, the ""cool"" action scene, Affleck and Uma Thurman's character found some keys to a motorcycle, proceeded to put on badass helmets, and be chased by the company douchebags. Why the hell would they waste valuable getting away time to put on helmets? Anyway, the guy chasing them proceeded to dodge bullets, rocks, and a giant steel pipe that penetrated his car, but was then hit by Uma's helmet which she threw at him. How gay. Don't waste my time. The only good scene was with a hot chick that pretended to be Thurman and trick Affleck (who lost his memory). Of course, she gets killed immediately. When they finally have something good going, they f**k it up. Figures. The ending is a gay one where Affleck and Thurman live happily every after with their birds, their plants, and the dumbass friend that acts like a bumbling idiot. Somehow they also win the lottery, but by this time, no one cares. Maybe if they won the lottery of death, someone would care. I would probably laugh uncontrolablly. In conclusion, to make a long story short, don't ruin your happy holidays by wasting 10 bucks on Paycheck. They should have paid me to see it.",
29 March 2004,Unintentionally Hilarious!,"I'm not a huge fan of action movies and have a tendency to jump at every scary scene. That's how I was at the beginning of this movie, too.

Until mid-way through when the movie took a turn from somewhat serious action to an over-acted comedy. The faces and movements of the cast and the ridiculousness of some of the action sequences had my sister and me cracking up in disbelief. I never did think Ben Afleck was the best -- or even a good -- actor, but I still enjoy many of his movies.

I enjoyed this movie because of its unintentional turn from action to comedy. I look forward to purchasing the DVD.

Colm Feore (Chronicles of Riddick) does his usual bad guy thing and Uma Thurman looks absolutely horrid in this one. you'd think they could've spent more money on her makeup. bottomline: dumb fun.

I mean, it does not deserve to be on the IMDb 250 or anything, but i think it is one of the best movies of its genre to come out in the last couple years. I think it has just been 'cool' to hate on Ben Affleck lately, so people are too quick to criticize everything he does.

Not great, but a solid action flick. it actually involves more thinking than most action flicks, and overall is just a really good popcorn flick.

17 August 2020,So so,"Cast is very good. However I cant say the same thing for the acting of them. Screenplay is pretty cheap one. I was actually expecting to see something like maybe ""12 monkeys"" but i really got disappointed. All those renowned worldwide celebs let me down. It was all about chase based on a sci-fi-like story.

19 January 2004,Enjoyable adventure,"I had read the reviews on here (mostly negative) before going to see Paycheck but decided to go and see for myself. I'm glad I did. Certainly I could dissect this film and find a plot hole or two but if you don't over analyze this one, it's an enjoyable afternoon at the movies. The actors were good and it was fun to see the guy from Six Feet Under as one of the FBI agents (can't recall the actor name but he's ""David"" on SFU). Certainly this was every bit as good as Minority Report, the film I most see it being compared to. If you're inclined at all to see this movie, I would recommend that you do so and decide for yourself!

31 December 2003,The Bourne Identity part 2,"Let's be honest; this wouldn't have been too implausable as a sequel to the Bourne Identity. It's almost the same movie; a man loses part of his memory and must figure out how he got where he is with the help of a few clues. In both cases, reality and plot consistency go to the wayside where necessary to make a better action film. After all is said and done with, the Bourne Identity did it better, but there's not much difference in quality between the two films.

The plot was from a short story, and it felt like it. It was there to carry the movie along between action scenes. You get the short, Hollywood version of what would happen if you saw the future instead the extended science-fiction edition.

Don't go see it for the plot. I wouldn't go see it for Uma Thurman, but that's a personal choice. If you want an action movie with a touch of plot, but not too much, you should go see it.",6
25 December 2003,Great Movie...,"All I have to said is that this movie is one of the best action movies I've seen in this year beside X2 and Matrix Reloaded. Ben Affleck gave the most outstanding performances and so does Aaron Eckhart and Uma Thurman... This movie is a must see for real fans of sci-fi/action types and for those of you who have read the book, I'm sure you can't miss this movie.

9 June 2004,Just how stupid do these movies have to get...,"... before this genre meets its much deserved (and ludicrously choreographed) demise?

The protagonist, knowing his memory is about to be erased leaves himself a random collection of objects and vague clues to remind him of a terrible machine he was working on (why he chose those strange clues and life-threatening course of action rather than just write himself a detailed letter explaining everything, or spilling the story to his girlfriend ahead of time is anyone's guess). Apparently he was able to see the future and is convinced he's about to be killed. Despite that he leaves himself these clues that help save his life over and over again, yet in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, he refuses to believe his destiny could change until Ms. Perfect Girlfriend convinces him of it with her undying love... give me a break... Apparently the grand plan is to destroy the offensive future-seeing machine, which he plans to do after his memory is erased by leaving himself all these clues, and knowing the whole world will be on his tail trying to kill him. He could just as well have destroyed the machine before his memory was erased, when nobody suspected him, having all his capacities, and free access to it... hmmm... some people just have to do things the hard way.

Enough... please! Can we have something with a half-way plausible plot?",
27 December 2003,What you would expect,"Some should be warned in advance, that this being a John Woo film, it will lack certain accuracy to detail that may be jarring at first. In the very early scenes of the movie, Jennings tears apart the virtual innards of a computer by point-and-clicking a number of identityless shapes, in a very pretty visual sequence having no resemblance to software code or circuit design. The machine Jennings builds glows, hums, smokes, and hisses much like any other Hollywood supercomputer, and much unlike any real computer. Seattle locals will also scoff at the notion that Seattle will have developed an underground light-rail system by 2007; anyone familiar with local politics will agree that it's more likely we won't even have agreed to build such a thing by then. On the other hand, despite being filmed in Vancouver, the movie adds other details that subconsciously reinforce the notion of being in Seattle -- real street, intersection, and neighborhood names, real Washington state train destinations, real Washington license plates, even accurate replicas of Seattle police cars. But the point of this movie is not to explore 2003 (or 2007) technology, or even to accurately portray Seattle -- if you want either of those things, watch a documentary about those topics. While a lack of technical accuracy is sometimes disappointing, even techies must admit that Affleck in goggles wielding a soldering iron and a screen full of hex isn't as visually exciting as Affleck squinting at a wraparound display, dismantling an imaginary gadget in midair. And we've come here to see an action movie, not a technical training video, or a driving guide to Seattle. Paycheck delivers in that action, though it is not perhaps as action oriented as a kung-fu flick or blow-up spy tale. It bases itself largely around suspense, which is able to change and surprise, even after you have an idea how it's going to come; a bit like a cinematic Rube Goldberg invention. Paycheck adds in a dose of sociology and philosophy that will probably be lost on most of the young adult action-movie crowd. 9 of 10",
8 January 2004,A pretty good action movie . . .,"At first glance this appears to be a movie that relies a little too much on science fiction. However, if we look beyond that - it is an action movie and I would say that it was a pretty good action movie. Far from all the epics going on at the moment (Cold Mountain, LOTR Return of the King, The Last Samuri) it is a refreshing break for the mind; that is , as long as you don't over think certain elements of the movie. Ben Affleck fits perfectly into his role as a cocky engeneer and though there isn't really much for Uma Thermon to do, she does her part well. The ideas behind the storyline are very interesting and do not fail to capture the viewer's attention. However, if they do, there's always the fast paced action to appease the masses. 6.5/10

2 January 2004,I don't understand what everyone's problem is,"Doesn't anyone just go to a movie for fun anymore? It's almost like Lord of the Rings made it so that all movies are expected to be masterpieces. This isn't an epic. It's just an action-packed popcorn movie. Of course the plot is ludicrous. Who cares? Just sit down for two hours and enjoy it for what it is: a decent science fiction action movie. Maybe if everyone stopped trying to over-analyze every movie they sit through these days, they'd have a better time.

Then again, most of you will probably just think I'm a pretentious jerk who loved the movie. Isn't it amazing how anyone with an opinion on the internet is an expert?

My score: 7/10.

29 April 2008,A Straight-forward Review by a Reasonable Guy,"Philip K Dick wrote many stories which seemed to have great film potential. I never thought of this as one of them.

I have seen Ben Affleck in a number of films, and felt that he was good in a few, OK in most, and positively annoying in some.

I saw the horrible, misleading trailers.

The soundtrack was simply bad.

So, needless to say, I went into Paycheck with very low expectations.... and I was pleasantly surprised.

Affleck plays a talented reverse-engineer, who sees the possibilities in new technology, and is able to carry it through to fruition. He takes on top-secret jobs and has his memory erased upon the completion of each. He decides to take on a project big and profitable enough to allow him to retire comfortably for the rest of his life. He completes the project, goes through the memory erasure, and then starts to discover what he has done, and, pursued by corporate hit men and the police, tries to recover his memory. Uma Thurmond, a biologist he had fallen in love with, is one of the memories he wants to recover, and also a target.

Paycheck is more of an action film than a sci fi flick. The plot serves the action, as do the somewhat one-dimensional characters. And there is so little chemistry between Affleck and Thurmond that the romantic subplot is almost just a distraction. Despite these flaws, I spent an evening being thoroughly entertained by this rehashing of the usual technology-run-amok / knowledge-is-power story. This film is very Hollywood, and uses a lot of slick and clich√©d camera-work, but nevertheless tells a good story and does it well enough.",8
13 August 2007,"Not Woo's best, not PKD's best, but entertaining enough","Having heard a lot of bad things about this film and skipped it when it first came out, I was actually pleasantly surprised when I finally got around to renting it. OK, so it's far from the best John Woo or Philip K Dick film, but the result is entertaining enough, and to be fair the original short story it's based on wasn't exactly PKD's finest work either.

I don't recall there being many chases and shoot-outs in the original story, and certainly no slow motion flying white dove (gnngh - give it a rest already, Woo!). A lot of the mysterious items in the envelope have been changed too, but the overall premise remains the same - Ben Affleck plays an engineer who has his memory wiped after each job to ensure the confidentiality of his clients. At the end of a particularly big job on a top secret project, he's understandably a bit miffed when he goes to pick up his pay, only to find that he apparently signed away all the money in favour of taking an envelope full of seemingly worthless knick-knacks - hairspray, cigarettes, a bus ticket, a pair of naff looking sunglasses...

Of course, he soon discovers that all those items are there for a reason, and in true 80s text adventure game style spends the next couple of hours running around trying to figure out where and when to use each item, while being chased by both the FBI and the company he was working for.

Sure, it's a bit hokey in places, the action isn't as spectacular as you'd expect from John Woo (it's more of a thriller than an action movie, to be honest), and the future looks remarkably like the present, apart from a few holographic displays borrowed from Minority Report and that nifty memory wiping machine they keep strapping Ben into. But the ride's fun, as long as you don't stop too long to pick holes in the plot.",6
27 December 2003,"Coulda, woulda, shoulda been -- but still lots of fun!","You'll find no great truths of the Universe in John Woo's `Paycheck,' nor will you find his (or anybody else's) best work. Nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this flick at a recent bargain matinee showing. The story was fun and well-played out for what amounts to a basic, mindless action film. And I'll tell you, this holiday season there are so many filled-with-doom, dark, sad, tragic films (albeit well-acted masterpieces), a mindless action flick is a welcome relief. After reading most of the mainstream reviews, I was ready to be bored and

irritated. I am happy to say, I left the theater feeling I had a good time, worth the price of admission. Yes, `Paycheck' could have been better made, would have

been better perhaps under different circumstances and, in deference to author Philip K. Dick, should have been better. But as it is, it's worth its 1 hour and 59 minutes.

4 January 2004,Fast Paced Thriller,"Paycheck is a very well made thriller. Keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. Takes some time to understand what is happening, but once you get past that stage you appreciate the excellent script and the slick direction. The only down point was that the ending scenes could have been slightly shorter. 8/10

3 October 2004,"Nice try, Mr. Woo, but easily forgotten.","Right about now, I wish I had a machine to erase the memory of this movie. I watched it with my 13-year-old, who had an easy time following the plot, since it was spoon fed. I found the choice of Afleck as the lead character a strange choice. He had no on screen chemistry with Uma Thurman, who sounded like she was reading her lines off of cue cards. I can see John Woo's parallel to North by Northwest, but he doesn't come close to matching Hitchcock's intrigue. Woo's trademarks come though like bulldozers. The film is visually scintillating, but hardly enough to keep viewers interested. The chase scenes are laughable, as are many other far-fetched scenarios. If we, the movie-goers, are supposed to suspend belief while viewing a film, it was nearly impossible during this two-hour assault on the imagination. If you have a kid who's into sci-fi, and there is NOTHING else at the video store, then it might be worth it. But if ""A Knight's Tale"" is available, get that and enjoy.

24 December 2014,Incredibly bad movie,"What a fabulously stupid movie! I can't believe all the positive reviews issued previously by others (they must have been from 13-year-olds, or something).

The storyline is lame and filled with stunningly impossible coincidences and the hero reaches conclusions that defy logic. The entire premise is just a pretext for Woo's usual abuse of explosions and flames.

I'm shocked that the director (John Woo) could make even relatively good actors (Uma Thurman) appear to be one-dimensional and uninspired. Of course, the lame actors (Ben Affleck, Aaron Eckhart) are, well, lame... but I didn't expect much more from them - never seen them in any movie where the characters actually have some kind of depth to them.

The movie isn't even bad enough to make it fun as only really bad movies can be (i.e. Attack of the killer tomatoes)...

In short, rent it if you have $3 to waste, and even then, you may be upset about the waste of time.",3
6 April 2021,What a surprise!,"I had never heard of this movie until it popped up as a suggestion for me on HULU.

It was fast paced, and fun! No nudity, no f bombs, no gore. Just a good movie. Entertainment as I think it should be.

31 January 2004,nice story until showdown,"...then it becomes boring. Yes, it starts promising, when you are left with the protagonist without knowledge about the past but with some clues you try to read but mainly leaving you puzzling...like in ""Memento"". Until the action (motor cycle scene) and the showdown starts. This, alas, again is stupid cheap Hollywood metal-and-glass-flying-around-after-lots-of-explosion-and-bullets-boring 10 million times seen -crap. What a pity.

17 September 2006,Uma's Eyes <()> <()>,"Lots of due respect. An interesting premise, and lots of hard work and certainly lots of pyro-dollars spent.

HOWEVER...

1: For a techno-cyberthriller, the 'techno' was very much lacking-- cool robotic arm that does bionic moves with a hard-wired gantry-crane hoist controller. You'd need to be wired into that thing like Spiderman II to do any of that--

2: With all due respect, we've seen much unbelievably baroque fighting choreography-- careful not to put great actors to use making Sunday matin√©e martial-arts sequences.

3: How does it come to pass that a stack of ship containers has a tunnel thru it, dierectly leading to a series of ship-containers that have open ends, and line up perfectly with the mysterious sewer-pipe all perfect for a motorcycle to zoom thru-- not even McGuyver coulda worked that set out.

4: Let's spend less on the predictable action-sequences and play more upon these great actors, and whatever story can be salvaged. Save the techno-dollars for explaining this amazing machine, thus sparing us the crunching of set-cars we've all seen so many times.

5: The great stars of this film were: Uma's eyes. She knows to use these huge expressive organs with devastating effect. Those who cast UMA, or manage her, lease try to find projects worthy of her talents, and her dangerous eyes... <(0)> <(0)>",
9 March 2004,"Surprising, good action, nice plot","My expectations of this movie were not set very high, however surprisingly very nice special effects kicked in, in the first stage of the movie ; Michael Jennings ( is performing his engineering work in a lab where he's moving 3D elements in a very realistic way, thus engineering a new 3D projection system) The movie evolves in a rather spectacular way, as an escape from Federal agents and a whole string of further escapes take place. The way this happens reminds a little of ""Momento"" In the end the Machine has to be destroyed, this part has the pinoccio effect in it, where you know he shouldn't first fix the machine and then destroy it. However the final explosion makes this all worth while. I was nicely surprised by this movie, worth spending time on if you're not in a suspension mood.

20 July 2004,"Entertaining popcorn flick,though its no Blade runner","Yet another Philip k Dick adaption hits the screens with veteran Hong kong action director John woo helming the project.I feel this movie has been unfairly torn apart by critics and sci fi fans alike.Maybe its the whole 'Bennifer' thing still playing on the publics paparazzi hungry brains or,the fact that Philip k dick fans will never be happy with any adaption of their beloved authors work,but i enjoyed it.Affleck is cast as an engineer who works on big money product development's,the jobs are so hush,hush that he has his memory erased after each contract.Against his pals better judgment he accepts a huge wage to do a 2 year contract.Upon finishing the big job he finds himself in a bit of strife he's also signed away his paycheck in exchange for an envelope full of obscure bits and pieces.Long forgotten love Uma thurman turns up and they go on the run,trying to avoid the evil corporations clutches and make sense of the whole bizarre scenario.So a lot of things are implausable but lighten up people this is a big budget,no grey matter required popcorn flick masquerading as sci fi, attempting to appeal to people who wouldn't normally watch a sci fi film.If you suspend your disbelief for an hour and a half you'll enjoy it.Even though John woo is directing don't expect blood thirsty shootouts as the body count is low,but his trade mark stand offs,and a motorcycle chase are included although he takes a rather workman like ethic to this film.Not as memorable as Dicks other adapted works such as 'Bladerunner','Total recall' or the overrated 'Minority report' but enjoyable escapism regardless.",
17 April 2004,A very good action movie with a nice little story,"Philip K. Dick is known to movie fans as the man who wrote stories for movies like Blade Runner (1982) and Minority Report (2002). His stories requires your brain to work during the viewing of the movie. Many people look at this new movie expecting another mind-boggling one like Steven Spielberg's Minority Report (2002) except that it is not. Paycheck (2003) is directed by the action master John Woo, who's known for his great action sequences in movies, like Mission: Impossible II (2000), Face/Off (1997) and Broken Arrow (1996). So you must expect to see a lot of action in his latest movie.

The story stars with Michael Jennings (played by the usually bad actor, Ben Affleck) as the best reverse-engineer in the business. He gets loads of money for his services which usually last two months. Telling you a little bit more of the story would be to ruin the story and enjoyment for you.

The first thing to say about this movie, is that it has a good pacing to it. It kept me interested for the whole length by thinking of the events happening and by the cool action chases (or should I say an almost one long car chase?). Minority Report (2002) is among my favorite movies of all-time, so if you were like me and you're expecting this to be the same, well it's not. Don't see it for the great story because it's a short one, but see it if you like a nice story in a good action movie.

The special effects were really nice. It may not be the best of the year, but surely was good enough for the movie. There's for example that screen which Tom Cruise used to depend on in Minority Report (2002) which gives you the ability to work by a pen or something like that.

The cinematography was good especially in the car chases, but the movie is still trying to capture the style of Minority Report (2002).

Uma Thurman is the leading actress here helping Ben Affleck in the story. She is really good, as usual, but her performance is not even close to what she did in Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003). If you hate Affleck so much (like many others), then maybe you find her existence in the movie entertaining enough along with Philip K. Dick's great short story to continue watching this movie.

One of the best things about this movie is the score of this movie. I'm not sure who should get the credit but probably to all of the composers: John Powell, James McKee Smith and John Ashton Thomas. The score was energetic enough and it helped the action a lot. The score wasn't deep nor it was telling a story, but instead was a great score for an action movie, which this movie certainly is.

This movie might not be among the best Sci-Fi movies ever, but if I was giving the choice of how to make it, I'd say I'm glad it was done this way and by John Woo. The story wasn't Sci-Fi enough to suggest someone else better like Spielberg directing it, and I wouldn't have seen it if it wasn't for Philip K. Dick's story and DreamWorks SKG's production (yes I'm talking about the logo). If you want a nice movie to watch with popcorn in one hand and a Coke in the other, this one shouldn't disappoint you.

What I hated really about this movie is that it doesn't really go under the surface of the story. Let me explain it: many people never heard of something like 'reverse-engineer' so what is that? It is a process where you reverse engineer something. That sentence with a big dot to it. I mean, we never knew anything about the main character's job except for the title! There is some more ideas to think about in the movie, but no time is giving to you. Let the movie figure it out for you, so you just wait there wondering for a minute about it. I would much prefer for you to see this movie without knowing anything about it (as this also applies to most of the movies).

Affleck was trying to act hard here, especially after the disaster that is called Gigli (2003). He needed this movie and any other good movie coming to him to prove that he can act, but can he? He might have given us some two or three nice performances in the past, but no more. Expectations are Jersey Girl (2004) is going to help him a lot along with this movie in his current career.",7
18 January 2004,Not as bad as I thought,"I was forced to watch the movie. The content of the film seems very commercial and clich√©. But actually it is really not that bad. The plot is very tight and the tension lasts until the end. I was very well entertained.

19 July 2004,John Woo's best American pic,"I'd say that this is the finest film John woo has made to date in the U.S. His career in the states has been entirely s***ty! Face/off was good if you felt like not caring about a plot or characters at all. It's also Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman's second best action movie. Affleck's personal best action film is Daredevil. Maybe you don't think that was a good movie but that comment is coming from a comic book junkie. Uma Thurman's best action film of course is Kill Bill vol. 1. No actor will ever swing a sword like she did in Vol. 1. As for vol. 2. I will not speak of it. I did see it, but my mother told me if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all.

27 August 2004,woo does it again!!!!!!!!!!,"Yet again the master has shown that the move from Hong Kong to The good old US of A was well worthwhile. This is far better than the other Woo films that people go on about, like ""the killer"", ""hard boiled"" or ""bullet in the head"", mainly i guess because it's in English, so you don't have to read the film you can just settle back and watch Ben Affleck get all confused about everything, while everything blows up around him. To call this film ""the best film to come out of America this year"", would be underselling it.

I't's vital that you see this at the cinema, because the explosions look much better when they are big, and they sound louder too. i'd give it 11 out of 10, if i could. But since I can't i'll just have to give it 10.

8 August 2004,Ever played computer adventure games?,"If you ever played (and liked) Monkey Island, LLL or Space Quest you'll like this movie.

The main character (Mr. Affleck) is a reverse engineer who gets a paycheck when the job is done. But since this is a guy with empathy the employers erase his memory afterwards...

However, a last job will do it. A big one. He finishes the job and then go to check out to fetch his personal belongings (which was left there before the job). The bag contains 20 items and he has to figure out the purpose of each item. Just like ""try everything with everything"" in the mentioned computer games.

28 December 2003,"Good, but alright","The movie was... okay. It had a good idea and a good story but a lot of it was rather predictable. You knew what was going to happen through most of the movie. That was, up until the end. This is where this movie earned its stars. The end in Paycheck is great.

Now, the acting. Ben did a bang up job. Al though i am still a little uneasy with him in action role. He should stick to the well done college dramas. Uma, this was not a role for her. Just that she is a very profound woman, a dominent woman, and i didn't like seeing her hidden behind this little playful and cute biology nerd interested in this tall dark and sterotypical genious... right? Anyway, she wasn't right for the role, i would have liked to see... Charleze Therone

The movie was well put together it was just that sometimes you got the idea that you were in the future with these really cool things going on, then you got the feeling you out of that world and in someplace that was just really expensive. It was not the same level of development like I saw in Minority Report. That was what i wished for in this film.

Ben, drama is for you but this is way better the Guili or whatever. Uma, Kill Bill 2 is going to rule Woo, i hope you are doing Mission Impossible 3

Overall a pretty bland action pic with some dreadful lines and nothing we havent seen before. Not a lot of tension or nail biting going on, not enough surprises to warrant the budget. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this movie, I imagine that would have been a pretty disappointing experience. I didn't think Uma Thurman was too bad, she had some pretty dodgy dialogue to work with and a lot of it was very corny. The motorcycle chase was alright but again the direction gave it no sense of tension at all. Why?

2 May 2014,Ahh my next paycheck!,"It's always a great feeling when the next paycheck arrives... even better when you can work for months, even years on end, then simply have all that wiped from your mind! Living in the highlights and a carefree life, not worrying over the job you do. Until it comes back to you. So you work at reverse engineering other people's products for another company to rip off for them, and they want to keep it private so wipe your entire mind of actually doing it. How are you to actually know what happened during that time. Specially if just a few weeks before your job finished and they performed the wipe, you had decided to give up your millions of dollars in your next paycheck. Why?

4 January 2023,BS,"Bad direction, and bad acting. The transitions and the camera are also poorly done. The music is boring, and outdated even for that time. The director had the goal of hiring a couple of good actors. In order to attract the attention of the viewers. But he did the wrong thing. The actors played poorly, as if they were actors of a low production. The budget of the film is not big, but it should not be big, since it is an action film. The film does not hold attention, it is quite predictable. The special effects could have been done better. In any case, grade 1 is even high. An hour wasted trying to watch a movie. If I had paid for a cinema ticket, I would have demanded a refund.

21 February 2004,Not bad but not as good as it could be,"Not as bad as you could imagine it is, (because John Woo directs and IMO he spoilt more than one film with his love to shootout, blows, running wild, car chases etc.) but not as good as it could get with right hand and eye behind the camera. Affleck ain't bad, Eckhart with his foxy smile is just swell, Feore is like a combination of wolf and fox also(I love that actor), Thurman is just herself, Giamatti wears a necessary in films like that role of a clown. A couple of ideas in this movie is just great (like shotgun shooting the floor - nicely done), with the leading place for all kind of hero's stuff - I liked that a lot. Too much of pathos and shallow moralizing (though I just knew they will come up with something like that in this movie - sigh, it's just the way they have to do it, I'm afraid, to let stupid people understand something...). All in all, the movie was very fine to watch. I think Phillip K. Dick won't suffocate of regrets and despair. Not bad work at all, but it could and it should be better. 8/10

25 December 2003,Good movie!,"I'm not a huge fan of Ben Affleck, but I love John Woo pictures. This film has it all a great plot and outstanding action. When you walk into a movie and don't have any idea what's goin to happen next, you know you've seen something good. The motorcycle chase was amazing. This is one of John Woo's best films and a huge improvement for Ben Affleck since he made ""Gigli.""

26 December 2003,Great movie,"This is by far one of John Woo's best! And a great bounce back for Ben Afleck after ""Gigli."" The reason why this movie is so good is that you have no idea what's going to happen next? I like the plot of a guy who helps companies by taking their competitors product apart to help the other company improve on theirs, then when he's done he has his memory erased so that he doesn't remember anything about what he's done and nobody can really question him. This movie kinda had a little ""Total Recall"" plot goin on here, but this movie I think is far better. This is a great film for John Woo fans. This is a definent must see!!!

4 June 2013,A Fairly Smart Action Flick That Meets the Explosion Criteria,"Philip K Dick wrote many stories which seemed to have great film potential. I never thought of this as one of them.

I have seen Ben Affleck in a number of films, and felt that he was good in a few, OK in most, and positively annoying in some.

I saw the horrible, misleading trailers.

The soundtrack was simply bad.

So, needless to say, I went into Paycheck with very low expectations.... and I was pleasantly surprised.

Affleck plays a talented reverse-engineer, who sees the possibilities in new technology, and is able to carry it through to fruition. He takes on top-secret jobs and has his memory erased upon the completion of each. He decides to take on a project big and profitable enough to allow him to retire comfortably for the rest of his life. He completes the project, goes through the memory erasure, and then starts to discover what he has done, and, pursued by corporate hit men and the police, tries to recover his memory. Uma Thurmond, a biologist he had fallen in love with, is one of the memories he wants to recover, and also a target.

Paycheck is more of an action film than a sci fi flick. The plot serves the action, as do the somewhat one-dimensional characters. And there is so little chemistry between Affleck and Thurmond that the romantic subplot is almost just a distraction. Despite these flaws, I spent an evening being thoroughly entertained by this rehashing of the usual technology-run-amok / knowledge-is-power story.

17 March 2004,"Entertaining, but could have been thought-provoking","'Paycheck' doesn't want to be an action movie. It would rather play out as a thoughtful story about the intriguing possibility of seeing into the future. However, John Woo is directing the picture, so you have to expect high-speed vehicle pursuits and lots of explosions. It's just that whenever those are happening on screen, you feel yourself wishing they'd cut back to the absorbing mystery that lies at heart of the plot.

Ben Affleck is Michael Jennings, an electronic engineer who is a wiz at reverse engineering other people's hi-tech designs and selling them off to whomever chooses to hire him. To prevent him selling those ripped off ideas to any other competitors, the firms who make use of his expertise insist on erasing his memory of the period he worked for them. So he moves from one job to the next, earning huge paychecks, but accumulating only very little to reminisce on. He's quite happy with this. As he explains to his techie friend, Shorty (Paul Giamatti), all he's left with are the highlights: the fantastic parties and vacations he spends his paychecks on. All the dull moments spent punching clocks at the office are conveniently wiped clean.

But now an old varsity buddy of his, James Rethrick (Aaron Eckhart), wants him for a project that will wipe out a more considerable chunk of his already Swiss cheese-like memory: a three-year assignment to reverse a top secret piece of equipment. Three years is a long time, but Rethrick convinces him it will pass in the blink of an eye. And on screen, it literally does. Instantaneously after seeing Michael accept the assignment, we cut to him directly after his memory of the past three years has been erased. Which is exactly the way the character experienced it: as if nothing ever happened.

He should be $92 million richer from the company stock he was given as payment for the job, however when he goes to the bank to collect some of that money, he is informed that he signed away his rights to the shares three weeks ago. Naturally, he can't remember doing this. And why would he have given up the money? All that's left to him is a manila envelope containing an odd assortment of trinkets with no apparent value.

No apparent value until the items in the envelope manage to help him escape FBI agents who seem intent on harming him because it turns out the equipment he reverse engineered happened to be stolen from the government. He quickly realizes a pattern: each item in the envelope was put there to be of use to him at exactly the moment he needs it, and every time he uses an item, he seems to be following a path towards unraveling the mystery of why he lost the $92 million and why strange men in black keep trying to kill him. But who sent Michael the items in the envelope? Was it Michael himself? He certainly can't remember doing it. And if so, how did he know precisely what he'd need at precisely the right time? Ah, but that all has to do with what Michael invented during his three years working for Rethrick, which Michael has no recollection of whatsoever.

I won't reveal any further plot details but the screenplay itself is a good piece of reverse engineering; working backwards from its inevitable conclusion to the point where Michael completed his assignment. Each of the items in the manila envelope fit neatly into place like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle, just waiting for Affleck to put them all together as if he was in his very own episode of `MacGyver'.

The middle section of the movie where Affleck spends his time solving the riddles is thoroughly entertaining, and I was reminded of Hitchcock's classic thriller 'North by Northwest', particularly because of the common element of an 'innocent man wrongly accused', but even more so because of the scenes where Ben Affleck is chased through a bus terminal and then onto train tracks by the villains. A little more grey on the temples and Affleck would have been the spitting image of Cary Grant running in his grey suit in that 1959 film.

But Hitchcock's film was art, and this film at the very best is merely entertainment. Woo allows the film to lose focus by including too many action set-pieces that simply aren't engaging enough to the audience. By the time the ride is over, the intrigue that was generated by the plot earlier seems to have been lost, and the ending - although fitting - seems a bit of a let-down.

Uma Thurman's role in the film feels a bit tacked on. She really isn't there to be anything more than a pretty face that may provide Affleck's character with a reason to try and solve the mystery - as if the $92 million weren't enough. And though the role is similar to the one she played in Gattaca, she isn't able to coax as much chemistry out of Affleck as she did with Ethan Hawke (perhaps explaining why Thurman and Hawke ended up being a couple off screen). Also, Gattaca was a far more stylish set and Thurman is the type of actress who thrives in highly stylized pictures; she seems to be languishing here in Woo's clean-cut Hollywood production.

All in all, the movie is good entertainment. It's not a remarkable film that you'll be talking about for weeks after, but it certainly gives you a good excuse to eat popcorn in a dark room with strangers.",

23 December 2003,fun,"went to see this at a screening yesterday, and i almost didn't go because it didn't really look good, and i'm not the biggest fan of Ben Affleck (can't think of one role he's done that i liked). while i won't be buying this on DVD, and i didn't spend any $ on the ticket, i didn't feel like it was a waste of time. the story reminded me of modernized old classic mysteries kind of like ""Charade"" where you have a few clues and have to figure out where the big finale is. uma thurman was fun in it (i missed her in Kill Bill 1 - i heard she kicked ass in that), but i think her role could have gone to any pretty gal. anyway it's not as bad as the trailers look. heh.

19 January 2004,Don't understand why the reviews aren't better,"Although the reviews for this movie weren't great, the premise seemed interesting, so I went to see it anyway. I was glad I did. The elements of action, mystery, and sci fi worked together nicely, and made for something that was a lot more fun than you'd expect. Sure, you could nitpick about some of the gaps in the science, but that's what makes it fiction. Definitely recommended.

12 April 2013,"A nice idea, in the wrong hands","This movie is one of those examples of a movie that could have been superb if it just had a better director at the helm. Don't get me wrong, Woo is fine for a mindless action flick, but this movie is NOT mindless. This is a smart film with some pretty high-concept ideas.

The performances seem a little forced and stilted, but having seen most of these actors acting far better in other roles, I find it hard to blame the actors and again feel urged to point the finger of blame towards the director.

The script needed reworking a good few times... if nothing else, just to make it slightly more believable (which is an odd thing to say about a film with such high-concept).

As we all know. This film was based on a novel written by the guy who wrote the novel that Bladerunner was based on... and as we also know, Bladerunner was a ""development hell"" kind of film. It had re-write upon rewrite, re-cast after re-cast, a dying cinematographer and a megalomaniac director with a huge budget... and it turned into one of the greatest ever films... THIS FILM NEEDED THAT!

A saving grace of this movie is the music. John Powell serves the movie very well, never detracting and always enhancing the visual.

... having said all of that... do watch this film, it's fun and not too long, with some good action... but it will leave you wishing someone else had helmed it... someone like Scott.",6
21 January 2004,Fresh and exciting thriller!,"I saw this movie after seeing trailers on TV. I was not sure what to expect because of the criticism of the film on this imdb. However, I thought it was very exciting and quite fresh and not a clone of another film. I was on the edge of my seat trying to work out what was going to happen in the end. It was great stuff. I rate this an 8.5

1 January 2004,"Smart, Witty, Unique and Entertaining","This was a really neat film. I personally thought it was one of the best of the year, although there's many (or most) that disagree. Sure, there's holes in the plot and story-line, but there's very few movies that don't have inconsistencies. You can pick apart just about any film. However, this movie explains some of its inconsistencies along the way, for instance, when the future changes, Affleck explains that it's not the future if it's known to the individual. Obviously.

What others have said has already been done are missing the point of the film. This is not a blast session or a flame, but this film has its own areas of uniqueness that others don't touch on. For instance, Affleck takes a job for an 8 digit paycheck consisting of stock options where he volunteers to have his memory erased after the completion of the highly confidential and proprietary work. Time passes and the film cuts to Affleck sitting in the same chair he started in when he took the job with his ""buddy"" Jimmy saying, ""You're done. It's over."" As the viewer tries to figure out just what happened (it intends to put you in the same boat with Affleck), you start the ride the film takes you on and things get rapidly more interesting and gripping, as Affleck tries to stay alive using his knowledge of his own future. He is able to change his future with 19 obscure items he sends to himself at the end of his tenure on the job, that don't flag his employers. He also makes sure that he protects and retrieves his love interest (Uma Thurman) who is also involved in the top-secret project. It also has a good ending.

This film is just plain smart. I loved it. Go along for the ride and don't over-analyze. Just ask yourself the questions, ""Did I enjoy this film? Was I entertained?"" The resounding answers are an emphatic YES! This film is well-done and provides enough of a unique twist that it doesn't feel or seem like a Minority Report or Bourne Identity redo. I give it a 9/10, at least.",9
7 March 2021,Struggled to stay awake...,"Some wrote bad reviews for this film, others struggle to understand why it was so poorly rated... so I chose to give it a go. I can deal with cliches, unrealistic plots and I can even forgive bad acting!!! Because you know, sometimes something is just my cup of tea and it all just comes together ok! Well I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this film was certainly not my cup of tea in any way shape or form. The plot was ridiculous, the acting was terrible, the action scenes weren't particularly entertaining, and over all I couldn't take anything seriously...well as serious as you can take a movie made in HW! I don't feel it came together well at all!!! Affleck's worst movie! It just wasn't good guys and you will not be missing much by giving this a miss!

25 January 2015,"Great story, but disappointing rest","The movie started off great. An engineer(Ben Affleck) completes very high-paid tasks and jobs for various employers, but after he is finished, his memory becomes erased, and now he gets an assignment for two, maybe three years. After that time, he doesn't get his promised 90 million and he is getting chased by hit men. A very imaginative story left a very promising impression for the rest of the movie. But, no,that was pretty misleading. After the first great 30 minutes, the movie just becomes an ordinary action film with the story in the background. All in all not a bad movie, but could have been much, much better.

25 December 2003,"Decent, but not great","Paycheck, the film version of Phillip k. Dick's short story is a decent film. Like most PKD stories, it explores rather profound ideas and questions of inevitability and the meaning of existence, but the screenplay has too many holes and the plot needs polishing. John Woo did a great job in making up for a lot of this by making a superbly directed film, but it seem that at every turn Affleck's acting was in the way. Rigid and Lifeless, Affleck does not portray his character well at all. Take for example his interactions with Uma Thurman - was he even 'present?' Anyway, overall a decent film, although i would wait for the DVD version.

19 July 2004,Entertaining 2 hours with interesting plot. Worth watching.,"The good:This is not a masterpiece of a movie, but I decided long ago that the value of movies was just entertainment. So despite some minor flaws my wife and I had a thoroughly good time watching this movie. The ideas this movie talks about are not new, but have very interesting implications and spark off one's imagination/ interest. There are plenty of those moments here.

The bad:In the party scene Ben's lines were just too plain stupid for even a moderately intelligent guy, especially when he is trying to portray a careful planner of one's own future.Not the actor's fault here but Keanu Reeves would fit Ben Afflick's role better. Uma did a good job for the limited exposure she had. The bad guy looks a bit stale to be honest. We have here a movie that tells a very interesting story but has under-developed characters. I would say 2-3 more weeks of script/ story review would do a better job.

Anyway, Overall: entertaining movie worth renting

5 November 2004,The Best film of 2003!,"I've bought this movie and I thought this movie was the best film of the year. Ben Affleck was great in this movie. This movie had a lot of action. It is so cool. My favorite director John Woo once again at his best for action movies. He directed one of my all time favorites ""Broken Arrow"" and ""Face off"". He's a genius. People think about the movie, but we got to think about the director because he or she is the one who directed the movie. You don't thank the actor or actresses because of the movie. You thank the director. I say this is the best action movie of all time. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves action movies because this is the right one. I give this movie a A+ or 10/10.

Further more I found that Ben Affleck mastered two new facial expression, witch accounted the previous ones..now he can say to have a total of 4 looks.. Still not enough to be able to act!!! Uma Thurman came as a surprise to see her so worn out and performing so poorly in her part

This movie was one of the best I have ever seen because it was so bad and yet I laughed so hard at it that it became a classic. The same thing happened when I saw Tomb Raider II. I can't explain it really...it was just something else. I loved plastic Ben Affleck, that was my absolute favorite. Movies that suck like this are diamonds in the rough.

10 January 2009,An Excellent Action/sci-fi/ Thriller for you to Enjoy,"Please Ignore other users comments on this film (as they are bullshit). It is an excellent action/thriller/sci-fi film which will glue you to your seats till the end. You can watch over & over again and you will not be bored. You will simply love every action sequence this film has to offer, the camera angles, environment, ambiance will just mesmerize you and take you to a roller-coaster ride. I don't know what is up with the other IMDb users, with all their stupid comments about this film. In my opinion most of the ratings of films I see here are wrong. The Dark Knight (2008) which is 6-7 rated film gets a much higher score (Rigged ????). So trust me !!!! - Go rent a DVD or something and you will not regret this.

27 December 2003,"Rest easy, Phillip K. Dick fans, they did a good job.","I love the original story that this movie is based on but had some deep reservations after seeing the trailer, with all the action scenes and Ben Afflick cast as the engineer and John Woo directing. However, I came out having seen the best performance Afflick has given all year and seeing that John Woo is able to direct Sci-Fi.

There are numberous changes from the original story but so was the case with Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Screamers and most of the changes worked for the better. Although there was no fight scenes in the original Paycheck story and the engineer was no athlete the stuff pulled off here is quite believable.

Overall, I'm happy to see that Paycheck ended up being a very enjoyable film rather than the train wreck I had feared.

30 December 2003,Could have been better,"This movie is OK. The acting could be better, the storyline is great, but it seemed like poor attempt by John Woo to make a cool Jerry Bruckheimer movie. The best thing I like about this movie is it's originality, and it's also a very smart movie, really makes you think. If your looking for a refreshing new story instead of the samething thats been done a thousand times then you should see this movie.

Dick, the same author of Total Recall and Minority Report. But I was reluctant because the star was Ben Affleck, who hasn't exactly had a good track record recently. (He failed to shine in Sum of All Fears, and let's not mention Gigli.)

But as the film progressed I was really drawn in. The presentation was good, it showed a world that did not look futuristic unlike Minority Report, but it showcased the new technologies that would be important to the film's plot. Of most importance was the ability to erase one's memory.

The main character, played by Ben Affleck, stuggles to discover his past after losing his memory of the past three years. He is confronted with problems involving his money as well as the government. Eventually he finds himself being pursued by both the FBI and the company he last worked for, Allcom. He carries with him an envelope full of items, which are all that is left of his forgotten past. Could these items be a clue to what happened to him in the past three years? As the movie progresses you will find out.

I said in the title that I like the movie for what it is: an action film. While the theme of the movie could be a bit cliche (it involves the prediction of the future just like Minority Report,) Paycheck makes up for it with its suspensful and fun action scenes. This movie is for the car-chase and gunfight lovers in all of us.

Finally, the movie becomes quite thought-provoking at the end, just like all the other Philip K. Dick stories. The theme is similar to Minority Report, because they both discuss what would happen if we were able to predict the future. This is cliche among sci-fi flicks, yes, but it still made me think about that and technology in general, too.",
26 December 2003,Not a bad idea,"This movie had a really good idea for a movie but didn't deliver on the writing or carrying out such a fine idea. They should have played more to how he picked each item to help him rather then trying to remember the girl. Not a bad idea just sort of missed my entertainment marks.

1 January 2004,Good Movie,"Well, I could care less about character development or what was left out of the original short story. This was a good movie to watch for one reason alone: It kept me guessing! I can usually guess endings or various outcomes of the different subplots in movies along the way, but I couldn't get anything right with this one. That is what made the movie exciting for me, and although I don't particulary care for Uma, I enjoyed the movie so much I could care less who was playing the part. 8+ points

26 December 2003,It is OK,"I think the movie is alright. Not bad and not the best of John Woo's movies. The story is not that convincing. How would you expect people to believe the machine can predict the future. My co-workers think it is hard to follow/understand, but they like the action. My girlfriend likes it more than Minority Report. I give this film 8 out of 10 stars.

27 December 2003,It's not that bad.,"There seem to be alot of negative comments about this film. It's really not as bad as some have portrayed it- it is NOT the story that Mr. Dick wrote, rather it is a movie based on the principles in Mr. Dick's short story. If you can seperate the two you will have a decent experience with the film. If you are a fanboy, don't bother.

The acting is nothing memorable and the direction seems a bit heavy handed. The storyline keeps the movie interesting, however it feels like there's a bit too much action- I guess one should expect that going to see a Woo film, but let's remember that Affleck and Thurman are portraying an engineer and a biologist. Not saying that scientists can't be action heroes, but they do seem to be a bit too tough for a couple of pencil pushers.

All in all it's not that bad. 2 out of 5.

11 January 2004,good sci-fi story,"Philip K Dick wrote many stories which seemed to have great film potential. I never thought of this as one of them.

I have seen Ben Affleck in a number of films, and felt that he was good in a few, OK in most, and positively annoying in some.

I saw the horrible, misleading trailers.

The soundtrack was simply bad.

So, needless to say, I went into Paycheck with very low expectations.... and I was pleasantly surprised.

Affleck plays a talented reverse-engineer, who sees the possibilities in new technology, and is able to carry it through to fruition. He takes on top-secret jobs and has his memory erased upon the completion of each. He decides to take on a project big and profitable enough to allow him to retire comfortably for the rest of his life. He completes the project, goes through the memory erasure, and then starts to discover what he has done, and, pursued by corporate hit men and the police, tries to recover his memory. Uma Thurmond, a biologist he had fallen in love with, is one of the memories he wants to recover, and also a target.

Paycheck is more of an action film than a sci fi flick. The plot serves the action, as do the somewhat one-dimensional characters. And there is so little chemistry between Affleck and Thurmond that the romantic subplot is almost just a distraction. Despite these flaws, I spent an evening being thoroughly entertained by this rehashing of the usual technology-run-amok / knowledge-is-power story. This film is very Hollywood, and uses a lot of slick and clich√©d camera-work, but nevertheless tells a good story and does it well enough.",10
13 August 2004,Enjoy it!,"I just watched Paycheck and was catapulted to an unexpected level of enjoyment as the story progressed--beyond the typical rush of an action movie. Let me simply say that if you are a Hitchcock fan, you WILL enjoy this movie.

Woo used some very old methods to create his story. No kung foo, just good old fist-fighting. No flashy costumes, just good old threads. No CGI, just good old stunt work.

At one point I could not help but to think how much Affleck reminded me of Jimmy Stewart in ""North by Northwest."" Then I thought I saw a small nod to ""The Birds"" and ""Vertigo"". I will let you figure out how ""Psycho"" fits into the scheme . . . I don't know how intentional Woo was in doing all this, but I think Hitchcock would have enjoyed ""Paycheck.""

These things roped me into watching the movie beyond just what was presented on the screen--a very good film. Easy on the language, not overly sexed, lots of action.

1 May 2004,The last John Woo movie I'll ever watch!,"That's it, this is the last John Woo directed movie that I am ever going to watch. You thought ""Face Off"" was bad? ""Paycheck"" is even worse. At least ""Face Off"" had somewhat good acting from Travolta's part. The whole movie is useless action and nothing else. There is no development of the characters, no plausible storyline, and the special effects look like cartoons aimed at 13 year old kids. And the story? Well, I'll let someone else try figuring it out... if they can. If you want to watch an intellectually engaging movie, then John Woo is not for you. And if you want to see an action movie, at least watch one that has good special effects. ""Paycheck"" is simply terrible.

4 August 2004,How omniscient is he ?,"By means of this machine Michael Jennings is granted a god-like state of existence within a limited amount of time(the period stipulated by his contract).

Like a higher power he works in mysterious ways to influence mortal Michael's life---but a course,it is up to the mortal to put the signs together and act as the god Michael watches over.But how omniscient is god Michael? He is only a demigod, an union of man and machine , be it an almost magical machine based on counter- intuitive quantum workings. How long did trial and error take ? How many virtual Michaels fail?
