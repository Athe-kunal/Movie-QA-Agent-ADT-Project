11 May 2023,rise and fall of crackberry,"Greetings again from the darkness. There aren't too many companies who have reached the pinnacle of their industry, only to later flop due to lack of innovation or a stubborn insistence on holding on to the past. Tremendous success and absolute failure are not typically associated with the same company. Blockbuster Video and Pan Am Airlines come to mind as examples of industry leaders whose refusal to adapt, culminated with closure, and it's likely that Blackberry belongs in the category, at least as presented here by writer-director Matt Johnson and co-writer Matthew Miller, adapting the book by Jacquie McNish.

Socially awkward pals, Mike Lazaridis (played by Jay Baruchel) and Doug Fregin (played by the film's director Matt Johnson), co-founded Research in Motion (RIM). The film picks up in 1996 when Mike and Doug are making their first presentation of their breakthrough handheld data delivery-email machine, which they have named Pocket Link. These are two genius nerds with no concept of how the outside business worlds functions, and the executive to whom they are pitching is so distracted that his only feedback is, ""You need a new name."" In a fascinating twist, that same executive, Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton, ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"") ends up saving not just the new product, but also the company.

Balsillie presents himself as a fireball, take charge, full-steam-ahead kind of guy. It's quite a contrast to nerdy Mike and easy-going Doug. Mike is a quiet guy committed to perfection in his work, while Doug wrangles the tech developers with a culture of video games, movie night, and an overall fraternity environment. Balsillie's arrival as a vocal outrage expert and brash businessman changes everything, and he and Mike drive the newly named BlackBerry to levels not previously seen. We do get a humorous anecdote from a shirt stain (even though it's not a true story), and in fact, there is quite a bit of humor throughout.

We are informed that the film was ""inspired by real people and real events"", so some dramatic license is expected. Perhaps the best comparison is THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010), and while that film was more polished, I personally found this one more entertaining and accurate from a business sense. An excellent supporting cast includes Cary Elwes, Saul Rubinek, Michael Ironside, Martin Donovan, Rich Sommer, and SungWon Cho, and the film's real draw is the contrast between Jay Baruchel's mousy but brilliant Mike, and Glenn Howard's powerhouse portrayal of the egotistical Balsillie. Baruchel's scene where he reacts to the new iPhone is alone worth the price of admission.

At its peak, BlackBerry had 45% market share and had earned it's ""CrackBerry"" label in the business world. Apple's 2007 introduction of the iPhone not only rocked the BlackBerry company, it shook up the world. The Canada perspective is noted (RIM was based in Waterloo, Ontario), as is Mike's aversion to 'made in China', perhaps the ultimate reason for the fall. It's likely that BlackBerry has become a Case Study in Business Schools, although the fast-paced and pressure-packed world of tech continues to require a balance of decisions focused on current markets and never-ending innovation for the future.

3 June 2023,Great docufilm.,"Aside from the constant annoying fast zoom-ins and shaky cam ""The Office"" style filming - which I can't stand, this was one heck of an enjoyable film. The two hour runtime flew by with the excellent pacing and the smooth cohesive and well-written screenplay. Jay Baruchel nailed his character with an all around great performance, as did Glenn Howerton. For that matter, all casting and performances were spot on, as was the cinematography and score. The story was mind-blowing, even if you never owned a BlackBerry, just to see a slice of Steve Jobs as the Canadian version of a small start-up becoming a world dominating tech empire, and that empire's fall from grace.

12 May 2023,One Hell of a Story,"Films about the making of a product can either be interesting or dull. In my opinion, there's not a lot of room in between because it was either a good story or not. In the case of Blackberry, I was obviously aware of the phone but never knew the behind-the-scenes stuff. I'm also slightly biased being a Canadian, with this film taking place very close to where I'm from, so if that makes you take this review with a grain of salt, so be it. I absolutely loved it from start to finish and here's why.

Blackberry tells the story of Mike Lazaridis (Jay Baruchel) and his genius mind that creates the world's first smartphone, the Blackberry.

Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton) steps in and buys his way into being the Co-CEO of the company in order to sell the phone. Balsillie is determined to shoot for the moon and nothing else, which in turn may or may not hurt the company overall. If you know the story, you know what I mean, but I won't ruin it. My favourite thing about watching this film though was the fact that I didn't know half of what went down in real life. This was a riveting and engaging lesson of school that I felt like a sat through.

Adapted from the novel by Matthew Miller and Matt Johnson (who also did a fantastic job directing this film), the dialogue here was stellar. I was glued to the screen, even when two characters were just sitting in a room and talking. I'm not saying this film is as great as The Social Network, but the story itself is in my opinion. It's a fascinating tale of the dog-eat-dog world that we live in. On top of the fantastic dialogue, Baruchel and Howerton sell these roles and probably each delivers the performances of their careers (especially Howerton).

From the editing style that genuinely impressed me to the great direction, performances, and even music choices, Blackberry is a film that I have little to no complaints about. The camera work with all the snap zooms annoyed me a bit, but that's really all I can nitpick. I also give it props for being a Canadian film, made by Canadians, starring some Canadian actors. I would also be remiss if I didn't mention the fact that while the story is very interesting, it's also funny when it needs to be. It almost becomes a satire at times and I loved it even more for that. It took the story seriously, but not exactly the movie around it, which worked so well. If you can't tell, I'll be gushing about this one for a while. I highly recommend checking out Blackberry, now playing in theatres.",10
4 June 2023,Can biographies be fast-paced? Here's the answer! [+77%],"Between this, Air, and Tetris, I think this one takes the cake. The central performances (Jay Baruchel & Glenn Howerton) are fantastic, and both manage to captivate us with their distinct mannerisms and quirks. The story itself is very compellingly told, with details covered from multiple angles, including business, tech, marketing, employee relations, and more. There's no question that Hollywood loves discussing corporate wins and losses (well, mostly wins) and BlackBerry is certainly among the finest I've seen. Howerton (playing Jim Balsillie) is at his best when he loses his cool, throwing temper tantrums at almost everyone, including contemporaries, executives, and even private jet pilots. The rise and fall of BlackBerry was always going to be an exciting story, and director Matt Johnson does an excellent job with the material in hand.

14 May 2023,The Story of the Worlds First Smartphone,"The phone was nicknamed ""Crackberry"" - due to its addictive quality ... (an omen of the future of smartphones). Here, people loved the clicking of the mini keyboard and the blinking ""new messages"" light. It was the rage of Wall Street, Fortune 500 companies government leaders and had dedicated fans ranging from Obama to Katy Perry to Kim Kardashian.

It was with this fascination that I watched ""Blackberry"". I wanted to know how did all of this get started and by whom? Well, the movie didn't disappoint - I'd have never guessed the people behind it and wild ride they had.

The story is brisk and the characters have radically different personalities. The latter made it interesting given that they all thrown together in an increasingly high-pressure environment. My favorite character was the comic-sidekick Doug Fregin (cofounder) - he reminds me of Jonah Hill. It also turns out that he's the co-writer and director of the film itself.

One thing I didn't immediately recognize was that the tech wiz / boy-wonder (Mike Lazaridis) was played by Jay Baruchel. He was the voice behind the lead character in How to Train Your Dragon. It was perfect casting.

Blackberry is definitely worth a watch if the subject matter interests you. It's yet another movie demonstrating that real-life events can be just as captivating as pure fiction itself. It joins the ranks of other great tech stories inspired by true events: The Dropout (Theranos / Elizabeth Holmes), We Crashed (WeWork), Super Pumped (Uber), and Tetris (the game).",
13 June 2023,Best of the Three 1980s Pop Culture Movies,"There happen to be three movies out right now telling the story behind a piece of 1980s pop culture. ""Air"" is about the founding of the Air Jordan brand at Nike; ""Tetris"" is about the battle over licensing for one of the most famous games in history; and ""Blackberry"" is about the mega-success and eventual obsoletion of a piece of technology that was undermined by Apple.

Of the three, ""Blackberry"" is the best. Sharp writing and direction from Matt Johnson, who also happens to turn in a terrific performance as the moral conscience of the company behind the famous hand-held device, turns this movie into a juicy and intensely entertaining story about corporate ego and competing visions. Jay Baruchel and Glenn Howerton also give outstanding performances, and the whole thing makes for one of the most entertaining movies I've seen yet this year.

And even though I've been using an iPhone for years, nothing has made me appreciate the brilliance of Steve Jobs' invention as much as this movie, which shows why it absolutely blew the Blackberry out of the water.

17 May 2023,A cautionary tale for tech companies,"BlackBerry is a 2023 film that tells the story of the rise and fall of the BlackBerry smartphone. The film is funny, heartwarming, and ultimately tragic.

The film is funny because it captures the quirks and eccentricities of the people who made BlackBerry a success. Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie are two brilliant but irritable men who are determined to make their company a success. They are constantly bickering and arguing.

The film is also heartwarming because it shows the passion and dedication of the people who worked at BlackBerry. They were all committed to making the best possible product, and they were willing to work long hours and make sacrifices to achieve their goals.

However, the film is ultimately tragic because it shows how BlackBerry was unable to adapt to the changing marketplace. The company was slow to innovate, and it was eventually overtaken by Apple and Samsung.

Despite its tragic ending, BlackBerry is a well-made film that is sure to entertain and enlighten audiences. The film is funny, heartwarming, and thought-provoking. It is a must-see for anyone who is interested in the history of technology or the human condition.

Doug is the real winner in BlackBerry because he is the only one who is able to see the writing on the wall. He knows that BlackBerry is in trouble, and he tries to warn Mike and Jim. However, they are too blinded by their own success to listen. Doug is eventually forced to leave the company, but he is able to start his own successful business.

BlackBerry is a cautionary tale about the dangers of hubris. It is a reminder that even the most successful companies can fall from grace if they are not willing to adapt to change.",
14 June 2023,In depth story about why Blackberry collapsed,"Blackberry (2023)

I remember the days when everyone in school was using Blackberries with the cool keyboards and their BBM service. The company was ruling the market and no one could have imagined that one day not only will they lose its leadership position, but it will cease to exist altogether. The general consensus is that Blackberry became obsolete because the company failed to catch up to the smartphones and evolve in a correct way. This film tells a more complete version of the story in terms of what happened behind closed doors and the reason why everything came crashing down.

The movie begins in the 90s with a Canadian company named Research in Motion trying to reinvent the mobile phone business. Their two leaders Mike and Doug have a bright vision and the scientific know-how but lack the business acumen to make their idea a reality. During one of their pitches, a man named Jim gets intrigued by their idea and decides to come on board and help get the company off the ground. As the movie progresses, we get to see both the human and the business elements of the story and how closely they come together to both build Blackberry and destroy it.

This is clearly a low budget movie but it never feels second rate because of the clean and efficient way in which it tells this large story. The actors and director are rather unknown and because of that, more focus is put towards the narrative and its execution. With that being said, everyone involved puts in the effort to bring drama, humor and tension to their roles. The quick, sharp and witty nature makes it feel like a mix between Social Network and Succession as the film doesn't waste a single minute and ends when it's supposed to. Blackberry might be gone but hopefully this film will shed some light and teach a couple of lessons to those who watch it.

7 June 2023,The Golden Gods rage knows no bounds!,"Watching these movies about the crazy cutthroat businesses of the 80s and 90s is very entertaining. This movie was great, well acted, fast paced and fun throughout. I myself grew up during the time of the Blackberry but didn't know anything about their story, so this was a fascinating look into how crazy the tech world was at the time.

The real gem of the entire movie though was the Golden God himself, Glen Howerton. I've been a fan of Always Sunmy and I'm always interested in what the cast does outside of that show. I havnt seen Glen in a serious role yet but he delivered. In Always Sunny Glen plays a sociopath who is constantly getting angry, you could tell that in Blackberry he was able to use that for his character. Glen was by far the best part of this movie, funny and intimidating all at the same time.

3 June 2023,Fast Paced Darkish Comedy,"It's a dark comedy of sorts. Not fully dark, but well done all around. Casting was great, especially Glen Howerton as the maniac CEO. Plays the part well, couldn't help but laugh at certain scenes because he's just like angry Dennis from Always Sunny.

It's a cool story too, about the rise and epic fall of the CrackBerry. If you're a bit older you'll remember well when the iPhone came out and destroyed the entire industry. I didn't know some of the things that happen besides that, so learned something too.

Overall it's a fast paced, fun little ride. It's a little too long and there's some poor character acting from the ""geek coders"", that's overwrought, but doesn't really impact the overall film. I already recommended to my buddy. 6.7/10.

2 June 2023,The Grape of Wrath...,"There's a rather angry man by name of Jim, expecting others to dance to, his latest whim, can get quite shouty if confronted, he'll ensure you are affronted, has a fury that can't be contained by rim. But he's managed to create a new black gold, taking gullible and naïve to a mould, casting out a new tech giant, though it's not quite all compliant, the board of keys has broken ground, and taken hold. Alas like all technology there is a trend, and in this case it's closely linked to a u-bend, as the stock goes down the pan, the innovation had no plan, to evolve and to compete, as Jobs transcends.

It's worth a watch, and may get you thinking of all those brands of the past that now reside in the graveyard of complacent, missed opportunity.

20 April 2023,"Entertaining, fun docudrama","Without knowing the history of Blackberry, outside its spectacular crash, I found this movie very entertaining and informative. It's not a documentary, so everything needs to be taken with the proverbial grain of salt. That being said, there were many parts of the Blackberry story, including Research in Motions technical innovations that predated the iPhone by almost a decade.

Jay Barucshel and Matthew Johnson were both wonderful in a corporate Ying-and-Yang relationship, though Johnson steals the show with his irreverence and comedy. Glenn Howerton was a bit disarming as corporate tough guy Jim Balsille. Together, the three drive the story from its lowest points to its dizzying heights.

Overall a fun entertaining picture, that may not be completely accurate, but for those who don't know the details, it won't detract from the story.

3 June 2023,Cinematic mediocrity,"Despite all the rave reviews, for me this film was mediocre at best. The characters were one-dimensional, the actors did a lot of scenery chewing without generating much interest in the story, the script was facile and superficial, the camera work was typical of low-budget productions with lots of protracted jerky hand-held shots. Ultimately, I found it difficult to empathize with any of the characters (I could never get past the thought that I was watching actors), and eventually I lost interest in the outcome altogether. Which is a shame actually, because there is a fascinating story buried in this misfire. Better attention to the script and casting, and better production values, might have helped. But I think this is one instance where a well-made documentary, with interviews, archival footage, etc. Might be a better way to tell the story.

5 June 2023,This is how biographies should be made,"I think biographies get a bad reputation because so many of them set out trying to win Oscars. So often they are painfully bland and uninspired, and I know for me at least it has made the genre much less appealing. 'Blackberry' however was an extremely refreshing experience. This movie doesn't feel like it's trying to win any Oscars (although it deserves to in a lot of departments). It just feels like it wants to tell a true story in the most entertaining way possible.

It would've been so easy to tell this story in a bland and forgettable way. The movie never takes the easy way out though and gets every drop out of every scene. There wasn't a single moment in the 2 hour runtime where I became bored.

The film is funny, well-paced, well -acted and has terrific dialogue in every scene. This one was a fun watch. 8.5/10.

13 May 2023,Interesting but dizzying,"This is the story of the rise and (the beginning of) the fall of Research in Motion, maker of the Blackberry. It shows the hothouse atmosphere of technology sales, by co-CEO Jim Balsille, who took over the business end, and sold machine that did not yet exist. It also shows the equally busy atmosphere of the developers, like lead developer and co-CEO Mike Lazaridis, and various other young folks, many of whom tended to give off a frat boy vibe.

It was informative, and I hope mostly true overall. The actors were believable in their roles. The hubris of dismissing the iphone, the distraction of Balisille chasing an NHL franchise, and the false economy of contracting out manufacturing all contributed to the demise of the company.

However, I got dizzy. Maybe the director wanted to emphasize the chaos, by having the camera repeatedly pan quickly left or right, to create a sense of motion,, but that did not sit well with me. So you are warned.",6
28 May 2023,Flying Too Near The Sun,"It's a movie about the quick rise and sudden fall of Research in Motion, the Canadian company which invented the Smart Phone, Told as a sequences of crises, its two main players are Jay Baruchel as Mike Lazaridis, an obsessive-compulsive wimp who actually knows what he is talking about when it comes to building computers, and Glenn Howerton as Jim Balsillie, a loud-mouthed businessman with a degree from Harvard, who recognizes that, and is happy to bs his way through everything. At its peak, the company had a market capitalization of almost $70 billion dollars. Then Steve Job came in and did the same thing in a package that was better designed and offered telephone companies not just user minutes, but data transfer, and it all went away overnight -- according to this movie, anyway.

There's no one to root for here, with the engineers, as Michael Ironside, the shouty man brought in to bring some discipline to the company notes, a bunch of children, Howerton thoroughly unlikable, and so forth. Cary Elwes has a sizable role as a smarmy competitor.

Like many movies about business, this one is pretty shaky with the facts. Likewise, other than ""don't think you're irreplaceable"" there doesn't seem to be much of a point to this movie. It's largely carried on the noisy performances, with Howerton's increasingly out-of-control Balsillie pretty interesting, if annoying.",5
6 June 2023,Entertaining but inaccurate,"Once upon a time Blackberry dominated the business phone market, especially in the US, while Motorola dominated the personal phone market, and Nokia the international market. Along came the iPhone and pushed them off the, with none of these companies adapting well to the introduction of the iPhone given that it was only projected to take 5% of worldwide phone sales initially and many people questioned that it would do that.

But this movie doesn't tell this story. Instead it crams complex engineering and corporate development stories into little vignettes, ignores the many much more popular options to the iPhone, acts like everyone knew the iPhone was going to overtake the the world. Then ultimately fails to tell the story of the inability to adapt. In fact Nokia had been providing phones with Internet and downloadable apps years before the iPhone, but only the Japanese were really smart enough to do that.

But what they fail to tell us about the failure to adapt is that it impacted on everyone. For Blackberry, they would have had to redevelop their product from scratch and it was too inflexible. While Nokia failed to adapt from management, Blackberry just wasn't able to adapt. Even trying to move their secure email platform from hardware to software so it could become an iPhone app proved impossible.

It is okay, this movie is entertaining enough, though starts off slow, fails to introduce or build the key characters at the beginning, and the ending is too forced.

Could have been a good series or a better shorter movie. Especially given the camera style and content, it is not worth seeing in the movie theatre.",6
29 May 2023,Like a History Channel Documentary - Watch on TV,"Reel Tunez, The Radio Show All About the Movies review (5/29/23): ""Blackberry""

If you like historic movies about technology.. movies that feel like a documentary or History Channel movie... then this is for you.

This is the true story of the meteoric rise and catastrophic demise of the world's first smartphone. At one time, 45% of the smart phones in use where Blackberry.. and now is about 0%.

Either the people at this company were the biggest nerds ever.. and goofballs.. or the movie was highly exaggerated. Lead actors were Jay Baruchel, Glenn Howerto, & Matt Johnson (who really, in my opinion, was cartoonish in his acting). It was fun to see Cary Elwes in this as well. You remember him from ""The Princess Bride"" as Westley.

Visually, this movie is fine on a TV screen at home as it lacks ""big screen appeal"". Audio is fine on a home TV or stereo (as even that doesn't merit the quality of Dolby Theater sound).

A dry movie that could be ""tightened up"" with better editing (some scenes were ""beating the dead horse"" over and over and dredged on. On a 1 to 10 scale with 10 being the best, I'd give it about a 5.5. I consider anything over a 5 having some merit to see.. and less that 5 is a waste of time. In my opinion the reviews are greatly over-rating this movie. When people rate something like this a 9 or 10, you really wonder what a REAL classic movie would rate??",6
13 May 2023,Keyboard to Touchscreen,"I remember BlackBerry vanishing from the face of the tech world, but never having owned one I didn't know the reason why. Very interesting docudrama about the phone's inception, rise, and fall leading into the smartphone era that we know today. The cinematography reminded me of a cross between The Social Network and Halt and Catch Fire, focusing on the intensity of character driven moments. Remarkable acting by Jay Baruchel and Glenn Howerton, complete powerhouse performances. It was great seeing these two actors in such a prominent film, as both of their backgrounds generally revolve around comedy. Absolutely a movie worth seeing, grab a ticket and enjoy the techno historical drama.

22 May 2023,Delightfully clever and funny look at BlackBerry's quick rise and even quicker demise,"As ""Blackberry"" (2023 release from Canada; 119 min.) opens, we are reminded that this is ""inspired by releas people and real events in Waterloo, Ontario"". It is ""1996"" and two nerds, co-founders of an outfit called Research In Motion, strike a deal with Jim Balsillie, a failed company executive, to become RIM's Co-CEO. So as to commercialize a gadget called PocketLink. At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.

Couple of comments: this movie is the latest from Canadian director Matt Johnson (""Operation Avalanche""). Here he looks back at the amazing rise of Research In Motion and its BlackBerry line of products, and RIM's even more astonishing demise. The movie is toughly split up in 2 parts (the rise; the demise), and is reminiscent of movies like ""The Social Network"" and ""Steve Jobs"". There is a lot of humor (more black than anything else), and these 2 hours just flew by. If there is one downside, it is the relentless hand-held camera work that is just irritating after a while. But in the end, ths movie's script is very strong, and this is one of the best movies of 2023 so far this year. (As an aside, I was one of those ""crackBerries"" and held on to my BlackBerry Bold until it literally stopped working. I was appalled and baffled by the utter disaster that was the Blackberry Storm, and finally gave in to the 'dark side', the iPhone.)

""BlackBerry"" premiered earlier this year at the Berlin film festival , to immediate cortical acclaim. There is good reason why this is currently rated 98% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie was released in limited US cities the weekend of May 12, and now is being rolled out. ""BlackBerry"" opened at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait the check it out. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attend so-so (I counted about 20 people). As word of mouth gets around, I can see this having strong legs at the indie art-house theater circuit. If you are in the mood for a top notch movie about a legendary product going bus in no time, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",8
27 March 2023,Darkly comedic and fun!,"I never knew the story of BlackBerry to this depth, and this movie portrays that very well with its dark comedy and anxiety-inducing writing! It does a very good job of showing how the IPhone destroyed the BlackBerry.

Performances from Glenn Howerton and Jay Baruschel were absolutely surreal, considering they are both comedic actors at heart. Had the pleasure of seeing this at a film festival, and I'm glad I did. This movie is meant to be seen with an audience, a big one. I will definitely be following Matt Johnson's career from here on out. Love this movie and can't wait for it to come out on streaming!

16 June 2023,The Rise and Fall of a Tech Icon,"One of the most popular and ubiquitous technological gadgets at the start of the millennium, BlackBerry was THE phone to have. The first smartphone and a status symbol the item rang on everyone's ears during its heyday. I never owned one but it sure made its presence known. ""BlackBerry"" is a riveting cinematic account of the dramatic rise and fall of the tech giant. Chronicling in fast and wobbly detail the story of a bunch of true-blue dorks in Waterloo, Ontario who created the first smartphone to the company's sad and pitiful collapse as competition and the long arm of the law finally caught up with them. The stellar cast and brisk pace of the film keep the viewer on edge as the panorama of corporate rooms, wires and interpersonal human relationships unfold. One of the best films of the year this is one every film fan shouldn't miss.

14 May 2023,"Cruel, real, funny, and poignant.","I add a disclaimer here: I worked in Silicon Valley for over thirty years building and designing designing stuff from Fibre Optics, to Atari stuff, and aerospace prototypes, and molds and fixtures for the lightning-fast evolution of pushing out the latest products before the next guy did. Also am a Canadian so the touches on Canadian culture are right on, even word pronunciation here and there LOL.

Jim Baiselle (played by Glen Hamilton) nails it. I met many just like him, all ruthlessly leveraging the focused genius of technicians for market appeal and to nail down investors.

My wife, not usually interested by nuts and bolts (and solder suckers) of tech but knows tactical office politics very well, was laughing. I never had blackberry but have had a few with buttons. And of course now iPhones are our devices of choice. But although the Blackberry is gone, the film is important and is a masterpiece of depiction of the spawning beds of mobile phone culture as we know it now. I think too it bears thinking about as the rush for the next best thing-AI-bursts upon us.",10
22 May 2023,A Satisfying Recount of Waterloo's Former Titan of Tech and Possibly an Even Better Movie,"Movies about rise and fall business stories have a certain sheen. They usually come with large budgets and top shelf production design but one of my favourite things about BlackBerry is that it's more grounded and grimier. The levels that Laziridis and Balsillie rose to were unheard of but their beginnings were modest. The movie don't gloss over how disorganized and unprofessional the original Research in Motion team was. They started out in an office where you had to build your own desk and that you couldn't use the office internet and the landline phone at the same time. If the movie is to be believed, they assembled the original prototype out of strewn about parts and slapped together micro-processor components. I assume there's some dramatic licence being taken here but even if it's relatively close... Jeez! But this choice makes the characters more relatable and easier to empathize with. Unlike Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg, I wanted to see Mike Lazaridis succeed and despite his abrasive personality, I couldn't help but admire Jim Balsillie's tenacity and his sheer force of will. The creative team does a marvellous job of humanizing the parties involved in a way that not every movie would take the time to do.

The cast features a lot of talent that you are familiar with but may not recognize right away. I want to start with my favourite performance, the hottest take I have about this movie is that I think Glenn Howerton's performance as Jim Balsillie should garner awards consideration. He's phenomenal as the the angry and intense Co-CEO. I found him so believable as a magnetic salesman and a tyrannical co-worker. He commanded the screen in every scene he was in and he blew me away. Jay Baruchel is appropriately passive yet sweet playing the shy Mike Laziridis. He's funny in his flustered comedic mannerisms as the obviously brilliant but flawed Co-CEO. I've never seen Baruchel play this kind of part but I thought his work was compelling even if he doesn't actually look much like the real Mike. Matt Johnson's work as a director is exceptional here but his performance is underrated as the goofy but loyal Doug. I didn't like his character at first but I was continually impressed by Johnson's choices in portraying this overactive man-child (I don't know if the real guy was portrayed accurately, this is how the character is presented). Saul Rubinek, Michael Ironside and Rich Sommer are all fun in their supporting roles. I normally like Cary Elwes but if someone came across as a little too goofy to be believable, it was his performance as Palm Pilot's CEO Carl Yankowski.

I agree with the critics in that Blackberry starts out as a darker-tinged comedy about a group of lovable underdogs who created something revolutionary and changed the world. I laughed a lot in the beginning and you celebrate RIMs wins along the way as the movie zips from scene to scene. But there wasn't a happy ending for the BlackBerry team in real life and when it comes time for the turn, there's quite the emotional gut-punch. I think the movie handles the drama surrounding RIM's fall from grace superbly (even if there's some meandering from the facts) and I couldn't help but feel sorry for guys like Mike L, Doug and even Jim to a lesser extent. The company boasted brilliant engineers and businessmen but they missed the boat after their meteoric rise and their egos got in the way of their ability to forecast the future of the smartphone. BlackBerry gleefully bounces along with the victories but deftly pauses to reflect when the party's over. The final scene with Mike obsessively trying to fix one of the BlackBerry Storms shipped in from China is very poignant and underscores how tragic RIM's decline was (at least to me).

I do have a personal connection to this story, I was going to school in the area in 2007 when RIM had hit it's peak. Everyone wanted internships there, they played the market with RIM's stock and we all dreamed of a bright future for the company. But RIM couldn't see the forest through the trees and while they still exist today, their importance has all but completely faded away. BlackBerry isn't just your average rise and fall business film, it's got a lot of heart, an underrated cast and a surprisingly funny script that isn't afraid to show the consequences of when giant egos get in the way of progress. I really enjoyed this movie, it's an easy recommend and I'd happily give it an 8.5/10 rounding up to a 9/10. If you get a chance to see it in theatres, definitely go, but it's worth checking out on your preferred streaming service if you miss that chance.",9
8 June 2023,"Glenn Howerton, Oscar winner?","I exaggerate as he likely won't be nominated but Howerton's performance is so much fun & electric. Blackberry is a fun encapsulation of the rise and fall of Blackberry phones. I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I did. The pacing is FAST, one of the fastest moving ""biopic"" type movies I've seen, and that aids the film. It keeps you glued with a racing plot, jam packed with nuggets of detail that all pay off later. What I enjoyed most about this movie was Glenn Howerton's performance though. For the people who know him from Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia, this movie catapults a Dennis Reynolds type character into a tech & nerdy filled startup. He captures the feeling of cluelessness that seasoned business professionals would have in such an environment & the eccentric personality of someone like Jim Balsille perfectly.

10 June 2023,Watch It,"I love true stories, this one does not disappoint. It's filmed in a documentary style with a shakey cheap camera, but the story it's telling is great! I loved all of the geeky, nerdy movie and video game references in the film, it was awesome. It was also very funny in many places. The story too is just crazy fascinating. And more than that, watching this as a Canadian, its pretty sweet to understand the movie from a Canadian perspective. I sat in the Waterloo theatre as I watched the film. It's crazy to think it all happened in that little town. They picked a great cast for the movie and delivered it smoothly. Definitely worth the watch if you like true stories and/or documentaries.

13 June 2023,Very Good Movie,"Rating: 8.7 Overall, an extremely entertaining movie that blends multiple genres to create an engaging biopic that tell the story of a famous company where not that much is known about them, with all the cinematic elements of the film coming together to drive the story forward.

Very Good Direction (Really moves the story forward in a unique style as he blends the humor in the more lighter segments and the drama in the more intense segments; Gets the most out of the cast and uses different elements like cinematography and editing to help tell the story and build the tone; really helped embody the engineering culture and the clash between tech and business well throughout the movie), Good Acting (Very Good from Glenn Howerton (Really pulls a lot from the psychopathic elements of Dennis in It's Always Sunny as he is a real commanding force in all the scenes he is in as he portrays a real social climber that is really does not know what he is doing), Good from Jay Baruchel (Shows a real transformation of the character throughout the movie as he transitions from a more social awkward tech-background engineer to a more heartless executive who lost the passion he originally had when going into the business), Pretty Good to Good from Matt Johnson (The real comedic relief of the movie as he breaks a lot of the tension in the scenes he is in), Pretty Good to Good from the rest of the cast (Really embodied their respective roles very well (especially the ones portraying the engineers))), Great Story (Story was laid out very well as it was entertaining to see where the company was going and how far the different character's journeys are taking them; It is uncertain how close this movie was the original source material but as a biopic I think it does a good job in capturing the essence of the rise and fall of Blackberry), Great Screenplay (The dialogue was well written/flowed nicely and jokes were really funny; the symbolism was pretty prevalent throughout the movie (which is pretty unique given the movie is a biopic); the foreshadowing of the downfall of the company is actually well done (though kinda overt towards the end) as it is down through the characters and how they are changing rather than any story elements/symbols), Good to Very Good Score (Really added to the tech feel of the movie), Very Good Cinematography (Though it is a bit amateurish, the guerilla style, shooting shots from different rooms, and the zoom ins really helped add to the scrappy tech start up feel of the movie as well as give comedic relief at times), Sound (), Very Good Editing (Helps give the scrappy feel of the movie and brings it all together), Plot Structure was good for the most part as it does a good job in following the rise and fall of the company (though I would have liked to have seen more time given to the fall as it seems a bit rushed), Pacing was good for the most part as it keeps a pretty steady pace until the end where it seems a bit rushed (I would have liked to have seen 10 minutes from the rise be given to the fall of Blackberry (but keep the same runtime)), Climax was executed very nicely as it really shows how far gone a lot of these characters are as the pressures of a failing company really get to them, Tone was a blend of comedy/tech/drama as it uses all of these different elements to present an entertaining movie, Saw US Premiere at SXSW (One of my favorite movies from SXSW); really captures the tech culture/workplace very well.",8
13 June 2023,Good...but the first act is excellent,"The proof that some stories make sense to be told in two hours and others don't. This is a good movie, but it could have been an excellent movie with an additional 35/40 minutes. The time the film takes and what it does in building up the smartphone concept and the company is phenomenal. Unfortunately, it is only competent when it starts talking about the time at the top and the decline. It feels lacking. It does well in what it does during this phase, but it seems rushed, and we needed a much deeper and more thorough analysis of this period.

Jay Baruchel gives an excellent performance, very consistent and one of the best I've seen from him. Still, the standout star is Glenn Howerton, who should already be part of any awards discussion. I admit that I love roles where one of the protagonists seems like a madman, shouting and insulting everyone and everything, ultimately achieving results. Howerton, just like Messina in Air, is quite convincing in doing so, being entertaining and even bringing an interesting dramatic depth to the character in some small gestures and actions.

The way this is filmed, reminiscent of a documentary, is excellent, and that is just one of the many good things that Matt Johnson does in directing. It's just a pity that this film could have been even greater if there hadn't been a fear of a much longer duration, with more time to develop some relationships and character arcs.",7
14 May 2023,Social Network meets Succession,"It's quaint, looking back on it now, but in the decade before iPhones and Androids, BlackBerry was the smartphone. It was dubbed the ""CrackBerry,"" because of the seemingly addictive hold the sleek gizmo, with its satisfyingly clicky keyboard buttons, had on the market. I was too young to have ever had a BlackBerry myself, but I do remember playing BrickBreaker on my dad's. And it was indeed the coolest thing... at the time. That was all before the release of the iPhone. Once that happened... everything changed.

Now, the BlackBerry is a relic. An also-ran. Or, as one character puts it in BlackBerry, the new movie about the early smartphone empire's rise and fall, it's merely ""the thing people used before they used the iPhone."" But as this fresh, thoughtful comedy makes plain, BlackBerry is more than just a bleak cautionary tale. It's a story of how tech culture, as we know it today, took root, bloomed, and died on the vine.

The story of BlackBerry's rise and fall was too good to not get put on film one day. What I didn't expect was that it would get the full-on Social Network treatment - or moreso, The Social Network if it was directed by the Safdie's! The story is so excitingly told, the performances so watchable, and the dialogue so quotable that it becomes the verbal equivalent of an action flick-kinetic, suspenseful, and sometimes unexpectedly beautiful and weirdly moving. It really plays like an Aaron Sorkin script, and Matt Johnson shows he really has some genuine talent as a filmmaker. The movie plays like a mix of The Social Network, Steve Jobs, Succession, or even more recently, Air and maybe even The Wolf of Wall Street... so if you like any of those movies... I promise you you'll love this! I ate it right up! I'm a sucker for these types of movies, and this was no exception for me! I was locked in right from the very start! Now, I won't say this movie is exactly like all those films, this is like the knowing, bratty B-Side to those. Yeah, these tech bros changed our lives, but they were also total goons. After seeing this, I'd love to see Matt Johnson take a crack at an Elon Musk/Twitter movie someday!

The movie is a darkly comedic, satirical, and intelligent look at the rise and fall of BlackBerry. The most fascinating thing about the script, co-written by Johnson and Matthew Miller, is its structure. It shows us the beginning and end of this story but nothing else. The ellipsis in the middle gives the film a more intriguing energy than it would have had if it had followed the standard playbook of meticulously tracking the rise and fall of a product and its purveyors. It's what it might feel like to watch only the first and last episodes of an excellent TV drama that ran for years-or maybe like the finance-bro equivalent of Full Metal Jacket, the only war film that shows naive recruits being trained/brainwashed at the beginning of the process and their cynical, hardened-by-war, final incarnations, but skips the middle part showing how the change happened. It worked for me in BlackBerry for the most part, however, the movie did get caught quickly summarizing past events a little too many times. I definitely would have liked to focus a tad more on some elements, but overall the movie does have a very good flow and tells you exactly what you need to know while also being very engaging and entertaining.

If I was to say one thing that didn't work for me too well, it would be the cinematography. It took more of a Succession approach, with lots of handheld work trying to emulate the documentary/mockumentary style. But where Succession makes it work with very precisely planned movements and staging, I found the setups and framing here to be ineffective. It wasn't bad, it just didn't really have the effect on me that I think they wanted it to. But that was very minor and I really didn't notice it after a while. The needle drops and clips shown throughout the film were excellently chosen and fit the film and its tone very well!

The one place where BlackBerry feels less close to something like The Social Network is where the in-the-moment stresses and anxiety are the major selling point, much like in the TV series Succession. You can thank our three leads for that. Matt Johnson is known for getting naturalistic performances out of his comedic actors via copious amounts of improv, and while it's hard to say whether or not that same improv was employed on set or if the script by himself and producer Matthew Miller was strict, there's a snappy, yet undeniably human feel to the multitude of dialogue scenes. Jay Baruchel steps into the role of a compulsive tinkerer and professional pushover with gusto. Seeing him transition from someone who believes in the work first and foremost to the kind of corporate tyrant he used to despise is like a magic trick, never coming across as unnatural.

The true standout in this film, however, is easily Glenn Howerton. We're gonna be talking about him in this film for years to come. It is positively unhinged mega-acting, he comes off as a genuine movie monster that devours everything in his path. Howerton drives this movie like JK Simmons drove Whiplash - he was simply a ferocious force of nature in this film.

Watching Matt Johnson's film is akin to being in the maelstrom of the changing winds of the tech world. Surrounded by memorable supporting characters like Cary Elwes' irritating Carl Yankowski and Michael Ironside's gruff Charles Purdy, BlackBerry truly gets better as it goes. This pure momentum surges the story of three men with a common goal of making their mark on consumer technology. The ultimate looming specter of Apple and the iPhone, along with their combined personalities and greed, forward into a darkly satisfying finale that only cements BlackBerry as an early pick for one of the best movies of 2023. Giving the turbulent tale of one of the world's first smartphone's rise and fall an appropriately exuberant biopic, Matt Johnson transforms what could've been a dry visual representation of a Wikipedia article into a mini tech epic.

Blackberry is a phenomenal film that showcases a razor-sharp script and some of the best performances that I've seen so far this year. It perfectly encapsulates the rise and fall of the BlackBerry in such a funny, engaging, and thrilling way. Superb direction and editing. Matthew Johnson has created this year's Social Network on a shoestring budget... and it turned out so great! I highly recommend it!

Plus, it's a great opportunity to support Canadian film!",9
15 May 2023,Filled in the Blanks,"I had a Blackberry when I was working. Somewhere along the way, I lost the perspective of time. Well, this film answered the big question...what came first Blackberry or iPhone? See the film to find out! I think the film makers made a film that perfectly captured my fantasy of what an early, and perhaps, continuing, high tech work place was/is like. The development of the characters, including their transition to corporate big tech was done very well. And of course, the main point of the film, what happened to Blackberry, was well presented. See the film to find out. If you suffer from motion sickness, this may not be the best film for you to see. There is lots of simultaneous activities. The other issue was periodic very loud and dissonant sounding music. It detracted from my enjoyment of the film (I am a senior). Last but not least, if you have missed the sound of ""dial up"" and its associated short comings see this film for a trip down memory lane.

5 June 2023,Nostalgic feeling through and through,"Greetings again from the darkness. There aren't too many companies who have reached the pinnacle of their industry, only to later flop due to lack of innovation or a stubborn insistence on holding on to the past. Tremendous success and absolute failure are not typically associated with the same company. Blockbuster Video and Pan Am Airlines come to mind as examples of industry leaders whose refusal to adapt, culminated with closure, and it's likely that Blackberry belongs in the category, at least as presented here by writer-director Matt Johnson and co-writer Matthew Miller, adapting the book by Jacquie McNish.

Socially awkward pals, Mike Lazaridis (played by Jay Baruchel) and Doug Fregin (played by the film's director Matt Johnson), co-founded Research in Motion (RIM). The film picks up in 1996 when Mike and Doug are making their first presentation of their breakthrough handheld data delivery-email machine, which they have named Pocket Link. These are two genius nerds with no concept of how the outside business worlds functions, and the executive to whom they are pitching is so distracted that his only feedback is, ""You need a new name."" In a fascinating twist, that same executive, Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton, ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"") ends up saving not just the new product, but also the company.

Balsillie presents himself as a fireball, take charge, full-steam-ahead kind of guy. It's quite a contrast to nerdy Mike and easy-going Doug. Mike is a quiet guy committed to perfection in his work, while Doug wrangles the tech developers with a culture of video games, movie night, and an overall fraternity environment. Balsillie's arrival as a vocal outrage expert and brash businessman changes everything, and he and Mike drive the newly named BlackBerry to levels not previously seen. We do get a humorous anecdote from a shirt stain (even though it's not a true story), and in fact, there is quite a bit of humor throughout.

We are informed that the film was ""inspired by real people and real events"", so some dramatic license is expected. Perhaps the best comparison is THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010), and while that film was more polished, I personally found this one more entertaining and accurate from a business sense. An excellent supporting cast includes Cary Elwes, Saul Rubinek, Michael Ironside, Martin Donovan, Rich Sommer, and SungWon Cho, and the film's real draw is the contrast between Jay Baruchel's mousy but brilliant Mike, and Glenn Howard's powerhouse portrayal of the egotistical Balsillie. Baruchel's scene where he reacts to the new iPhone is alone worth the price of admission.

At its peak, BlackBerry had 45% market share and had earned it's ""CrackBerry"" label in the business world. Apple's 2007 introduction of the iPhone not only rocked the BlackBerry company, it shook up the world. The Canada perspective is noted (RIM was based in Waterloo, Ontario), as is Mike's aversion to 'made in China', perhaps the ultimate reason for the fall. It's likely that BlackBerry has become a Case Study in Business Schools, although the fast-paced and pressure-packed world of tech continues to require a balance of decisions focused on current markets and never-ending innovation for the future.

23 June 2023,The story of the world's smallest email terminal.,"What starts as a dark comedy, becomes a grim drama by the end and that is great. This is an excellent telling of the rise and fall of Blackberry. The writing is fun and the story is engaging because of how crazy it is. The technical jargon is made to be easily understood. The performance by everyone is great even if it is very dramatized and over the top.

The filming style with its weird snap zooms, shaky cam and weird filter can be a bit odd but it does make it feel unique.

It has excellent pacing and a great 2 hour runtime. Plus SungWon Cho is in the movie and he should be in a billion movies. IA must-watch, for Canada's sake.

20 May 2023,A Perfectly Ok Film That Goes Through The Motions,"Hollywood, bereft of any originality, is scraping the barrel of semi-interesting ""nostalgia"" products/ fads to use to churn a halfhearted film out, see Tetris, Air, Dungeons and Dragons, etc.

Technically there is nothing too wrong with this film. Things happen, there's some jokes, and it tells a story. However, the whole affair feels soulless. There's nothing new here - unruly nerds out of water in a corporate world; some corporate backstabbing etc. Etc.

This is a generic film that has likely been made because something had to be. You'll watch it, be mildly entertained, and then forget about it for the rest of your life.

3 June 2023,Written for an iPhone consumer audience.,"This movie seems to have been intended for the iPhone consumer electronics audience -- while Blackberry catered to the business professional & productivity market.

Worse yet, they only told 1/2 the story, and ignored the RIM QNX operating system, which is presently used on a vast range of ultra-high reliability mobile craft. The omitted QNX story also includes the protracted introduction of Blackberry 10, and its failure in the low end consumer electronics marketplace. I.e., it was not designed to be an entertainment toy like a glorified iPod.

This movie is so unrealistic and over the top, it made me feel like it was written by the same people who wrote the 3-Stooges (2012). No electronics engineer who can build a prototype handheld network device would struggle to turn off a buzzing intercom, let alone waste time fixing a piece of junk -- when looking straight at the battery connector which can merely be unplugged. Further, no CEO gets anyplace by being a raving angry screaming lunatic. Even the financiancial wrongdoing was exaggerated by more than 25 times. The hyper-stereotypical charicatures were neither plausable (the way that Kerri Russel's character was portrayed in The Diplomat) nor humorous at all, yet ""comedy"" is an IMDB tag.

This slapstic mockumentary represents the contemporary problem with disinformation, and will cause some viewers to falsely believe that this is how tech companies actually startup.",1
21 May 2023,A really great dark comedic take,"Jay Baruchel and Matt Johnson are friends who run a small tech company and have invented the smart phone, but are so bad at running a business that they're on the verge of going under. Enter Glenn Howerton, who has heard their pitch when he worked for a company that has no interest in their phone, but has developed an intense interest not that he's lost that job (for good reasons). He buys his way into being co-CEO with Baruchel, and when he realizes just how badly run the company is, pushes them forward to selling the phone by force of will.

The story is of the invention of the BlackBerry, and this very engaging dark comedy wisely skips the middle of the story. We get the company's rise, it's struggle to deal with it's insanely rapid sales threatening to crash it's network (and fighting off a hostile takeover from PalmPilot), but then we pretty much skip to the downfall. What's wonderful about this structure is that we very clearly see how the character traits that make Baruchel and Howerton an initial success are the same traits that make them unable to handle the twin assaults of the iPhone and an SEC investigation.

This is much more entertaining than you expect a tech business story to be. While it does not skimp on technical details (I thought it was pretty fascinating how they solved their network issues), it's mostly high comedy and dark satire. Howerton steals the film playing the most bombastic character, but Baruchel shows a completely new side.

Cary Elwes, Saul Rubinek and the mighty Michael Ironside are all superb in supporting roles.",8
3 June 2023,5/10 Poorly Executed Creat Movie,"I've been waiting for a movie about Blackberry and their fall as I was a huge proponent for a physical keyboard the security and the phone, yet the company refused to listen to the users such as myself who were offering advise on 100s of bugs all of their phones had, due to very narcissistic type of the management.

The first 15 minutes were very painful to watch, as I was trying to adjust and kept thinking"" can I sit through this high school play for 1.5h""? It felt like a low production school play and at first I didn't know if it's a comedy, a joke or a real movie.

The camerawork is absolutely atrocious. One of the worst. It is shaky. The directors in 2023 could not afford a steadycam?? If you want to get nouseus, this epic-fail camerawork is for you... And don't tell me it's to showcase the 3rd eye/journalistic approach because that would clear show the 2nd point I will make bellow. Only amateurs use that approach, because they are unable to tell the story via story and good directing so they used this old outdated technique.

Really bad directing. Again one of the worst. I've seen some of the actors before and pretty much everyone in this movie played worse than they all did elsewhere. The director, who is also was an actor did a HORRIBLE job acting in the movie, just like very amateur directing. As usual, if you try 2 things, you will fail and he clearly did both.

If not for Glen, I would have walked away. But even Glen wasn't squeezed for the talent he has!

The story is also very shallow. There's very little information, details. A lot of fillers and fluff to fill the void. The current rating is just wrong. I am giving it a 5 and I am being generous. I am sad the shot at this story was taken with a low budget, bad story and bad directing, wasting a great moment of a Canadian history and I am sad as Canadians, we couldn't show we can match Hollywood!

4.9/10.",5
3 June 2023,Terrible directing,"Why, oh why do they use shaky hand camera? Ever heard about tripods? The directing of this movie takes away a lot of the enjoyment watching this. The other problem is that it's not realistic. Even the opening scene with at stupid manager doing being very rude and stupid when the guys are presenting the idea.

This could have been a very interesting story, like the book it's based on But instead of doing a real movie they try to do a mocumentary and totally fail at it. And that's a real pity because this could have been both interesting and entertaining. But sitting there being more and more irritated about the shaky cam is just not worth it.

17 July 2023,Surprise of the year!,"BlackBerry tells the story of Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, the two men that charted the course of the spectacular rise and catastrophic demise of the world's first smartphone.

This movie is one of the movies I enjoyed the most this year, a big part of why I did was definitely the storytelling. The storytelling was insanely good, they made a story that would bore your whole friend group up 30 seconds into the it, into a 2 hours movie that's interesting and fun all throughout. The cast was just perfect in my opinion; each character had its own traits that made it stand out from other characters, and the actors playing those characters delivered the script, that suited each of them, incredibly. Character development is a key element in this story and it was presented so smoothly and gradually in a way that you don't really feel like there's anything changing but when you look back at the events that happened and what certain characters did, you will notice it.

I thought the director, Mathew Johnson (who also plays Doug), did a very good job; the color scheme used, the way the whole film was shot, the music, and many more aspects present in this film were just splendid as suited the movie's theme perfectly and elevated the story. I also found the movie to he hilarious especially with the characters' reactions in certain scenes

Score:8.5/10.",8
5 June 2023,"A Captivating Journey: ""Blackberry"" Delivers on Every Level","Jo and I had the pleasure of immersing ourselves in the cinematic masterpiece known as ""Blackberry"" last night. Initially recommended by a friend, we were astounded that such a gem had eluded our radar until then. From the very beginning to its gripping finale, the film proved to be an exhilarating and unforgettable experience.

One of the standout elements of ""Blackberry"" was undoubtedly the remarkable performance by Glenn Howerton. Known for his comedic prowess in ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"" we were pleasantly surprised to witness his incredible versatility in this film. Howerton's portrayal in ""Blackberry"" shattered any preconceived notions we had, revealing a profound depth to his talent. With this remarkable performance, he undoubtedly establishes himself as a force to be reckoned with, poised for even greater roles in the future.

Beyond Howerton's stellar performance, ""Blackberry"" captivates the audience with its gripping narrative and impeccable execution. The story unfolds with masterful precision, effortlessly weaving together elements of suspense, emotion, and thought-provoking themes. Each scene is crafted with meticulous attention to detail, leaving no room for distraction or disappointment.

The film's visual aesthetic is equally commendable, with stunning cinematography that enhances the overall experience. From breathtaking landscapes to intimate character moments, every frame is a work of art. The handheld docu-style cinematography, meticulous production design, and a compelling score creates an immersive atmosphere that transports the audience into the heart of the story while simultaneously bringing an air of authenticity

""Blackberry"" give us hope for cinema and storytelling, reminding us why we fell in love with the medium in the first place.

We wholeheartedly recommend ""Blackberry"". It is far better than AIR and for that alone should be recognized!!",10
13 June 2023,"Not satisfying enough, left me wanting to know more","Greetings again from the darkness.

Perhaps the best comparison is THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010), and while that film was more polished, I personally found this one more entertaining and accurate from a business sense. An excellent supporting cast includes Cary Elwes, Saul Rubinek, Michael Ironside, Martin Donovan, Rich Sommer, and SungWon Cho, and the film's real draw is the contrast between Jay Baruchel's mousy but brilliant Mike, and Glenn Howard's powerhouse portrayal of the egotistical Balsillie. Baruchel's scene where he reacts to the new iPhone is alone worth the price of admission.

At its peak, BlackBerry had 45% market share and had earned it's ""CrackBerry"" label in the business world. Apple's 2007 introduction of the iPhone not only rocked the BlackBerry company, it shook up the world. The Canada perspective is noted (RIM was based in Waterloo, Ontario), as is Mike's aversion to 'made in China', perhaps the ultimate reason for the fall. It's likely that BlackBerry has become a Case Study in Business Schools, although the fast-paced and pressure-packed world of tech continues to require a balance of decisions focused on current markets and never-ending innovation for the future.

2 July 2023,The company went down but not out,"Were you ignorant of the company, you'd think the end of the movie meant that Blackberry disappeared from the world. It didn't, it's producing security software more or less in-line with the fact they once had the most secure communications device extant. The movie is a bit old-school with the ""The Office"" use of cameras that jiggle and loose centering. The problem is that although it does a good job of showing the skeleton of what happened to the company, there is simply too much to say in the time-frame allowed. Also, silly changes to reality like them being investigated by the SEC (American) as opposed to Canadian tax officials was not needed, even to appeal to a U. S. audience. The characters in the movie are true to life, more or less as is the ""Google-inspired"" lazy work environment shown. The final phone shown, a full-screen model like Android and Apple phones (the Storm) was a flop probably not because of Chinese manufacturing but of a rush to market with a sub-standard product. The whole is likely no better than the parts used. I wonder if they've done a movie on Nokia like this?

24 May 2023,"Nothing ""docu"" about this drama","Greetings again from the darkness. There aren't too many companies who have reached the pinnacle of their industry, only to later flop due to lack of innovation or a stubborn insistence on holding on to the past. Tremendous success and absolute failure are not typically associated with the same company. Blockbuster Video and Pan Am Airlines come to mind as examples of industry leaders whose refusal to adapt, culminated with closure, and it's likely that Blackberry belongs in the category, at least as presented here by writer-director Matt Johnson and co-writer Matthew Miller, adapting the book by Jacquie McNish.

Socially awkward pals, Mike Lazaridis (played by Jay Baruchel) and Doug Fregin (played by the film's director Matt Johnson), co-founded Research in Motion (RIM). The film picks up in 1996 when Mike and Doug are making their first presentation of their breakthrough handheld data delivery-email machine, which they have named Pocket Link. These are two genius nerds with no concept of how the outside business worlds functions, and the executive to whom they are pitching is so distracted that his only feedback is, ""You need a new name."" In a fascinating twist, that same executive, Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton, ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"") ends up saving not just the new product, but also the company.

Balsillie presents himself as a fireball, take charge, full-steam-ahead kind of guy. It's quite a contrast to nerdy Mike and easy-going Doug. Mike is a quiet guy committed to perfection in his work, while Doug wrangles the tech developers with a culture of video games, movie night, and an overall fraternity environment. Balsillie's arrival as a vocal outrage expert and brash businessman changes everything, and he and Mike drive the newly named BlackBerry to levels not previously seen. We do get a humorous anecdote from a shirt stain (even though it's not a true story), and in fact, there is quite a bit of humor throughout.

We are informed that the film was ""inspired by real people and real events"", so some dramatic license is expected.

13 August 2023,Two memorable performances stand out in an otherwise unmemorable feature,"Taking its cues from the likes of Adam McKay's The Big Short and Vice, Matt Johnson's BlackBerry is a frenetic and constantly moving biopic on the worlds first ever smartphone, mixing drama and comedy into one hyperactive concoction that doesn't deliver anything groundbreaking but gifts us another cautionary tale of the fickle nature of success all the while giving its two main stars Glenn Howerton and Jay Baruchel an opportunity to showcase that their more than what audiences have grown to appreciate them for.

Gaining attention with his 2013 independent offering The Dirties, Johnson (who here also acts as the pop culture/moving night loving Doug) gifts It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Howerton and stoner comedy expat Baruchel chances to shine as the repulsively aggressive and vicious Jim Balsillie and the mild-mannered tech genius Mike Lazaridis respectively, with both performers excelling in their roles in this Canadian backed affair that almost seems too impossible to in fact be true.

Driven by the dangerously obsessive Balsillie and the tech-focused minds of Lazaridis and Doug Fregin, watching the rise and fall of the BlackBerry brand from the late 1990's into the early 2000's is a wild ride and one that is going to have to be considered a must-watch by anyone that is somewhat of a ""tech-head"", it's hard to recall many businesses that had such an immediate and notable rise and an equally notable and sad demise and its a credit to Johnson and his cast that their able to draw so much entertainment from a story that while in a way encouraging to those with big dreams is equally frightening to those that expect success to be a gift that keeps on giving.

Doing little in the way of providing any lead up backstory or groundwork to what made these true life characters the ones they are when we join them on their world conquering journey, BlackBerry does suffer from being able to truly grip its audience into it's world, with there never really being an emotional connection to anything going on around our characters and with the inevitable downfall coming for the company and those that built it, BlackBerry feels more like a film ticking off a series of boxes rather than one giving us anything unexpected or memorable.

At days end a quick moving dramedy with two solid against type performances and another impressive all-round effort from the multi-tasking Johnson, BlackBerry is one of those easy to watch films that will likely be overshadowed by the bigger players coming our way in 2023.

Final Say -

Taking inspiration from films of a similar ilk that managed to become special offerings in their own unique ways, BlackBerry is a watchable and well performed feature that lacks the true heart and soul that would've made it a special low-budgeted experience.

7 June 2023,What a great movie,"This movie surprised me because, like many I taught, I knew the story of the Blackberry. But, like what an amateur moviegoer wrote, this movie is so well made, and acted that it makes you relive this impossible dream that was the Blackberry. You learn why it was impossible ... And learn that the window of opportunities that Rim was exploiting, although still there, was moving away from them. Just like they had done with their products, moving the cell phone industry from selling minutes to a subscriber base, Apple products were moving the market towards all in experience & away from subscribers towards a data plan. The acting is perfect to make you feel the complex of emotions that this electronic engineer, who founded RIM, created the Blackberry must have been feeling under his geeky appearance.

6 July 2023,A fascinating look at BlackBerry that creates a compelling look at the rise and fall of the tech giant with strong performances from Howerton and Baruchel,"Set from 1996 to 2008, BlackBerry follows the trajectory by Research in Motion founders Mike Lazaridis (Jay Baruchel) and Doug Fregin (Matt Johnson) whose struggling startup was guided to pioneering the smartphone with the BlackBerry handheld by ambitious businessman Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton) before the changing marketing landscape and Balsillie's actions caught up with the company.

BlackBerry is the third film from Canadian filmmaking Matt Johnson who also serves as co-writer alongside Mathew Miller as well as starring alongside Baruchel and Howerton. The film is an adaptation of the book ""Losing the Signal: The Untold Story Behind the Extraordinary Rise and Spectacular Fall of BlackBerry"" by Jacquie McNish Sean Silcoff. Johnson had made a name for himself directing the well regarded found footage films The Dirites and Operation Avalanche which received strong critical support in spite of their low budgets, and Johnson brough that frugal approach to the making of BlackBerry making the film for a modest $5 million in comparison to comparable films like The Social Network or Steve Jobs which were made for $40 million and $30 million respectively. Johnson gives us a memorable look at BlackBerry's rise and fall by creating compelling character portraits and engaging dialogue that helps to distract from the economical approach to the filmmaking.

Despite Baruchel and Howerton being more known primarily for their comedic work, both do quite well in a film that while possessing touches of humor is a considerably more dramatic work for both actors. Glenn Howerton disappears into the role of Balsillie and while Howerton has played sneaky ambitious characters before such as his roles in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia or A. P. Bio, Howerton does quite well in his portrayal of Balsillie as an ambitious and cutthroat businessman who is unafraid to bend or break the rules for his own purposes but is also often a victim of that ambition by overextending his position as seen in his introduction where he's fired from his first job after taking over the presentation of a co-worker he described as ""a goof"". Baruchel is equally good in the role of Lazaridis and he gives us a compelling look at a man who when we first meet him isn't all that interested in the business side of tech and is more at home perfecting the innards of technology such as when he gets rid of the awful background buzzing noise on a Chinese manufactured intercom using only a paperclip only to lack that same level of success in a board room. Baruchel does a good job of showing the character grow more confident of the film's 12 year stretch with Lazaridis adopting more traits of Balsillie and sacrificing his commitment to quality in favor of economic trends such as outsourcing and offshoring. Matt Johnson is also a lot of fun playing Research-in-Motion co-founder Doug Fregin and plays the character as someone who's very carefree but is also intelligent behind a seemingly immature surface. Johnson does a good job of creating a period film with limited resources and despite not having the open scale of similar films like The Social Network or Air, Johnson uses a clever combination of real life news reports and period appropriate TV footage to create the atmosphere of the time and place without actually needing to build anymore of it than the rooms our characters occupy. In terms of filmmaking this is a prime example of why you don't need a $50 million budget.

I really enjoyed BlackBerry, even for people who aren't interested in the tech world I think the film works as not only a great coverage of the points in time it works in, but it's also a solid character piece with some really good work by everyone involved. This is definitely one to check out if you haven't already.",9
22 August 2023,A very entertaining film,"I enjoyed this for the same reason I enjoyed Succession - lots of yelling, swearing, dark/cringe humor, and unsympathetic people being unreasonably stressed, even if part of me sometimes felt a tiny bit bad for them on occasions. It's like the tense/dark humor of that show crossed with the same kind of story told in The Social Network, only here, the story is ultimately one of complete failure, rather than moral failure, and it's more humorous (might lack the visual polish of any of the stuff I've just mentioned, but the down and dirty/fairly low budget look works in a lo-fi aesthetic kind of way).

It's all about the rise and fall of the titular BlackBerry phone, and though we should be careful about the recent trend of brand biopics, this one's easy to enjoy, seeing as BlackBerry is now an ex-brand. You don't really feel like you're being advertised to, seeing as I don't believe there are any BlackBerry phones left to buy anymore. I think this ultimately gives this movie the edge over the more brand-friendly Nike movie, Air, from earlier this year (which was still well-made enough that I enjoyed it to some extent).

Besides the humor, I feel like the performances here are what really enhance BlackBerry. Glenn Howerton was undeniably the standout for me - I knew he was a good actor, and he's funny in what I've seen of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, but I didn't know he was capable of a performance this good. His meltdowns in this movie (there are many) never get old. He probably won't get any Awards recognition, but I think he should at least be considered for some nominations.

I also dug the soundtrack here (Joy Division, Slint, The Strokes, and The Kinks are all used well), and the final scene is perfect, even if you can kind of see it coming. Overall, I found this to be very entertaining and pretty funny for most of its two-hour runtime. It's definitely one of the better films of 2023 so far.",8
2 September 2023,Ok ''biopic'' about the blackberry phone,"I knew about BLACKBERRY since last December because it was among the movies in production of Michael Ironside. It was released last May and in the meanwhile I saw in theater AIR (about the first Air Jordan shoe being produced exclusively for Michael Jordan) that despite being about a different subject it's a similar themed movie. A month after its release I finally saw this and I just liked it.

The movie is about the invention of the Blackberry phone, and considering that I am 24 years old I lived in the time they were still sold even tho I never had one myself. In 1996 Mike Lazaridis (Jay Baruchel) and his best friend Douglas Fregin are forced by Jim Balsillie to build a prototype for a new phone and they brand it as Blackberry. Skip to 2003 when Carl Yankowski (Cary Elwes) plans a hostile takeover on the RIM forcing Balsillie to sell an amount of phones that exceed Bell Atlantic's network limit. This crashes the network so Balsillie is forced to poach engineers for fixing the problems and to hire Charles Purdy (Michael Ironside) as RIM's COO for keeping workers in line, and they'll manage to avoid Carl's buyout. Most of the movie simply consists of RIM's workers that will have their period of luck until the Blackberry industry failed in 2012 and in fact to this day they were never produced again.

I liked the acting: Jay Baruchel gives one of his rare leading man performances, and heavies Michael Ironside and Cary Elwes give some of their best performances in their resumes full also of terrible movies (15 years earlier they co-starred in the terrible THE ALPHABET KILLER). But the problem was the pace; in some points too slow, and the running time could have been trimmed of at least 30 minutes and I probably would have liked it more. Still, a good movie about a mobile phone industry that folks of my generation certainly remember so it's bound to bring some nostalgia as well.",7
20 May 2023,You'll look at your phone different,"Nothing unexpected but very fascinating. The desperate race for fame & fortune is shown in all its stressful glory. Funny yet dramatic with an awesome score to set each tone. The cast executes their roles perfectly.

3 June 2023,"Not a quality movie, but still worth a watch","The movie is dirt cheap. They have a few 2000's sets, but it's small stuff. A few cars are shown, a few offices, and that's pretty much it. It's basically stuff you could do better with a camera and nothing else. How is it hard to film a few random cars? The camera work is extremely lazy and bad. The handheld cam is never stable and we often just see faces or people without much set design anywhere so it feels like a cheap theater play. It's a $5m budget history movie that does look like a $5m budget movie. But the script does make it work overall.

We follow engineer nerds and a mean CEO who comes in to help them create a mobile phone. Together they make it work until Apple arrives on the market and the BlackBerry leaders just claim the iPhone is for idiots and won't ever work so they don't change things fast enough. Basically, it's a dirt cheap Canadian movie that is interesting all the way, but the story is never explored much. The Dropout took us through the full development history of a fake product. Here we get some development scenes, but the big steps are seldom explained. When they move their production to China it's just shown via a single line of dialogue in one scene. We get what is going on. They are a quality product that now needs to bring down cost to stay alive. Even though they all claimed that moving production to China is what kills tech companies. We get the unsaid stuff, it's just unsaid and at times lazy. They never tell us how much lower costs are in China. We never get a scene in China. Hell, we never even get any cost numbers for anything they make. And while they mention iPhone and Android we never see what happened step by step. They just say this stuff via dialogue and only before it happens. Apple is mentioned before they even bring the product to market. Android is only mentioned in one scene by a random engineer. So we know what is coming yet it is told via lazy dialogue lines.

Still, it's a curious look into BlackBerry. We get the basics like the new CEO trying to buy a NFL franchise. He actually tried to buy like 5 different teams. But his goal was to move his team to Canada which NFL of course didn't want to happen. He verbally promised not to move the team yet started to sell tickets in Canada as soon as he made an initial deal. Which revealed his hand and made other NFL team owners not trust him and vote against this buyout. It's all quite interesting, but could have been a bigger story still as they never tell us much about this. Similarly we see the engineers work and some criminal acts. But all is kinda rushed and as the cam is never still so everything looks ugly too. I really wanted to like this and in some aspects I did. But it's not really a ""movie"". More like scenes they made for some upcoming documentary or something.

We don't actually have any women here. The camera often lingers on women in the room, but expect a few secretaries having a few pointless lines it's all men. Which actually is a bit weird as these men were married for decades. And had kids and friends. Yet we only see what they do in the offices. You wonder if they are loners or something. There is not a single kid in the movie. And we never see random people use BlackBerrys in random settings. It's all small offices here. I enjoyed it for sure. But compared to The Dropout and The Social Network it's a letdown. The acting is also comedic and fake.",7
3 June 2023,Enjoyable movie of 2 halves,"I didn't really know much about this movie and the back story of the rise of blackberry so came into it with a very objective point of view - probably the best way to approach all movies !!

I really enjoyed the movie and it had touches of ""social network"" about it.

The basic premise is the how blackberry becomes the original smartphone and how it changes the landscape of mobile phones.

Not sure how factually true it is and how much of it Hollywood licence- but it's entertaining from start to finish.

It's definitely a movie of 2 halves with the first half being more comedic. The first half covers the early days where a couple of bumbling techie nerds with zero personable skills have a phone concept but have no idea how to market it. It's filmed in a pseudo documentary, almost fly on the wall style and works well.

The second half then changes direction and becomes more of a corporate / boardroom kind of movie where it plots the eventual downfall of blackberry and this half of the movie has a more serious feel and less comedic.

Overall , I think the movie works on the whole and is well worth a watch.",7
6 June 2023,"Excellent, pacy & engaging '00s-based 'inspired by truth' drama","""Blackberry"" follows swiftly after ""Tetris"" & ""Air"" as another terrific 'inspired by truth' back-story of an iconic product rise (and in this case fall) from a few decades back. This one has tech whizz Jay Baruchel (with a bunch of nerds led by Matt Johnson) and business shark Glen Howerton revolutionising the early '00s cell-phone market with their titular device, ground-breaking innovation & ruthless drive... only for illegal financial short-cutting and the iPhone to bring them crashing down. Brilliantly performed, written (by Johnson & Matthew Miller) & directed (again by Johnson) it is an excellent, pacy & engaging addition to a growing, high quality genre.

11 September 2023,It is not a cell phone. It is a status symbol.,"Blackberry takes us through the period of 1996 - 2008, from the days of it's invention to the beginning of Blackberry's decline. During those 12 years, how the founders Mike Lazaridis and Douglas Fregin struggled to sell their prototype, especially how Jim Ballsillie helps them out by bringing in the much needed aggression to survive among the capitalists. The price to pay for that is the innocent nerds' vision for Blackberry which eventually succumbs to Jim's high headed business tactics. Despite that, Blackberry owns the market and rules as the market leader until they fail to adapt to the changing times. The company and relationships well tumble down.

It documents the 12 year events in this fictional take. The narrative caught my attention the moment Jim Ballsillie's character enters. The character of Mike is introduced effectively with him focusing on repairing the faulty equipment, disturbed by the noise from it and the exact way he is shown at the end. He was always going to be the perfect engineer without the qualities of a businessman. Similarly the character Doug, remains Goofy throughout but the smartest among them all. The equation they have with their engineers and how Jim changes it by completely changing their work culture was well done. The aggressive sales pitch was another attraction.

The whole phase of selling minutes to selling data, was well captured with some live footage. Jay Baruchel as Mike stuck to the one toned performance and to emote on the same frequency was commendable. The humor clicked throughout and once things turn serious, the whole debacle of Blackberry over failing to understand the changing market was in a way a heartbreaking watch. But the toxic work relationship Mike and Co had with Jim, kind of sets up the journey towards their inevitable debacle. With two hours runtime, this indeed was a commanding watch and I would definitely recommend this to everyone.",7
18 September 2023,The story of history's first smartphone...,"The movie tells the story of the emergence, incredible rise and historic collapse of the BlackBerry brand. I'm not exaggerating when I say incredible rise and historic collapse; in its heyday, the company controlled 45% of the cell phone market, but today that figure is 0%.

I enjoyed watching the company's clever marketing strategies, the ""wars"" they fought with economically powerful competitors, and how they pushed the boundaries of technology and laid the foundations of today's smartphone world. It is hard not to be surprised that this movie is so overshadowed.

One of the seminal and beautiful films of this year...

Footnote: Mike Lazaridis, the founder of BlackBerry, is a Black Sea(Türkiye) Greek. He was born in Istanbul and lived in Istanbul until he was 6 years old, then immigrated to Canada with his family.",8
18 May 2023,Smartphone version of Social Network,"This film shares a lot of similarities with the Social Network and that is a compliment. It had my attention from start to finish. While some of the casting may not have been accurate with sone characters not looking like the real life version (Mike) and Doug not even being remotely like the real Doug, they certainly are fantastic in making it entertaining. Prior to the film I knew the basics of the rise and fall but didn't know it was this interesting and my expectations for the film were much lower. It was a pleasant surprise.

On the downside of things much of it has to be taken with a grain of salt. I found the small clips of writing used at the end of the film that are usually used to tell the true story to be somewhat deceptive. At the end of based on true story movies I expect to read hard facts. This was not necessarily the case. For example, it showed how Doug sold his stock in 2007 and became extremely wealthy. However, it made no comments on how the Doug portrayed in the film was a false character or showed images of the real Doug. Further research showed how Doug in real life was nothing like the character in the film and nor was Jim Balsillie and absolute tyrant.

It makes for good entertainment no doubt. Also gives you a good shell of a story of what went down. But ultimately you ll need to do some fact checking for the truth.",8
26 August 2023,"Somewhat bittersweet, but engaging story","'BlackBerry' is another mostly-non-fiction cautionary business origin film, along the lines of 'The Founder' and 'The Social Network', as well as this year's 'Air' and 'Tetris'. We follow friends Mike (Baruchel), the tech whiz & Doug, the morale-booster (Johnson, also the director) who have formed start-up Research In Motion in Canada in the 90s, focusing on making modems and have a patent for a handheld email device. They come across ruthless businessman Jim (Howerton), who turns their idea into a reality.

The film probably sensationalises a lot of things, but does well to focus on some of the personal drama, especially the balancing act between Mike & Jim. But I would've liked to have seen more of the Mike/Doug dynamic and their early-RIM friends/employees doing the development. The acting is good all-round, with Baruchel playing someone different for him, Howerton is a great jerk and Johnson is fun, basically the TJ Miller character form 'Silicon Valley'. There's some laughs, but a lot more focus on the progress of the business.

BlackBerry had a good 6 years from 2002-2007, somewhat thanks to Mike becoming more like Jim, as well as hiring slave-driver Charles (Ironside) and the things that Jim has to do to fend off the takeover by Carl (Elwes) and Palm. BlackBerry was ultimately doomed to fail when Android OS became the standard for mobile phones, as well as the marketing behind the iPhone. Big shame for me, as I think I was one of the few in Australia who still owned a BlackBerry in 2010! Well-paced and under 2 hours, with an OK-digital-style score.",6
2 July 2023,Com-drama at its finest,"Great casting, well written and directed, with a flow to it that makes the recently released ""Air"" feel sluggish. Glenn Howerton, known for Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia, shines as the protagonist (and antagonist) in a film where he taps into that rage that ""Dennis"" struggles to control on the show It's Always Sunny. He's hilariously scary, while being completely serious and devoted to the role. Jay Baruchel plays off that shyness we saw in ""She's Out of My League"", as the timid geek who created the phone we were all addicted to. Along with the other lovable geeks and their movie nights, this movie was fun to watch, even if they skipped through a few years at a time.

24 May 2023,The necessary movie surprise of May,"I don't imagine that many people are expecting a film with a title as well remembered as ""BlackBerry"" to provide the type of character depth and anxiety driven sequences as a hidden independent project would, but that's exactly what you get. Focusing on the evolution of personality, the contrast of greed vs neutralism, and the vital nature of integrity with work, this story moves fast yet keeps a hold of you every step of the way. The film style is inclusive with the viewer, similar to documentaries or sitcoms with its intense handheld focus, and equally enticing with the dramatic color saturation and nerve rattling score. Actor, writer, and director Matt Johnson generates an addictive energy embedded behind the lifespan of a brand mixed together with the brutality of good ideas mixed in with selfish purpose. This is the surprise movie of May that we desperately needed.

5 August 2023,A great cautionary tale,"I've always been obsessed with the blackberry story, mainly how it went from having 45% of the market to 0% of the market only a few years later. The only criticism I have is there were many many missteps along the way that were not fully documented in this film at all, but I still think they got the gist of this crazy crazy story. The iPhone killed blackberry, plain and simple, but that part of the story was only touched upon very lightly, when it really is the major event in this story. I wish they would have spent more time on the missteps, the ignoring of the iPhone, and the effects that had on the demise of the company, but it's still very well done.

17 May 2023,CRACKBERRY,"For those who remember tippy typing on their obsolete devices in utter denial, this film contains a built-in spoiler. A spoiler that does not spoil the show. A feat, this is.

The rise and (insert Final Jeopardy music) of BlackBerry is a geek fest riot. One that delivers so much more. Developed by a cackle of soldering nerds - whose solution to work glitches is emergency movie night - the world's first and best smart phone is a revolutionary product which they have no idea how to sell. Enter Jim Balsillie, a clever, ruthless, maniacal product pusher who quickly jettisons this rag tag bunch of kids to the world stage. And in a fantastic running subplot, he is a huge, huge hockey fan.

Jay Baruchel as head techie Mike Lazaridis is a wonderful combination of skittish, mousy, determined, innocent, and charmingly funny, even when saddled with a preposterous Man From Glad wig. Glenn Howerton as his demonic, temperamental, yet super successful pitch man, torches the screen with every scene. In a good way. This is good torching. He owns this movie. He shaved his wondrous hair for the role. A trooper. Half his gift is whipping immature nerds to dominate the big bad grown-up tech sector. The cutthroat nature of the exploding business makes for thrilling drama, with the intrigue and pacing of a nail-biting spy caper. The ominously creepy shadow of Steve Jobs lurks in the background, ready to wreak havoc on the BlackBerry. Very Darth Vaderish. This may not end well.

Some primo Canuck eggs - from Don Cherry to Waterloo to Copps Coliseum - are slyly slipped in without sabotaging the film, because they are absolutely essential to the story. (Play the damn anthem right here). You'll be root-root-rooting for the home team!

An absolute joy to watch, ""BlackBerry"" is a boffo reveal of recent history that has gone lost in the shuffle, until now. Hilarity ensues.",9
8 July 2023,Good to know,"Wow, the ground breaking story of the former tech giant and the levelin of it was something to behold in the eyes of men, this depicted true human nature and that is to take what one has innovated and commercialize it for profit, till today i didn't use the use other models but the blackberry i used was the best phone i have ever used in terms of security and all compared to the now money hungry products that don't consider you all what the higher ups think about is money. My thanks goes out to mr mike and douglas for the initiative to globalize such marvel in the first even if it didn't last but still havin the people at heart was the greatest brand of all to me and many others like me out there.

3 June 2023,Disappointing,"Due to the high rating, I expecting a much better film. I would have given BlackBerry less than 6 if it wasn't such a good story to begin with. Poorly executed by mostly the director. The acting is pretty substandard as well by the three leads. Too bad this wasn't placed in more competent hands. I actually can't believe all the high ratings for this film. Ratings that exceed two recent films I've watched, Tetris and Air. Far superior films. BlackBerry feels like a mess compared to the seamless way these two films are told. I wouldn't waste my money seeing this in the theatre. I'd wait for the remake.

6 June 2023,Well told story about the world's smallest email terminal,"Greetings again from the darkness. There aren't too many companies who have reached the pinnacle of their industry, only to later flop due to lack of innovation or a stubborn insistence on holding on to the past. Tremendous success and absolute failure are not typically associated with the same company. Blockbuster Video and Pan Am Airlines come to mind as examples of industry leaders whose refusal to adapt, culminated with closure, and it's likely that Blackberry belongs in the category, at least as presented here by writer-director Matt Johnson and co-writer Matthew Miller, adapting the book by Jacquie McNish.

Socially awkward pals, Mike Lazaridis (played by Jay Baruchel) and Doug Fregin (played by the film's director Matt Johnson), co-founded Research in Motion (RIM). The film picks up in 1996 when Mike and Doug are making their first presentation of their breakthrough handheld data delivery-email machine, which they have named Pocket Link. These are two genius nerds with no concept of how the outside business worlds functions, and the executive to whom they are pitching is so distracted that his only feedback is, ""You need a new name."" In a fascinating twist, that same executive, Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton, ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"") ends up saving not just the new product, but also the company.

Balsillie presents himself as a fireball, take charge, full-steam-ahead kind of guy. It's quite a contrast to nerdy Mike and easy-going Doug. Mike is a quiet guy committed to perfection in his work, while Doug wrangles the tech developers with a culture of video games, movie night, and an overall fraternity environment. Balsillie's arrival as a vocal outrage expert and brash businessman changes everything, and he and Mike drive the newly named BlackBerry to levels not previously seen. We do get a humorous anecdote from a shirt stain (even though it's not a true story), and in fact, there is quite a bit of humor throughout.

We are informed that the film was ""inspired by real people and real events"", so some dramatic license is expected. Perhaps the best comparison is THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010), and while that film was more polished, I personally found this one more entertaining and accurate from a business sense. An excellent supporting cast includes Cary Elwes, Saul Rubinek, Michael Ironside, Martin Donovan, Rich Sommer, and SungWon Cho, and the film's real draw is the contrast between Jay Baruchel's mousy but brilliant Mike, and Glenn Howard's powerhouse portrayal of the egotistical Balsillie. Baruchel's scene where he reacts to the new iPhone is alone worth the price of admission.

At its peak, BlackBerry had 45% market share and had earned it's ""CrackBerry"" label in the business world. Apple's 2007 introduction of the iPhone not only rocked the BlackBerry company, it shook up the world. The Canada perspective is noted (RIM was based in Waterloo, Ontario), as is Mike's aversion to 'made in China', perhaps the ultimate reason for the fall. It's likely that BlackBerry has become a Case Study in Business Schools, although the fast-paced and pressure-packed world of tech continues to require a balance of decisions focused on current markets and never-ending innovation for the future.

4 June 2023,The camera is all over the place and out of focus a lot of times. It is a shame that this wasn't done professionally!,"When I saw that this movie was about the rise and fall of the Blackberry phone, I was really intrigued and excited to go along to the cinema and watch it. It is certainly a good idea to make a movie about.

I paid for my cinema ticket and sat down. When the movie first started , I honestly thought that it was some kind of joke and that it wasn't professionally made , but made by some Film University students!

The first thing that you notice is the camera is out of focus a lot of times. It zooms into totally irrelevant props, and then zooms out. The camera is also shakey at times. Who made this film???

After 10 minutes I was really mad about the camera work and also about the poor actingf from the Cast. I sat for another 20 minutes just to give the movie a chance, but I honestly couldn't bear to watch any more! I felt like screaming! I walked out of the cinema after 30 minutes. I don't know how this movie is getting such high Ratings, as they are clearly Fake. Save your money for another movie I WANT MY MONEY BACK. This movie is just awful.",1
5 June 2023,And deduct an extra point for portrayal of offensive stereotypes.,"I made a point of watching this movie after hearing positive reviews of it on CBC radio, and was deeply disappointed. For a minute I was going to give it a 2, but decided it needed to lose an extra point for its clumsy, stupid, lazy, and woefully ignorant pastiche of reality.

I wasn't there (at RIM), but I'm of the computer R+D world and of the same age as the characters in this movie, so I have some understanding of the reality, and the reality this was not. It may be, (very) approximately, historically accurate in the overall arc of the story, but they screwed the pooch in all the details, with the result being a huge insult to the actual culture of the time *and* the professionalism of the engineers and programmers who did the work. As a rule, those guys know how to *grind*, not just play video games and give each other horsey-back rides until Michael Ironside rolls in and cracks the goddamn whip.

This is because the screenwriters and director opted for a cartoon portrayal of the people and their working relationships and environment rather than something reasonably representative and accurate. It's easier to fall back on the cliche of the ""culture clash"" between the freewheelin', game-playin', movie-watchin' nerds and their starched, stiff, humourless, suited ""bosses"". The fact is that designing products like this is *hard*, the hours long, and the work - though ultimately (one hopes) gratifying - arduous and intolerant of small errors. This makes for great books (I continue to enthusiastically recommend Tracy Kidder's ""Soul of a New Machine"" more than 40 years after its publication because it captured it perfectly), but lousy movies and TV shows (like ""Halt and Catch Fire"") because viewers' attention spans are short and it's easier just to tart up the script with nonsense to keep their attention for 90 minutes. So that's why Lazarides is a portrayed as the very model of a clueless geek savant unable to find his own zipper who finds himself with one foot uncomfortably in the business world, rather than a serious designer spending days, weeks, and months staring at the screen of a CAD workstation, and Balsillie an insufferable, explosive prick. The nuanced truth is boring as hell to watch, so just tell the actors to go all the way over the top, all the time.

I haven't read it yet, but my suggestion would be that if you want to learn the story, that's where you should probably go, because there's absolutely nothing of substance to be drawn from this sad excuse for a ""docucomedy"", or whatever on earth it's supposed to be.",1
27 July 2023,The rise and fall of BlackBerry.,"BlackBerry.

The story of the meteoric rise and catastrophic demise of the world's first smartphone.

The rise and fall of one of the iconic mobile phones, the BlackBerry that if you have never used ,you surly know someone did.

The story of the two founders of BlackBerry, Mike and Doug are two tech men with different perspectives who meet Jim the business guy to build what used to be the best cellphone back then.

It is definitely a worth telling story, I really enjoyed the first half that gave me ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" vibes somehow, it was funny until it got serious, the thing that was a bit weird for me but it should've been that way anyway.

Great performances right here especially from Glenn Howerton and I just realized that Matt Johnson directed this movie, chapeau !",7
11 June 2023,Rating: Made for tv movie,"If you are expecting a mega blockbuster movie with well known A list actors , you will be disappointed. You get a group of barely known Canadian actors who are seen on Canadian T V. Some of the actors are not realistic they seem more like cartoon characters.

J. Baruchel's performance is cringe worthy, Matt Johnson is a goof and should of stuck to directing and replaced with someone else.

The production value gives one the impression that you are watching a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation television show.

In spite of this the movie is interesting to watch, you can tell it is not a Hollywood production because there is no sex, violence, car chases, cgi , subliminal cigarette commercials or flying super heros.",6
21 August 2023,The rise and fall of a tech icon,"Do you remember the Blackberry phone, a revolutionary device before the iPhone or Android smartphones were introduced? It combined phone, messaging, and a keyboard, setting a new standard in mobile technology.

The movie Blackberry tells the story of this innovative piece of technology, from its rise to fall. While it couldn't compete with the game-changing iPhone, the movie focuses on the beginning and end of Blackberry's story, which keeps the audience engaged.

The outstanding cast, including Glenn Howerton, Jay Baruchel, and Matt Johnson, bring the characters to life with their performances. Howerton is hilarious, while Baruchel's sympathetic portrayal adds emotion to the movie.

Director Matt Johnson's use of a handheld camera style adds to the movie's immediacy and urgency. The production design and special effects are effective, and the Blackberry phone takes centre stage as the most iconic visual element.

Blackberry's pace moves briskly through plot points, with character moments that add depth. The dialogue is sharp and witty, with a few laugh-out-loud moments.

Overall, Blackberry is a fascinating biopic that reminds us of the revolutionary impact of the Blackberry phone on society. It's a must-watch for anyone interested in the history of technology or a well-crafted biopic.",8
14 May 2023,Jim Balsillie the Canadian version of STEVE JOBS...,"Never been a fan of Canadian Film and or TV, but on a few occasions I did find some. Like the Animated Series ""FUGGITABOUTIT"" for example.....3 Seasons of Pure Political Incorrectness was a dream and then finding out it was created by a buddy of mine from Toronto. BTW, i suggested him as a writer way back in 2009 when my the series I created called ""24 HOUR RENTAL"" was greenlit.. Sadly the Production just didn't understand... Either way catch his series ""FUGGETABOUTIT"" it if you can on UTUBE..

So when i heard that the movie was being released on MAY 12th, 2023 the story of ""BLACKBERRY"". I was sort of excited being a long term ""BLACKBERRY"" phone user right up to the Android version ""PRIV""

To be Frank, I was looking to loathe the ""BLACKBERRY"" movie, but I ended up loving it... I rarely watch any Canadian Crap, but the main actors like ""Glenn HOWERTON"", Jay Baruchel & the amazing Michael Ironside who played ""PURDY"" really impressed me .😁 Although music selection could have been better selected ( Kim Mitchell, RUSH, TRIUMPH, SaSS Jordan... etc....)

Glenn Howerton who plays ""Jim Balsillie"" really impressed me, although he is an American actor after all ey ! :)

And then when the character ""PURDY"" showed up on screen, I said who the hell is that amazing TERMINATOR BULLISH actor !

Did some IMDB research after the movie and it turned out to be Canadian actor ""Michael Ironside.

WOW !! Michael Ironoside can pull off a ""RIP TORN"" in seconds. If they ever decide to do a ""MEN IN BLACK #4""...... IRONSIDE is the perfect fit

A definite watch and as a former Video Store rental manager from Montreal with my own personal Frank's PICKS..... GO SEE #BLACKBERRY.",8
18 August 2023,A damn good movie! But not perfect...,"Taking two starts off for:
the horrible cinematography which seriously made it difficult to watch this movie at times
the over-the-top aggressive use of traditional movie making tactics to make this a better movie which totally backfired (for me) - for example, making Jim Balsillie this insanely annoying wall street shark who just screams at everyone... he's nothing like that. Or completely fabricating random events that never happened just to create more intensity at the end of the movie when it really wasn't necessary...


With that out of the way, this was a really good movie. This was some damn good movie. Yup. Great stuff! Just fire that DP. The acting, although annoying at times, was definitely believable. And although this was very much a fictional movie based LOOSELY on a true story I still enjoyed learning about the rise and fall of the BlackBerry (which I never had because I'm ***only*** 37). I enjoyed the fast-paced storytelling style. Just that DP, man... So many ""through the glass"" or ""from around the corner"" type of shots! I get it, you were going for that ""fly on the wall"" feel but I got more of a ""out of the room, trying to see what's going on"" type of feel instead. Do it a couple times and then just stop. It's not funny!

But this was some damn good movie for sure. Well done!",8

18 May 2023,Impressively Immersive Storytelling,"In a way for a movie with pretty much no special effects it is sad that more people won't be able to see this movie in theaters. Far and away this has got to be the best movie so far for me of 2023. Air tried to do the same thing that BlackBerry did in a compelling way, but this movie surpasses it in almost every way. Visually, I felt immersed in the story of BlackBerry and the storytelling did not feel like I was being forced to learn every detail, but instead was shown a poetic narrative of the rise and fall of the company. The acting is top-notch, and the cinematography was completely new and creative. This film does a great job of not falling into the trap of musical biopics by trying to share every detail of the story but instead gives the viewer exactly what they need to know and nothing more. I also am somebody that doesn't laugh very often in a movie theater but I was chuckling multiple times in my screening. I definitely recommend that everybody give this movie a shot because you'll be blown away with the motifs, writing, and overall immersive of this film.

1 September 2023,Loved the tech history lesson,"This is such a fascinating story. I remember the days when everyone had a BlackBerry, and to see exactly what happened behind the scenes and its inevitable downfall was genuinely interesting to watch. The cell phone revolution was a wild time and observing how businesses operated during this era made for a compelling story. The references to familiar pop culture and how it played a massive role in the development and engineering world added a cool component to this movie. I have certain memories from my childhood about pop culture, and hearing how it fit into this world was captivating.

This movie isn't flawless, though. The lead performance from Jay Baruchel was rather stale, and the movie could have benefited from a stronger lead. Glen Howerton is awesome to watch in this. I'm thrilled to see him finally break into a role outside of Always Sunny. He does a good job with most of the dramatic scenes and provides humor in plenty of moments. The rest of the performances are quite solid, with, in my opinion, the strongest coming from Matthew Johnson. He gives the most emotional weight to the story.

***Just found out Matt Johnson also directed this. Pretty awesome. He gives a great performance and also directed a good movie. Props to him.

The soundtrack was good, the directing felt pretty swift, and the writing was also strong. I don't have many complaints about the movie other than the lead performance, and maybe the movie didn't quite nail the landing towards the end. Overall, a good movie though. I would watch it again someday.",8
14 May 2023,Thoroughly entertaining film with great acting,"I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. The acting is superb and the storytelling is outstanding. Films built around technical innovations can be tedious (see both films about Steve Jobs) or smug (see The Social Network). This movie didn't fall into either trap. It also effortlessly covers topics outside of the world of mobile phones, including the NHL politics and the way that other tech hubs look down on Kitchener Waterloo. Finally, it is so refreshing to finally see a movie set in Ontario. I never thought I would see a Shoppers Drug Mart sign in the background of a shot, and there really is a Bank of Montreal on the corner of King and Erb.

8 June 2023,Better than expected!,"I had a couple of hours spare last night and found this movie on the listing and decided to give it a spin, with no great expectations. It turned out to be pretty good!

As a guy in my late 50s, I knew all about the public facing of Blackberry and how it virtually took over the mobile world for a time, before Steve Jobs and Apple snatched the market away. What I didn't know about were the characters involved and what went on behind the scenes with the founding and rise of RIM.

From i have subsequently read, the basics of the movie seem quite accurate. The actors all play their parts rather well. Howerton (CEO Jim Basillie), Baruchel (Mike Lazaridis) and Johnson (Doug Fregin) all play their roles with gusto. And then Michael Ironside rather steals the show as the disciplinarian COO Charles Purdy.

Well worth watching!",8
14 May 2023,Technological Ride,"If I could describe this film, it would be similar to having a cocktail of The Social Network and The Office, with some sprinkling of its own identity. As I rarely write reviews, I find myself writing this to invite you, reader, to watch this film and to admire the amazing performances of Glenn Howerton, Jay Baruschel, and Matt Johnson, as well as to learn about some of the events that transpired in the technological advancements of our time.

The film does what it's meant to do, and the watcher sits there waiting to know what transpires next. I can say that this film is worth your while.

Who knew that a film about a phone could be so enjoyable!

11 July 2023,BlackBerry 0 - NHL 1,"It was a good movie, especially for those who have lived with this nostalgia (oh boy how quickly time flies).

As much as I am familiar with the lovely product of that time (Blackberry), but I had no idea about the behind the scenes and their managers, so I hope that this movie is a faithful adaptation of what really happened.

The speed of showing the events in the film is very high, they have avoided details, because they did not focus on a single point of the history of this brand, but they showed the entire history of the brand in 2 hours.

The acting was very good, the cinematography suited the speed of the film, and I think the only weak point of the film was the music, because now that I think about it, I don't remember anything from it and it was not remarkable!

And as for the story of the film, the aim is to show the fall of an empire, well, the director has been completely successful in this act and has done what he should induce to the viewer.

I would love to know if Jim has seen this movie? His reaction...",7
30 June 2023,The Juggernaut before Iphone,"BlackBerry is a dark comedy that glosses over the history of the BlackBerry from its origins to inception to its downfall.

Honestly never thought they would make a movie like this but I'm glad they did. Now a days we can easily forget that there ever was a BlackBerry phone and it will probably fade with time as younger and younger generations come along. It has an important role in the place of the smartphone generation as it truly was the first of its kind.

This film is helmed by Matt Johnson who actually plays one of the main characters Doug. The main two characters are played by Jay Baruchel and Glenn Howerton both well know comedy actors. Going into this I should've expected as much but I didn't think the comedy would be this spot on! This movie is hilarious and the pacing of this film is phenomenal! There isn't really a dull moment in this movie as we progressively go through the BlackBerry's development relatively quickly!

It's a biopic so it has a similar lens from a filming perspective although they definitely give you a 90's lens film vibe from this. If you are a 90's baby or grew up during this time the nostalgic call backs and showcasing will make you really miss those simpler times! I got major nostalgia watching this movie and how tech worked back then to see how rapidly it has improved since is extremely rapid. This movie demonstrates that very well but in a witty, humorous and inevitably somber note.

This is a sleeper movie for the year of 2023 so far! If you want to watch this right now it's available to rent or buy.",8
23 July 2023,Blackberry,"I was in IT when the blackberry came out. I have had many cell phones. This movie hits the nail on the head about the physical keyboard. This feature can't be replaced with a virtual keyboard. I don't care what anyone says about the virtual keyboard. The physical keyboard can't be and never will be replaced! I don't care what IPhone or Androids provide as far as Apps. The Blackberry was intended for businesses. I think these developers at Apple should provide users with a physical pullout keyboard. The blackberry was intended for business use. I could type 90 wpm on a blackberry. I have owned Androids after blackberry went under, and NOTHING compares to a blackberry. If someone would come out with a physical keyboard, I would buy it.

4 July 2023,Surprisingly good,"Amazing movie, the two lead are excellent in this, Glenn Howerton and Jay baruchel both deserve oscar nominations for this, i never had a Blackberry im not that old, it just weird a cell phone with buttons , you type the letter in the manual keyboard and you sent messages, i cant imagine how awkward must have been for someone with fat thumbs, i always used iPhone so this is new for me, this story is very interesting, Glenn character was fired from his job and now he is the CEO of this company where he is basically the one who runs the numbers, Baruchel character is the one who is in charge of the product itself, the cinematography by the new director is pretty stylish and nothing generic, anyways on ly positive things about this movie, top 10 of the year for sure.

23 May 2023,Entertaining but heavily fictionalized account of Blackberry's rise and fall.,"Very well acted, though a rather unappealing film to look at with unnecessarily drab colors and art direction, even for a documentary-feel. The film has been criticized by former RIM employees as playing far too fast and loose with the truth and portrayal of the key personalities involved. The result is an entertaining but unreliable telling of a paradigm shift in how business is conducted and how people approach their professional and personal communications. An actual documentary would likely be very engrossing as the story behind Blackberry is remarkable enough that it doesn't need to be ""punched up"" to maintain viewer interest. But that's a movie for another day, if ever.

16 May 2023,Did it really happen this way?,"I don't know if the rise and downfall of Blackberry happened exactly as portrayed in the movie. But it sure convinced me it did. The Blackberry group was first named Research in Motion and it stayed that way until it found an investor in Jim Balsillie. Then it became a sexier name - Blackberry. I saw this movie with a 3/4 full audience and everyone was fixated on the story. I was too because I was watching a great company with a great invention (the cell phone) go down the tubes because of egos, incompetence, brilliance, manipulation and power struggles. Much like the Social Network, this movie showed us that nerdy engineers can be screw-ups too. Few of them are wired to be savvy cunning business men. The company relied on Balsillie to make the deals with leading providers like AT&T, and it worked until Steve Jobs invented the Apple smartphone.

The movie had snappy dialogue, great acting because I believed the nerds were nerds and the businessmen were manipulators.

17 May 2023,A great Film that people should go out and see,"This is a great overall film that I would recommend. It's a great blend of comedy and drama. This movie isn't intended to be inspirational. It essentially wants to tell the story of how Blackberry came to dominate and how it eventually fell apart. This film stuck to the script and did exactly what it set out to do. It is well written and I enjoyed how the cinematography felt like ""The Office"" in some parts. The sound and music choices all fit very well. There are some great moments of suspense and the runtime breezes by.

The performances were all very good. Matt Johnson as Doug was very funny but he also had some tense moments that added to the drama. Glenn Howerton as Jim Balsillie was great, personally he was the standout. His character drove this story from beginning to end. He was serious and driven but he was also funny. Jay Baruchel as Mike Lazaridis was also well acted. He was able to show his range as an actor by displaying different emotions throughout. At first he was a bit subtle playing this shy person but as the film progressed he ended up being a bit more assertive. Throughout the film he was able to demonstrate how nerve wracking it can be to develop a new product and try to sell it. The only negative about his character was the hair makeup. It was noticeably fake and did not look right.

If you enjoyed ""Air"" then you would also enjoy this film.",8
23 May 2023,Incredibly well written and acted,"This film exceeded my expectations for sure. A film about a tech companies story isn't typically one that i'd think would have me on the edge of my seat but it did from beginning to end. The film cranks the tension up to 10 immediately and throws in tons of great jokes that hit hard in such a suspenseful movie. The pacing makes it feel like an hour long instead of two. The acting is perfect. Glenn Howerton's performance in particular is so intriguing that every time he's on screen I couldn't look away. Matt Johnson is hilarious and provides tons of comedic relief.

Go see this film, it will not disappoint.

5 June 2023,Great story - horrible choice of cinematic look,"There is much to like about the story but very hard to watch. I cannot even write anything in depth about story - actors - script because the film is so distractingly ugly (director and producer choice?) So what happened here. Digital cameras are of such high quality the decision to make a film look like this is inexcusable. This story needed to be told - it is not just a Canadian story it's a great story. It is discouraging the cinematic choice made this look like a 1960's/70's Canadian film with its colourless palette - pretend documentary feel and lacklustre direction. It took me 6 hours to get through this film because there was only so much I could tolerate at one sitting. I'm SAD.

At its peak, BlackBerry had 45% market share and had earned it's ""CrackBerry"" label in the business world. Apple's 2007 introduction of the iPhone not only rocked the BlackBerry company, it shook up the world. The Canada perspective is noted (RIM was based in Waterloo, Ontario), as is Mike's aversion to 'made in China', perhaps the ultimate reason for the fall. It's likely that BlackBerry has become a Case Study in Business Schools, although the fast-paced and pressure-packed world of tech continues to require a balance of decisions focused on current markets and never-ending innovation for the future.

24 September 2023,Still Rock'n the BBQ10!,"I love it. I love what it meant. 10 years, 2 batteries, and I still can't imagine going to a 'smart' phone. I sure wish they were still around, I could use a better weather app! Lol

Blackberry. Why oh why?

You invented the industry. But it sure was short lived. In hindsight, I really do not know what could have saved you. I don't know how much of this movie is true, but it sure portrayed you were always struggling with something internally. Maybe with a bit of better historical luck, you'd still be around?

As for the movie itself. I think it would only appeal to those that have once been a Crackberry addict. There was something special about it when everyone else was on other phones. That same addiction is present with anyone using a phone today, but its does not have that special thing that the Crackberry had. The addiction was exclusive. Crackberry addicts know what I'm talking about. As for the rest of you, you might want to pass on this movie.

The best part about this movie is how well they brought back feelings of nostalgia for those days. The days before the internet. When people spent time in rooms interacting with one another. Those were the days.

The worse part of this movie is how forced some of the characters were. Not quite overacting, but not quite 'real' either. The chemistry was not there. A lot of scenes just felt to forced to me. Like good enough, 'were not trying to make a good movie, were just here to tell a story.' A story I'm glad to see, but not one I wish to see again.

In the mean time, still pushing my Blackberry for as long as I can!",6
25 June 2023,"Work Hard, Fail Hard.","In all honesty this may be the best biopic of the year so far. BlackBerry showcases probably the biggest rise and fall stories in the smartphone industry. A strong performance from the cast providing authentic emotion and chemistry on screen as well as I actually found myself laughing a quite a bit with this film but without it feeling corny or forced. It all felt natural, especially with the cinematography giving the feeling that the viewer is involved in the story in real time like in ""The Office"" but without the mid scene interviews. As a fellow Canadian this film touched home quite a bit and I was overall pleased with the final outcome.

4 June 2023,Its about Capitalism not Technology,"Was interested to see this film when I assumed it was about building the Blackberry device itself. Its not a bad dramatization, just different from my expectations. The film is more focused on the perspective of Blackberry's CEOs. And the trials and tribulations of poor capitalists just trying to make it on the mean streets of Canada in the early 2000s.

Not too much action or drama with this one. It felt very linear. Cast and cinematography were great, its just not a very intriguing story/script. I would have liked to see the development of the Blackberry and their implementation of its technology. But, to be fair that'd prob be very boring to most audiences.

12 June 2023,What a horrible prosthesis,"Started to watch this movie with my wife last night. It was slow moving, at times inaccurate and didn't hold my interest for very long. The acting by some was stilted and the periodic shots with hand-held cameras were at the very least disconcerting. And speaking of disconcerting, the prothesis that Glen Howerton was wearing was beyond ridiculous and very apparent. If you look at headshots of Howerton you will see he has massive amounts of hair. Pulling a prothesis over all that hair to make him appear as if he was bald was a stupid decision by whoever was in charge of makeup. They should have simply shaved his head.

26 August 2023,A Brief History of Blackberry,"Blackberry is a smartly directed and excellently written biopic that builds all the suspense well to make the audience witness the birth of the first smartphone. The humor shown in this story-based film is also very straightforward, sharp, entertaining and provides an overview of business competition in the technology industry. This film would not be as successful and uplifting without brilliant directing from Matt Johnson (who also played as supporting character) and stunning acting performances from Jay Baruchel and Glenn Howerton - the perfect trio combination that easily makes Blackberry one of the best drama films of the year.

8 July 2023,Documents an important part of consumer tech history,"I'm a lifelong geek, and was a heavy user of U. Of Waterloo software when I was studying computer science in university. It was a slam dunk that I would like this film, so, on my way out of the theatre, I surveyed some non-geeks for their opinion of the film. They liked it, too. One person viewed it as another Steve Jobs story.

The portrayal of the rank-and-file RIM employees was over the top, but not by much. I worked with people like that. The potrayal of the ""suit"" Jim Balsillie was believable.

I agree with the ""goofs"" entry that the appearance of the Android OS in the marketplace should have been covered as a significant factor in the Blackberry's demise. It's a fact that RIM didn't make any improvements in the Blackberry OS for eight years, which is suicidal in the high tech industry.

I also feel a need to say that the side story of Balsillie's effort to purchase an NHL team was worthwhile. I think it's criminal that there is an NHL team in Phoenix, but not in Hamilton.",10
15 July 2023,Bittersweet like a berry itself,"I really miss Blackberry and was both happy and heartbroken to see the story about my most favourite phones ever (and how i wish there could be a happy ending! Honestly i was hoping for a real announcement of the triumphant return of Blackberry phones in the end). The movie is bittersweet like a berry itself: full of humor, life, emotions, disappointments, it also discovered some facts and details I didn't know about. The cast is simply brilliant: what a wonderful job did everyone in this movie! Now i'm going to cry over the dead screens of my very first and the last Blackberry models whole night long.

18 June 2023,So that's how you honor mistakes?,"Greetings again from the darkness. There aren't too many companies who have reached the pinnacle of their industry, only to later flop due to lack of innovation or a stubborn insistence on holding on to the past. Tremendous success and absolute failure are not typically associated with the same company. Blockbuster Video and Pan Am Airlines come to mind as examples of industry leaders whose refusal to adapt, culminated with closure, and it's likely that Blackberry belongs in the category, at least as presented here by writer-director Matt Johnson and co-writer Matthew Miller, adapting the book by Jacquie McNish.

Socially awkward pals, Mike Lazaridis (played by Jay Baruchel) and Doug Fregin (played by the film's director Matt Johnson), co-founded Research in Motion (RIM). The film picks up in 1996 when Mike and Doug are making their first presentation of their breakthrough handheld data delivery-email machine, which they have named Pocket Link. These are two genius nerds with no concept of how the outside business worlds functions, and the executive to whom they are pitching is so distracted that his only feedback is, ""You need a new name."" In a fascinating twist, that same executive, Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton, ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"") ends up saving not just the new product, but also the company.

Balsillie presents himself as a fireball, take charge, full-steam-ahead kind of guy. It's quite a contrast to nerdy Mike and easy-going Doug. Mike is a quiet guy committed to perfection in his work, while Doug wrangles the tech developers with a culture of video games, movie night, and an overall fraternity environment. Balsillie's arrival as a vocal outrage expert and brash businessman changes everything, and he and Mike drive the newly named BlackBerry to levels not previously seen. We do get a humorous anecdote from a shirt stain (even though it's not a true story), and in fact, there is quite a bit of humor throughout.

We are informed that the film was ""inspired by real people and real events"", so some dramatic license is expected. Perhaps the best comparison is THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010), and while that film was more polished, I personally found this one more entertaining and accurate from a business sense. An excellent supporting cast includes Cary Elwes, Saul Rubinek, Michael Ironside, Martin Donovan, Rich Sommer, and SungWon Cho, and the film's real draw is the contrast between Jay Baruchel's mousy but brilliant Mike, and Glenn Howard's powerhouse portrayal of the egotistical Balsillie. Baruchel's scene where he reacts to the new iPhone is alone worth the price of admission.

At its peak, BlackBerry had 45% market share and had earned it's ""CrackBerry"" label in the business world. Apple's 2007 introduction of the iPhone not only rocked the BlackBerry company, it shook up the world. The Canada perspective is noted (RIM was based in Waterloo, Ontario), as is Mike's aversion to 'made in China', perhaps the ultimate reason for the fall. It's likely that BlackBerry has become a Case Study in Business Schools, although the fast-paced and pressure-packed world of tech continues to require a balance of decisions focused on current markets and never-ending innovation for the future.

3 June 2023,"Beautiful cinematography, great storyline, and wonderful performances from all the actors.","I'll admit I never thought I would have thoroughly enjoyed a movie talking about the rise and fall of an old mobile phone company that peaked over a decade ago. The storyline, while mostly business-centered, manages to be consistently entertaining as well as tense throughout the run of the movie. The main characters of the movie are all pretty fleshed out and well rounded, and the actors performances left me wanting more after it was all finished. My favourite acting performance was definitely that of director Matt Johnson as Doug Fredin, a character who represents integrity in the business world in the movie. Special shout out to Glenn Howerton's portrayal of Jim Balsillie as well, who is delightfully unhinged in mostly all the scenes he's in.

20 July 2023,An exploration of how a phone revolutionised the world.,"""Blackberry"" is a gripping and nostalgic journey that takes its viewers back to a time when a seemingly ordinary device changed the course of history. Directed by a masterful storyteller, the film manages to turn a potentially mundane concept into a captivating exploration of how a phone revolutionised the world.

The movie boasts an outstanding cast, with Jay Baruchel and Glenn Howerton delivering excellent performances that leave a lasting impact. Howerton portrays a no-nonsense businessman whose character embodies the essence of the corporate world. His portrayal is commanding, sharp, and at times, even intimidating, adding an intriguing layer to the film's narrative.

The plot might seem unremarkable on the surface: a film about a phone could easily be written off as dull or lacking in depth. However, ""Blackberry"" defies expectations, as it weaves a rich tapestry of human connections, innovation, and the profound impact a simple handheld device had on global communication.

What sets this film apart is its ability to evoke nostalgia and resonate with those who have experienced the era of Blackberry phones. For those who owned a Blackberry, the movie feels like a deeply personal journey, reigniting memories of the device's tactile keyboard and the thrill of receiving those distinctive BBM messages. But even for those who didn't own a Blackberry, the film offers a compelling and immersive glimpse into a pivotal moment in technological history.

The storytelling is expertly crafted, moving back and forth between the past and the present, capturing both the rise and fall of the Blackberry phenomenon. It beautifully juxtaposes the enthusiasm and optimism of the past with the introspection and introspective reflections of the present day. As the characters reminisce about their experiences with the iconic phone, they highlight the deeper societal impact and the lasting legacy of this once-revolutionary device.

Beyond the captivating storytelling, ""Blackberry"" also offers a profound insight into the role of technology in shaping society. It reminds us of a time when smartphones were not just tools for socialising and entertainment but genuine game-changers in business and communication. The film delves into the struggles and triumphs of the people behind the Blackberry's creation, reminding us of the ingenuity and passion that goes into transformative innovations.

Additionally, the film's attention to detail in recreating the era adds to its authenticity. The nostalgia-infused soundtrack, the vintage technology on display, and the stylish wardrobe choices contribute to transporting the audience back in time.

In conclusion, ""Blackberry"" is a remarkable cinematic experience that surpasses expectations. The exceptional performances from Jay Baruchel and Glenn Howerton, coupled with the film's ability to evoke nostalgia and offer valuable insights into technological history, make it a must-watch for audiences of all ages. Even if the concept initially sounds unexciting, ""Blackberry"" proves to be a poignant and memorable journey that will leave a lasting impact on viewers long after they leave the cinema.",7

4 June 2023,Financed by Socialism from Canada,"Great movie. It would've been a lot better for if it hadn't been paid for by Justin Trudeau's socialist government. Even though they finally went down the tubes surely the folks at BlackBerry have enough money to pay to make their own movie without government support. Great movie.

Even though they finally went down the tubes surely the folks at BlackBerry have enough money to pay to make their own movie without government support. I surely paid them enough money in the early 2000s not switching to iPhones until I absolutely had to because the BlackBerry server network finally was going down.
