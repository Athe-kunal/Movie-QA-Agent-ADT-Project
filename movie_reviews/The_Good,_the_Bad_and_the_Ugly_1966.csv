29 June 2006,"For a girl who doesn't enjoy westerns much, this was one of the greatest films ever!","Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

16 April 2001,"Brutal, brilliant, and one of the best Westerns ever made","A sprawling Western epic that follows the adventures of three gunfighters looking for $200,000 in stolen gold, Sergio Leone's `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is a masterpiece, one that continues to get better and better with each viewing. In a way, it's a morality play, weighing the consequences of good and evil, but it does so in a realistic manner. Sometimes, crime does pay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good does go unrewarded. This film probably signaled the death knell of the traditional John Wayne `White Hat/Black Hat' Western.

The three main characters make the film. Lee Van Cleef (`The Bad') is evil personified. Totally ruthless, he'll do whatever it takes to get what he wants. Clint Eastwood (`The Good') is the Man With No Name, not really `good' in a traditional sense . . . but he has a certain sense of honor and tries to do the right thing. (Watch the scene when he gives a dying Confederate soldier a puff of his cigar - powerful, and it sums up everything that the Man With No Name is all about, without saying a single word.) Eli Wallach (`The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most complex - if not the best - character in the film. All impulse and rage, Tuco spins wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be Clint Eastwood's best friend in one scene, trying to kill him in another - Tuco truly represents `the ugly' side of people.

The movie is long, but there's not a wasted scene in the film. Each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more about each character and what's going on. The pacing is incredible, as is the direction - Sergio Leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film, keeping the film from ever getting predictable. Any typical Western cliché that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling. Of special mention is Ennio Morricone's score, which is absolutely perfect. Two scenes - one in a Union prison camp, one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film - are amazing on their own, but they become absolutely astonishing with combined with Morricone's powerful score.

This movie is absolutely brilliant. If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly urge to do so. Immediately. (And then, go watch `Unforgiven' . . . in a way, I think that `Unforgiven' is the sequel to `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly - it's the story of what eventually happened to the Man With No Name.) `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is easily one of the best Westerns ever made.

1 January 2004,Sergio Leone's penultimate Italian-western; a film that gets better with each passing year...,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it?

25 November 2006,"""There are two kinds of people in this world, my friend""","Sergio Leone always wanted every picture he made to be, in every way, bigger than the one which preceded it. With the Good, the Bad and the Ugly he continued his upward trajectory and rounded off his dollars trilogy in style.

This picture was Leone's most stylised and grandiose to date, and brought all the themes and styles he had been developing in his earliest films to perfection. Among the most notable was his characterisation, particularly his all-important introductions of characters. Look at the introductory scenes of the three leads. We first see Tuco bursting out of a window, obviously interrupted in the middle of a meal, and straight away we get his freeze-frame and the title ""the ugly""  this is a simple character, and needs no further introduction. Angeleyes appears out of the distance, but grows towards us until his face fills the screen. We see him commit two despicable acts of murder and treachery before we get his freeze-frame and title ""the bad"", telling us he is pure evil. Finally, in Blondie's first appearance he steps into the frame from behind the camera, as if he had always been there. He rescues Tuco, but only for his own profit. It's not until we have seen him betray and abandon Tuco that we get his freeze-frame and title ""the good""  obviously a fairly ironic label given the way he has just acted.

Leone's trademark long drawn out face-offs  exaggerated versions of the shootouts of John Ford westerns and the sword duels of Kurosawa's samurai films  are also brought to a peak here. Not only are they now taken to absurd heights of stylisation, they are also spread out and adapted to cover the whole picture, until the point where even two men sitting opposite each other eating a meal and glancing suspiciously at one another is treated like another stand off. In fact, the entire film can be considered one long series of duels.

We also see more of the importance Leone attaches to church and family. The Dollars trilogy could be thought to lack emotion, taking place as it does in a world where there are no morals and everyone is out for gold. However the Good, the Bad and the Ugly contains several moments of poignancy, perhaps the most prominent of which is when Tuco confronts his estranged priest brother.

Religious iconography and references crops up time and again. Leone loved biblical epics almost as much as he loved westerns, and there is something of the feel of those pictures here in the overwhelming landscapes and eerie, choral music. On top of this the central trio can be read as an allegory for God, the Devil and humanity. This arguably presents rather a cynical view of the Catholic faith  given the treacherous and chequered nature of the ""good""  but it could be argued to be a typically Italian one. In a country in which the church is so omnipresent and universally accepted, it's sometimes said that God is cursed as much as loved. Having said that, this was clearly never intended as the central theme  Leone wasn't trying to make some grand statement here  it's simply part of the mix of ideas going on in this picture.

This brings me onto the war theme. Anti-war sentiments are not directly addressed in this picture, but the way the civil war is woven into the plot makes a powerful statement. For the first half hour we don't see that the war is going on. The central characters aren't concerned with the it  they are only interested in hunting down the gold. However the war encroaches on the plot more and more often, until it moves from background to foreground and takes over the entire picture, culminating in a colossal battle scene. And of course the fact that the film ends in a huge military graveyard is also very significant.

I've spent so long talking about the themes and ideas going on in this film I've nearly run out of space to talk about all the genius that has gone into making it so enjoyable. The dialogue is superb, often funny and plenty of it quotable. Technically Leone has perfected his art  he composes a shot like John Ford, edits like Eisenstein, paces like Kurosawa, but all with a degree of his own originality. There is brilliant acting  Eli Wallach steals it as Tuco, probably his best ever performance. It's funny how Lee Van Cleef was cast as a villain here. Van Cleef's early career mostly involved playing mean-looking gang members, but as Leone discovered when casting him as the hero in For a Few Dollars More, while his face said ""bad guy"" his voice and manner could be warm and likable. The good guy Van Cleef obviously proved more popular, as in the dozen or so other spaghetti westerns he made for other directors he was invariably cast as the hero.

Just time for a final word on the recent (2003) restored edition. While it's great that several lost scenes have been added, I have to say that very few of them were entirely necessary. The only one of the added scenes I really like is the one in which Angeleyes visits the field hospital  it keeps his story arc going, and also shows an act of compassion from the ""bad"" when he lets the soldier keep the bottle. However the new dubbing for these scenes, strange as it may seem considering today's technology, is mixed absolutely atrociously. On top of this, Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach are now so elderly, they actually sound less convincing than the guy impersonating the late Lee Van Cleef. As a result the restored segments stick out like sore thumbs, and break up the flow of what is in every other way a perfect motion picture.",10
19 February 2009,"The Good, the Better, the Best","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly or the Good, the Better and the Best, as I prefer calling it, is a bizarrely sublime and a uniquely aesthetic masterpiece. The actors in title roles have given such extraordinarily superb performances, that it would be impertinent and disparaging to merely regard their swell work as acting. In fact their brilliant portrayals have immortalized Blondie, Sentenza/ Angel Eyes and the enigmatic Tuco. Lee Van Cleef is fiendishly unforgiving as the merciless Angel Eyes. Clint Eastwood is rugged yet suave, cocky yet adorable as laconic cigar-smoker Blondie, a role that laid the foundations of his illustrious career. But it is Eli Wallach, who steals the show with his captivating portrayal of Tuco, a portrayal that is as entrancing as it is enlightening. Wallach is amusing, capricious, nonchalant, uncanny and yet tenacious as Tuco, perturbed by his insecurities and dampened by his solitude. It is the tacit amicability between Blondie and Tuco and their mutual hostility towards the evil Angel Eyes owing to the vestiges of virtue present in them, redolent of their moribund morality, which gives the story, the impetus and the characters, a screen presence that is not only awe inspiring but also unparalleled.

Sergio Leone's magnificent and ingenious direction in synergy with Ennio Morricone's surreal music, Tonino Delli Colli's breathtaking cinematography and Joe D'Augustine's punctilious editing makes the movie, a treat to watch and ineffably unforgettable. Initially aimed to be a tongue-in-cheek satire on run-of-the-mill westerns, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, continues to stand the test of time in its endeavor to attain apotheosis (if it hasn't attained it yet). It will always be remembered as European cinema's greatest lagniappe, not only to the Western genre, but to the world of cinema.

It's a must watch for any movie lover. 10/10",10
24 August 2005,the greatest of the great!,"I wasn't sure if I was going to comment on this film because everything has already been said by the hundreds of other people who have posted their thoughts, but I decided that I should really put my two cents in since this is my favorite movie.

This film, in my opinion, is not only the greatest spaghetti western of all time. It is the greatest movie of all time. Period. Regardless of genre. I could probably watch it every day, and be perfectly happy doing so.

The music is perfection. The way the music drives this movie is absolutely amazing. The musical genius of Morricone and the incredible direction of Sergio Leone is a combination that will probably never be equaled. The theme song will forever be etched in your brain. In fact, it probably already is, even if you haven't seen the movie! The scene where Tuco runs through the graveyard with the song ""Ecstacy of Gold"" is pure poetry. And the showdown at the end with that great music- just incredible.

The story is riveting. There is not a single dull moment. The movie is long, but Leone's direction is so good that you will love the fact that you can enjoy this movie for three hours.

Lee Van Cleef is my favorite spaghetti western actor, and he is incredible as ""Angel Eyes."" It is the part he was born to play. Eli Wallach is perfect as Tuco. He really shines in this movie. Some people say he steals the show, and I can see why they think so. Eastwood is excellent as ""Blondie,"" although I don't think Eastwood has as strong of a presence as Van Cleef (I know many will disagree, and that's OK because all three actors are superb in this film so why split hairs?).

This movie is hypnotic. It's operatic. It's sad. It's funny. It's gritty. It's violent. It's art. It's action. It's pure entertainment. The film is just so incredible on so many different levels that EVERYONE should see it, regardless of what kinds of movies they are into. And it's so cool that the greatest flick ever just happens to be a spaghetti western. If you haven't seen this movie, stop what you are doing, and go get it now!!",10
11 February 2018,A Cinematic Masterpiece - And Also The Most Entertaining Western Of All Time,"I'll keep this brief: This is simply one of the most entertaining and best looking westerns ever. Director Sergio Leone's unique use of the camera - long, uninterrupted shots in wide angle alternating with extreme close-ups - and Ennio Morricone's unique, wildly inventive soundtrack are blended to perfection. The career-making performances by Eli Wallach (hilarious), Lee Van Cleef (chilling) and Clint Eastwood (cool) are nothing short of iconic, and the film's finale is so good it will send shivers of cinematic joy down your spine. It's a movie of epic proportions; it's funny and violent, but underneath it all there is a strong anti-war message. It's a cinematic masterpiece and one of the most influential movies of all time. Oh, and it's also tons of fun, and you should see it on the biggest screen possible. 10 stars out of 10.

20 July 2018,The best Western ever made,"Filmed in Spain by Italian filmmaker, this is the best Western ever made. With Hollywood actors but fittingly, not made in Hollywood, it was despised by the mainstream at the time, but also recognized for its genius and is the most famous part of the most famous Western trilogy. Building on a rich Italian storytelling and film making tradition, with unforgettable score, this movie has justly taken the place it now holds. If you have not seen it yet, do it. Equally subversive and authentic, this is just one master piece nobody should miss.

21 August 2006,The King of Cool,"On a partial first viewing, I didn't like ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" I thought it was a slow, tedious story about a bunch of unpleasant jerk characters involved in a bog-standard conflict over money. It all seemed very macho and self-consciously cool, and it had obviously inspired all the overrated macho directors I don't like in my own generation - Tarantino, for example, and Robert Rodriguez. In short, I was unimpressed.

Years later, I gave the film a second shot, watching it all the way through this time. I loved it. What had changed?

For one thing, I took more notice of the technical side of the film. I paid attention to Leone's famous use of close-ups, his selection of memorable character actors, and his wonderful scene-setting. I admired the detailed sets and the sweeping landscapes, the props and the costumes and all those weird, wonderful faces that Leone clearly loved to photograph.

I also got hooked by some of the quieter moments that I had skipped over in my first viewing. One of the most effective scenes involves Eli Wallach's character, Tuco, quarreling with his brother when they meet after they've been apart for years. Their argument is great, emotionally charged stuff, made all the more effective by the suggestion that they really do love and care about each other. It's the kind of sensitive, human scene you never get to see in a Tarantino or Rodriguez movie.

Before I get too fuzzy-wuzzy, I should also like to point out that, on my second viewing, I LOVED all the action, too. Every gunfight is great, in its own way, and they're all a bit different. The greatest of them all is, of course, the final confrontation between the trio, which is accompanied by some of the most rousing music I've ever heard in a film. And hey, there's even a huge Civil War battle to provide a change of pace from all the small-scale action.

Ultimately, ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is probably just a potboiler of a film, without too much to say about, for example, the human condition. But what a potboiler! It doesn't have to try to be cool - it simply IS cool. In fact, it probably defined heroic coolness for an entire generation. Eli Wallach's performance, Leone's direction and Morricone's music alone are enough to elevate it to classic status - and the fact that everything else in the movie is great, too, helps elevate it to the level of perhaps the greatest action film ever made.

And to think, I missed all that the first time through...",10
2 March 2023,Made me love Western. Brilliant! ⭐,"I wasn't aware of the wild taste of Western. This movie made me love Western. I don't know any movie can achieve being this much effective nearly without any drama. Nearly every great movie is carried by some drama between characters.

Yes it has a little bit drama. It shows the greediness of humanity just like The Treasue of Sierra Madre. It refletcs conflicts between three different types of men. Also I love how Eastwood's character is nameless in The Man Without Name Trilogy. Sometimes the trilogy also called The Dollar Trilogy.

Besides the storyline the techincs are breathtaking.

Acting performances are just breathtaking. If you didn't notice that much of acting skills, then you should check Trivias of the movie.

The Scores just one of the bests. Morricone just made the most iconic scores. From that time until now, every Western score has his iconic type.

Set decoration is about something enormous in this movie. They really did something great with that too.

Costume design and makeups are also so good. You can see it in the battle scenes and in the desert scenes.

Sound is really good, the only decent thing is Film Editing. Especially in the Extended Versions some flaws appears.",10
26 December 2007,Primal honesty and morality,"After many years of barely watching any movies, I treated myself to several classics recently. And this was the best.

That I so enjoyed this movie so much came as a shock to me. I literally never before have been able to even sit through a western, which (in my admittedly limited experience) was schlock action starring John Wayne as the taciturn all-American good guy being tough and beating up the outlaws. Watching GBU, I was enthralled for the entire three hours. Twice. And if I had time, I would have watched it a third time.

The setting is typically western: a dry, dusty panorama in which men barely co-exist with each other; few wasted words; and lots of action, horses, and gunfighting in a wild west barely governed by incipient institutions of law & order  all shrouded within a morality play of good vs. bad. But what I liked so much is exactly what I hate about John Wayne westerns  the seriousness and honesty with which moral context is considered. In Hollywood, good vs. bad is as thoughtlessly superscripted as the protagonists' white and black hats. In GBU every remnant of moralizing has been ruthlessly cut.

Good, Bad, and Ugly are personified in the form of three characters: Bad (""Sentenza"") is the easiest to understand. He is *very* bad, perhaps not so different from other villains, but much more sharply developed; murderous, sadistic, traitorous, and remorseless. Good (""Blondie"") and Ugly (""Tuco"") are more puzzling, but their labels are the key to the movie. Both Blondie and Tuco are outlaws and killers with only the barest hint of morality, but they're not evil in the same way that Sentenza is. Tuco is demonstrative, emotional, loud, wild, and unpredictable; but driven by survival rather than satanic urges. Blondie is cool, calm, rational and controlled  in many ways similar to Sentenza  but whereas Sentenza tortures, maims, kills, and lies for the hell of it, even apparently enjoys it, Blondie simply goes about his business coolly, and shows several poignant hints of empathy, decency, and a sense of justice.

GBU takes place during the Civil War and strips away the high-level political struggle of history books, leaving us with the soldier's vantage point of brutality, pointless death, and some individual decency. The politics are indecipherable from this vantage point. GBU hits this point home when our protagonists wind up in a prison camp because the oncoming gray cavalry uniforms turn out to be dust-covered blue. Later, they encounter an army fighting over a worthless bridge, suffering countless pointless deaths and casualties. Because Leone has so rigorously excised traditional off-the-shelf morality, the few instances of humanity are remarkably poignant. One such instance is when Blondie shares his coat and cigar with a dying soldier; another is when prisoners are forced  by Sentenza's orders  to play music to cover up the screams of the tortured. Sentenza apparently enjoyed the irony of beautiful sounds used for such ends; the musicians are, of course, pained by it.

That was one of many extraordinarily striking scenes. The honesty of the moral context was what I liked best about the film, but I liked everything else too. Indeed the same primal, ruthless honesty that characterizes the character development pervades the film. The music is unlike anything I'd ever heard  it's an audible version of the arid west and the tensions and lawlessness that characterize the film. Underlying the entire score is one instantly memorable theme starting off with what sounds like a screaming hyena. The story took place in New Mexico, and even though it was filmed in Spain, it really does look like New Mexico; and just as in life in the American west, the wide, breathtaking panorama tends to subordinates dialog. Indeed, it is several minutes into the film before even one word is spoken.

The plot was extremely clever  and never predictable. High level suspense is maintained for the full three hours. It was hard to imagine how it could unfold  three uncompromising outlaws in search of one buried treasure; cooperation was not in their nature, but nothing was ever done out of character. Any Western cliché that you can think of is either given a unique twist or destroyed by masterful storytelling. For example there is an utterly irreverent scene in which Tuco meets his brother, a sincere Priest, and turns platitudes upside down. The brother begins with the standard rebuke of the criminal's behavior, but Tuco punches back and says, ""Where we come from there were only two ways out. You lacked the courage to do what I've done."" The movie is also irreverently funny: For example, Twice Tuco gained the upper hand on Blondie and said:

""There are two kinds of spurs(?), my friend. Those that come in by the door, and (crosses himself) those that come in by the window.""

""There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. Those who have a rope around their neck and those who have the job of cutting."" Later Blondie gained the advantage of Tuco and observed:

""You see in this world there's two kinds of people my friend - those with loaded guns, and those who dig. You dig."" In addition to all these specific attributes, a unique and strikingly cool style infuses the entire film: long scenes of tense silences  never for an instant boring; and telling, startling close-ups and transitions. Most noteworthy was the film's climax. As the protagonists stand there with their fingers on their holsters, waiting for the first person to go for their gun(s), the transitions start out slowly, and speed up as the tension increases. As I write this, I wish I had my own copy of the film, just so I could see this scene again.

Not just a great western, but easily one of the best movies of *any* kind ever made.",10
29 August 1999,film making of the highest order,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it?

9 September 2016,What got Quentin Tarantino so damn excited...,"One of the original Leone ""Italian Westerns"" that quickened the pulse of a young Quentin Tarantino.

Sometimes I think I am living in a time warp. I watched all the Leone films in theatres in real time and was mesmerized, gob-smacked, and exhilarated. Now in the far future (2016) I watch QT do his knock-offs, and the young audiences (who have never seen the originals) think his are the originals, and everything else the knockoffs.

(Reminds me of the Old King Cole nursery rhyme -- ""pulled out a plum and said What a Good Boy Am I"" -- another reference lost on those living the age of portable devices.)

For those who actually care about the history of film:

* Leone invented a brand new genre called the Italian western. His first, Fistful of Dollars, recycled a Japanese story (Yojimbo), recycled an American ex-pat whose Hollywood career was officially over (Eastwood) and introduced one of the greatest music composers of the modern film era, Ennio Morricone.

* next came For a Few Dollars More, an original story, which locked into film history Leone's trademark use of closeups and sound editing, and brought out of mothballs Lee Van Cleef, one of the greatest ""faces"" in the history of the western. (""Angel Eyes"" in this one.)

* with two international hits under his belt, Leone aimed for the stars and created this movie which marks his legacy. While simultaneously continuing the tradition he started, and using the two stars from his second film, he gave Eli Wallach (an A-list star from the 1950s) the role of his career. Wait there is more. He set the story against the backdrop of the Civil War and manged to make the transitions seamless and brutally compelling. it is simultaneously a violent film and an anti-war film at the same time! (The only film of Leone's that may compete with this one is Once Upon a Time in America, also reviewed by this writer on the IMDb).

By modern standards the film is overlong and, had it been produced in America (as was indeed the case with Upon a Time in America), the ""suits"" would have butchered it down to 100 minutes. Luckily for the rest of us, this was an international release, cut-proof, and survives very nicely to the present day in its original form.

QT was a young lad when these films appeared but the impact is clear. He used Morricone's music in Kill Bill (his best film in my view) and in my view The Hateful Eight tries to emulate the power of Leone but falls somewhat short.

For you youngsters out there, I recommend these films as some of the most entertaining efforts ever set to film, period. Imitated but not duplicated.

Astonishing, mind-blowing, unforgettable.",10

16 August 2004,Westerns don't get any better than this.,"This is the third,and arguably the best, of the so-called ""spaghetti western"" trilogy. It is ironic that, at the time the three Sergio Leone westerns were released, they were largely panned by critics as being poor and even laughable imitations of American-made westerns. The fact that they were filmed in Italy and Spain resulted in them receiving their amusing nickname which was intended to degrade them at the time.

Somehow, over the quarter century or so since their release, the critics have tended to change their opinions, and now these movies are generally regarded as classics. Perhaps this is because Clint Eastwood was principally known only as the second banana, Rowdy Yates, in the television series ""Rawhide"" when the films were produced but since then has achieved superstardom. But I also think it goes beyond that. I believe the critics decided to take another look at these films and realized that they had been premature in writing them off. Actually, I believe the three films were considerably better than most of what Hollywood produced. In fact, I think that TGTBATU ranks among the best westerns ever produced bringing to mind the magnificent films of John Ford, the undisputed master of that genre, and his protege, the incomparable John Wayne.

I have nothing but praise for this film. In fact, I rank it as one of my favorite films of all time. I could write volumes of what is good about this film. But since its qualities have been oft repeated in other viewer reviews, I will focus on what others didn't like about it. Most of the IMDb reviews had only one major complaint: the film is too long. I disagree. In fact, in spite of its nearly three hour length, I was disappointed that it ended. I was so absorbed in the film that I was disheartened to have to return to reality. The combination of story, cinematography, acting and musical score left nothing to be desired other than more of the same! The sequences that seemed to drag on in the opinion of other reviewers were necessary to fully create moods and to drive home important points. For example, the opening sequence might be regarded as needlessly long as Angel Eyes taunts a hapless man over a leisurely meal. But to me, scenes like that are what makes the movie great! The time allows the viewer to fully appreciate the amazing replication of the primitive home and the pitiful life of its dirt-poor inhabitants. I felt as though I was sitting there at the table; I was half tempted to reach for a bowl and spoon to partake of the meal. And all the while the suspense was building towards the inevitable climax. You know it's coming but not when and the length of the scene drives you crazy but makes it all the more satisfying when it does happen.

Another example is when Tuco punishes Joe by forcing him to walk through the desert. This is possibly the only time that one might become bored with the film. But again, I think the time for the scene was justified in that we are able to receive the full impact of that experience and enjoy the haunting music at the same time. Joe's subsequent predicament might not have had much credibility had this sequence been abbreviated.

In my opinion, one of the essential elements of a great film is creating moods that absorb our attention. This often takes time, lots of time. For example, many of the scenes in the magnificent film ""Dr. Zhivago"" were almost painfully long but they were necessary to create those startling surrealistic moods, and the film would not have been great without them. In many ways, TGTBATU has this same sort of greatness. It is a sweeping epic with very compelling characters and magnificent settings that draws the viewer in and doesn't release him until the closing credits begin to roll. When it's over, you feel that you've been on a long and exciting journey. Such a journey takes time.

In summary, if you haven't seen this film, buy it right away. Don't rent it because you will not want to part with it once you've seen it.

Then curl up with it on a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon when you are in no hurry to do anything.",
2 July 2006,"""When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk.""","I know some movie fans who consider The Good, the Bad and the Ugly the best movie ever made. While I don't even think it's the best thing Sergio Leone made, it's a solid Spaghetti Western that has all but transcended the sub-genre. There are images, such as Clint Eastwood in the poncho, and music, like the main title theme, that are known by people who have never seen the movie. I also know people who wouldn't be caught dead watching a movie made outside of the USA who love The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. I can't think of another Italian made film, let alone an Italian made Western, that has become so universally known and enjoyed.

There are so many moments in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly that I enjoy. One of my favorites is that of Tuco running through the cemetery as Morricone's ""The Ecstasy of Gold"" plays in the background. It literally gives me goosebumps. It's one of those movie moments that I look forward to no matter how many times I've seen them. I'm also a fan of the techniques Leone used in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Leone's use of the widescreen shots of the landscape inter-cut with extreme close-ups of faces is brilliant. It adds a sense of intimacy to vastness of the setting that allows the viewer feel like they're part the movie and gain some insight into the characters. It's a technique that very few other filmmakers have the guts to employ.

But I sincerely doubt that Leone's film would be so widely and wildly regarded if it weren't for the music of Ennio Morricone. I've already mentioned the main title theme and ""The Ecstasy of Gold"", but these are only two examples found in this amazing score. Can you imagine the final showdown without Morricone's music? I can't think of many instances where music and film go together to create such tension and anticipation. I've already used the word ""brilliant"" to describe Leone, but it's also applicable to Morricone.

Finally, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly wouldn't be the same without the three lead actors. Each, at least in this movie, is brilliant (there's that word again) in his own right. Clint Eastwood is ""The Good"". He's ""The Good"" in the sense that he's not as ""bad"" as the other two. Lee Van Cleef is ""The Bad"". He's a ruthless killer who would just as soon shoot you as look at you - as long as the price was right. And then there's Eli Wallach as ""The Ugly"". As good as Eastwood and Van Cleef are, Wallach is really something special. Wallach's Tuco is one of the most crazed, but complicated characters I've seen. It's a special cast for a very special movie.",9
12 May 2000,Sergio Leone was a highly personal filmmaker!,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

19 December 2022,Several Fistfuls of Cadavers...,"It's a story of three people on the run, from themselves, from poverty and from the gun, all chasing golden riches, in their saddle weary breeches, one-upmanship prevents, being outdone. Angel Eyes is a hardened mercenary, always finishes a job, he won't miscarry, has his sights set on a bounty, buried in, a cemetery, but two others will become, adversaries. Tuco is a cunning, cagey outlaw, never satisfied, wanting a few dollars more, devious and double crossing, scornful, sneering, often scoffing, wears a noose more than he'd like, below his jaw. Blondie plays it cool most of the time, makes his living freeing Tuco for his crimes, with his cigar and his poncho, he's an independent honcho, though a walk around the desert leaves him begrimed.

Three outstanding performances in a film that stands the test of time and just gets better and better.

28 September 1998,Classic,"Rather than a review of a 30 year old movie, here is my recollection of a 30 year old movie. When was the first time you saw this movie? I remember the first time I saw this movie. Back in the '70s, one night there was 2 things on TV to choose from, this movie or a baseball game. How do I remember a baseball game, it was the night Hank Aaron was going after Babe Ruth's homerun record. Baseball or a movie. Tuned into the the baseball game, flipped to the movie -a western, cool. 'Uh, what is this no one is talking it makes no sense'. After what seemed like an eternity somebody finally spoke, Lee van Cleef. The rest is Movie History. Since then I have seen this movie well over 25 times. Numerous lines that have been etched into my memory. Forget whatever minor flaws this movie has. Put yourself in the movie. Sergio Leon, John Ford these are the people that defined ""The Western"". On a scale of 1-10, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is nothing less than a 10. Plop the tape into the VCR, sit back and experience a classic.

25 December 2007,Wonderful,"I must admit that I had some doubts prior to seeing this movie, considering its length and some people's comments that it is slow as molasses. Well, they were mostly right about that. GB & U is indeed a movie that does not always move very fast, and it does take a little getting used to. Yet if you manage to look past the slowness, this is easily one of the best movies ever made.

This is one of those movies where nearly everything comes together in exactly the right way. First of all, there is a wonderful cast of characters. Clint Eastwood is at his best as the 'Good' (even though he's not strictly a good guy but more a bad guy with an honor code), Lee van Cleef is so truly evil that you'll long for his downfall with a passion, and Eli Wallach steals the show as the 'Ugly', turning him into a character that you'll root for even though he's quite clearly the least trustworthy character you'll ever meet.

These wonderful characters engage in a quite complex plot full of twists and turns, as they are constantly trying to outwit and outshoot each other. There's quite a lot going on and in spite of the fact that the tone of the movie is actually fairly light (there is some truly good humor), it's actually a fairly good exploration of human nature and the lengths to which people will go to achieve their goals.

And then, there's the music of course. Ennio Morricone has always composed some very distinct and recognizable tunes, which unfortunately were not always that great by themselves. The music here, however, is absolutely one of the most memorable scores ever.

Of course, the cinematography is wonderful as well. The production values here seem to be a lot higher than in some previous Leone movies, and GB & U contains plenty of memorable shootouts that will truly keep you on the edge of your seat. At the same time, the gunmen here seem not nearly as invincible as in some other Leone movies, which greatly adds to the suspense.

As I said before, nearly everything comes together in this movie. Sure, it might be a bit slow, but it's got a great story of good versus evil, told in an impressive and truly epic way, with memorable characters and shootouts everywhere. Highly recommended",10

23 August 2006,"Among the finest Westerns, though not for all tastes","While I have given some pretty long reviews to Clint Eastwood's Westerns--particularly the wonderful FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, I will only give a brief review of this movie because there are so many reviews already I doubt if my pontificating will actually influence many people. After all, this is widely seen as one of the greatest Westerns ever made and since I liked it immensely, there isn't much need to say more.

Well, there are actually a few Westerns I liked a bit more--I am a HUGE fan of THE BIG COUNTRY. But, when it comes to style, originality and the epic proportions of this film, none can match it, though ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST comes very, very close. The acting and script are just fine and the music is intensely weird but effective. Of all the films I have seen with music by Ennio Morricone, this is his most intense and strangest. And it works perfectly in this film, but I also appreciate much of his more restrained work in other films and would never want all Westerns to have such distinctive and bizarre music as in THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY--it would just lose its magic and might even tend to overwhelm the film.

About the only negatives about this film are the title and it is a pretty violent film that the little ones probably shouldn't watch. There is a lot of blood and violence and you do get to see (yuck) Eli Wallach's butt. As for the title, sure, Lee Van Cleef was truly ""BAD"" and Eli Wallach was cure ""UGLY"", but Clint as ""the GOOD""? Well, his character was far from good--but of course, who would like the title to be ""The Kinda Good, The Bad And the Ugly""?! Not to be missed by any serious fan or the genre.",10
28 April 2010,"Masterfully shot; masterfully scored; masterfully directed, Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a stunning and highly involving piece - just masterful.","Sergio Leone's 1966 Western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly unfolds under this hostile, violent and hate filled umbrella of Civil War America; a fitting backdrop of ongoing warfare and hostilities to which two American men and a Mexican bandit strive to find a large box full of valuable coins buried out in the big country somewhere behind Confederate Army lines. In using a plot item as routine as said example and applying it to a relatively routine singular strand arc for the film's narrative to take, Leone essentially breathes so much life into a set up and plot plan that about half way through you forget the basic bare bones of the movie and find yourself going with it, utterly immersed in the tale the director's laying out in front of you. So much has been written and said about the film, like other such examples at the top of each genre, that further comment and analysis may seem futile. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly may very well be the pinnacle to the western as Psycho might be to horror or Apocalypse Now to the war, for instance. If it isn't, or either of the said examples aren't, then there will still be a large cluster of individuals that would sternly argue otherwise.

The film begins with a loud and confrontational title sequence, a brash and expansive manner in which to announce your film has arrived; the sort that sees a flashing of character faces and arrays of different colour, a sequence in which even the little animated horse gets the full force of a cannonball that's been fired off. It sets the tone for a no holds barred ride of guns; gunslingers and no nonsense people with no nonsense attitudes as observations of greed and that of both a mid and post-war crumbling society plays out. The film features some of the best direction I've ever seen; Leone's ability to shift gears and change the film's tact from one thing to another, as loyalties shift and events take a turn for the different is near-flawless. His ability to essentially construct a number of small, minute set-pieces amidst this wide-open and dusty, hostile setting is immaculate; but the change of tact he applies later on towards the end of the film in capturing a Civil War battle between the North and South is just as impressive; portraying a larger fight sequence as the inevitable showdown between the film's three main players draws nearer and that sense their showdown will be of a similarly epic proportion, despite it being just another gunfight and despite the fact all of those thus far have been between grossly outmatched participants.

Leone is all for spectacle and action to propel the plot, but his ability to capture the little things; the terrain and just the sounds that it omits is wonderful. The introduction of Angel Eyes, aka The Bad (van Cleef), for instance sees a young boy flee into his house on first sight of him as he arrives; Angel Eyes' boots stomping on a stone floor whilst he approaches an elderly man sitting at a table as a dog barks outside, all of it a routine use of composition and SFX, but the drawn out editing process; the fact a kid ran for his life at first sight of him and the semiotical driven noise of a barking dog which suggests a rabid animal or ominousness build the scene and character without anyone ever explaining or saying anything.

They call him The Bad because he shoots without mercy and takes without conscience, leaving a family in tatters and on another occasion beats a girl to a near pulp until she gives him what info he's looking for. The name Angel Eyes is wholly ironic. This makes Clint Eastwood's 'Good' (aka Blondie) and Wallach's 'Ugly' (aka Tuco) perhaps look more favourable than they actually are when it's revealed they're mostly in it together against this blackly dressed; father/husband murdering; woman slapping figure of evil. Tuco and Blondie's relationship is a strange one, a mutual appreciation of one another and the death they leave in their wake. Tuco would no sooner shoot Blondie, than hang him, than act like they're best friends. No longer is 'The Good' of a western limited to wearing the sheriff's badge and/or cleaning up towns of drunks and no-good varmints; as here, 'The Good' would much rather come across as upstanding; fleece a local sheriff of $2,000 and then make off with the cash against the guy he was initially in tow with.

Tuco's raging attitudes are captured in a single shot that encompasses a sketching of Christ on the cross as he swigs alcohol whilst wearing an eye-patch, the film at a point where Tuco seems to be doing good in aiding an old friend but perhaps with a traitorous eye still on the prize as the patch acts as a visual distinction of the two sides of his face doubling up as his sinful and righteous attitudes, whereas he gives the Holy Trinity throughout. But THE scene that encapsulates his character is in a store early on during which, betrayed and foaming at the mouth for revenge, he fondles some handguns in front of an elderly clerk before angrily discarding them. He then fondles some more and asks for bullets, drawing you into the scene in an utterly effective manner and its threat element within as we wonder what he has in store for the clerk above all else. There's a solid hour of character involvement and some set-piece exchanges which work wonderfully well; and a later juxtaposition between diegetic musical content with an interrogation brought a smirk to my face when I realised whom it was that felt so inspired to pay homage to such a sequence. The film is engrossing, rich in detail on so many levels and an absolute outright winner of a piece.",10

9 December 1998,One of the Best of all Time,"This film probably had the largest impact on my life. It set the tone for everything I then got interested in. American Civil War. Film Music. Clint Eastwood. Real Westerns. This is the best of the Dollars Trilogy and by far one of the best Westerns of all time. It has drama, comedy, cracking dialogue, some of the most brutal battle scenes - especially around the bridge - that I'd seen up to then, music to die for and set pieces that just ooze atmosphere and tension. I have never forgotten the end shoot-out. This was unique; 3 people?! You can't do that. But Leone did, and he did it brilliantly - all cameras and music. I have now seen this film too many times to count but I'll be back for another blast of buono, brutto, cattivo, someday. My son owes his name to this film. Yep, that there is Clinton.

14 April 2019,Greatest Western of all times!,"""You see in this world, there are two types of people my friend, those who love this film and those who're retarded."" This quote should be shared everywhere. Also, it's a spoiler free review, and it may seem to be a little vague.

Good : It's a masterpiece. Don't agree with me? I don't care at all. Leone's visual storytelling has never been so great. The scores, the activities of the characters, the scenes were enough to tell the story. The dialogues are simply conversations between the characters. In the entire three hour runtime, there isn't a single expositionary dialogue, except for a total of 5 minutes. That's a very difficult task to do, and it does it with such an ease that we don't even notice it during the first viewing. Many difficult scenes have been shot very perfectly, which feels really obvious. There are a few point of view shots which makes it more interesting. The characterizations given to each of the three lead characters justify them as good, bad and ugly. There are many moments which justify their characterizations. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach have done a complete justice to their roles. This movie, being set in the American Civil War, has some elements of it. However, it doesn't glorify the war and doesn't take any side. It portrays war as one of the worst things - just like in the way it should be. The war scenes are too damn good. Well choreographed and incredible cinematography. You can see a whole bunch of people engaging, and it obviously was not CGI. It wasn't really necessary to show all of that, but it did and it was great (Sergio Leone rocks!). The violence does feel real and legit, in contrast to many of the older Westerns. Last but the important thing would be music, Ennio Morricone's score is entirely of next level good. Incomprehensibly great. It complements every scene and either escalates the tension (eg. the final showdown) or just develops emotional and dramatic factors. Also, contrary to this, there are some moments of silence which serve similar purpose of escalating the tension and drama. The music is so good that even if you (somehow) end up not liking the film, you will definitely love the score by Morricone. It has absolutely no negatives whatsoever. It deserves every bit of praise it receives.

Conclusion : This is the Citizen Kane of Westerns. Every Western film (not necessarily Spaghetti) is compared with this. There is a reason why. This is a highly recommended film not only for Western lovers, but for every movie lover out there. As for me, I heard a lot of great things about it, then, I was ready to be disappointed, but I was blown away by it. It was way above my initial expectations, and delivered a lot more than that. Recently, only Infinity War managed to do so. It is a gem of a movie.

18 February 2008,Eastwood's iconic anti-hero,"There's not a lot to say about this one that hasn't been said. You have to enjoy the sweeping, desolate Spanish vistas. And, as it has been pointed out as a plot hole, it is an interesting technique that what ever is out of the frame, is unnoticed by the characters, such as Angel Eyes making it all the way to the Stanton grave without being noticed approaching (on horseback) over open land. I found it distracting the way many characters spoke in Spanish or Italian and were dubbed into English. I have always disliked dubbed movies and preferred subtitles, but this one was odd, with some characters speaking English, and some not. It must have made for interesting rehearsals and filming. I would have to agree with others that Eli Wallach largely stole the show. And does anyone know if Lee Van Cleef really was short part of his right middle finger, or did they splice in someone else's hand for that shootout scene?

9 January 2011,"Nothing bad or ugly about this movie, all is good","Well what do you know? Another amazing movie from Sergio Leone. The Good, The Bad and the Ugly has so much good about it, and quintessentially it is one of the best westerns ever made. There may be nothing new about the story at first glance, but that's the point, Leone is paying homage to the Hollywood western, and despite the initial simplicity there is also a complexity mainly in the film's characters. Regardless of whether simple or complex it is, The Good, The Bad and the Ugly does have a compelling and brilliantly written story.

But there are other assets that make The Good, The Bad and the Ugly so good. The dialogue is always excellent, while Leone's direction is superb once again. The characters are great and are superbly played. Clint Eastwood gives one of his best performances ever here, and Eli Wallach is perfectly cast and more than a match for him. I was also very impressed with Lee Van Cleef, who I recognised from High Noon and such, but he makes a bigger impression here. The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is also the most violent of the trilogy, and one of the most violent of the genre, not a bad thing whatsoever.

The pace was spot on too, even though the film is nearly three hours long, it is never boring or dull. The best things though about The Good, The Bad and the Ugly are the visuals and Ennio Morricone's score. The film looks amazing, the cinematography is gorgeous and the sweeping images and scenery are very lovingly crafted. Morricone's score is even more impressive than that, it is simply one of the best film scores I've ever heard, and if I had to say which was Morricone's best score, I would immediately say this.

Overall, there is nothing bad or ugly about the film. The film is amazing. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10
14 August 2019,The Absolute Essence of Film,"Since there isn't much original that I can add, I just want to make sure that no stone is unturned. The three principles in this epic are so well developed. There are no really ""good"" guys, despite the title. But they are so well drawn that we are intrigued by the clash of spirits. It is very much like reading the Iliad. When Achilles dons the armor, he is going after another hero and must defeat one he respects. Here, respect may be the wrong word, but viable adversaries have a kind of sense of immovable object and irresistible force. There is so much violence and so many confrontations, it works so well. It, of course, got us away from the horse opera, or even the white hat of John Wayne (not to diminish the joy of those films) and created an opening for the anti-hero. What a piece of cinema.

10 August 2003,Visual Literature,"Sergio Leone is an underappreciated talent. His skill, in most cases, exceeds what he actually puts on the screen. This is, by far, his crowning achievement and the culmination of both his work and Clint Eastwood's career. After this, it is only pushing the plateau without success.

The primary focus of this movie is not the characters, the story winds up being the least of Leone's concerns. Instead, he is concerned about the camera and the music. Ennio Morricone, a genius in his own right, was seriously ignored by the Academy for his compilation here--certainly one of the Top 10 ever. He understands the crude editing of the mid-60s and exploits everything he can from the vision onscreen. If Leone was dissatisfied with the Ennio's final product, something MUST have been wrong with him.

The camera is another element that never lies. Modern filmmakers should study this before they try emulating MTV next time. With Leone's grandeur and a cast that understands that they aren't the real focus, how can he lose?

The story, while it isn't the greatest, is better delivered than such works as The Wild Bunch. Perhaps only High Noon understands the value of pacing and what to reveal/not reveal to the audience. Then again, Fred Zinnemann is an entirely different director. The character interaction here is certainly better than what Gary Cooper has to offer, not to mention the dialog includes some uncanny deliver by Eli Wallach.

Overall, a classic. This is a definer of the unconventional Western and visual literature. 4.5 out of 5 stars. A must see.",9
10 July 2007,"Fantastic, legendary masterpiece","Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it?

When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

10 January 2007,One of the greatest films ever made!,"And Sergio Leone had to show Hollywood how a western should be done. Earthy, gritty, moody, rambling, funny and just plain nasty too. One thing most people forget about the Sergio Leone Dollar trilogy films is that they were made when westerns were really staid and boring, with zero atmosphere and very mechanical. Then came these movies, with THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY being the last and the greatest of the three Dollar films. Cinema wasn't the same after it was released. And to show influential this film is, it transcended its ""western"" genre and influenced practically every type of films made after that. Heck, I'm not even a western fan and I thoroughly admire what Leone and the gang created here. It's big, bold, melancholic, lusty, giddy and operatic.

The thing I really love about THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is the atmosphere. It's almost one kind. Never duplicated in any other film since (and that includes Clint Eastwood's dry cowboy flicks). One major contributing factor is obviously Ennio Morricone's unforgettable score, probably one of the greatest scores ever made. The music during the ending, when Tuco searches the cemetery, it's spine tinglingly powerful.

Of the three characters, Tuco steals the show. He's the heart and soul of film. It's probably Eli Wallach's greatest performance. He immersed himself in the role and, in the processed, really became Tuco.

My only complaint about THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is that it is a low budget film and as expansive and epic as it is, the film sorta looks cheap. Practically everything was shot outside. There are few sets in the movie and when we are within four walls, the sets look, hmm, cheap. I just wished the production design was as expansive looking as the vision Leone had in mind. The film would have been perfect then. But that's something I can clearly overlook.

When I watch a movie like THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, I get depressed. Depressed because at one time films were actually amazing, groundbreaking and entertaining. The 1960s were one of the greatest era in movie-making. Sadly today's films don't even come close to the stunning creative output of that decade. They should re-release THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY on the big screen. It's a classic film.",10
20 July 2003,"Second best movie in Leone's superb spaghetti western ""trilogy"".","Most people choose 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' as the best of Sergio Leone's superb spaghetti western ""trilogy"" (I'm putting trilogy in inverted commas because the three movies actually have no connection to each other, and Clint Eastwood, despite the ""Man With No Name"" tag, plays a different character in each). Now it's a very close call I admit, but as much as I love this movie I'm inclined to choose the one before it 'For A Few Dollars More' as my favourite. Anyway, this is still a superb piece of pure entertainment, and Leone's movies had a massive impact on not just the western genre but action and adventure movies of all kinds. Clint Eastwood is super cool playing ""Blondie"" just as he was as Joe in the first movie and Monco in the second. FAFDM added a strong supporting character by Lee Van Cleef, TGTBATU continues that (though Van Cleef is playing a completely different guy) and also brings in Eli Wallach as Tuco, who adds some nice comic touches. Blondie and Tuco have lots of great scenes together, but I could have done with a lot more Angel Eyes (Van Cleef), one of the greatest screen villains of all time. Having three strong roles instead of just Eastwood is one of the great things about this movie. Another great thing is the unforgettable score by Morricone. Morricone did some of his most memorable work with Leone, and this could just be the best of the lot. Certainly the main theme (a massive hit single in the late 1960s as covered by Hugo Montenegro) is one of the most recognisable and original pieces of film music ever. Another standout is the spectacular bridge scene, surely a direct inspiration for Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch', a movie which owed Leone a sizable debt in my opinion. It's very difficult to pick this movie apart and single out what is so great about it as it really works as a whole. There's almost nothing wrong with it. It's one of the greatest westerns ever made and a hugely enjoyable movie that is just as compelling on your tenth viewing as your first. If you haven't seen it before I still think watching 'A Fistful Of Dollars' and 'For A Few Dollars More' first is the smartest movie, despite the three movies being a trilogy in name only, and each of the three being able to stand alone. Each movie is brilliant stuff and each comes with my highest recommendation. Movies don't get much more entertaining than this!",
4 February 2021,The Man with No Name,"A masterpiece of the western genre.

The direction, cinematography, actors and soundtrack are great.

The characters are imaginative and interesting, a bit satirical and just plain great. The actors are perfectly chosen for their roles and that is one of the things that makes this film excellent.

Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are mesmerizing in their characters. The supporting characters are just as interesting, especially Aldo Giuffrè as the alcoholic Union Captain.

There are so many plots and so many characters here that a movie seems like multiple movies at once. The film is visually impressive, rich in subtle details, and its layered story is fascinating.

The soundtrack is a true masterpiece and elevates the film to yet another dimension and makes the film even more impressive.

An absolute masterpiece of the western genre and cinematography in general.",10

First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's.

26 September 2008,Cinematic brilliance.,"A big, bravado, bold and exquisite film for its time, Sergio Leone's ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" remains one of the most seminal, influential, and exciting films of all time. With its superb cast, its beautiful and wide scenery, and its superior action sequences, this film is a masterpiece. A picture that embodies the perfect personification of masculinity. A true man's picture, and one that will stand tall among most movies today.

The simple tale of how three gunslingers form an unlikely alliance of hate, in order to find $200,000 (that's $6 million by today's standards) worth of stolen gold, in a country that is ravaged by war, is elegantly told by the maestro of westerns, Sergio Leone. For its time, Spaghetti Westerns were not considered genuine art, but rather, entertainment instead. Sergio Leone is probably the only director who is smart enough to make his film compelling to mainstream and critical audiences alike. His direction is smart and strong, and you see how well his direction is as per the amount of manpower and creativity in handling the action sequences. The action sequences are raw, crisp, grand, explosive, and taut. Especially the Standoff at the end. Leone should probably be awarded a Nobel Prize for that scene alone. Leone is probably why westerns are popular among the youth of the '60s, hell, he probably influenced would be filmmakers at the time. I know of one who was particularly influenced by Leone's direction - Quentin Tarantino himself said that this film is the best-directed film of all time. And yes, although the film may be long, there's not a scene that goes by that you'll say boring.

Clint Eastwood - The Good. The legendary Man With No Name. His character perfectly embodies with the true meaning of masculinity. As per in his previous films, he plays a mysterious gunslinger, one with a deadly aim and a strong sense of honor and pride. He is the perfect hero, and this film stands out as one of Clint's, if not his, best film ever.

Lee Van Cleef - The Bad. Here, instead of the fatherly Doug Mortimer in the previous ""For A Few Dollars More"", we get the stone-cold assassin Angel Eyes. Van Cleef plays him chillingly to the bone. He is wicked, he is ruthless, he is cruel. He would kill anyone, be it his targets or even his own client.

Eli Wallach - The Ugly. He is Tuco, a criminal on the loose. He is the most interesting character in the film, as we see the ugly side of man through him. He is two-faced, slimy, arrogant, and hate-able. But that what makes his character great. There is no substitution for Wallach, he will always be Tuco no matter what.

The cinematography is absolutely beautiful. We get to see the backdrop of the glorious Wild West and the battlefields of war in all its unfaded glory. Even the cemetery scene is filmed extremely well. The music - that's another thing. The music, is masterful, so sublime, so grandiose, and so haunting. It's mesmerizing, really, to hear the great Ennio Morricone's score while looking at the actions of people, it perfectly matches the film. Not forgetting to mention the iconic and haunting theme song that's embodied itself in popular culture even until today.

So, yes, this is truly cinematic brilliance. If you want to see the film in all it's glory, I reckon you readers get the extended cut DVD of the film. It's Leone's true version of this film, and it would do you some good to see his true film, not to mention the remastered picture and 5.1 sound so that you can hear the gunshots and explosions in all its fury. Make no mistake readers, this film is one of the most iconic movies ever made, and it can be proud of its status as ""Greatest Western Ever Made"". Now if only movies like these were made today as well...

Overall rating: 10/10

19 July 2004,A revolutionary and exciting Spaghetti Western,"This is a bemusing, violent and stylish Western, it's the best Sergio Leone . The film takes part of ¨the man without name¨ trilogy united to ¨For a fistful dollars¨, and ¨ A few dollars more¨.

The movie centers about the ugly (Eli Wallach) , the bad (Lee Van Cleef) and the good (Clint Eastwood) in search for a Confederate treasure buried on a cemetery whose tracks have got the three enemies and is set during American Civil War.

It's too much violent but is neither tiring, nor boring, but entertaining. The film mingles noisy action , impressive battles, shootouts, violence with strong tortures, tongue in cheek, satire and a little bit of humor.

The final showdown between the three contenders is breathtaking.

In spite of the fact the runtime is overlong , nevertheless isn't dull . Direction by Sergio Leone is magnificent. Ennio Morricone musical score is extraordinary , the soundtrack has been imitated and copied by thousand occasions. Morricone's iconic theme music was designed in places to mimic the sound of a howling coyote . Production design by Carlo Simi and cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli is riveting . Shot in the deserts and landscapes of Spain : Burgos and Almeria , with 1,500 Spanish soldiers as extras .

Eli Wallach is very well , as he steals the show , he interprets a humorous and greedy murderous thief , Lee Van Cleef plays a villain and ominous killer and Clint Eastwood makes a dirty and wry 'man without name'.

This quintaessential 'Spaguetti' originated great influence of wide range in Western . It was such a good picture that had a great success. Followed by ¨ Once upon a time in West¨and ¨Duck you sucker¨.

Rating: very nice, above average 8'5/10",9
27 November 2019,A Cultural Phenomenon,"This sprawling epic changed the way the western and cinematic gunplay was shown on film. Brutal, funny and packed with characters that flow in and out of the narrative without ever feeling disjointed or dashed together. Sergio Leone pushed the boundaries of his previous two westerns and told a tale of three men and their travails through the end of the civil war in search of the hidden gold maguffin. The result was so revolutionary that this movie is burned in the quilt of our culture.The iconic music..Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name...the closeups..everything here is classic. Arguably the best western ever made and certainly the most ambitious.

17 July 2006,The Blood of Human Kindness,"Eight of Ten Stars. I was so enamored of this movie as a teen that my Northwestern University freshman dorm wall was papered with big B&W posters of mssrs. Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef in the Fall of 1968. I was quite the little existentialist then; ""If it feels good, DO IT!"" was the mantra of my high school Senior English teacher. Well, it felt good, and bad, and ugly. I ended up dropping out of Northwestern after Kent State and, taking the soundtrack of GBU (in my head) with me to Vietnam in 1971, I proceeded to get a real-world education in the old 'ultra-violence' as an infantryman in the AMERICAL Division... WHAT you may ask does this have to do with an American Civil War movie, directed and written by an Italian Communist? (Sergio Leone's daddy may have been more of a commie than Sergio was, but the fact is that ""A Fistful of Dollars"" was STOLEN from Kurosawa, while ""The Magnificent Seven"" was PURCHASED years before. The end justifies the means? Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery?) http://www.fistful-of-leone.com/classic/articles/prof.html I found out firsthand the moral ambiguities of war. If only I had paid attention to the subtext in GBU! If only I had studied the Matthew Henry battlefield dead tintypes as Leone so obviously had! His hideous, rotting carcases of Union and Confederate soldiers, bloating in direct sunlight, would have sufficiently revulsed me from any notion that I could 'play soldier' and survive! But here I am, having just barely survived.... and I just got out of the fabulous Fox Theater here in Atlanta where the restored GBU was projected in all its Technicolor/Technirama glory at fully loaded, screaming Morricone volume.... there must have been at least a thousand people there, and hardly anyone moved. INCREDIBLE. It is said that the movie was made to the tunes Morricone made prior to production's start; i.e. Leone played the music while shooting the scenes! Hence, these epics are giant music videos - fantasias - symphonic cinema- they are huge, elegiac tone poems! And, God help me, I still love this movie.",8

28 February 2007,The west as a piece of art...,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly has a very basic storyline - 3 cowboys trying to collect a fortune in gold. Sergio Leone then set this story against a backdrop of the American civil war. It is visually stunning, and has enough action for 10 films, let alone 1. Okay, so its not geographically or historically correct, but seriously, if you care about those things so much that you don't like the film, then you are just plain sad. The 3 main characters are excellent; Clint Eastwood as the laid back hero, Eli Wallach as his dirty Mexican partner and Lee van Cleef as the evil gunman who kills for a living. The whole film is like a work of art, leading up to the final gunfight in a stadium like cemetery, 1 of the best scenes in film history. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly isn't one of those films that is thought provoking, but it is one of the best simply because for 3 hours it is very entertaining, and a thing of beauty.

13 August 2005,One Of The Best Westerns Ever Made!,"This movie has style - in a very elemental way - so to speak. You get an idea of the deadly, dreary desert, the deadlier bounty hunters and the deadliest of 'em all - Clint Eastwood - the man with no name! The story is a simple one to follow and is brilliantly executed by Sergio Leone using just the right landscapes along with some pretty good sets too (like the one featuring the Civil War sequence). Some of the scenes were meant to be symbolic (especially the Civil War scenes) and they did their job well.

Eli Wallach is simply superb with his ""Blondieeee!!!"" screams and curses. Lee Van Cleef seems as deadly as the great Eastwood himself as ""The Bad"" guy.

Cinematography - not as continuous as one would like - but manages to convey the tension in the dueling scenes very effectively.

Also, the music - Ennio Morricone at his best! He has dished out some very innovative and brilliant stuff for all the three ""great"" westerns and this along with ""For a Few Dollars More"" seems to be his best.

Finally, the style! Sergio Leone can certainly teach a thing or two to Quentin Tarantino or The Wachowski Brothers - in fact Tarantino acknowledges Leone's great style. And then the epitome of style himself - Clint Eastwood - with a half-burnt cigar in his lips, unshaven face, tilted hat, ragged jeans, a worn out poncho and the sharpest scowl ever which can rub out any ""Neo-with-million-dollar-goggles"" off the face of the Earth.

Not genre-defining, surely - it was invented by Hollywood. But somebody from Europe really showed the world how to make westerns.",10
4 March 2010,This movie is Flawless...this movie has no parallels...this is the Best one I 'll ever see.,"I want the rating meter to allow me to rate it more than 10. I love this epic movie. Patiently shot and created , it exudes a scent of eternal beauty. This is my friends every movie goer's delight. A movie which can't be bettered. Full of outrageously funny puns and comic lines; made with an audacious appetite for cinematic patience, this movie has it all.

The background score is classic. I still get charged when I see the final scenes of the movie playing to Ennio Morricone's The Trio.

Deep dialogues an unbelievably smooth screenplay this movie is perfect.

It's detractors complain that some parts are overdone and are too clichéd. Well those things hardly matter when you have Blondie, Tuco, Angel Eyes , The drunk Army Captain on screen exhibiting something completely out of this world in terms of cinematic achievement.

I have never seen a better genre in movies than westerns and in that genre this movie stands out. This movie is undoubtedly the greatest one ever made in any genre.",10

21 May 2010,More good and beautiful than bad and ugly...but some of all four!,"The Good, The Bad, The Ugly (1966)

A classic? Well, not so fast. Are we really okay with brutal (if brief) mistreatment of women, fast and senseless bloodshed, and lots of bad overdubbing of dialog?

Maybe.

Yes, this is a cinematic movie, and if you can overlook its flaws (some) you will be wowed and dazzled by its merits (very many).

Overflowing with archetypes, filmed with huge widescreen effect, brimming with familiar scenes vividly re-imagined, this is a movie that is dramatic (or ironic) in softspoken (or cynical) ways. There are gunslinging shootouts, long lonesome treks across the desert, and showdowns between tough guys. Yup. And it's all built around a story that leads scene after scene to one big moment after another. There's no question this is a movie that is great fun to watch. In fact, for its visuals, the sheer cinematography and sets and editing, this is as good as it gets, amazing stuff. The man behind that was Tonino Delli Colli, the cinematographer for some other of director Sergio Leone's legendary movies beyond this one: Once Upon a Time in the West, and Once Upon a Time in America (and well as the astonishing Life is Beautiful.) But overall, for its content, its plot, its message (if that matters), is TGTBTU a great film, a masterpiece?

Well, the movie is smart. It deliberately plays off of its genre, which had worn itself thin by the 1960s, so things push over the top in a campy, awesome, excessive way. It almost feels obliged to revisit and exaggerate all the themes of American Westerns, including the Civil War, including slapping women around and killing people in a flurry of fast six-shooter magic. Even the title makes clear this is about a stripped down, pumped up version of older classics.

Whatever his aura over time, Clint Eastwood is no great actor, not in my book, and here he is easily out shined by Eli Wallach, who plays a less attractive type, and by Lee Van Cleef, who plays a more attractive one. But Eastwood isn't meant to be acting, not exactly. He has aura. He's stoic and inscrutable, exaggerated make-up and all, and he shoots a mean Colt, or Smith and Wesson, something classy and throbbing. He's a great archetype, in a movie that is about archetypes. It's not a ""realistic"" movie, of course, not at all, and it's actually a comedy at times, overall, and it's totally fun and never laughable.

Go ahead, compare it to The Wild Bunch, and then to Butch Cassidy, both coming just after this one (and no doubt influenced by it). Both of these later movies have more impressive acting, and more intense intentions (both in brutal violence and in cinematic innovation). But all three have a similar effect, playing within a genre that has always, since the 1939 Stagecoach, been beautifully trapped by its limitations (that's part of its staying power for fans). The Searchers (1956) and High Noon (1952), for starters, are working within the genre, and gnawing at it, as if its something to feed off of. That's where The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly really shines. I have trouble with aspects of it, but I really like it in a bigger sense, looking the other way as needed. I switch to first person because I think it's a personal preference, and a lot of guys I know love the movie to pieces, and a couple women I know think it's either stupid or insulting or boring (actually boring!).

It's an Italian production, which explains some of the out of sync dubbing. Sergio Leone obviously has an intuitive sense of what makes a movie moving, something sorely missed in a lot of productions since. It's gritty, dirty, and it pounds ""profound"" hard in a male kind of ""toughness prevails"" way. Sorry guys, but bite that bullet. Oh, and the soundtrack? Amazing, perfect, and rising above the movie, which is great in its own way, I admit.",8
22 July 2006,A simple classic and a must see by every Eastwood fan,"I have been a Clint Eastwood fan for years. But I have NEVER watched his Westerns. That's kind of idiotic isn't it?? Well suddenly I'm having an Eastwood movement and sinking myself into Westerns for the first time in my life and it only made sense that I start with what some critics and fans call ""The Greatest Western ever made."" In some respects I agree with that because it embodies everything that the Western is...even if you have never seen a Western you know the way they are supposed to go and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly encompasses every aspect of the stereotypical Western. Also a film like this has to be judged by it's release time as well and for 1966, this film's violent and gritty story would have made heads explode and Eastwood's trademark Man with No Name made Eastwood the gosh darned coolest, slickest man in history. The story explodes into an epic 3 + hour (extended cut) film about three man of completely different personalities, backgrounds, and goals trying to find a hidden treasure by a Civil War soldier and stay alive while basically beating the living daylights out of each other. The film is gritty, bleak, and the three main characters are so watchable that each one could carry their own film.

Clint Eastwood...how can you possibly say that name and then try to critique the man's acting. If you looked up the definition of masculine in the dictionary...there his picture would be...probably from this film. Eastwood's raspy voice, his ""doesn't take any crap"" attitude, and completely violent personality (in his characters of course) makes him the best gun fighter in ANY Western. He is the perfect leading man especially for a Western and he had to be THE GOOD in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Eastwood is Eastwood and that is the highest compliment you can give. Lee Van Cleef embodies THE BAD, I mean the man has being a villain down to a science and although he doesn't share a whole lot of screen time with the stars he has his own brand of justice that makes him the perfect villain. In a lot of ways he is the polar opposite of Eastwood. He still has the raspy voice, and the cool demeanor and he has this killer instinct that makes him petrifying to see on screen. But all in all he doesn't get the majority of the story and there is a lot of back story to his character left unexplored. I would have loved to see a sequel or another story where he plays Angel Eyes because it would have great to see him back on screen in this role. And finally I save the best for last. I have found a new absolute favorite screen character in Tuco played by veteran actor Eli Wallach. Tuco is THE UGLY in every way shape and form. His drunken, sarcastic, and annoying personality makes him the real stand out performance in this film. In fact he seems to get the majority of the lines and the screen time as we watch his journey to try and get rich. And on top of that the tumultuous relationship between his off again, on again partner Eastwood's ""Blondie"" as named by Tuco. The two of them start as partners until Eastwood turns on him and leaves him which only makes Tuco seek revenge in a horrible way, one of the great scenes where Tuco forces Eastwood across the desert nearly killing him in the process. But you know that can only mean Eastwood will get the last word and he does. Tuco is amazing. He's hilarious, he's bumbling, but he has fantastic good luck when it comes to getting away and on top of it all despite his humorous character he's not easy to kill or a push over. He's blood thirsty, crafty and skilled as a gun man and a villain. The whole film must be watched for Wallach's Tuco alone.

This is my first taste but not my last of Eastwood Westerns and Sergio Leone who apparently is the be all and end all of Action western directors. I have the first two installments of the Man With No Name trilogy fired up in the VCR and ready to go. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly in many ways is not outstanding and yet it has this mysterious quality that just sucks you in and makes it an absolute classic. From the dusty streets of the Western town amidst the brooding Civil War and the front, this film encompasses everything. And you can't mention the film without pointing out that haunting Western theme which almost seems like it's used comically but perhaps that's because it has been used as such in the future. You can't ever start a love for Westerns without seeing this...I have no doubt. And it will permanently go down in my books as one of my favorite Westerns. I will say it didn't need to be as long as it was and perhaps more of a climatic ending would have been nice but it's a classic and you can barely pick it apart. Made on a million bucks and probably 100 times that made back. Just see it!! 8.5/10",8
7 September 2019,There are two kinds of people in the world those with guns and those that dig. You dig....,"The good the bad and the ugly is the epic spaghetti western movie starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van cleef and Eli Wallach and is directed by Sergio Leone.

The movie is about two men Blondie (the good) and Tuco (the ugly) form an uncomfortable partnership to find a fortune and in mid of their way is Angel Eyes (the bad) who is also in the hunt for the same treasure.

The movie was the final instalment of the Dollars trilogy.

The movie is one of the most epic movie made and rating it would be like showing torch to the sun.

The acting by all the characters is fabulous but it's Eli Wallch who steals the show.

The cinematography and screenplay is unique and shows the style of the great Sergio Leone. The theme is one of the most remembered and popular themes.

This movie is one of the most epic and great movie which every movie lover should watch once in his lifetime.",10
26 August 2010,Never before has two hours and forty minutes whipped by so fast,"""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" is one of the pinnacles of my experiences of a moviegoer. Not only is it my all-time favorite Western and therefore, one of my all-time favorite movies regardless of genre, but is a landmark in the history of cinema itself. First of all, it is proof that oftentimes the simplest ideas are the best ones. The plot is fairly simple: three men try to reach a buried fortune of Army gold coins while the Civil War erupts around them. The story is even simpler and yet the audience gets wrapped around in it as 160 minutes and those 160 minutes just seem to whip by so fast that when the movie does end, we're craving for more. The film is also evidence that the Western is not a dying genre, for this landmark film from Italian director Sergio Leone has aged like wine; time has done nothing to varnish its style and authority. And it is also proof that Spaghetti Westerns, which are low in budget and oftentimes flamboyant and over-the-top, can be art, too.

This was the third and final time that Clint Eastwood worked with Sergio Leone. He returns again as the mysterious Man with No Name: a cigar-chugging bounty hunter quick on the draw and minimal in emotions. Here is the pinnacle of the vintage Eastwood as an actor, where he could manufacture a character by doing little other than squinting and hissing some sparse dialogue. Eastwood's in prime form here. The movie also features Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes, a mercenary/bounty hunter/Army colonel, the exact opposite of the warm-hearted character he played in the previous Western ""For a Few Dollars More."" But oddly enough, even though Eastwood gets top billing, the central character is Tuco, played with outstanding charisma and sharp energy by Eli Wallach. Wallach had played bad guys and anti-heroes before, but here as the bumbling, deliberately comical, greedy, self-centered, and yet somehow likable and personable Tuco, he steals the show. The movie stays interesting as these three men change partnerships with each other, whenever it seems convenient and when it'll bring them closer to the 200,000 dollars in stolen coins. These three characters, wonderfully written and acted, are an important column holding this film's roof up.

Sergio Leone was very much the David Lean of Italy. He could set up beautiful landscape shots and cinematography tricks like few others could. That's part of the reason why so little can happen for so long and yet the tension mounts higher than most. The way he also contrasts long shots with close-ups and montages it all is sheer brilliance. His timing is also exquisite. He knows how long to go, when to cut, when to produce a long take, when to crop a short one, and so on and so forth.

And I cannot leave out Ennio Morricone's music, which is even more famous than the movie itself. His main theme, which has been used in parodies and cultural references for more than forty years, is justifiably famous. But whereas it is usually used in parodies to produce a comical effect, here it fits the mood of the picture down to the bone. There's not a single weak cue of music in this marvelous soundtrack.

But what's most remarkable about this movie is that it sustains itself for the entirety of its 160-minute length and throughout most of it, very little happens. There are long stretches - minutes upon minutes - where virtually nothing happens. Oftentimes there isn't any music. It's not just the suspense of waiting for Leone's trademark bursts of action; the cinematography and the montage and the directing are so taut and winded together that the audience cannot even force themselves to look away. And if one seeks proof, they have to look no further than the film's climax. Of course because it's a Western, it will have an obligatory final showdown. But consider this showdown. We have three men facing each other down and it goes on for four minutes. Four minutes and the actors are hardly even moving. The only real movement is the camera, which is locked-down, but montaging amongst what is very nearly static images. Coupled with Ennio Morricone's heart-thumping music, this showdown, where very little happens for so long, comes across as one of the most electrifying climaxes in cinema history. Sure the music helps a lot, but it's the directing by Sergio Leone that really makes this scene so intense.

""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" is most definitely one of the most important films of all time and it certainly has earned its immortality in the realm of the cinema. It is undoubtedly the greatest Spaghetti Western of them all and Sergio Leone's masterpiece. The first film is this trilogy, ""A Fistful of Dollars"" was nothing more than an off-beat, but fun remake of ""Yojimbo."" The second film was also entertaining and fun. But the third movie is a masterpiece. Even at a great length of 160 minutes, and having most of it consumed by silence and stillness, the film never falters to goes on for too long. It goes on and when it does at last end, the audience is left craving for more. They can satisfy themselves in two ways: a) seeking out Leone's director's cut, which is about twenty minutes longer and b) watching the movie again, something I have done and will continue to do many, many times.",10
24 February 2006,A Classic,"There are hundreds of comments here on this movie and most of them are of high acclaim which comes as no surprise to me. Many have included this in their all-time top 10 films and again it comes as no surprise. With those I agree, this is a great film. There is little I can add that hasn't been said here but I will go back to the beginning. I was a Clint Eastwood fan when I was a kid from his role as Rowdy Yates in Rawhide. When he made the Spaghetti Westerns as they were called, I of course had to see him on the big screen. A Fistfull of Dollars and A Few Dollars More were unlike the typical Hollywood Westerns of the 50's and 60's. Italian and American actors in low budget productions with overdubbed dialog filmed in Spain which was supposed to be Mexico or the US Soutwest. Heavy on style with strange music. Raw realism emerged from this strange brew and I loved them. Then this came out. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Just the title itself was so impressive you knew this was going to go to another level from the first two. And it did. Ennio Morricone's music was so different and wonderfully strange and remains so even today. It was the perfect soundtrack score for this film. Sergio Leone's direction and his story and screenplay along with Luciano Vincenzoni and cinematography by Tonio Delli Colli are superb. A great cast with Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach. Eastwood's Hang Em High and High Plains Drifter that would follow were good but they couldn't top this. I've seen this dozens of times on TV but I haven't seen it on the big screen since it's initial release. This film ran a little long but it didn't matter because this was clearly a masterpiece. And so it remains. I would give this a 10 and highly recommend it. I'd love to see it on the big screen again.",10
15 August 2020,Still Ueber-Fantastic,"Sergio Leone is still an unchallenged maestro regarding the Western genre. From time to time I watch his classics and The Good, The Bad & The Ugly is one of those movies that are still captivating and entertaining no matter how many times you already watched the movie. On top, we get those incredible iconic music by Ennio Morricone. Last but not least - of course, the other two movies of the Dollars trilogy (A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More) belong to every serious movie collection.

5 October 2020,we SCORED a classic (see what I did there),"If ever a movie can be defined by its soundtrack then this is it.

As a Metallica fan I have heard the Ecstasy of Gold more times than I can imagine, so much that I've come to think that the barking/howling dog is part of the music (it isn't). Only a very few movies can reach the musical heights of GBU (Conan the Barbarian is one that comes to mind).

For me only 2 movies in Clint Eastwood's catalogue are better than this, High Plains Drifter and The Outlaw Josey Wales. Both being epic westerns.

Its a masterful movie that works in part because if its lack of details (like a name for The Man With No Name) and the pacing. It takes its time to deliver the story and actually makes their quest for gold feel like a quest.

This movie should be banned from remakes.",8
22 August 2007,the greatest western ever,"The beautiful cinematography , the excellent music and great camera work make this a stylish masterpiece. With a volatile mix of myth and realism The Good The Bad And The Ugly is the best of the spaghetti westerns and the greatest western ever made.This is Clint Eastwood's 2nd best movie (the best is UNFORGIVEN) Elli Wallach was excellent as Tuco, he is the real star of the movie, he had the best lines . Lee Van Cleef plays the bad guy to perfection.Sergio Leone is at his very best here.And Ennio Morricone's music is outstanding like always. The man with no name will always be the best. Buy it and experience the spectacle and greatness of a western like no other.

22 March 2011,not for me,"I'm not a fan of westerns, but feel I've shoved myself in a sci fi horror orientated corner of ignorance so am slowly working my way through the IMDb top 250 in an attempt to broaden my horizons (and possibly catch that rare film that blows u away without expecting it) I did REALLY appreciate the level of accomplishment this film expressed. For its time the cinematic atmosphere of comedy, emotion and gritty drama was clearly above average for even now, and the acting skills were brilliant and really added personality.

however (and i don't think its cuz I'm a girl) this film just wasn't for me. it was very slowly paced and i didn't manage to follow or care much for the characters stories.

that said, i would definitely recommend watching it as its surely one of those films that depends heavily on personal tastes, and judging it as a western just doesn't give it the respect it warrants.",7
4 February 2023,"Il good, il best, il masterpiece","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is not just the best western ever made, it is at least in the top 5 movies of all time. Why? Well, where to start...

...the story

This movie has a simple plot: Three guys searching for 200.000 dollars. But what's wring about a simple story? Right, absolutely NOTHING. Especially if it's so good working like in this film. All three characters have unique trait marks that play a big role during the 2 hours 50. And lets talk about this rather long running time. You won't feel the lenght at all! There is not a single moment I felt bored and the pacing is very slow. And because of that slow pacing the finale is even more satisfying.

One of the most tenseful moments of cinema history: The Showdown. And that leds me to...

...the music

Ennio Morricone. One name. More shouldn't I have to say. The man, the legend, master of his profession. Just the music during The Showdown is enough to say that without his music the movie would be easily one point lower rated. There is little music that everybody can identify easier with a whole genre than his. But he is just the first of the three legends that created this movie's legacy. Lets focus on...

...the directing

Sergio Leone. Without this guy the western genre would just consist of John Waynes movies and a few unknown. The genre would not have become this important as it was. The unique style of his directing build a whole new subgenre: The italo-western. When watching his movies you know that he made them, the emotions of the characters are depicted in a way never seen before. Just look at the showdown scene. It's brilliant. But of course this is only possible because of the third person that defined the movie. Let's talk about....

...the acting

Clint Eastwood. Is there anybody who don't know this man? His unique performave as the man without a name during all three movies of the dollar trilogy is a masterpiece of it's own. When I think about a cowboy the image of Clint Eastwood is in front of my eyes. This guy defined the genre like no other (even John Wayne) and is one of the best actors Hollywood has ever seen. This guy is a phenomenon!

So let's summarize that, you have a powerful story with one of the greatest finales of all time, the trio of perfection giving you masterclass music, directing and acting and 2 hours and 50 minutes full of entertaining.

It's hard to beat that, it may even impossible to top that. I rarely give a ten out of ten, because that means perfection, but this movie is perfection so there is no other choice.

Go watch it, everybody should do it, because if you die without watching it, you missed something big, very big you missed

Il Masterpiece.",9
19 May 2019,"The bad, the badder and the baddest","Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

21 March 2020,Superb filmmaking,"Not many films that have this level of artistry can also be this unpretentious and entertaining. The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is such a film. Now, as as far as Clint's westerns go, I much prefer The Outlaw Josey Wales and my all time favorite movie Unforgiven to this. Granted, this is only a personal preference mind you. Even so, The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is a tremendous film and the biggest and best of The Dollars Trilogy. This is a true artist at the top of his game with a truly unique take on the Western genre that is an unforgettable cinematic epic that was a game changer for westerns and movies in general. The film still looks great and while there were lots of spaghetti westerns that would follow, no one did it like Sergio Leone.

16 February 2008,Perfect.,"""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" is the kind of film that needs to be seen by everyone. I'm going to make each one of my kids watch it when they get to be like 10 years old. It's a film that absolutely captures the essence of what life is all about. There really are only three types of people out there, and the three characters in this film are complete, yet simple, portraits of those three types.

The hairs on my arms stand up every time I watch this film, especially during the final scene. Sergio Leone knows how to build a scene. Ennio Morricone's music is absolutely perfect with this film. It's hard to think of a movie with a better soundtrack actually.

To summarize: brilliant, breathtaking, mesmerizing...and like a fine wine, this one just gets better and better. So far ahead of it's time, it blows your mind. ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is one of the greatest movies ever made.

28 May 2015,Leone overcooks his spaghetti.,"'The Good' is sharp-shooter Blondie (Clint Eastwood), although how someone who runs a bounty racket, betrays his friend, and shoots numerous people dead can be deemed good is beyond me. Bandit Tuco (Eli Wallach) is 'The Ugly', which I think is a little unfair to the bloke: he's no George Clooney, but he's not Quasimodo either. That leaves cold-hearted killer Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) as 'The Bad', which he most definitely is, even going so far as to kill a child in order to achieve his goals. After Blondie and Tuco chance upon a dying Confederate soldier who reveals to them the whereabouts of a fortune in gold, the pair come to the attention of Angel Eyes, who will do anything to lay his hands on the treasure.

The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, the third film in Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy, is an epic spaghetti western that benefits from iconic central characters, an undeniable sense of cool, and, of course, that classic Ennio Morricone soundtrack (Waaawawah, waa waa waa!). Where the film doesn't fare quite so well is in the pacing and storytelling, the basic plot—three guys go in search of hidden treasure—stretched painfully thin, particularly in the Extended Cut, which clocks in at approximately three hours. The expansive historical backdrop—the American Civil War—frequently detracts from the flow of the story and Leone has a tendency to labour a little too much over his style, lingering on his characters for an eternity and repeating similar shots ad nasueum, all of which causes scenes to drag. Fortunately, some nice touches of humour and a couple of neat plot twists help to make matters a little easier to digest.

6/10. Not quite as hard-going as Once Upon A Time In The West, but not a patch on the earlier Dollars movies, or indeed, Leone's underrated A Fistful of Dynamite.",6
7 July 2020,R.I.P. Ennio Morricone,"An absolute materpiece by Sergio Leone. Best film from The Dollar Trilogy. This film is as good as a western gets. Wonderful score by the legend we just lost.

19 July 2020,useful.,"First, for a long time, it was the music of Ennio Moriccone. Obsessive, preserving , like a flavor, the essence of the story. The second - Lee Van Cleef. And, sure, the great job of Eli Wallach. I am not an admirer of western genre and I saw this film few couple days ago. The last virtue, not the least remains the fine refference to the Civil War, smart, precise, real useful. The basic scene - the first. It is a film with many admirers , a classic and more than te familiar western. But its virtue , the great virtue , is to be the perfect caleidoscope. A good film, maybe a masterpiece, for many reasons, many , so different categories of public, in impecable craft, with a powerful message. The humor, the tension and, yes, especially the high inspired sound are the great - unique , in my opinion, motifs to see, time by time, this splendid film.

16 November 2003,A Classic Western Movie With an Unforgettable Soundtrack,"Three bad guys  the chaser of rewards Joe (Clint Eastwood), the outlaw Tuco (Eli Wallach) and the very bad assassin Angel Eyes  become aware of a fortune of US$ 200,000.00 in golden coins, hidden in a cemetery. Only Joe knows the name of the grave, therefore there is a great dispute between the two gunmen, but always keeping Joe alive. This is a really classic western movie. This movie has never been released on VHS in Brazil, and only now the distributor Fox do Brasil' released on DVD format. I am a great fan of Sergio Leone, and the first DVD I bought for my collection was 'Once Upon the Time in America'. 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is great in all aspects: the story is very funny, the actors have great performances, and the soundtrack from Enio Morricone is unforgettable: it is certainly one of the most beautiful and known in the cinema history. This movie is really a great entertainment. My vote is eight.

Title (Brazil): ""Três Homens em Conflito"" (""Three Men in Conflict"")

1 July 2007,A western masterpiece,"The third of Sergio Leone's trilogy of spaghetti westerns is his definitive masterpiece.This epic,sprawling western is graced by breathtaking photography, a fantastic score and Leone's masterful direction. The performances are all iconic with scene-stealer Eli Wallach the standout.The earlier films in the trilogy don't have the same tremendous sweep and scope.The dry and dark humor also elevates this classic to greater heights.Although I'm always somewhat annoyed by the acting of the Italian supporting cast, with their excessive macho laughing and some assorted weird characters,it doesn't detract from the enjoyment of these movies.""The Good,the Bad and the Ugly"" is in my opinion one of the best westerns ever made.

8 April 2010,A movie at least 20 years ahead of its time,"As I was scrolling through IMDb 250, I saw ""Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo"" at #4. My initial thought ""Huh, 1966 movie, not worth watching. Runtime(179 min) also convinced my mind against watching this. But another half of my mind said, ""Dude, you can't afford miss an IMDb #4 movie. So, I saw the movie and till date I have watched it at least 25 times. Hats off to Sergio Leone for making such a great and legendary movie and that too in 1966 with limited resources. None of the ""Spagetti Westerns"" are close such brilliance, not even the other 2 in this series. Leone has extracted out a stupendous performance from ""Eli Wallach"". Clint Eastwood was good as usual. Shooting locations are brilliant and the supportive background score is very catchy. The movie is a bit slow in the beginning, but once it catches pace, it deeply involves the audience. Some people have argued that #4 is too high for this movie, but its not 'some' who make the IMDb list, its the majority. Speaking of Leone, I believe that he was at least 15-20 years ahead of time. He has served as inspirations for such genre in all parts of the world, be it 'Sholay' in India, 'El Desaro' in Spain, and many more. I would like to go with a 9 out of 10 for this movie and its a flick which you just can't afford to miss this",9

30 January 2005,Enthralling entertainment!,"Three gunslingers are after a fortune in stolen gold, which they team up but can they trust each other and to make matters harder the country is in a Civil war.

This is the third film in the 'Man with no name' trilogy, with Eastwood and Van Cleef (a different character in this film) returning from 'A Few Dollars More'. In my opinion this is the greatest and most stylish western ever made. With a superb mix of action, adventure and drama and not forgetting the humour.

The cinematography is brilliantly captivating (will the great mix of flashy camera angles), the music score is downright dynamic & undoubtedly absorbing and the backdrop of the film is simply breath taking.

This is one truly drawn-out western film that feels so surreal at times. It runs for just under three hours, the pace of the film is quite good for a very long film, as Leone's direction is really top-notch that it just doesn't seem to matter as this film is really compelling and dense that you could watch it over and over again and it would still seem fresh.

The performances are excellent, Clint Eastwood as the quietly spoken Blondie (the good), Eli Wallach as the humorous Tuco (the ugly) and Lee Van Cleef as the menacing Angel Eyes (the bad). Whenever the three share the screen it's thoroughly imposing and intriguing, though that's greatest thing it doesn't just focus on Eastwood's character- but it has another two strong leads.

The story is tremendously set in the background of the American Civil war, with its twists and turns, comedic touches between Blondie and Tuco, powerful images and great shoot-outs.

Wow, what a spectacular movie this is by Sergio Leone. A defiant must see for movie lovers.

25 March 2023,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly - A Timeless Classic That Transcends Genre and Defines Cinema","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a timeless classic that transcends genre and defines the very essence of cinema. Sergio Leone's direction is masterful, with each scene carefully crafted to build tension and suspense. Ennio Morricone's iconic score is unforgettable, perfectly capturing the film's themes of greed, violence, and the pursuit of fortune.

Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach deliver unforgettable performances as the film's three central characters, each bringing a unique energy and presence to their roles. The film's themes of betrayal, loyalty, and the cost of violence are timeless, and its examination of the human condition continues to resonate with audiences today.

But what truly sets The Good, the Bad and the Ugly apart is its iconic set pieces, including the unforgettable standoff at the cemetery and the explosive climax. The film's visual style and attention to detail are unparalleled, with each shot perfectly capturing the mood and atmosphere of the film's setting.

The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a true masterpiece of cinema, a film that defines the very essence of what it means to be a movie. It is a timeless classic that continues to inspire filmmakers today, and a testament to the power of cinema to capture the human experience and transport audiences to another world.

Sergio Leone's direction, Ennio Morricone's score, and the unforgettable performances of Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach all contribute to making The Good, the Bad and the Ugly an essential viewing experience for any lover of film. It is a true classic that deserves to be celebrated and cherished for generations to come.",10
4 June 2023,"One of the best, most famous and most iconic Westerns ever. More than a classic, it's mandatory.","I'm not an expert nor do I want to sound like one, but I think this is one of the most famous western films ever made, despite being shot by an Italian director and being more European than American. Sérgio Leone was one of the most notable directors of his time and he left us, in this film, one of his masterpieces.

This is one of those movies that is almost perfect. Problems and failures are scarce and reside in minimal details that end up not making a big difference in the overall work. The story was very well written and takes place in the midst of the American Civil War, a time when violence was part of everyday life. In this environment of violence and mutual distrust, two men are looking for a treasure buried in a cemetery: the problem is the fact that each one knows only part of the location (that is, one knows the location of the cemetery and the other knows which grave it is) and there is a third man, a fearsome assassin, willing to do anything to take all the gold.

For this film, Leone put together a very reasonable cast, mostly European, and three great North American actors with enormous talent: Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. I believe that they knew how to make the most intelligent and skilful use of this film, giving us a truly remarkable job. For this three actors, this is the best cinematographic work of their career, or one of the best, consecrating them as great Western movies actors. The film, however, seems to give Wallach more and better opportunities. While watching it, I got the feeling that he is the actor who receives most attention and best material, in addition to having known how to improvise at the right moments and in creative and intelligent ways.

The film has great visual beauty, emphasized by the cinematography, the filming work and the good choice and design of sets and costumes. At a time when the correct period recreation was something that cinema sometimes blatantly ignored, this film did the opposite, giving us a realistic and believable vision of the past and placing the film in a specific place and time. I'm not saying it was a one hundred percent successful effort, but it was definitely a decisive step in the right direction when it comes to period films. The special effects and visuals are excellent, the best there was then, and the whole film has an epic, grandiose, expensive feel. It is also very long, with almost three hours in length, but it is worth not being afraid or giving up on because of that. Being a Western film, it is quite evident that there is a lot of violence, so it is not a film for children. Even so, it is not gratuitous violence. Finally, we owe Ennio Morricone a salute for the excellent soundtrack he composed. Among his vast work, this is not my favorite nor the best, but it is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable and iconic pieces, a work that we know, even without having seen this film, and that has become part of our collective memory. We can't ask for more than that.",10
23 January 2012,Who are you calling ugly?,"In the last of the so-called 'Dollars' trilogy Eastwood now plays a man called Blondie (despite clearly having brown hair) who has hooked up with Tuco, a bandit with an amusingly long list of crimes, to run a reward-and-release scam with various towns and cities across the Old West. Soon tiring of Tuco's behavior, Blondie ends their volatile partnership and heads off on his own.

Angered by the double-cross, Tuco exacts a laborious revenge on Blondie, but just as the punishment reaches its zenith under a burning hot sun in a remote part of the desert a wagon carrying dead Confederate soldiers interrupts. With his last breath, the sole surviving Rebel tells Tuco of a stash of treasure buried in a cemetery, and, while Tuco is distracted, tells Blondie what grave it is buried under. Their difficult partnership is quickly restored as they trek across the West, through Civil War conflicts, towards the treasure.

So far I've only covered the Good and Ugly. The Bad just so happens to be Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless mercenary who has also learned of the hidden loot and eventually crosses paths with his rivals. He has the least screen time, but is necessary as a pure villain to lessen the crude vulgarity of Tuco.

It's a long film. But it's not about the destination, it's about the journey, and Sergio Leone allows himself plenty of time and space to indulge in quirky idiosyncrasies. I especially like Tuco having a bubble bath in the midst of his current location being blown to smithereens.

Villains always interest me, and actors mostly choose villains over heroes as they make for better characters. Blondie may comfort dying soldiers and play with kittens, but he's just too bland. Angel Eyes, is hardcore, and a better character, but he's nothing compared to Tuco. Eli Wallach owns this film, and takes most of the screen time away from Eastwood and Van Cleef. The scene where he searches the cemetery, as the camera spins around and around and around has such a beautiful innocence to it. Even though Tuco may have killed and robbed many this scene makes him seem like an easily excitable child at heart. It's absolutely wonderful.

If you've got an evening free, and just don't know how to spend 3 otherwise empty hours, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is a fine way to spend them.",9
22 April 2014,"Hands down, the best Spaghetti Western movie ever! ""When you have to shoot, shoot! Don't talk."" Sergio Leone knows how to shoot a Spaghetti Western.","Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

14 February 2007,See This If You Don't Like Westerns,"When I was a kid, nobody liked westerns. Our fathers had fought in the Korean War, and the astronauts were racing in space. Cowboys seemed old, dusty, and boring. Then along came three guys to change all that. One was good, the other bad, the other ugly. Or maybe they all had those three characteristics in them. But they arrived at one hell of a showdown, and it changed things.

This is not just an action filled western, but a sweeping commentary on the American character, as witnessed by an objective outsider. His aim was true.

By the mid 60s, the western formula, and perhaps the action film itself, had become too stale and conventional to evoke any enthusiastic response. Leone gave us not just a new perspective on film violence, but for the first time a director blended the most fascinating elements of American history, both mythical and real, into a traditional western story.

The storyline, involving three untitled men propelled by avarice into uncivilized territory, could serve as a fable for the expansion of the American frontier. Against the sun-blasted background we see the elements that have shaped, in different ways, the essential American character: warfare, technology, weapons, hardened individualism. Previous western films might have explored related themes, but never with the exciting visual style shown in this one.

The characters are men we really have never seen before. They are enigmatic, inscrutable, and fascinating to look at. Leone leaves their pasts unmarked so we can eagerly fill in their backgrounds on our own. As their journey in pursuit of lucre ends, we are presented with the best showdown in the history of the western. The quest, exciting as it was, culminates in one of the best endings in movie history.

The score of course is famous in itself but welded to the fascinating visuals and characters it becomes one for the ages. Amazing it took an Italian director filming in Spain to make the essential ""American"" western film. You don't like westerns? I urge you to try this and see things from an outsider's point of view. His aim was true.",10
16 May 2020,A great western.,"Movies I don't get the first time around usually become my favorites. The more I think about those movies, the more I love them and realize that I like them even more.

2 March 2010,"""You may run the risks, my friend, but I do the cutting""","This week I was fortunate enough to see 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly (1966)' (namely, the 2003 extended English-language version) in the cinema, perhaps the only place that Sergio Leone's classic Spaghetti Western can be properly appreciated. This was my second viewing – the first being in 2006, when my interest in cinema was still in its infancy – and, just as Leone's film gained status only in subsequent decades, my admiration has since grown substantially. By the early 1960s, the Western had become a tired genre, and even the best American entries {such as Ford's 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962)'} could more closely be described as somber rather than thrilling. Leone's low-budget Italian productions breathed new life into the Western, the director's highly-stylised (and purely cinematic) film-making style tackling the recently-emerged Revisionist Western sub-genre with a cheekily-parodic sense of humour.

Though 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly' clearly identifies each of its three protagonists with a titular adjective, the separating lines are decidedly blurred. Blondie (Clint Eastwood) is the archetypal anti-hero, a laconic, cigar-smoking bounty-hunter who makes every word, and every bullet, count. Tuco (Eli Wallach) is a slimy opportunist, a bottom-dweller whose unabashed enthusiasm – especially opposite the apathetic Eastwood – makes him an oddly-likable character. Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) is a crafty, intelligent schemer, greed and contempt mixing behind those cold, steely eyes. Leon's film revolves almost exclusively around these three characters, and the American Civil War is utilised purely as a historical backdrop. As was the director's style, the film is a triumph of contrasts: an epic period of American history is used merely as a stage for an intimate battle-of-wills between three determined men with their own selfish aims.

Contrast, too, is evident through Leone's camera lens. Few directors (perhaps David Lean or Sergei Bondarchuk are his only true rivals in this field) have more inspiringly utilised the cinema screen as a canvas. Leone switches between landscapes and portraits, at times cutting unexpectedly from a distant long-shot to an extreme close-up of Eastwood's sweaty brow, his eyes narrowed and alert. I wrote in my review for 'A Fistful of Dollars (1964)' that that Leone's landscape was the human face. Unlike Ford, to whom setting was significant (one reason why he so adored Monument Valley), Leone's Westerns unfold in an anonymous landscape, dry and unremarkable and unforgiving. Colour is instead injected through Ennio Morricone's score, perhaps the most memorable ever composed for a film. The composer's contribution is uniquely cinematic, refusing to linger in the background and instead serving to overwhelm and enhance Leone's imagery.",10
17 September 2010,A Western Masterpiece!,"¨You see in this world there's two kinds of people my friend, those with loaded guns, and those who dig. You dig.¨ I wonder what would've been of Clint Eastwood's career if it weren't for the ¨Dollars¨ trilogy. Before working with Italian filmmaker, Sergio Leone, he had a career as a television actor in Rawhide, a western based TV series, but he couldn't get a decent job in Hollywood so he began to look for work abroad. He reached international success thanks to Leone's reinvented spaghetti westerns: A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (1966), known as the ¨Dollars¨ trilogy. He proved producers wrong because they thought that people wouldn't pay to see movies of actors they could see for free on television, but audiences were more than willing to see him in the big screen. His pairing with Leone couldn't have worked out better for him since the director's trademark was combining long wide shots with extreme close-ups. These wide shots couldn't have been enjoyed as much on the small television sets at home. Eastwood's rough features and manly charisma also contributed to Leone's success, and both seemed destined to work with each other. There is no need to see the previous ¨Dollars¨ movies as The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly stands out on its own and is actually a prequel since the movie takes place during the Civil War in the early 1860's before the other plots take place and they are all separate stories that only have Clint Eastwood's character in common. When I see Eastwood's latest films as a director I can't help but think how much he was influenced by the great Sergio Leone. He must have learned a great deal working with the Italian director in this masterpiece. It is just shot beautifully and to perfection by Leone, the cinematography and scenery are amazing and feel real, and the score is perfect. Eastwood may be a different director than Leone was, but he pays close detail to his craft and also knows how to shoot beautifully.

The plot is pretty simple for a movie that is about three hours long, but Leone's use of the camera and extended shots makes the film longer. He also adds several side stories that work really well in the narrative. The film begins by introducing each character (although in the opposite order: The Ugly, The Bad, and The Good). The film begins with an extreme close up on a bounty hunter (Al Mulock) and then when we see the wide shot there are three of them who are quietly entering a bar. Once the men enter we hear three shots and out comes Tuco, also known as The Ugly (Eli Wallach), who escapes. In the next scene we are introduced to The Bad, Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), who is tracking down a peasant farmer. The scene is truly a classic as no words are spoken for about ten minutes, but the tension can be felt. Angel Eyes is actually looking for information on the location of a treasure of coins lost during the Civil War and he is told a soldier named Bill Carson has it. Finally, we are introduced to Blondie, The Good (Clint Eastwood), who saves Tuco from a group of men who want to turn him in because there is a reward on his head. Blondie saves him only to collect the reward himself, but once Tuco is about to be hanged he shoots the rope and sets him free as part of a scam in which they divide the money. They later turn against each other only to discover the location of the treasure that has been buried and the race begins to see who can get to the treasure first as the three men have different information regarding its whereabouts.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is my all-time favorite Western. Any other film in the genre will always be measured by its standards. The opening scene in which we are introduced to Angel Eyes (The Bad) is just so beautifully shot that no dialogue was needed and we were already hooked (Ennio Morricone's amazing score can also take some credit for that). The first ten minutes have no dialogue whatsoever but it sets up the general tone of the movie: several wide shots where we can see the great landscape and deserts combining them with extreme close ups of the characters facial expressions, the tension and suspense is built with long and slow scenes and suddenly the violence happens so quickly that we are caught off guard. The film doesn't celebrate violence, it portrays it truthfully. The main character is the quiet Blondie (The Good), but without a doubt Tuco (The Ugly) is the one who has the most lines and brings some unbalance and goofiness to an otherwise serious picture. One of the funniest scenes is when he is in the tub and one of the bounty hunter shows up to kill him but before shooting he begins the classic speech villains tend to give and Tuco pulls out his gun and fires at him saying, ¨When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk.¨ Tuco plays a key role and his character is kind of the gray in an otherwise black (Angel Eyes) and white (Blondie), good guy and bad guy western movie. He breaks the conventionality in the genre. The final Mexican standoff scene is also truly memorable and one of the best shot sequences. This is a truly unique film that has stood the test of time; it catapulted Eastwood into a movie star, and has influenced him on his way to becoming a great director. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is one of my all time favorite movies and is a must see film.

17 July 2010,My review is superfluous...,"... but i still want to jostle in with more than half of a thousand other reviews just to type: this is undoubtedly THE best Western movie ever and easily one of the best masterpieces of all time. Even the most noble adjectives preserved particularly for art praising found in Merriam- Webster are too mundane to captivate its greatness.

Please watch this classic before you die.

R.I.P Leone and thank you for blessing your fellow humans such a great gift.

P.S: Eli Wallach + Lee Van Cleef + Clint Eastwood = the most bad-ass narrow- eyes gang in Hollywood.

5 February 2009,Not as good as A few Dollars More,"It's surprising how your memory can play tricks on you. Having watched many westerns in my childhood i could have sworn that i had seen The Good , The Bad and the Ugly . Surely everyone of a certain age has? Well as it turns out i probably hadn't , or if i had i remember nothing of it. This is the final film of the Sergio Leone "" ""Dollars"" or "" man with no name"" trilogy of which i have been watching recently and although this is the most famous of the three ' for me it's not quite the best .

Blondie (The Good) and Tuco (The Ugly) are con artists, trying to steal as much money as possible during the Civil War. Angel Eyes (The Bad) is trying to locate a bank robber going by the name of Bill Carson, in order to collect his stolen gold. After a few scams, Blondie cheats Tuco by keeping his share and leaving him in the dust.

Tuco eventually finds Blondie and drags him off into the desert, torturing him in revenge. Then they run into Bill Carson, who tells Tuco the location of a graveyard where his stolen gold is buried. As Tuco looks for water to keep Carson alive long enough to help more, Carson tells Blondie which gravestone marks the buried gold, and dies before he can say more. Angel Eyes soon figures out that they know, and all three want a 50% share of the gold, but only two of them will get it.

The amazing thing about this superb trilogy is that they all were made within three years. Each movie having it's budget increased. A fistful of dollars - 200K . A few Dollars more - 600K and finally the good , The bad and the ugly 1.1m. In the latter it really shows that leone had a lot more money to spend. Lavish sets , a huge amount of personnel and no doubt an increased salary for the ever popular Clint Eastwood and Lee Van cleef but as any movie fan will tell you an increased budget does not always make a better film .

I have no doubt which is my favourite of the trilogy and that is "" A few dollars More"" . It is the perfect western. This film is not, simply because it's trying to do too much. It's an hour too long and the plot drifts off in different directions. Sure it has all the superb hallmarks of a Sergio Leone western. It looks amazing , it has a wonderful soundtrack and it finishes with typical tense showdown but it's the bits inbetween namely the civil war scenes that distract from what should have been an amazing western.

Angel eyes , the lee van Cleef's character is not engaging enough and i would have loved to have seen him return as Col. Douglas Mortimer who we saw in the previous film instead we get a character who is given third billing behind Blondie and Tuco. In fact the best character is Tuco ' who is played by Eli Wallach and he gets the vast majority of the screen time.

This lacks the brutality of the previous films and maybe that is because Sergio Leone was going for that wider audience.

7 December 2009,We're all Tuco,"One of the best depictions of war, and one of the best anti-war films. The best gunfight ever filmed. Consistently witty, often moving, brutally realistically ugly, and one of the most beautiful films ever shot, set to one of the most beautiful scores. The 'spaghetti' label on the can means that these westerns will never get the consideration and respect they deserve.

If you fancy thinking a little differently about 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly', try the following. Look past Clint Eastwood's legend-founding performance and suppose that the central character is actually Eli Wallach's Tuco, the Ugly. A gross rogue, guilty of every possible vice, Tuco is after all the character we see and hear the most, about whom we learn the most, and through whom we experience much of the action. Eli Wallach makes him comic, poignant, and plausible - certainly compared to the unrestrained darkness of Lee Van Cleef and the impossible cool of Eastwood. The film is largely Tuco's struggle to survive, and to earn a little on the side, constantly battered between Eastwood's ""blond Angel"" and Van Cleef's angel of death. Angels? Indeed: Tuco is ultimately human, and Tuco is all of us - grubby, corrupt, uncomfortable and slightly desperate humans, veering between the good and the bad, subject to a perplexing God and an unrelenting Devil, and just trying to muddle along.",9
10 May 2020,Excellent,"""The good, the bad and the ugly"" is nothing but a masterpiece. From its start to its astonishing ending, this film gives me chills every time i watch it. It truly doesn't matter if you are a Western fan or not, this film will capture you from the first few seconds. It is full of action, and not that kind of mainstream action, but the kind of action that will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the whole picture! From the excellent soundtrack by the great Ennio Morricone to Sergio Leone's unique direction, this film stands out from the rest. Clint Eastwood gives yet another magnificent performance that in my opinion, has changed cinema. Every scene is shot so beautiful that it makes you ""live"" with the well-sculpted characters. To conclude, ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" is one of those few films that managed to shape cinema throughout its long history. If you haven't watched it yet, you should definitely give it a go asap!!

26 November 1999,There's two kinds of men,"And maybe even more in this story of an uneasy (to say the least) alliance between Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach, both in search of hidden gold. It doesn't help that Lee Van Cleef, and boy is he an evil one with a lot of attitude, is also out there looking. Film is quite long, but the non-stop action, Wallach's performance, and rich Civil War backdrop distinguish this one from Clint's earlier Spaghetti Westerns. In fact, this is just about the only one of that genre that I can stand at this point; I saw Once Upon a Tine in the West not too long ago and missed the point entirely. Final showdown is deservingly legendary, as is the musical score. 10 out of 10

14 January 2021,"A good one to watch on January 9th, Lee Van Cleef's birthday","Let's backtrack for a minute here. The Good, The Bad and the Ugly (GBU), is the most famous of the Spaghetti Westerns, however, the Spaghetti Western was around a little bit before the release of GBU. The term basically describes Western films, based on American history, that were made in Europe, most notably Italy and Spain. Some also were made in Mexico and they all came out in the theaters in the 60s & 70s. It is actually a critical term that American critics coined in the 60s, making fun of these films, because America was so used to the TV westerns that filled the airwaves. But, as time moved forward, the term became acceptable, as well as, the movies themselves. It turned into a positive term, because these films were really good, but a little too different for some. These films now have achieved critical acclaim today, long after their release.

GBU is the third film in a series known as ""The Man with No Name"" trilogy, directed by legendary, Italian film director, Sergio Leone. The musical score was done by master film composer, Ennio Morricone. He would later go on to do the score for Brian De Palma's Untouchables (1987), another great movie and favorite of mine.

GBU is that classic story about three completely different guys, the good one (Clint), the bad one (Van Cleef) and the ugly one (Wallach). It has a wonderful collection of colorful, interesting supporting characters that help propel this film to its exciting end. Its so well, craftily done that you don't even notice the basic, simple plot of three outlaws, in the ultimate struggle to see, who can find the gold from a heist that was hidden away. This also helps to bring forward the time period that the film wants to establish, being as the gold was stolen from a Confederate stash during the Civil War. Eastwood and Wallach's characters get intertwined with each other, while Van Cleef's, Angel Eyes, always is looking for an opportunity to kill them both. It's a great story.

Eli Wallach almost killed himself a couple times in this film. Issues with stunts and poor safety measures almost did some of the work for Angel Eyes. Eli Wallach is brilliant and funny in this film too. This is Clint Eastwood at his best. Clint's character also influenced Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), in Back to the Future III (1990). Having mixed language-speaking actors also complicated matters. Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach all spoke English, but most of the rest of the cast was Italian or Spanish, hence the need for dubbing. Sergio Leone spoke hardly any English, so he and Wallach communicated by speaking French to each other and the others had interpreters.

Charles Bronson was originally chosen to be in Lee Van Cleef's ""Bad"" roll, but declined to be in the film. There is no dialogue in the first eleven minutes of the film, but who cares. GBU's strongest link is its dreamy-like imagery mixed in with amazing, mesmerizing music. This is what film is all about and this is the definitive Western.

9.4 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9
14 January 2001,"""No one used the widescreen ratio more dynamically than director Sergio Leone...""","The above quote is from Bill Hunt, one of America's best-known proponents of 16x9 Enhancement. Having seen this film very briefly on an old VHS tape, and then experiencing it on 16x9 Enhanced DVD, there is just no comparison. It's like looking at the interior of a mansion through a keyhole, then looking through the wide-open door. The scene in which Tuco discovers the graveyard where the pot of gold is buried is a classic example of a scene that loses all of its drama when chopped down just to fit some tiny little narrow screen.

Of course, it's not just the cinematography that earns this film a place in the top 250 of all time. Clint Eastwood's non-existent acting style actually benefits the film, as the less his character says to anyone, the more enigmatic he becomes. Eli Wallach is annoying, but that was the whole idea all along as far as I can tell, and he does this job well. Lee Van Cleef is suitably devilish as ""Angel Eyes"" Setenza, the ultimate expression of the mercenary sensibility concept. They're the only three actors whose roles have any semblance of development, but the style they bring to each role is more than enough to carry the film by itself.

It's also no accident that the main theme of this film, as well as ""The Ecstasy Of Gold"", the theme we hear during Tuco's hunt for Arch Stanton's grave, are among the most frequently replayed or outright ripped off pieces of film scoring in the history of cinema. The latter is especially powerful, as it takes what would otherwise be a meaningless sequence of a man dashing through a makeshift cemetary into one of the most powerful moments of the film. There's only one other composer I've heard who has performed an equally amazing feat through the use of music - John Williams.

Of course, the best element of this film is that it shows the American Civil War the way it really happened. Slavery was just one element of the war, and a relatively minor one at that. Other elements such as British Loyalism, economic problems, taxation without representation, and general discrimination were the causes of the war. To the everyday man, represented in three different ways by the film's principal characters, the causes of the war were secondary to the opportunities for exploiting either side in order to make a fortune. It has been that way well before the Civil War, and it will always be that way long after the Civil War is long-forgotten. In that sense, this film is less a Western than it is a drama about three greedy men after a pot of gold.

And if you want to see the reason why television screens are *finally* being made wider, get the 16x9 Enhanced DVD version of this film that is available in America (NTSC) or Europe/Australia (PAL). Cinematography just doesn't get any finer than this, and neither do dramas with Western motifs.",10

16 June 2007,The most influential western ever.,"By far the most ambitious and unflinchingly graphic western ever mounted, THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY is an engrossing, explosive movie shot through with a volatile mix of myth and realism.

Clint Eastwood returns as the invincible 'man with no name' or 'blondie'. This time teaming with two gunlingers (Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach) to pursue a fortune in stolen gold. But teamwork doesn't come naturally to such strong-willed outlaws, and they soon discover that their greatest challenge may be to stay focused - and stay alive - in a country ravaged by war.

And Eli Wallach as Tuco ""the ugly"" a more humorous addition to the series, but also earn the title as he is neither good, nor bad. Greedy and a coward is a better description.

Once again it's all about money, this time 200 000 dollars, a lot of money back then. I won't spoil much, the money is buried in a grave, and only Tuco knows which cemetery, and only Blondie knows which grave. And ""Angel eyes"" are never far behind them.

This movie is a masterpiece of it's time, the acting is great, Sergio Leone deserves a lot of credit for this film, and the theme music is unforgettable. Plus they finally improved the dubbing which was a little unsynced in the two previous films. Also it portrayed a very realistic image of the American Civil War without taking any particular side in the conflict. then again the main character doesn't exactly care much for the war, they're just after the gold. Then still it's nice to see Blondie show his sympathy for those who fought and died in the war.

I really can't recommend this film enough, if you haven't seen any of the films in this trilogy, buy them immediately and watch all of them. If you have the films and have only seen the two first, well what are you waiting for! Don't do anything other than buy this film, it's a must see and must have film. I give this film (obviously) a 10/10.",10
4 August 2020,Better As Fully Restored,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

31 December 2020,An extraordinarily fantastic western,"Sergio Leone proves yet again that he's the master of cinematography and the western genre. The film is so brilliant in setting up the tone and themes, slipping seamlessly from comedy to tragedy to violent passion and back to comedy again. Every character is designed to perfection, even the little characters who have but minutes of screen time are all interesting and very unique.

Cinematography is spot on, with vast panning shots of the western land and also encompasses frequent but well placed close ups of character's faces so as to better read their emotions (or presumed lack of) and dominate the screen. Furthermore, in some shots what the camera cannot see the characters cannot see, and that gives Leone the freedom to surprise us with character entrances (Tuco surprised Blondie for example) that cannot be explained by the normal geography of shots.

The music by Ennio Morricone is absolutely superb and can be both subtle and obvious to drive a scene and enhance the action. The sharp jab of music when the evil Angel Eyes first rides into frame leads to a certain level of unease that cannot be explained any other way apart from the music. Music that has long become legendary and iconic, rightfully so.

The acting is breath-taking, Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, Lee Van Cleef and every single supporting actor (reluctant to use supporting considering how great the roles are) are perfect.

10/10: You cannot dislike this film, and if you do you're just plain wrong in my eyes",10
12 July 2006,An instant reminder of what a movie really is!,"Civil War, gold is up for grabs, and three dirty cowboys all want it. Seems like a regular Western. It's a good thing film-directing God Sergio Leone and cowboy-extraordinaire Clint Eastwood paired up, because in that genre, there isn't a better match. To this day, there hasn't been a movie that comes close to the depth and craft that his movie produces.

It's a beautifully woven-together piece of cinema that Sergio knows what to do with. He creates a feeling of both intensity and humor by portraying the three key characters with one trait only; The Good (Clint Eastwood), The Bad (Lee Van Cleef), and The Ugly (Eli Wallach). These characters follow their own instincts, whether it be good or bad, and let nothing stand in their way of recovering the gold. The only problem is, they have to work together to get it. One knows the place of the gold (a graveyard), and one knows which grave it's buried under. Just how long does it take until the cowboys let their pride and betrayal ruin their treasure hunt? Though the beautiful directing is immensely distinct and original, the movie is very plot-driven. The characters don't matter to us. We could have The Good play The Ugly and it would still be the same outcome. But from Sergio's vision, comes a truly magnificent submission into the psychology of the Civil War civilians and determined, gun-shooting varmints.

At first, we meet the characters by obviously seeing them do what they're intended to do. The Ugly robs a store, The Bad kills a few people, and The Good saves someone's life. After that, we see that The Ugly and The Good are actually working together to do what dirty cowboys do best; collect their money. Upon finding out about the treasure, all three characters become The Determined, and both work together and hang each other by the necks (literally) to find the gold.

From beginning to end, ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" is utterly entertaining and unique. It can be called both a Western and a War movie. As the plot develops and thickens, we see more of the setting than in all other Westerns combined. Everything is twice as big, and everything is twice as dirty. A definite classic, that defined cinema in more than one way, with its memorable score, to the never before seen directing, the movie stands as one of (if not the) best movies of all time.",10
8 January 2020,"Not a big fan of westerns, but I like this one","The Good the Bad, and the Ugly is a spaghetti western film starring Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef. The film is directed by Sergio Leone and is the conclusion to the Dollars Trilogy, which also starred Clint Eastwood. The film centers on three outlaws who are on the hunt to find a fortune in gold buried in a cemetery. To kick-start this review off I will mention that this is the final chapter in the Dollars Trilogy. The Dollars Trilogy are three spaghetti films starring Clint Eastwood as the Man with No Name. And these three movies are major influences that have inspired countless western films to come. But unlike the first two films, I think I speak for everyone in saying that this is the film that brings a breath of fresh air to the western genre. Even though the movie is called The Good the Bad, and the Ugly, the movie does display its good, bad, and ugly side to things. I don't know if it was Sergio Leone's intention to go all out in the final chapter and have this be his magnum opus, but he needs to work on the run time. This movie is three hours and in those three hours the movie felt like it was all over the place as we focus on these three outlaws hunting for buried treasure, but then it jumps to the American Civil War. There just needed to be some common ground on whoever wrote the script, but I didn't feel any connection. And when this movie was released, people didn't like it and received criticism as well. And in a way I feel like I fit that category because I didn't like it after it was finished, but it grew on me after. But ignoring its three-hour run time, the movie does make up for its brilliant dialogue, acting, and the music department. The music does a great job building that suspense feeling and I as I was watching this zoning in and out, as soon as that theme song kicked in, I knew I was in for a ride. And that last scene alone is enough for me to say that you should definitely watch this if you're not a fan of the western genre. I'm not the biggest fan of western genres, but Clint Eastwood makes any western movie enjoyable to watch that no other western character can top Clint Eastwood's charm and charisma. So in the end, even though this movie is three hours long to the point where it bore me to tears, the movie grew on me to the point that I realize while it may not be the best movie of the western genre, its still the one western movie I would recommend watching regardless if you hate western movies.",9

16 July 2023,Timeless Masterpiece to be Appreciated by Future Generations,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) is an epic Italian Western directed by Sergio Leone that has become a milestone in the genre and one of the most influential films in cinema history. Starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach, the movie presents a captivating story set during the American Civil War, where three gunslingers compete to find a fortune in stolen gold.

One of the film's distinctive features is Leone's ability to create visually stunning sequences. His wide cinematography and use of wide shots and close-ups establish a tense and captivating atmosphere. Additionally, Ennio Morricone's masterfully composed soundtrack enhances the unique cinematic experience, with its instantly recognizable and iconic main theme.

The screenplay, written by Agenore Incrocci, Furio Scarpelli, Luciano Vincenzoni, Sergio Leone, and Sergio Donati (uncredited), is skillfully crafted, presenting a narrative filled with twists and complex characters. The three protagonists, known as ""the Good,"" ""the Bad,"" and ""the Ugly,"" are portrayed masterfully by Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach, respectively. Each brings their character to life in a memorable way, with Eastwood, in particular, solidifying his position as an icon of the genre.

The impact of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly on the Western genre is undeniable. While the film is part of Leone's Dollars Trilogy, it goes beyond the boundaries of the spaghetti Western and becomes a masterpiece of cinema as a whole. Leone's revisionist approach, which challenges the traditional conventions of the Western, was instrumental in revitalizing the genre at the time and inspiring future productions.

By portraying a desolate and lawless West, filled with violence and morally ambiguous characters, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly resonated with audiences of the time and captured the melancholy of the turbulent 1960s. The film's visual style, influenced by Catholic iconography and surrealistic elements, adds layers of depth and meaning to the narrative.

Sergio Leone managed to elevate the Western to an art form, surpassing the genre's expectations and creating a lasting cinematic experience. His innovative and daring approach set a new standard for Western films, and its impact can still be felt in the film industry today.

In summary, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is an epic and unforgettable Western that has left an indelible mark on the genre. With its masterful cinematography, iconic soundtrack, engaging narrative, and brilliant performances, Sergio Leone's film remains an essential reference for cinema lovers and a timeless masterpiece that should be appreciated by future generations.",10
1 June 2020,"""Well now, seems just like old times""","I've been watching a lot of classics lately and Sergio Leone's masterpiece couldn't be left out. I was a bit hesitant at first to watch it because I generally don't care much for Westerns. But it sure was well worth the time.

The story starts rather slow and throughout the movie there isn't al that much dialogue. The dialogue that is being said though, is absolute gold and the entire movie is filled with memorable quotes that will stick with you for a long time. The cinematography draws you in and combined with the slow pace makes for a unique experience. You get completely lost in the beautiful landscape and it puts you in a place you don't want to get out of. The movie can be considered long, with a runtime of nearly three hours, but you find yourself wishing for more when it is over.

I also wonder if there were ever three more compelling characters put together than 'The Good' (Clint Eastwood), 'The Bad' (Lee Van Cleef) and 'The Ugly' (Eli Wallach). Three completely different characters that work so well together on screen and bring with them a continuous tension that puts you at the edge of your seat. Eastwood's 'Blondie' is the most fascinating character of the three. A man of few words but everything he says and does is coolness personified. He brings with him the illusion of being the good guy and of having a moral center while killing his way to $200,000 in stolen gold.

Van Cleef's 'Angel Eyes' is evil personified in the story. With those menacing eyes you sense right away that he is ruthless in everything he does. But still you're never quite sure what he is up to and he keeps you guessing as to what his next move will be. Wallach's 'Tuco' is a very complex character on his own. Having no problem in lying and deceiving to get what he wants. Yet you can't help to have a little bit of sympathy for him and he is responsible for some of the funniest lines in the movie. ""I get dressed, I kill him, be right back.""

The legendary score put together by Ennio Morricone is absolute perfection and brings a perfect sound to the amazing images. Tuco running through the cemetery whilst you hear ""The ecstacy of gold"" is one of the most memorable scenes i've ever seen in cinema. It is hard to find a more perfect half hour on film than the last thirty minutes of this Western epic. How Sergio Leone manages to turn a stare down between three people in to one of the best and most exciting sequences put together is sheer excellence.

Go watch this movie if you haven't already, you'll be glad you did.",9
20 January 2023,The best western and one of the best movies,"Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo.

When I saw the first one I was very impressed, the cinematography, the camera angles the performances, everything in this movie is perfect. It is the best western and one of the best in history.

Eli's character Wallach I feel is one of the most charismatic and mythical in the history of cinema, also the famous scene of the final duel between the good the bad and the ugly.

Also the score of the genius Ennio Morricone left one of the most iconic themes in the history of cinema.

What else to say about this masterpiece simply cinema in its maximum expression. A CLASSIC.",10
21 August 2019,I love ugly,"Tuco was my most favorite character in good bad and ugly. He is crooked and acts like a chameleon. Blondie is cunning and straightforward. Angel eyes is perfect as bad guy. Next highlight is the rocking soundtrack. Only drawback is length and unnecessary pre climax. On the whole good bad and ugly is a classic cowboy film.

17 February 2008,"Just Isn't The Same Now, But Still Love The Soundtrack","Usually, the more I see a film the more I learn to appreciate it. Here's the opposite: I really enjoyed this when it came it at the theater. It made such an impression that I remember where exactly I saw this film, and I enjoyed it on TV a few other times afterward. Now, 40 years later my opinion of it is not the same. The only aspect that I still have a high regard for in here in the music, now considered probably one of the ""classic"" soundtracks.

However, the three main characters - the men who dominate this film - played by Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef - are really nothing but overly crude and excessively violent morons. The worst, of course, is Wallach's ""Taco."" He makes me want to take a shower after watching this film! He and Eastwood's ""Blondie"" just take turns brutalizing each other through much of the film. Van Cleef's role is considerably less, as ""Sentzenza"" or ""Angel Eyes.""

Wallach's character is just plain insulting. He is a real lowlife and a horrible witness for anyone of the Catholic faith, which is why they probably emphasize the latter with him genuflecting throughout the film while acting like a complete degenerate. It's another slam on that denomination (of which I am not a member, by the way).

I usually like Director Sergio Leone's long, dramatic, slow shots and good facial closeups Leone keeps his camera so long on one subject that it gets boring. So, there is a rarely a happy medium in this movie: it's either too violently stupid or too slow.

What was once ""good"" has now turned ""bad"" and ""ugly.""",5
29 August 2020,As good as expected,"Sergio Leone delivered a masterpiece with The Good, The Bad And The Ugly. 54 years later this film still holds up as one of the best Westerns of all time. (if not the best) Of course, ""Once upon a time in the West"" comes close, but this movie was a bit more thrilling in the end. Personnally, I found that the synergy between Tuco and Blondie was more powerful and interesting than the two protagonists in that film. You care for Tuco, but in the same way Blondie does. In my opinion, his actor performed the best out of the trio. While I watching I couldn't stop thinking about how many newer films got inspired by his character. It seems like everything from Pirates of The Caribbean to Tarantino studied this movie closely to create their worlds. And I'm not complaining, because frankly if more people did, we wouldn't have to deal with so many contrieved story lines.

25 July 2012,Brilliant,"To keep it short, it's simply the best western and probably the best film ever made.

The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is an absolute masterpiece. It's got great directing, great actors, great music, great action, great lines. Everything about this piece of art is great and the film is so damn cool, it's just incredible. I don't know how to describe how magically The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is. The storyline is simple but brilliant and the characters are fascinating. The scenery is meditative and the music mesmerizing, the action and violence are brutal but realistic. Everything fits. Well, the film is long but that doesn't matter, time just flies by.

Enough said, go rent or buy this wonderful flick, you won't regret it.

6 September 2012,Sergio's Masterpiece Still Influences Films and Filmmakers Today.,"Watch films and TV shows to this day and you'll see how deeply influential that ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" has been. Sergio Leone's masterpiece, to be sure. Just as influential, is the musical score by Ennio Morricone. Yet it's so interesting to note how Leone's style was greatly influenced by the work of John Ford.

GBU is an essential film, and anyone reading this understands it. How many people, who don't like westerns, recognize that high-pitched wail that plays at the beginning and very end of the film? It's amazing that the film is 161 minutes long in its original theatrical release, but so many people are so satisfied with it from beginning to end.

Most people generally root for that scoundrel, Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez - known as the rat! What I enjoyed was that Blondie was never *too* Good, while Angel Eyes was so good at being oh, so bad. Tuco, being the Ugly? You understand why he resorted to his ways as his character developed, and you tend to actually root for him. But you still never want to turn your back on him.

One of my favorite intimate scenes was Blondie, taking a pause from a pursuit, crossing paths with the soldier. Not one word is said, but the moment between them is truly touching. The only person we truly don't get too close to, is Angel Eyes, but you simply don't feel cheated by that.

The cinematography is exquisite. Whether it was the DP, Tonino Delli Colli, or the vision of Sergio's direction, you find a depth to the film like never seen before. The deep focus, using wide angle lenses to maintain focus from, say, a shoe in the foreground to people yards away, to the truly extreme closeups of only shifting eyes, is cinematic genius.

There is not one actor that's off in this film. And the writing - three men pursuing a hidden treasure, through the back yard of the Civil War - is outstanding work, with just enough comic relief to give you a chance to relax from the countless number of climaxes throughout.

""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,"" is the benchmark of not only westerns, but of filmmaking in general. This film, released in 1966, stands at #5 of the top 250 films, which says volumes, especially with over a quarter million votes. And GBU only won one award?",10
8 May 2014,One of the Best Films I Have Ever Seen,"It took me a long time to come around to the idea of watching ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" I'm not generally a fan of Westerns, and I always dismissed this film as the kind of movie fan boys would like.

Well I've been watching movies for a long time, and I've seen most of the ""best of all time"" movies, so it's pretty rare anymore for a movie to join the ""one of the best films I've ever seen"" ranks. But Sergio Leone's simply magnificent film did just that. The first thing I asked myself when it was over was, ""Why did I wait so long to see it?"" For a cinephile, it's just utter joy to watch this movie. It's beautiful -- beautifully composed, beautifully scored. Every shot is a work of art by itself. But what surprised me the most was how funny and playful the movie is. It's like reading a Charles Dickens novel, waiting to see how the various plot threads are going to come together and what crazy twist the storyteller is going to throw your way next.

Watching Sergio Leone's movie made me instantly appreciate Quentin Tarantino less. He obviously adores Leone and borrows (steals) from him outright, but what seems daring and original in Tarantino's work feels instantly derivative when you see the real deal and realize it was made over forty years ago yet feels more alive than almost anything filmmakers are putting out there today.

Grade: A+",10
8 September 2007,The best of the three and the best western ever.....,"I spent all day watching all three movies and this one beats the other two and near every other western out there. (with a few exceptions...) Usually, Spaghetti westerns annoy me do to the cheesy noises, unrealistic shooting, and lots of bore. But this movie was different. Unlike the other two, this movie had lots of simple comedy. (Most from Eli Wallach's silliness and stupidity as Tuco adds a perfect sense of comic relief and Clint Eastwood's slickness and intelligence as Blondie makes him so.... cool. Lee Van Cleef does a perfect job as the villain giving a sinister performance. Instead of the fact that the slow parts in the first two movies were boring, this movie took advantage of long shots for suspense and to get a sense of things which is a great directing tool. (Kudos to Sergio Leone) I can surely see why this is #4 on the IMDb top 250. It feels more realistic than the other two movies. No whistling noises when things fall, suspenseful music(and very famous), stellar acting, and nice shoot outs. One of my favorite Clint Eastwood movies and one of my favorite westerns ever! A+. 10/10 Watch this one right away. (I recommend watching the new edition DVDs, the white cases, because the quality is better, the sound is great, and newer, and the dubbing is near impossible to spot.) Don't miss this or you will miss one of the greatest, classic movies ever made.",10
30 June 2023,Western at its finest,"Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo.

A bounty hunting scam joins two men in an uneasy alliance against a third in a race to find a fortune in gold buried in a remote cemetery.

The good, the bad and the ugly is a classic western movie that I've heard a lot about, it's very simple than I thought it would be and it is enjoyable for someone that doesn't watch movies of this genre, very enjoyable for a film from the 60's.

The plot was simply interesting to watch, so many legendary things that make this film a legendary one, the classic sounds effects, the classic story build up ,the classic soundtracks and more.

I really loved the characters especially Blondie and his unstable relationship with Tuco, it was the highlight of this movie till the last second of it. Something creepy was about Angel eyes, his character was a pure frightening one in the screen, what a performance from each one of the epic trio .

Directing was great considering the era, I want to see more of Sergio Leone's, especially if it's starring the goated Clint Eastwood .",9
5 May 2001,Well done,"This is a long movie, and it seems short; that makes it a good film. Funny and at times unbelievable, the movies strong point is its satire of the west. It is a good story, and well acted. The film is more of a art forum than your traditional western. One point the director portrays in this film, is how gritty the west was, and how cruel the world is when the wicked play on their terms. Worth seeing.

17 February 2006,A superb story that loses it's flair and entertainment when it runs on too long,"""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" is the final movie of ""The Dollars Trilogy,"" nd had ""For a Few Dollars More"" and ""A Fistful of Dollars"" coming before it.

This one starts off very good. After the stylish credits and the famous music, we are introduced to every one of the characters. ""The Ugly"" (Tuco) gets his introduction with no dialog, and just action.

""The Bad"" (Angel Eyes) really shows how ""bad"" he is, with one of the most ""bad-ass"" lines in Westerns. ""When I'm paid, I always follow my job through."" When you hear that line, wait for a couple seconds, and then you will know why he is called ""The Bad.""

""The Good"" (Man with no Name)gets introduced when he triumphs over ""The Ugly."" Of course, he's not really ""good,"" but most Western heroes simply aren't. Take William Munny in ""Unforgiven"" or The Lady in ""The Quick and the Dead.""

To quickly sum up the story, ""The Good"" finds out the location of a treasure from a man's dying breath. (No, his last words weren't ""Rosebud."") They meet up with ""The Bad"" who also wants to get his hands on the treasure.

The ending takes a lot of twists, and the quick-draw scene was very good. But, the film seemed to slow at parts that could have been easily cut down. For example, in the graveyard scene, Tuco runs around for at least three minutes, which means three minutes of boredom instead of story, dialog or action.

Another flaw was the English dubs. Well, I'm not sure if they're dubs or not, but the voices don't match the mouth at times.

Oh well. The ending was really good. Well, to be more precise, the last couple of minutes. Note: For all you Tarintino fans, this is his favorite movie.

9 July 2020,Blondie!!!! One of my favourite movies of all time,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

16 March 2023,Can You Get Any Closer to Perfection?,"I generally don't like westerns and I was not a fan of the previous two installments in this ""trilogy"", but this film is undeniably a legendary masterpiece. This is the mother of westerns. Can't find many weak points and I have to admit it has to be one of the best movies ever.

First of all, the music must be mentioned. Ennio Morricone's score is unbeatable. It is undoubtedly one of the best scores ever. The film would have been nothing without the music. Scenes, where Tuco runs around for several minutes, would have been boring without the music. Add the music and you have one of the most iconic scenes ever. You can not look at a western movie without hearing this music play. It's so iconic that even if you have not seen the movie, you will have heard the score.

It's an old film with old camera technology. This is where the film may lose many viewers. The last thing a western film - which is mostly set in an ugly and bleak desert - needs is bad cinematography. The cinematography is good for its time, but of course, it is not as strong today almost 60 years later. The camera work is impressive, but the technology hinders it. Fortunately, the score saves the sometimes very blurry and low-resolution images.

The composition is perfect. So many new movies are heavily inspired by the photography from this movie. Director Sergio Leone is a master of visual storytelling. Many scenes do not even contain dialogue, but it is still clear what is going on. Small grimaces from the actor or small movements from the camera tell us enough. It is perfect.

An example of visual storytelling is the scene when Tuco tries to find Eastwood's character. He follows a trail where someone has set several campfires. At these campfires, he finds Eastwood's old cigars. We know he's very close when he lifts a cigar and it's still smoking. The end of the film is also an exemplary example of visual storytelling. It is a fantastic feeling when you understand what is happening in the scene without dialogue. It's brilliantly done.

All actors are good. Both the ugly and the good are good, but the bad gets too little screen time. The bad / Angel Eyes is played very well by Lee Van Cleef. He's a bit creepy while also being very charismatic. Nobody delivers a performance worthy of an Oscar, but it's solid acting from everyone involved.

In conclusion, a legendary film that everyone must see. It has inspired countless amazing works. It's hard not to be blown away by epicness when the music plays. The film is as close to perfect as you can get. I understand why this film is still analyzed today. The film is really clever.",10
25 July 2005,Greatest Western of all time,"Clint Eastwood stars as the man without a name again in this western about three gunslingers who all end up looking for the same treasure of 200,000 in gold.

The movie is the western of all westerns. Clint Eastwood's first major role is in this movie. Sergio Leone does a great job and leaves his legacy with this movie. The close ups are amazing. Facial expressions are very key to this movie which has very little dialogue at times. The music is awesome. You know the tune...du du du, wa wa wa wa.Overall, it is the greatest western of all time.

I highly recommend this western.

2 March 2007,A True Masterpiece,"People like to throw the term 'Masterpiece' around and rarely is it ever as apt and as TRUE when concerning Sergio Leone's The Good the Bad and The Ugly.

I mean, where to start? How about the music for instance, Morricone writes truly inspirational and masterful work, sure, everyone knows the theme tune, but his music has influenced EVERY western reference since. He captures the mood, the emotion and makes this movie EPIC with his wonderfully orchestrated scores. The landscapes and scenery are visually stunning and it's perfectly filmed for true atmosphere, intertwining with the aforementioned music, well it's nothing short of magnificent. Every scene is influential and significant, and equally as intriguing. The acting by Clint Eastwood can take no other meaning but 'cool'. He is what every gun-slinging', cigarette chewing cowboy is based on post-this and no doubt has inspired TONS of action heroes (Or indeed Villains) throughout cinema.

But the storyline isn't as basic as one would first imagine: three gunmen searching for a rather large sum of money, it seems that simple. However, all of the gunmen have complex personalities and none are flawless in moral judgment, to which it is hard to judge who is indeed 'Good', 'Bad' or 'Ugly'. The classic 'Good Versus Evil' situation that is such a frequent theme in film (And coincidentally, more often in westerns) is slightly blurred in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and I personally think there is no definite and it is left up to the viewer to decide.

This movie is simply essential viewing, an all-time classic and much deeper than would first appear. Incredible.",10
5 August 2003,"Impressive Completion of ""Nameless Man"" Trilogy.","Sergio Leone's completion of the ""Nameless Man"" trilogy is definitely the most popular of all his films. It is the Civil War-era West and the three titled characters (Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach) are all after a hidden fortune of buried gold in an old graveyard. The typical twists and turns come with chess matches aplenty among the three leads as alliances are made, broken and made again. Eastwood became an icon with this one and has not looked back since. Once again, this film has little to do with ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and ""For a Few Dollars More"" except for Eastwood's mysterious drifter. Van Cleef plays a different role from the latter film and Wallach makes his first appearance in a Spaghetti Western. Leone shows a real love for the David Lean-styled epic with ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"", but sometimes the film admittedly drags and becomes a little too long. It also does not become quite as complicated as it would have liked to be. Personally, I thought ""For a Few Dollars More"" was a better production and a bit deeper. Overall though this is another winner from the new-age cinema that came about in the mid-1960s. 4 stars out of 5.

8 May 2016,"I'm looking for the owner of that horse. He's tall, blonde, he smokes a cigar, and he's a pig!","It's debatable of course, since there are legions of fans of the first two films in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trology, but with each film there not only came a longer running time, but also a rise in quality - debatable of course!

Here for the third and final part of the trilogy, Leone adds Eli Wallach to the established pairing of Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood, and brings all his tools of the trade to the party. Plot is slight, the three principals are on a collision course to find some buried gold, with each man having varying degrees of scuzziness, so how will it pan out?

Such is the genius of the narrative, it's a fascinating journey to undertake. The characterisations are ripe and considered, the various traits and peccadilloes beautifully enhanced, and with Leone being Leone, there's no shortage of cruelty and humour. He also brings his style, the close ups, long shots and some outstanding framing of characters in various situations.

The story encompasses The Civil War, which pitches our leads into ""The Battle of Branston Bridge"", where here we get to see just how great Leone was at constructing full on battle sequences. It's exciting, thrilling and literally dynamite, whilst Aldo Giuffrè as Captain Clinton turns in some memorable support.

The Euro locations pass muster as the Wild West, superbly photographed by Tonino Delli Colli, and then of course there is Ennio Morricone's musical compositions. It's a score that has become as iconic as Eastwood's Man With No Name, a part of pop culture for ever more. It mocks the characters at times, energises them at others, whilst always us the audience are aurally gripped.

There's obviously some daft coincidences, this is after all pasta world, and the near three hour run time could be construed as indulgent. But here's the thing, those who love The Good, The Bad and the Ugly could quite easily stand for another hour of Leone's classic. I mean, more barbed dialogue, brutal violence and fun! Great, surely!

From the sublime arcade game like opening credit sequences, to the legendary cemetery stand-off at the finale, this is a Western deserving of the high standing it is held. 9/10",9
28 May 2015,Third time is the charm,"Clint Eastwood is good, Lee Van Cleef is bad and Eli Wallach is ugly. Sorry about that, Eli. Eastwood again plays the Man with No Name whom we have already seen in A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. Our hero, this time referred to as Blondie, may be ""good"" compared to the other two leading characters but having seen the first two films we know he is not the traditional all-American hero. He's not all good, he's more complex than that. There's not much complexity to Angel Eyes, the character played by Van Cleef. This guy is bad to the bone. Meanwhile Wallach threatens to steal the show. He plays Tuco and this is a guy who, in an otherwise very quiet movie, never shuts up. Good, bad and ugly are searching for $200,000 in Confederate gold known to be buried in a cemetery. It's a very simple plot for a very long movie but the time flies by. Director Sergio Leone ratchets up the tension and keeps you on the edge of your seat.

The events of this film, unfolding during the Civil War, actually take place prior to the events of the first two films in the Dollars Trilogy. And the war certainly intrudes on the story, causing complications for our characters in their desperate search for that gold. A big war battle scene lends a bit of grandeur that the first two films didn't have. Leone is making a film of much larger scale this time around. But while the war looms over everything this is still a story about our hero and the two companions he would very much like to be rid of. There are great twists and turns as at different times in the movie different members of the trio have the upper hand. Sometimes you're at the top, sometimes you're at the bottom, sometimes you're forced into an unholy alliance with your great adversary. All along the way there is much drama. And along with the drama there is plenty of action too. This is a movie which grabs your attention right at the start and holds it throughout.

Blondie is the nominal hero, making Eastwood the nominal star. And, as already established in the prior two films, Eastwood suits the role perfectly. He's the perfect embodiment of the quiet, cunning, not totally heroic hero. Van Cleef played a good guy, more or less, in For a Few Dollars More. This time around he gets to play a total baddie and he sinks his teeth into the role with great relish. Wallach is a little over-the-top but delightfully so. Tuco is a crazed, maniacal character and Wallach pours his heart into his performance. He brings so much energy to the film. Three great actors, three great characters. Leone could hardly go wrong. And the film has so much more to offer. With breathtaking visuals and a truly memorable score the film both looks and sounds spectacular. Story, actors, cinematography, music. This film is the total package. It is certainly the best of the Dollars Trilogy, this is the Man with No Name's greatest adventure. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is often found on short lists of the greatest films ever made. That kind of acclaim may be overselling things just a touch. But there is no doubt this is a very good film, a thrilling last chapter in the story of one of the most iconic characters to ever grace the screen.",7
9 July 2013,Not the Best Spaghetti Western,"The Good......it is one of those ""New"", groundbreaking, and completely different Movies that was quite influential, broke Taboos, and in the midst of a Decade of change was an announcement from a Director that said...""take this, you Western Movies"", and the Western Movies did and never looked back......The Cinematography expanses and lingering affection for landscapes brought the John Ford aesthetic to a new Generation and to a new level of opulence. There are some other Camera Tricks here that are playfully fresh (for 1966) and it was without doubt, Psychedelia before it was fashionable......The Soundtrack that is now an indelible part of Pop Culture and reminds us Today of how different it really was.

The Bad......Endless Closeups of squinting eyes. A tendency to elaborate on already elongated Scenes to add to the already established Suspense......The Character Tuco becomes relentlessly obnoxious, overbearing, irritating, and unlikeable immediately and this keeps up for almost 3 Hours. It is an overacted Performance that makes the Movie less engaging......The length seems padded and indulgent.

The Ugly......All the Characters, their Personalities and the Makeup. This is truly a Panorama of Ugliness throughout and given its length, a bit too much to bare......There is for your viewing pleasure...flies, filthy Faces (almost always in close up) chewing little cigars and sporting blood, pus, scabs, and other assorted flavors like food being shoveled into salivating mouths with Technicolor glee......Ugly could be a word that would describe this Movie. Another would be overrated.

In conclusion......The best Spaghetti Western is from the same Director...Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).",7

11 October 2002,Classic Italian western hits almost all its marks,"Leone hits his stride -- it's beautiful, exciting, and very funny. The music is Morriconne's most famous and was worked out before the film was shot so effects could be coordinated with sound. The results are excellent. Eastwood is good, Van Cleef is as always campy fun, and Wallach is captivating as the best in the series of bandito/heroes in Leone's films. Good story introduces epic scope for the first time in a Leone film, marking a departure from the Boetticher/""psychological western"" style of his first 2 westerns.

24 December 2021,No American Western Can Come Anywhere Near !,"Hollywood's westerns of the 1950's and 60's had actors riding many miles, then reach their destination looking fresh, and wearing ironed shirts !

TGTB&TU showed us what people actually looked like, with filthy faces and bad teeth etc. That must have been a wake up call ... because this style was copied in full by later Hollywood westerns !

This is now a classic film ... up there with the best, even though it was filmed in Spain with an Italian crew and a few American actors, and some bad dubbing.

9 April 2010,"A Good Movie, But Had Some Annoying Flaws","I just want to make a quick few comments here. I know this film is highly rated and people love it. And yeah, I found it enjoyable. I like a good shooter film with Clint Eastwood. But it seemed flawed and people are quick to forgive here where they don't elsewhere.

The historical accuracy of the film is the biggest problem, with guns that are incorrect for the period, and the really strange suggestion that the North fought the South in this region... which, really, just didn't happen. I liked the drunk military man, but it wasn't realistic.

The dubbing was annoying. Clint Eastwood speaks English and he speaks to a variety of characters who are speaking Italian. Okay, one or the other. Hire actors who speak English or get Italians and subtitle the film. It's awkward to have Eastwood talking to people who, on the set, who probably didn't understand.

Lastly, I need more Lee VanCleef. If he's ""the bad"", he should have a bigger role. Instead you have mostly Eastwood, who is ""the good"", being just as bad as the villain. I respect the idea that good and evil are not clear-cut, but why do I side with Eastwood if he's no more good than VanCleef? That being said, the film had a lot going for it. Very fun shooter, great bridge explosion scene (possibly better than ""River Kwai"") and the very memorable theme song. As far as Westerns go, I don't know that it was really much more advanced than ""Stagecoach"". Maybe more epic and longer, and Eastood can out-act John Wayne any day, but there wasn't much new here.

I recommend this and feel I need to see it again, but perhaps see ""For a Few Dollars More"" first... that will give you some VanCleef action and Klaus Kinski.",6
26 July 2010,One of the most overrated movies of all time,"I won't say this is the most overrated movie ever made. There are many movies which are considered among the best ever by the majority of people that are as overrated as this one is. However, that this is one of the most overrated of all time, no one can deny that.

I hate westerns. However, considering the fame of this one, the fact that it is in most lists of the all time's greatest movies, the fact of being a Spanish-Italian production and the value that most people give it (including this guy who is a friend of mine, who owns the movie and loaned it to me), I decided to give it a look, even though its long runtime could easily scare me off.

I know that its Italian title is 'Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo', but I don't know if it was filmed in English language and later dubbed in Italian or the contrary, although I believe it was filmed in English.

This spaghetti western was directed by Sergio Leone and stars Clint Eastwood as Blondie (""The Good""), Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes (""The Bad"") and Eli Wallach as Tuco (""The Ugly"").

To be frank, the character Tuco annoyed me very much, not to mention that he was worst than snakes. Angel Eyes was nowhere near as annoying, being a more likable character in comparison. Blondie is a more complicated character. He's supposed to be the good guy yet he teams with Tuco during most of the movie and actually saves him twice from his execution rope (including in the end, when he was supposed to kill him). He kills Angel Eyes, yet he doesn't kill Tuco - and after everything that Tuco did to him. He is not that good after all...

There's some good in this movie but I saw far more of bad and ugly in it. There is brutal violence in this. Plus, the movie is way too long. And it doesn't really offer much during its runtime of nearly 3 hours.

Certain sequences were filmed in a way that strongly resembles me '2001: A Space Odyssey'. The first 9-10 minutes are a good example of this. The opening is long and has music, there is no dialog, the slow pace of the scenes gives us time to appreciate the scenario. Another good example of this is the Mexican standoff scene that lasts 5 minutes near the ending when the 3 main characters stare each other down in the graveyard's circular center, calculating alliances and dangers (and the amazing distance which the camera films it).

The famous film score by Ennio Morricone (who is a genius, like John Williams) is phenomenal, especially the spectacular and unforgettable main theme. But the music that plays when Tuco is running in the Sad Hill cemetery is equally memorable.

I didn't know that this movie was part of a trilogy, much less that it was the 3rd one. I also thought it was from the 50's, not the 60's. Anyway, none of that matters. This movie didn't do anything for me. Is this one of the all time's greatest movies? Absolutely not!",5
8 November 2008,God is not on our side because he hates idiots also.,"How many accolades could one add to previous reviews of the film. There is only one other western that comes close to this, Once Upon a Time in the West. This is the ultimate western, not made by John Ford, or starring John Wayne, by a great film by Sergio Leone, and starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and the great Eli Wallach.

You want shooting? There is so much you will get a headache from the sounds of guns and cannons.

You want laughter? The competition between Wallach and Eastwood was a constant stitch in my side.

Yes, it is probably the best western ever.

Felt not for a moment that it was a Western of 1966. There is no actress and the movie is longer than 2 hours, but never once I got bored. It is a masterpiece.

And the satisfaction is 100%

5 October 2003,Stylish and entertaining but drags badly too often,"Two men have a partnership  one (the good) pretends to capture the other (the ugly) claiming the reward before rescuing him from his sentence. When the two have a falling out they spare each other simply because they both know part of the location of hidden confederate gold. Meanwhile a corrupt soldier is also hunting for the location of the gold or anyone who may know where it is.

Routinely heralded as one of the greatest westerns ever made, I must admit to always feeling a little disappointed by this film whenever I watch it. However I always then assume that it is a classic and come back to watch it again! There is no denying that the film is very stylish and very memorable but it's main problem is in it's basic plot not being long enough to justify such a luxurious running time. This results in the film really dragging at several points  this is not a major problem but I did wonder why it could not have been edited to suit it's spaghetti style.

The music and action is much imitated and well known to even those who have not yet seen the film. The closing stand-off is fantastic and the music throughout can only be described as iconic. The film does manage to cover 180 minutes well but I just had an issue with it's very wandering nature and the fact that it does drag a bit.

The cast is all good. Some of the support is badly dubbed but I always found that to add to the character of the film rather than be an annoyance. Eastwood had a hard time on the set but still delivers a really good performance  the type which made his name in this type of film. Wallach has the biggest role as Ugly and is very good in an unsympathetic role. Van Cleef is a good Bad and is a cool foil for Eastwood.

Overall I always enjoy this film but would draw the line at putting it as high up the top 50 list as it usually appears to be. The film is iconic in so many ways but I just don't like the way that it seems to drag at several points  it could easily benefit from losing 20 minutes.",

19 February 2018,"It proves, once again, that Leone is the master of guns and gazes.","'The Good, The Bad And The Ugly (1966)' has a different feel to the others in the trilogy, actually coming across as closer to 'Once Upon A Time In The West (1968)' than 'For A Few Dollars More (1965)', almost to the point where it feels as though it occupies a different sub-genre, one with a much stronger focus on the civil war and the spectacle such a state provides. It's an epic, the wide frame capturing both the sweeping vistas of war-torn America and the weary lines snaking across the faces of its seedy inhabitants, and it's masterfully helmed throughout. Another big draw of the long-winded narrative - which loses all but a modicum of its steam when the feature takes an extended detour into an admittedly visually stunning yet narratively unnecessary large-scale battle just before the final confrontation - is the amorality of the three equally charismatic leads, the titular labelling of whom is thankfully rather arbitrary (given that Eastwood's nameless protagonist is awarded the 'good' moniker 28-minutes in after he's just left a man for dead in the middle of the desert), and their constant double-crosses and back-stabs makes for an interestingly unpredictable ride. The feature keeps you on the edge of your seat until it's blistering finale that proves, once again, Leone is the master of guns and gazes. 8/10",8
23 October 2012,pinnacle of Spaghetti Western,"Sergio Leone's third piece of the Dollars Trilogy, years ago I watched A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS (1964, 7/10), but FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE (1965) is still sitting laid-back in my waiting to see list. I wish my jumpy sequence might not hinder the logical understanding of the film, although it is never a major concern of Mr. Leone and his team.

I cannot claim myself an ardent Western genre follower, also without any trickle of fetish towards neither guns or other weaponry, nor killing for fun, plus being an out-and-out urbanite, my natural response over the usual tonal settings of Western films is quite nonchalant (also the bleak milieu is not my preference to admire), what I need to fathom is whether it will evince any on-screen dynamite to maintain a buoyant vibe through its storytelling and action. THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, without any doubt, has done a crack job here, the lengthy narrative never cease to fall into tepid, three leading characters are richly depicted with accumulated details and minor plots, Eli Wallach's the ugly, who receives the most amount of screen time and rendered as a complete hypocrisy and opportunist, is the arch-protagonist, Eastwood and Van Cleef's roles are less colorful but more pragmatic to be idolized in the hero and anti-hero cinema realm.

One cannot evade Morricone's masterly work (not only in Leone's filmography), but here, his knack of enhancing the whole film's temperament has been comprehensively facilitated, the hyena-mimicking theme tune for me is something worth persisting for my entire life. The very much discussed and highly appreciated Mexican standoff could be regarded as the pinnacle of the wholesome western films, Leone's obsession with relentless close-ups is another trademark of its own kind.

Leone's film career is an underachieved one, and most of his fame has been accruing after his untimely decease in 1989 at the age of 60, with only 7 feature films under his rein (another one I have watched is his swan song ONCE UPON A TIME IN America, 1984, 8/10), if only he could live a bit longer, his feat would easily stride outside his comfort zone and evolve himself and his work with the time, like what Martin Scorsese has attained.

What should I whine about the film? I really cannot say it explicitly, the only thing impedes me from rating it higher is the innate trait of the grumpy and grubby world, which seems to me like a pit on earth.",8
30 July 2011,"Authentic in its Ugliness, Intense in its Badness and Operatic in its Goodness ...","INTRODUCTION :

A nasty face full of scars and sunburns suddenly fills the screen, covering the extended vision of the Sierra landscape : a curious opening, creating two incongruous feelings of authentic yet comical ugliness. This sums up the very essence of the 'Western Spaghetti', a pivotal sub-genre that traced the singular evolution, hence the survival, of the Western genre in two polar opposite directions : the ""anticonformity"" and the ""overconformity"" or let's just simplify and say ""demystification"" and ""amplification"".

DEMYSTIFACTION:

Akira Kurosawa's innovative ""Yojinbo"" ended the classic 'good vs. bad' antagonism, which directly inspired Sergio Leone. Like ""A Fistful of Dollars"", the realism of ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" lies within the lack of morality of the three main characters, each of them has malicious motives. Leone's intuition over using Kurosawa's characterizations proved to be useful for the Western genre that was begging for a metamorphosis. John Ford's era was over, and with all due respect to John Wayne, everyone knew how the West was Won, and were tired of the pompous idealism displayed, despite the breath-taking imagery of Monument Valley. Even the mythic Civil War, the powerful symbol of the fraternal fight that ultimately consolidated the American spirit, is treated like a vulgar subplot, which somewhat betrays the foreign aspect of the film, and in the same way, sweeps off all the dust of semi-propaganda stuff disguised in entertainment. The myth was agonizing, and the 'Western Spaghetti' genre proceeded to a sort of creative destruction.

Take the three main characters, the irony in the title, is that all their 'nicknames' are interchangeable, there is something ugly in the bad, and vice versa, and the good isn't 'boy-scout' good. Listen to the opening credits, flute for Blondie, Clint Eastwood as the Good, ocarina for Sentenza, Lee Van Cleef as the Bad and human voices for Eli Wallach as Tuco, the Ugly. Different instruments were used for each but they all play the same iconic melody, inspired from the howling of a coyote. Symbolically, each character is different, but the deadly greed inhabiting their hearts is the same, it's ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" rather than ""The Good vs. the Bad vs. the Ugly"". Their relationships are all tactical, cynical and hypocritical, with friendships based on a mutual need to reach a hidden gold. The Good and the Bad need each other, because they know half the secret about the gold's location, and Sentenza, need them alive to find it. They're all tied to each other until the strongest and cleverest wins; this was the humanistic reality during the dark ages of the last century.

AMPLIFICATION:

I guess the fact that I watched it for the first time when I was 10, built my personal affection to the film, because at that age, my expectations were not tarnished by the cynicism of the classic know-it-all film buff. For me, the three characters were not similar; the Good was the hero, the Bad, the villain, and the Ugly, the comic relief. They happen to be the only recognizable actors' faces in the film, but it hardly matters because we don't need them overshadowed by other supporting performances. Eli Wallach, in a career-defining role, is the fastest talking and provides the best moments of the film as the indisputable scene stealer. His humor also relies on the exciting duo he formed with Blondie whose cool sense of humor, and cynical detachment proved at many occasions to be the yin to Tuco's yang. And Lee Van Cleef is the senseless, cold-blooded killer who makes the Ugly look Good. He represents the dark side of the film, a man who always finishes his job, and from the first scene involving him, I took him as the bad guy of the story. The characterization is why I loved the film both as a kid and as a movie buff.

The line between amplification and parody is very thin, but there's a difference. When parody takes all the conventions into derision, amplification insists on them, providing the typical Leonesque shots. Time is dilated, locations are magnified, like belonging to a unique dimension, and the whole film oscillates between extreme close-ups and extended shots from very far away. All the effects are amplified with cinematic hyperbolas exceeding the limit of believability. In his 'Great Movies' review, Ebert stated that Leone invented a rule which consisted on the characters' point of view limited by the screen. I never understood until I re-watched the film and got it, and I respect Leone even more for having pushed the limits of creativity to this point since most of the greatest effects from the film depend on that rule, and are transcended by the iconic score of the musical genius, Ennio Morricone. ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" has all the tragic, comic, epic and musical elements that makes it a kind of operatic masterpiece.

CONCLUSION :

Film-making is far from being an exact science, and you can make a masterpiece out of the least complex plot elements, the lowest budget, and the cleverest directorial tricks. Not to diminish the quality of Leone's ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" but the point is that the movie works as if it was self-aware of its own restrictions and transcended it with a magic that another director, wouldn't have judged necessary. Some apparent weaknesses are sometimes the necessary drivers to push the creation to the limit of genius while confidence can work as a tricky obstacle, maybe that explains why ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is the highest ranked Western on IMDb Top 250 and undoubtedly the most iconic.

So, to conclude, I would simply say that there's two kinds of people in this world, those who love the film, and those who don't get it ...",10

27 December 2010,when the western was born again in Europe,"Seeing again the last film in the 'spaghetti westerns' trilogy was a true revelation. It already happened to me to see classical movies, live again the feelings I had at the previews viewing and discover new perspectives brought up by the years. With 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' something different seems to have happened. It's my third viewing if I remember well. I scarcely remember the first one, I was a teenage and I must have seen the movie at the same time I was seeing other classic westerns like these starring John Wayne. Then I saw it again in the 90s and what struck me was the fabulous acting especially Eli Wallach's. This latest experience is different as I dare now discharge all the labels and enjoy what is best in this film - the camera art, the dynamic of the characters, the superb acting of the three lead actors, Ennio Morricone's music which entered the best soundtracks gallery, the color and diversity of the extras and the fresh perspective brought to a moment of history often present in the American film.

By the mid 60s when Sergio Lepne had the chutzpah of undertaking the trilogy project western was a genre in stagnation. The period of the big films of John Ford was passed over, actors like John Wayne or Richard Widmark were beyond their pick, and westerns were not considered a source of blockbusters by the big studios.It was kind of natural to expect renewal to come from out of America, as in Europe the Far West space was keeping its fascination and the potential of staging eternally human dramas.

After the success of the first two films in the trilogy Leone wanted the third one to be a quality upgrade, more ambitious and more stylish. Although he could not hire the actors he wished, he was lucky to receive as replacement Eli Wallach who gives here one of the best performances of his career, a combination wicked shrewdness and surviving skills, a dangerous creep with a sense of humor.

The viewing is a fest from start to end. That was the period of Technicolor and big screens, and Leone masters the technology and the format, which fit the endless desert where most of the action happens. While filmed in Spain, one can say that never had Andalucia looked so Texan. The local extras faces carved by wind and sun fit perfectly the cinematographic landscape. Morricone's music fills in the vision in a synthesis that was played and quoted in endless movies that followed (to mention 'Kill Bill''s theme as the last I remember).

Especially visible and special is the reconstruction of the Civil War background. From 'Gone with the Wind' to 'Cold Mountain' this is one of the most filmed episodes of American history, allowing for numerous mass and battle scenes. Amazingly the vision of the Italian Leone fits perfectly in the gallery. Moreover the juxtaposition of the situations of fortune seekers and of the soldiers caught in the absurd of the was allows for a comparison with anti-militaristic nuances. Soldiers and adventurers play death games with little chances of survival. And yet, for at least one moment the the game of the fortune seekers seems more rational and even more human than the organized game of destruction called war.

The actor that dominates the film is without any doubt Clint Eastwood. Closing up the trilogy that launched his career, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' brings the last touches to the portrait of the Man with No Name from the previous movies, the soldier of fortune and killer who never draws first his gone and never kills without a reason. The script places him here in different situations than in the previous movies, but the scene of the duel in three close to the final brings him back the poncho as the sign that the cycle draws to its end. In the permanent game of trickery and death Blondie is the only of the three characters that allows to himself manifestations of humanity and acts of compassion that endanger him. Howevwe he knows and we know that he aims and shoots faster and better and he will eventually prevail. The final scene with Eastwood's character melting in the infinite desert landscape closes up in the best possible way Leone's trilogy.",9
24 April 2020,Now that's what I call real men's cinema.. Machoism Unlimited !,"Finally The Good The Bad And The Ugly (1966) Now that's what i call Real Men's Cinema. No love story, no melodrama, no emotions just the bullets and machoism till the last stage. A real man would love this film more than any other love triangle story with women and Romance involved in it or a happy go lucky film because this is stuff made only and only for Men. I doubt any such particular film was ever made for Women or will ever be made. We Men are lucky, aren't we? Possibly, it is the Spaghetti western which was better than many big budget films in the genre. I can sense so many nuances in the screenplay where the hero proves that this is how a real man should be. The other 2 guys doesn't care much about anything but money. Clint Eastwood as The Good proves what the real Good means even in bad encounter. Lee Van Cleef as the Bad brings the cruelty into the character whereas Eli Wallach as Tuco AKA the Ugly did exceptionally well. If i have to mention some iconic scenes then i would go with the introduction scene of all 3 guys in the film. One can do anything if he is paid, other one is lusty for money and the 3rd guy is one hell of a good fella, doesn't matter what the situation is. Other than that, there are multiple situations which i can say are influential and iconic and have inspired so many action films over the years. The Background score which is still giving me chills. The Good The Bad and The Ugly is well known as Sergio Leone most hard-hitting work and totally different vision to look at a western film. The distinctive use of violence, cold blooded encounters, stylistic bullets fires and machoism of the lead hero all these things surely makes The Good The Bad and The Ugly a Classic Western Action film. And like i said, if you're bored of typical romance, unnecessary melodrama and mainstream dramas then this film is the most different experience for you just like it was for entire generation of 60s Cinema Lovers. Rating- 8/10*",8
19 June 2020,The best western movies I have ever seen,"The three-hour plot is not procrastinating. All the characters are full-bodied and have distinct characters. Definitely the best work in Westerns. Incorporating the elements of the Civil War enhances the film's conception, increases the depth of thinking, and at the same time it is properly filled with a relaxed and humorous atmosphere.

2 August 2019,"The good, the better and the best","Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

17 April 2007,Great!,"Basically, if you have to see one western, watch this one. From the opening credits, you can tell its going to be a stylish, bloody ride.

What I admire most about this film is the attention to detail. Leone doesn't rush scenes; sometimes we have shots up to five minutes without dialogue.

Tension chews nearly every scene as we observe the eyes and hands of the characters. It's as much a film of greed and civil war, as it is about deception.

The acting is perfect all round. Clint, Wallach and Cleef are all amazing in their roles. They manage to live up to their roles of good, bad and ugly well, but it's not as clear cut as that. The characters in this film are all morally ambiguous and so they should be. At a time like the civil war, even the ""good"" can be ""ugly"".

Great direction, superb acting and amazing style. The film is very efficient at telling its story - and the ending is amazing.

Definitely watch this.",10

2 November 2020,Required viewing,"I was late to the table as far as Spaghetti Westerns are concerned. I'm a big fan of westerns but the Spaghettis used to leave me a little flat. A few years ago it all clicked. I became a big fan of Spaghetti Westerns and the genius of Sergio Leone. Leone was a true master. ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is great epic filmmaking. There are tons of classic moments in this movie. If this movie has a flaw, it's the running time. ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is a long movie that feels long at times. It's never boring but the pacing is off at times. That said, this movie is required viewing for any serious fan of westerns or film in general.

30 March 2023,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly","Set during the American civil war, 3 characters - 2 conmen played by Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach and killer for hire Lee Van Cleef discover that a soldier called Bill Carson has buried $200,000 of gold in a cemetery somewhere. With each trying to get the treasure for themselves, they still keep crossing each other's paths, usually resulting in plenty of violence towards each other

Glorious and classic Leone western featuring 3 wonderful characters giving us great fun as they run into and try to outwit each other. Truth be told whilst each character is critical to the plot, this is Wallach's film. His fabulous 'bad guy' with a glint in his eye turn as Tuco gets the most screen time and is a particular pleasure to watch. There are though many great scenes in the film particularly the blowing up of the bridge and the cemetery which are pure cinema gold helped immeasurably by Morricone's legendary score and the horror of the war runs throughout adding a saddening seam to the story. A masterpiece.

10 August 2020,Great Western,"I don't usually watch Westerns but this one is famous and epic with a sweeping scope. The star is Clint Eastwood who convincingly plays a gruff antihero. It is mostly quite slow paced to show off the landscape but it can get quite intense at times.

18 February 2022,A phenomenal masterpiece,"Yes, it takes its time setting things up, and the main ""plot"" starts about 70 minutes in, but when it kicks off in the second half, it builds from one iconic scene to the next, each one better than the last, and becomes not only the best western of all time, but one of the best films of all time.

And I still really like all the setup. Still plenty of iconic scenes there, and I think the last 20-30 minutes wouldn't be nearly as impactful if that first hour or so had been edited right down.

Speaking of the final 20-30 minutes, everything that happens from the bridge scene onwards is just some of the best stuff I've ever seen in a movie. My heart was racing even though this was probably about the fourth time I've watched this movie. Everything in the cemetery is like 12/10 good; I can't even put it into words. The music is godlike, with Ecstasy of Gold and the track that plays during the three-way duel among Morricone's best (and let's not ignore the fact that the rest of the soundtrack is incredible).

It's arguably Clint's best role, too, and even then, he's often foreshadowed by an even better Eli Wallach, who dominates the screen in creating one of the best characters of all time, Tuco. While Lee Van Cleef isn't given as much to do, he's also fantastic, especially in his first couple of scenes, which establish how cruel and calculating Angel Eyes is.

The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is just about perfect. If you're not feeling so keen on the deliberately-paced first hour, stick with it, and your patience will definitely be rewarded. Sergio Leone was one of the best filmmakers of all time, and this film's one of his best.",10

1 March 2012,Early Eastwood,"At three hours in length, the word epic can be applied to Sergio Leone's western. Clint Eastwood is Blondie, or the good, Lee Van Cleef is Angel Eyes, or the bad, and Eli Wallach is Tuco, or the ugly. He does a fine job portraying a Mexican bandit, who begins the story in a shoot out with bounty hunters. He kills two of them, and wounds the third during an escape.

Blondie is a lone gunman who captures Tuco and collects $2,000 for turning him into the law. At the hanging, he shoots the rope, allowing Tuco to run away. They later meet up and divide the money. They repeat the scam several times, but Tuco complains constantly, and so Blondie leaves him in the desert and takes all the cash.

Tuco later tracks down Blondie with three guys who shoot at him, but they are killed in the battle. Tuco manages to hold Blondie at gunpoint, and as he tries to hang him, a cannonball hits and Blondie escapes. The reunite and find another guy for the hanging con, but the rope isn't shot and he dies. Tuco then marches Blondie into desert again with to die. Blondie asks for water for giving Tuco information about the name on a gravestone where Confederate gold is buried.

Further adventures take place until the apparent final resting place of the gold is reached and there is a Mexican standoff. Eastwood and Wallach are standouts as the pair of gunslingers, and Leone just lets them rip. Patience is required for this western, but it is worth the journey.",9

15 July 2010,How good can a film be? This good!,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is rightly called a classic. Regardless of where you place it in your own list of the greatest films ever made, it will most likely be near the top. And that is what makes this such a classic – it is more than just a damn good Western. It is a damn good film.

Plot – simple. There is some buried gold. Three lawless gunslingers are after it. They continue to run into each other and this gives the film momentum during the first two hours.

So much has already been written about this film that it is impossible to sum up all of its influences and innovations. The haunting whistles of the first moments of the title sequence are instantly recognisable even to those who have never seen a Western. Clint Eastwood is instantly recognisable in a career-making role. No matter your verdict, this is an immensely important film.

Director Sergio Leone has a sense for painful irony. 'The Good', Eastwood's character, begins the film by double crossing his partner (Eli Wallach's conflicted Tuco, 'The Ugly') and leaving him in the desert. This irony goes to the level of sight and sound. As 'The Bad' (Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes) tortures his victims at a Civil War P.O.W. camp, he orders the other prisoners to play their instruments to drown out the screams. The expressions on the faces of the musicians speaks volumes, and is more affecting to a modern audience than the scenes of torture themselves, gorged as we are on Saw and Hostel. It is this attention to storytelling detail in every frame of the film that makes it so rich and deep. How film-making has changed.

While the film is long and slow, it has to be. The tension built up in the early parts of the film is punctuated by brief flashes of action, but it is the waiting before the action sequences that grabs you by the insides and slowly squeezes. There are ideas and emotions being played with in this film that cannot be quickly explained or unravelled, and these need the full three hours of the film to come to their conclusion. With the luxury of time, Leone is able to make a shared meal as tense and troubling as the moment, hands on guns, before a shootout.

Even if you think the middle sections of the film dragged somewhat (philistine!) the finale is something special. In so many ways, it is the perfect climax to a film filled with moments of brilliance. There are too many parts to the film, too many special moments, to comment on any more, so I will simply say that this is a film I should have seen long before I did finally watch it. It is a film that, if you haven't seen, you should as soon as possible. And if you have seen it, a second, third or fifty-seventh viewing is in order. This film has quality that we are not given the privilege to see very often.",10
20 June 2011,"Sunshine, Gunsmoke and Attitude","The high point of the Spaghetti Western sub-genre, Sergio Leone's dubiously-titled masterpiece is a living, breathing encapsulation of everything that made its peers so notorious. Whether you're after atmosphere as thick as smoke, tight-lipped anti-heroes, charmingly bad audio dubs or a cast of thousands, this grand adventure delivers in excess. With a run time of just under three hours, it should go without saying that the narrative sprawls at times, yet expert cinematography, intriguingly era-authentic landscapes, a variety of fresh, varied locations and rich characterization keep the picture from stagnating even when it's been ten minutes since the last line of dialog. Naturally, Leone regulars Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef bring the goods as remotely feuding foils with a penchant for sharp, icy glares; though I preferred their dynamic in the preceding For a Few Dollars More, the two make for a stunning combination whenever they share the screen and it's a shame this marks the end of that brief partnership. It's a terrific picture if you've got the time to really pore over it, but works equally as well as simple background noise.",8
14 November 2011,"Good, better, best!","The legendary ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" It was a long time coming - ""A Fistful of Dollars"" (1964) was good, ""For a Few Dollars More"" (1965) was better but the best of Sergio Leone's ""spaghetti western"" ""Dollars trilogy"" was/is ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" released in 1967. The last film in Leone's ""Dollars"" trilogy is best remembered for two things: for truly being the best film Leone was capable of directing at that time, and for making star Clint Eastwood a household name (he'd been rising overseas due to his starring roles in the two previous ""Dollars"" films). (Eastwood, of course, wouldn't become a big-league Hollywood star until ""Dirty Harry"" in 1971.) The legendary ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is set during the Civil War, and concerns three men's quest for a fortune in Confederate gold buried somewhere in a cemetery. The three men are: The Man With No Name/Blondie/""The Good"" (Eastwood), Angel Eyes/""The Bad"" (Lee Van Cleef), and Tuco/""The Ugly"" (Eli Wallach). All three have itchy trigger fingers but therein lies the problem: they all know the secret to the location of the buried Confederate gold (one knows the cemetery, but not the grave; another knows the name of the grave but not the cemetery). This film, in its full-length unedited 179-minute running time, may very well be the first epic (spaghetti) western, or at least, the first epic western that I've seen. It's one of the most thoroughly engaging, action-packed, and provocative films I've ever had the pleasure of watching. At center stage is star Clint Eastwood, playing the ""Man With No Name"" for the third and probably last time, and he's at the top of his game here as a truly bad-a** anti-hero. Sure, he speaks softly, but he carries a big six-shooter and he knows how to use it! But don't overlook the contributions of co-stars Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach. It's been a while since I've been so thoroughly captivated by someone as truly evil and sadistic as Van Cleef's steely-eyed killer Angel Eyes; there is also something to be said about Eli Wallach's portrayal of the unkempt, desperate con man Tuco, who also serves as this film's comic relief. Leone was at the peak of his skill in ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" clearly the best film of his ""Dollars trilogy."" His love of wide-angle shots to capture the oppressive desert landscape, and intense close-ups of the actor's faces were unmatched here. It's also the best film of his to make truly excellent use of the extensive talents of the brilliant Italian composer Ennio Morricone (I'm listening to his score for this film right now as I type this up).

It only seems fitting that as the western film genre's most iconic star, Clint Eastwood would go on to make his dark, violent anti-western ""Unforgiven"" in 25 years later in 1992.

28 July 2015,Overly-long western with iconic scenes and sadistic scenes,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

23 November 2010,the yardstick used for measuring Spaghetti Westerns,"The quintessential Spaghetti Western put some teeth back into a dying genre, recognizing the American Frontier for what it really was: a patchwork of legends and lies best recreated through broad exaggeration. The result here is a ruthless, violent, oddly skewed facsimile, spread out across a Techniscope landscape with enough dramatic flourishes to suggest a larger-than-life parody. The title roles are played, respectively, by Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach, who steals the film with his brash comic performance, but the real star to emerge from the film was director Sergio Leone himself. All of his now familiar stylistic tics are on display: the portentous wide-angle compositions; the sweaty close-ups; and the director's trademark, patented gun duels, featuring ten minutes of relentless crosscutting between beady eyes and itchy trigger fingers, while Ennio Morricone's classic music score builds to a typically overwrought frenzy on the soundtrack. The body count is surprisingly low (not including the soldiers killed during the geographically imprecise Civil War battle scene), and Leone was already learning the power of myth, testing the waters for his next and last great Western epic: 'Once Upon A Time in the West'.",9

21 January 2023,"A really good movie, not bad or ugly at all","There are a lot of good things about The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, and not much that is bad or ugly. This is one of the all time great Western movies. Clint Eastwood stars in his iconic ""Man With No Name"" role, this time around listed as ""Blondie"" in the credits. This is the great director Sergio Leone at the top of his game. And it has the all time greatest film score by Ennio Morricone.

This movie is a grand, epic masterpiece. There is a reason it's one of the top rated movies in IMDb. It must be the larger than life characters. Or the beautiful cinematography in vast Western settings. Or the aforementioned greatest film score ever. Or that distinct style of Sergio Leone film making - where everyone has an interesting face even if not conventionally beautiful - where it's almost like some kind of Italian opera. If you have any kind of interest in classic movies, you need to see this one.

7 July 2006,"""If you're gonna shoot, shoot; don't talk.""","I'm going to start this review by saying this: there is not western that can compare to this, hell, there may not even be any movie that can compare to this. Only a handful come to my mind, and it's a very small handful at that.

Sergio Leone's classic western provides the perfect ensemble of cinematography, direction, acting, story, and last, but not least, music. Leone's film about three greedy men in the search for 500,000 in gold exemplifies the dirty west. This is not your typical American western, where the sun-drenched west is romanticized. No, it's dirty and rough, just like the west was. If anyone wanted to watch the film that is the antithesis the ""chick-flick,"" I would recommend The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.

Clint Eastwood reprises his iconic Man With No Name in this final film in the Dollars Trilogy. Lee Van Cleef returns from A Few Dollars More; however, he plays a different (much different) character. The actor who steals the show has to be Eli Wallach. Wallach, a western veteran, plays Tuco with great viciousness and humor, making him likable and unlikeable at the same time; he truly is ""ugly."" Leone and his cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli pack the film with great shots of the west, from the tired sands of the desert, to the endless graves of a cemetery (which was actually located in Spain). Ennio Morricone combines Colli's lush cinematography with the greatest score ever put onto film. From the easily recognizable theme, to the sad Story of a Soldier, to the excitement of Ecstacy of Gold, this soundtrack has it all.

What more can I say? If you haven't seen The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, see it now! I can not press you more. This is one of those films that could be considered perfect, or the closest to perfection. A classic that shall never be forgotten; a classic that shall always be admired.",10
3 July 2008,Classic Western,"If this isn't the Greatest WEstern movie of all time,, someone please tell me what is.. yeah there's a few that come close,, like High Plains Drifter,, and such,, but this film is timeless, i could never grown old watching this one,, and if there ever is a remake,, you better you're Fistful of Dollars,, i'll never watch it.. it would be a travesty to the genre. Sergeo Leone did a wonderful job on this film,, the music done by Ennino Marconi,, is timeless also... Lee Van Cleef is excellent as ""Angel Eyes"",, Tuco,, played by Eli Wallach is very funny and wonderful to watch,, Clint, well he's just Clint playing it up as ""the man with no name"",, you gotta love it,, the story is about 3 guys who try to get to a box full of money,, in a cemetery and all they have to go through to get it.. Clint saves ""Tuco numerous times throughout the movie,, and Tuco,, never fully appreciates it,, as he almost kills of Clint,, but no fear that don't happen cause then there wouldn't be a movie right,,, This movie is so great, the length is long though,, but the ending is well worth it,, and i think that's what makes the movie a perfect 10 for me.

13 July 2005,Best Clint Eastwood Western ever,"There are a lot of westerns made but this one takes the cake. I loved tombstone but this movie had it all. You really don't appreciate this type of film or Clint Eastwood until you watch a really crap ass film like ""Hang Em High"". Before anyone watches any of clint's films you have to watch a fistful of dollars, for a few dollars more and then The good the bad the ugly. This story is just awesome on so many levels, it keeps you watching every minute (even though it's a 2 hour and 40 minute film). The best part is no part really drags, its all toward the main purpose of the story. Watch Hang em high and you'll see a traditional American western get dragged out (i can't stand that flick.) Anyways if you want to watch the film that made westerns popular as well as western games (Red Dead Revolver) watch this film! By the way, the draw at the end is the probably one of the best and creative draws i have ever seen in any western

3 February 1999,"The best of Eastwood's ""spaghetti westerns""","The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is the most ambitious of all the ""Dollar"" films. The backdrop of the Civil War aids in this epic that involves three characters, all out to find a stash of Confederate gold. Leone piles up the images, outdoing himself each time. Morricone's score is one of the most memorable scores ever written. The final shootout in the dry lake bed is filled with tension that is so thick you nearly fall off of your seat anticipating the outcome. A great film, that will only get better with age.

17 October 2005,The Best Of The Best!,"Sergio Leone's ""Il Buono, Il Brutto Il Cattivo"" aka. ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" of 1966 is, beyond doubt, one of the greatest movies ever brought to screen. Period. I lack the words to express my admiration for this film adequately, but i'll try to indicate how brilliant this film is. This film is pure cinematic perfection. The story, the brilliant directing, the impressive cinematography, the unique atmosphere, the ingenious score, the great characters, the unforgettable performances, the dialogue, the wit, the violence,... everything in this film is pure perfection! This is one of the few movies that actually deserve their high ranking in IMDb's Top 250 list, and if I was to make such a list, ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" would rank even higher. Leone's brilliant directing and a superb cinematography come along with what is maybe the greatest of Ennio Morricone's unique soundtracks. Each one of the three leading actors fits perfectly in his role.

As in the movie's two predecessors, ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" (1964) and ""For A Few Dollars More"" (1965), Clint Eastwood ('The Good')is the epitome of coolness in his role of the Man with No Name (who actually always has a name - He is credited as 'Joe' in ""Fistful Of Dollars"", his character is called 'Monco' in ""For A Few Dollars More"", and he is referred to as ""Blondie"" in ""The Good The Bad And The Ugly""). Together with irascible MexicanTuco ('The Ugly' brilliantly played by Eli Wallach), he rips authorities off by collecting the reward, that is set on Tuco's head and then saving him a very second before his execution.Since I first saw this Dollar Trilogy as a kid, the word 'coolness' is linked with this character played by Clint Eastwood. No other character in any other film is embodies coolness the way The Man With No Name does in the Dollar trilogy, and no other ever will.

Lee Van Cleef ('The Bad'), one of my personal favorite actors of all-time, and one of the true icons of the Italian Western, is brilliant in the role of Sentenza aka. Angel Eyes, a ruthless assassin who knows no mercy or scruples to achieve his goals. While all of the three men are selfish crooks, and all of them selfish and violent in getting what they want, Sentenza is truly evil, and Lee Van Cleef plays this role with absolute brilliance.

The arguably greatest performance, however is delivered by Eli Wallach as 'The Ugly' Mexican bandit Tuco. Hot-tempered, irascible, savage and yet crafty, and sometimes sadistically vengeful, Tuco is a criminal with an immense crime record and an immense talent to survive hangings (with the help of 'The Good'). Eli Wallach's performance as Tuco is ingenious beyond comparison. Wallach plays 'The Ugly', his anger and rage, his quick, violent temper and brutality, his savagery but also his craftiness with a unique brilliance. Wallach's performance is not only THE single greatest performance ever in a Western, but, as far as I am considered, also one of the greatest performances ever in a movie.

Set in one of the final years of the American Civil War, somewhere in the southwest of the US, ""The Good, the Bad And the Ugly"" tells the story of these three men, who are on the hunt for a case carrying 200,000 dollars in gold, buried somewhere in a graveyard.Each of the three men wants the gold for himself, of course, but since none of them has all the information they need, they have to work together in order to get it. Although all three of them are reckless and sneaky, Clint Eastwood (despite to being an antihero and crook that shoots a lot of people, the Man With No Name shows some mercy and charity in comparison to the foregoing movies ""For a Fistful of Dollars"" and ""For a Few Dollars More"") is rightly referred to as the Good, Eli Wallach, playing the angry thug Tuco, is the epitome of (the) Ugly, and Lee Van Cleef is wonderfully evil and ruthless as The Bad.

""The Good, the Bad And the Ugly"", a Spaghetti Western at the genre's best, is a brilliant movie full of violence and dark humor, a film full of wit and pictures that will make a great visual impact on everybody with taste, a masterpiece going along with one of the most brilliant scores of all time. This is not only a film that every cineaste should see this is a film that EVERYBODY MUST SEE! If I was to name my favorite movies of all-time, ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" would be one of the strongest contenders for Numero Uno! In one sentence: ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" is one of the greatest films ever made! Absolutely essential and brilliant beyond comparison! 10/10",10

14 January 2020,Another drop dead classic by Leone.,"I rated the first two episodes of the 'Dollars' trilogy 10 out of 10! The third for me was just a shade under, due to a larger epic feel and the fact that apart from the most memorable title track, the musical score was not consistently as great. When i say great, I mean to the genius level of the former 'Dollar' Westerns. Still there are heaps to love about this and the uncut version (only recently available in the U.K) really makes it less of a comedy and gives it more of a darker, cutting edge. Brutal in parts, it's another masterpiece by Sergio.L.

13 April 2009,Arguably the best spaghetti western of all time,"Sergio Leone's ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is perhaps the finest 'spaghetti western' ever committed to film. It was the final entry in Leone's 'Dollars' trilogy, which made a star out of Clint Eastwood. Here, Eastwood ('the Good') and his partner in crime, Eli Wallach ('the Ugly'), have to work together in order to locate a fortune in buried gold while Lee Van Cleef ('the Bad') hopes to get in on the action too.

This trio of American actors leads the pack on the acting front, though it is perhaps unfair to compare them to the Italian actors whose lines were dubbed. To me, the dubbing (while it is typically pretty good) is the film's biggest flaw.

Leone's direction, on the other hand, is top-notch from beginning to end. His signature style, mixing extreme close-ups and wide shots, is in evidence throughout. Also worthy of note is the iconic score by Ennio Morricone.

The story itself is an entertaining one. Even though the film clocks in at nearly three hours and Leone really takes his time with some scenes the film doesn't drag at all. The plot does venture into seriousness occasionally but mostly it's just an engaging yarn about three rogues pursuing a fortune in gold.

The film is currently ranked at #4 in IMDb's list of the top 250 films of all time. While I wouldn't rank it that high I do think that it deserves a spot somewhere in the list. It is undoubtedly a must-see film, especially for guys.",8
25 January 2020,A Fantastic breaking rules movie that defined the genre and Cinema on the way.,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Where to begin reviewing this movie?. This is one of those movies that you can speak for days and not be over with all the many good things it did, is almost crazy to belive that this movie was panned by critics at the time, probably a response to a product of it´s time but from another country, we should agree. However critics where proved wrong with this movie and had to appreciate a Western that in many ways was more revolutionary and arguably better than anything produced in Hollywood.

Sergio Leone Direction for this movie is iconic and now one of the things that distinguish this type of movies, with beautiful and slow cinematographic long shots, extreme close ups, the storytelling he used and how graphich it was visually (At the time), but most iportant the build of tention he did in so many scenes, when you know something gonna happen but you have no idea when would happen, but when does happen it marks the movie and your life.

The acting in this movie is very underaprecciated in general, the main Trio has so much presence by them selves that they stole every inch of screen they are in, Ellie Wallach as Tuco is funny yet ragging, charismatic and just enbodies ""The Ugly"" as a word better than anyone has done; Lee Van Cleef as Sentenza ""Angel Eyes"" is so menacing, there´s no scene including him that make you think contrary, his incarnation of ""the Bad"" is just that, someone that appears to have no soul and would kill twisting his own rules at bennefit; and finally Clint Eastwood as Blondie, ""the Good"" that isn´t exactly good, a bounty hunter that has dubious moral codes, he is so unpredictable in what he is gonna do and how he is gonna do it, yet has some good in him and is the smartest of the trio, not to say the better gunslinger (in all movies arguably). The rest of the supporting cast does a good job at it, never outmatching the main charachters but doing really good carachterization and making the film have more weight, the shop owner, the soldiers, the Generals, the killers, all of them have a poruse on the film and add something special to the film.

The Score is another big one of this film, Ennio Morricone is a genius mind and there´s no better man to writte music for this genre of film than him, he easly outmatches most composers of Western movies and composers in movies in general. His score really put you in the mood of the scene, in how you are supossed to feel the film, in how raw the life was back then, the Main theme, Eacstsy of Gold, The Trio, the Sundown are great pieces of music, that´s how movie themes should work and how they have to make you feel.

This movie really broke the rules of typical film making as well, is one of those movies that don´t really care that much about the plot, wich in any other movie would feel wrong, but this one makes their scenes so heavy and so much happens on screen at the same moment that the plot becomes almost a non factor for the film, is a movie about circumstances that happen to their carachters and how they deal with them in that exact moments not really caring when it would get to the end of the plot, is much more about their stories and what they leave behind, however there is a plot but the film don´t rushes into it, it takes it´s time to get there and is so satisfying.

We already talked about the acting, but it´s worth talking about how this movie was one that popularized double sided charachters, specailly with Tuco and Blondie, it really don´t let you make up your mind about what you feel about them, the only thing you know is that they might be bad or good any moments, specailly that of the Man with no name, altough Wallach´s acting stole the show, Eastwood is one fo those presence actors that just need to put a cigar in his mouth and he will change movies forever and his charachter in this movie, cold, smart, few words spoken, and overall bad ass really changued movies to this very day, there´s so many movies that stole that concept and implemented into their own, not only in westerns but in action movies and Sci-Fi, there would not be Han Solos, Snake Pilskims or even Indiana Jones withouth the grandad of dirty players wich was Blondie.

There´s too much to talk about this movie again and most of all is positive to excelent, so whenever you have the chance go and Watch it, is the final instalment of the Dollars Trio or the Man with no name trilogy, yo surely won´t be dissapointed.",10
25 June 2006,"Ted Turner's favorite film, and mine (and a whole lotta others').","(NOTE added, April '07: Since writing a review on this film, I've been paying close attention to references and allusions to it in other films; I will now make a tentative assertion: this film is the single most influential commercial film in cinema history. Literally hundreds of films make allusion to it or attempt to imitate it - films made in Hollywood, Japan, China, the Phillipines, India, Mexico, Argentina, Germany, France; both commercial films and offbeat independents; comedies, ""B"" sci-fi movies, and ""A"" suspense dramas; films by hacks and films by recognized masters. On top of that, the film really redefined how actors are photographed, how dialog is written, how scenes are shot and edited, the whole narrative structuring of a motion picture, and the composition of soundtracks. Not bad for a ""spaghetti western"", huh?)

(First review, June '06:) Some readers may remember that, in the year before he at last surrendered control of the Turner Broadcasting Network, Turner had this film played once a week, with hardly any commercial breaks. Now that's love for you.

This is definitely a ""guy"" film, which means that it doesn't do justice to 51% of its potential audience. However, it is as close to perfection as any guy film could possibly get.

I would add most of the original Italian release additional footage available on the DVD. But this is one of the films not a frame of which can be cut without serious damage.

How did Leone accomplish this? It is largely due to his close cooperation with Ennio Morricone, the finest Western composer after WWII. Although they were not to perfect their working relationship until Once Upon a Time in the West, the opening sequence of this film - where the yelp of a coyote is heard in the same tones as the whistle of the title music - announces that we are here to enjoy as many of our senses as film can reach, and in a manner just coordinated enough that we can allow ourselves to be swept along without concern for time.

I will also say this: Until recently (for reasons I shan't get into), I have been a pacifist most of my life. It happens to have been this film that convinced me that war is a ""waste of good men"", as Eastwood's character remarks.

Which reminds me to remind my reader - this is not a Western - it's a war movie; an anti-war movie. And far more powerful, as such, than all the crappy ""anti-war"" movies Hollywood churned out to please the hippies in the '60s.

The ""hippies"" ended up voting for Bush's fiasco in Iraq. Clint Eastwood, despite his conservative politics, has (as a filmmaker) become obsessed with the horror of violence, and the hope that somehow we can rise above it. Me too.",10
27 January 2012,"'Spaghetti' Western is a misleading term, this is some fine Italo-American cuisine.","First up for a spaghetti Western this doesn't appear anywhere near as hackneyed and half-arsed as the label might lead you to believe. In fact the blu-ray I rented looked pretty awesome.

The tale of the three titular desperados is long and elaborate. How long? How about 3 hours long. Long enough to have two on screen deaths and a full meal eaten before a line of dialogue is uttered.

The Good is Clint Eastwood, a rough n tough cowboy who plays as fair as you play him. He sports a perpetual three day growth and an equally permanent short cigar propped out of the corner of his thin lips.

The Bad is Lee Van Cleef, a dodgy soldier on the lookout for a man with one eye, for reasons that I will explain later.

The Ugly is the only guy with a name used regularly, Tuco (Eli Wallach). In fact Tuco is pretty much the star of the show, though Good n Bad get their moments.

Good, Bad and Ugly are eventually all in pursuit of the same target, stolen gold coins, the whereabouts of which are only known to a one eyed soldier who sports a patch.

The greater part of the film plays like those riddles where the farmer must get the chook, the fox and the wheat from one shore to the other without something eating something else, only he can only fit one thing in his boat at a time. The Bad knows the location of the gold, the Good knows not the location but specifics once you get there, and the Ugly is the key to bringing all loose ends together.

Each of the grimy trio spend ample time getting to know – and beat the shtuffing out of – each other. They take turns leaving each other for dead and at various times all seem to hold the upper hand, only to have it taken from them.

There are loads of close ups highlighting shifty eyes, many slow drawn out scenes including what must be the longest Mexican stand off on history, and I must say the makeup jobs were quite well done. As the film is set in the US civil war era some of the settings are surprisingly intricate and feature a cast of thousands of well costumed extra, further dispelling any notion that I had of a 'spaghetti Western' being a cheap knock-off, and though the length and long periods of inactivity were a little different to my modern day ADD sensibilities I was rarely bored, which in a three hour 45 year old film might be the strongest recommendation I can give.

Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. I wish I could explain it better but the circular sounding whistle that forebodes every gun fight (and parody) know to film originated in this film. If you only watch once Western this year – or this decade – you could do a lot worse than this.",7

7 October 2015,So who's who?,"Bearing in mind that I think westerns are an American art form and I have an aversion to the European made ones, Sergio Leone's The Good The Bad And The Ugly has a lot to recommend it. Not the least of which the impact it had on Clint Eastwood's career making him an American icon.

The Good The Bad And The Ugly follows an odyssey of three men, two of them a pair of lowlifes and the third no better than he ought to be in a search for buried gold.

It's quite the odyssey that Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef in those title roles have in search of the loot. A minor theater of the Civil War is operating in the west and all of them get caught up in it as well.

Clint Eastwood developed and honed his laconic and cynical character who was in fact a good guy. Which gives you some idea of the bad guys he faced in his western films. Note that Clint Eastwood also never returned to the spaghetti western after this film.

Van Cleef is his usual mean self, perhaps exponentially so. One thing about him is that he's a hired killer with a strong work ethic so I guess that counts for something. When he takes a contract he follows through. As for Wallach he dusts off his Mexican bandit characterization that served him so well in The Magnificent Seven is dusted off and embellished. At one point he's got Eastwood at his sadistic mercy, but when he learns of the loot, Wallach's greed gets the better of him.

I don't consider this the great classic that many do, but The Good The Bad And The Ugly will satisfy most western fans.",6

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

21 June 2018,"The Good, the Bad, the Ugly - they're all Great","Sergio Leone really shot for the rafters with The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, and I think he succeeded beautifully. Together with Ennio Morricone's powerful, truly original, and unforgettable score, they have created an iconic film. Eastwood and Wallach are both perfectly cast and create rich and deep characters that I really enjoyed. This is a serious film dealing with some serious situations, but Leone very adeptly sprinkles it throughout with just the right amount of humor. I disagree that this film is slow paced and instead consider it to be evenly paced to a degree necessary to achieve the desired result.

23 April 2004,"Clint, Lee, and Eli","In his third and final go around as the laconic Man With No Name, Clint Eastwood (the Good) reluctantly joins forces with bandit Eli Wallach (the Ugly) to find Confederate gold and only killer Lee Van Cleef (the Bad) stands in their way.

The Good - memorable spaghetti western music (title theme, Eli running through the grave yard, the death of the soldier, the stand off), Clint's stoic loner routine, Lee Van Cleef's killer villain routine, Eli Wallach's scene stealing performance as the rascal bandit Tuco, usual dose of morality tale told against the harsh western landscape.

The Bad - Too long, too slow, not a lot of energy except for when Eli Wallach is on screen, and even Eli can only do so much to keep the film lively.

The Ugly - Not a whole lot, though I preferred ""A Fistful of Dollars"", which was made on a smaller budget.

As a trivia note, the theatrical trailer incorrectly build Eli Wallach as ""the Bad"" and Lee Van Cleef as ""the Ugly"" even though in the film Lee Van Cleef is ""the Bad"" and Eli Wallach is ""the Ugly"".",
14 April 2023,"Hands down, the greatest western of all time!","Since childhood, this has been my favorite western movie, and it remains so today! As beautifully composed as the theme music, so many characters and situations are developed and maintained seamlessly throughout the film. There is never a dull moment, and some humor is also sprinkled in at times! Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach form the most formidable trio in western movie history, and each plays their role to perfection! This movie has it all, even taking us through a battle of the Civil War. The cast, the music, the sets... all come together to put this one at the top of the western movie mountain!

14 May 2015,"We all know this is great, but here's my 2 cents..","Well first off, having seen so many films, I'm not sure why I waited so long to watch this but I'm glad I finally did, and you should too! It's unbelievably clear to me now where Tarantino borrowed his camera shots and editing techniques from in the likes of KIll Bill and Inglorious Basterds! (I knew about Morricone)

The film was years ahead of its time, but I have two gripes with this movie that stopped me from giving it the full 10/10.

1: The dubbing- All the foreign actors acted their roles in their native tongues which were dubbed over afterwards. It was quite noticeable and threw me off a bit, I'd much rather a foreign film with subtitles than dubbing any day.

2: A tad too long. I do feel the running time could have been shaved byt 20 mins.

Having said all that, it's a great film! Ennio Morricone's soundtrack is outstanding and the ending is spectacular.

Overall opinion: Milestone!

Other films from the time I rated 9/10: Cool Hand Luke. Bicycle Thieves. The Italian Job",10
18 February 2008,The greatest movie of all time,"In the late sixties and early seventies, in the days before video and DVD, I used to regularly go out to watch the Dollar movies in the West End of London. What more can you say about this fabulous movie that hasn't already been said. Not much more. To me the music makes it. I really think this is the greatest sound track of all time. There was a cover version of the title theme by Hugo Montenegro that was No 1 in the UK hit parade for at least 6 weeks and I can remember Jimmy Saville in his Blondie outfit with cheroot introducing the record on Top of The Pops. So this movie, the music and the characters were constantly in the public consciousness and at the office we were constantly using the line ""There are two types of people in the world my friend...."" To all the people who haven't yet seen this movie - lucky you. Do yourself a favor and go and get it. You won't be disappointed.

7 June 2023,The Western of all Westerns,"Sergio Leone has perfected ""Spaghetti Westerns"" with his masterpiece ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"". Produced with arguably one of the greatest and most iconic scores ever this film manages to build perfect tension and set up every scene for success. Accompanied by fantastic performances by Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef who manage to carry their own weight equally on screen as well as beautiful scenery and cinematography helped to makes this feel authentic. From beginning to end I was never disappointed and highly recommend everyone to view this film even if westerns are not your cup of tea.

14 April 2020,the greatest western ever 9/10,"Three man in the wild west, either they team up or fight each other. Probably Sergio Leone's finest work on a western and considered one of the greatest movies ever. It's amazing how each of the three man represents the different types of people who lived back then in the wild west: the ugly represents the cunning man. The bad represents the gangsters and criminals of the old west and the good represents the only people left in the wild west to do good and what's right - for the right price ;). All three man try to survive as the civil war takes over everything. Great script, great actors and one spectacular finale sequence at the end.

23 August 2021,"Clint, Lee and Eli get serious","The conclusion of the Dollars trilogy lets Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach get tough. ""Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo"" (""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" in English) is more of an epic than the first two, but no less intense. Is there a way to watch the whole end sequence and not feel your heart flutter?

Even if you haven't seen the movie, you've probably heard the pulse-pounding theme song. It's one of the most iconic pieces of music ever (not surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino hired Ennio Morricone to do the music for ""Django Unchained""). It matches up perfectly with the setting and action. That plus the subtle performances and Sergio Leone's masterful direction make this one movie that everyone should see.

25 October 2011,"The best western movie in the world. Even after 45 years, no movie came even a bit closer for a challenge.","This movie is completely frank. It shows us everything that could be possible in any western movie. The only thing that makes it different than other movies is that it does it with style.

All three of them are of course brilliant. They were given many cool dialogues. Ennio Mariconi's music does half the work. You probably must have heard it. It brings more style and character to the story. Each of the three acted well and lived up to their pet names. Simply by looking at them makes you feel that it's great.

If you have not seen this movie, don't waste anymore time in reading these reviews. This is a classic movie used almost as a standard to measure any other film's greatness.

4 March 2023,"Invented Badass, Cinema Peaked here","This was my first spaghetti western. Since I watch other films of the same genre. And is not bias because it was the first. This is just a great movie. It is the best western. Sergio Leone is a great director. He can make a scene really suspenseful and engaging with just silence and closes ups on the actors faces. He can make a characters face tell a story. The score by Ennio Morricone can elevate those scenes and moments to another level. His music and score is iconic and memorable. Leone and Morricone are fantastic and shouldn't be overlooked. The pacing is great. It doesn't slow down to much in this almost three hour film. Nothing dragged or felt out of place. The main trio of actors are amazing. Clint Eastwood as Blondie or The Man with No Name and his co star's Eli Wallach as Tuco and Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes respectful. Each actor was very unique in there roles. Wallach is a huge stand out. He plays this very dirty and ugly character with such energy and fun. Cleef is the perfect casting as the main antagonist. Eastwood is a stoic wanderer, he plays his character with a cool calm collective manner whilst being a smart badass gunslinger. The dialogue is great with many memorable lines. The characters are memorable and unique. The cinematography is very solid. The way some shots are framed is very creative. And the final is easily the most memorable and iconic western imagery in the western genres and film in general. The music elevates this moment so much. It's gripping and intense and will leave you satisfied. A great film everyone should watch!",10
17 February 2023,A legendary movie,"It is a 1966 western movie. The subject is legendary, the director is legendary, the acting is legendary and the music is beyond legendary. Good in the movie, not good. Bad, not bad. Ugly isn't ugly either. Tuco, who is already called ugly, drags the movie. The true story of the man is built on pain. Her conversation with her brother is heartbreaking. I think a movie could be made just about this character. He is actually pure and sympathetic. He is ruthless in his fad moments, but like the other two characters, he is incapable of making plans. Bad is the dictionary meaning of charisma. Disciplined enough to do his job properly. The good character is slippery. He makes a deal with the criminals, delivers them to the law, gets the reward, then frees him from the rope, splits the money, and gives it back to the sheriff in another town.

All the music of the movie is signed by Ennio Morricone and is magnificent. The intros are flawless. The scenes are remembered for their music. My favorite is the L'estasi Dell'oro music, especially when Tuko searches for the name in the tomb.

The movie has great jokes and funny moments. One percent smile until the last scene.

There is no sex or nudity in the movie. It can be watched with family peace of mind.",9
23 January 2012,"""That's a tidy sum. But when I'm paid, I always see the job thru.""","A+

The undeniable pinnacle of Spaghetti Westerns, and one of the greatest films of ALL TIME. This movie slouches nowhere and every aspect of it is masterful. Clint Eastwood is back as ""The Good"", this time known as ""Blondie"", and is as great as ever. Lee Van Cleef returns as well, but not as Mortimer. He plays ""the Bad"", Angel Eyes; a completely different character. Angel Eyes is cunning, obsessively brutal and if you look closely maybe a psychopath. You've got to admire Cleef's capabilities as an impersonation actor. He's a whole another character than he was a year ago in ""For a Few Dollars More"". And Eli Wallach ""the Ugly"" a.k.a. Tuco, a truly great character. One might presume him as the comedic relief, and while definitely hilarious, that's hardly his role. The writing gives him depth, even a peek into his younger years which is why the writing is so great. And before I delve elsewhere, let me be clear this installment is indeed a prequel.

Many other great characters appear in the film, like the sadistic Corporal Wallace played by Italian actor Mario Brega , the left-handed gun-slinger out for revenge (Al Mulock, R.I.P.), who serves as the basis for one of the greatest lines of all time, courtesy of Tuco:""When you have to shoot, shoot! Don't talk."" Aside all these, my favorite would have to be the Union Captain, played by Aldo Giuffrè . The character is not a reflection of only great acting, but also serves as the symbol of what the whole movie is about.

The focal point of the movie would definitely be the devastation that war brings, and the many live sit tends to waste on useless efforts. All three of the titular characters, though motivated by greed no less, can't look away from the mutilation before their eyes. This tragic theme is brought out to its fullest by Ennio Morricone, our composer. This has got to be one of his best scores ever, the rawness of it. He captures the fighting spirit beautifully. One of my favorite scene sin film history would have to be when Angel Eyes finds the battered Confederate regiment, and the glorious cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli actually shows the villain step out of the darkness, even if only for a moment, to observe the plight of the soldiers. The music really adds to it, but enough. After all there is a limit to how you can write on IMDb.

Anyways, this film sports truly awesome characters, clever writing, beautiful cinematography, and a timeless score. And oh yes the greatest gun-slinger duel of all cinematic history. It truly is director Sergio Leone's finest hour.",10
19 May 2020,Memorable. Father and son.,"Great movie. Iconic actors. Iconic characters. Legendary soundtrack. Great film that leads you and the main characters down a series of situations each unique and interesting and holding of your attention. Watched this with my son. I enjoyed how despite its name, each character had a small amount of good, bad and ugly although obviously each of the characters displayed one of these adjectives more than the others. Great movie to build memories around. Loved it and so did he.

20 July 2014,"The Long, The Boring, And The Ugliest","Serfio Leone was never my cup of tea - his spaghetti westerns are schematic, prolonged, protruded, childish, silly and slow. This horror of a movie lasts for unbearable 3 hours and makes it painful and slow. Nobody saves the film - even Clint Eastwood seems to be utterly bored, Wlach is at best bemused, and even the superb soundtrack by Enio Morricone does not help deliver this devastating bomb of terribly long and slow close-ups, unnecessary silly dialogs, inconclusive battle scenes, meddled plot and gray, dry, grainy tempo. This gray, sandy, grainy landscape illustrates the film's misery best of all - it is not captivating, nor does it manage to hold attention for a speck of time. It just rags along ploddingly and leaves no place for any serious delivery or dynamics. Do not watch this meddle, waste of time merely

29 December 2022,Undeniable Classic,"Sergio Leone's ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is undeniably a very classic film. An iconic soundtrack. Very iconic scenes. The birth of the spaghetti western. The launch of Clint Eastwood's career. One of the many films that was partially responsible for the demise of the Hays Code in Hollywood and which gave rise to a new era of cinematic art through the 1970s to today. All of this is undeniable.

And the film itself is quite excellent. The cinematography and editing and directing are all somewhat of a masterclass on film making here. This is one of the most beautiful films ever shot; a spaghetti epic that runs nearly three hours long.

And that's part of my criticism with it. It feels a little bit longwinded. The pacing is slow. Many scenes that I feel are somewhat superfluous. The soundtrack is great but we here the same musical sequence like at least ten times in the movie, that crying harmonica. The dubbing is also pretty bad at times.

I love it but I'll admit it's a little flawed and it's not something that I'd consider rewatching over and over again. It's a great film but at the same time it just doesn't really connect with me personally like I know it does for others.",9
22 October 2022,It can be better,"I think it can be better. The story is meant to be unfolded with 3 protagonists, but actually only two are the actual heroes (antiheroes). I don't really see the correspondence between the Bad and the other two, which made it quite confusing when I was expecting three persons' story intertwined. The Bad is quite static and two dimensional. Tuco is a successful character though. I see his personality fully elaborated and almost all of his behaviors are explained with his history. The best part is when he met his priest brother and said something like ""from where we were born, the only ways to survive are either to be a priest or a bandit."" It is like a response to Stendhal's The Red and The black where the situation is either to be a priest or an aristocrat. The time sets in civil war America, where aristocracy life is out of the picture. That plot alone evolved Tuco from a dumb gangster to a complex and somewhat lovely character who we can sympathize. While the Good, although better depicted than the Bad, is not very successful neither. The storyteller apparently wanted to make his line a crucial thread, but we still don't know why he is the good one. He is not any better than Tuco, because they all kill people for a living. Sometimes he cares for others but that's not enough to turn our perspective on him from bad to good. Yup, he is attractive, but still - not enough. None of his history is told, so we don't have any evidence to understand his conducts as a whole. It's a pretty nice western though, but I do think there can be more. It can be so much better.",7
13 September 2001,"Not as good as ""Once upon a time in the west"" still VERY good!!!","three gun fighters looking for $200,000 in stolen gold.

That´s about the story and those three gun fighters is: Clint Eastwood(The Good) Lee Van Cleef(The bad) Eli Wallach(the ugly)

The story could have been better but it´s maybe the best in the dollar trilogy(For a few dollars more is almost as good). This is much like: ""once upon a time in the west"" Both are a western epics.



RATING:4+ out of 5-not as the masterpiece ""once upon a time in the west"" still great.

9 May 2008,"""God is with us because he hates the Yanks"" ""God is not on our side because he hates idiots also""","If you want to see a good spaghetti movie, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is probably the move you're thinking of.

3 sides, 3 people, 1 excellent film.

The Good: Clint Eastwood plays Blondie, who is quite possibly the most interesting person to ever grace a Western movie. Blondie is so mysterious, laid back, quiet, sly, sneaky, and tricky. But at the same time, he does what he knows is right, and will not rip anyone off unless they had it coming.

The Bad: Lee Van Cleef plays Angel Eyes, who is quick to show that he is the bad guy. Angel Eyes is very educated, well-connected, sly, and very determined. Angel Eyes pulls a lot of strings to get what he wants, and will stay on task until it is done.

The Ugly: Eli Wallach plays Tuco, a sleazy, sniveling, thief. Tuco is very sneaky, and usually will steal from almost anyone, including his own partners. However, as evil as Tuco is, he also has a good side. He does occasionally do what is right. Although it is sometimes still in his own benefit, he will still go out of his way to do it. And this cross between good and bad is what makes Tuco such an interesting and well-liked character.

The story is very winding, but in a good way. Some parts make you wonder if you are still watching a spaghetti movie or not.

With a long (but still very interesting) plot, great characters, and many excellent scenes, The Good, the Bad and The Ugly is sure to please western fans of all kinds. The movie deserves its place at #4 on IMDb's top 250 (as of 5/9/08).

10/10",10
1 September 2007,Brutal Brilliance,"""There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend: Those with a rope around the neck, and the people who have the job of doing the cutting.""

This is without any doubt one of (if not the) greatest western films ever made. It has a very continuous structure so it keeps the audience entertained the whole way through Its a story of greed, hypocrisy, betrayal and ironic friendship.

Its about 3 very different people (good the bad and the ugly) all going for the same treasure buried in a grave. Its a tense and edge of seat classic

The music is nothing short of perfect, this is by far Ennio Morricone's best work and the music creates the films now clichéd stereotype which was such (and still is) a success in the 60's when it came out.

In Conclusion, Don't be scared off by this movie because of its genre, I've never liked westerns but this was thoroughly entertaining a must see 8.9/10",10

13 March 2023,MASTERPIECE !!!!,"If I could do a one word review of this movie, that word would be MASTERPIECE.

This may not be my favorite movie but it is very close. However I do appreciate the great detail to the casting, , cinematography, soundtrack, clever writing/dialogue and all the great production that makes this movie the greatest movie ever made. I have seen it at least 10 times and never tire of it. Right now I'm watching it on television although I own it on DVD. This version on TV is showing all of the deleted scenes that were later cut. With the deleted scenes added back in, it is almost like watching a new movie. Thank you Sergio Leone. You are the best.

6 October 2020,Another Western Smash By Sergio Leone,"Pros: 1. The score is phenomenal, particularly the iconic theme which gives you chills whenever it plays. 2. The cinematography is fantastic with the wide shots showing off the beautiful scenery, and the close-ups upping the tension. 3. The set and costume design is brilliant thus making the world-building perfect and entirely immersive. 4. The make-up is terrific, especially in regards to Blondie's (Clint Eastwood) blistered face. 5. Both Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach (Tuco) give great performances. 6. The action scenes are wholly entrancing and they're brilliantly choreographed. 7. The humour is dry but hilarious, and it's intelligently placed thus it never feels forced or inappropriate. 8. The atrocities and horrors of the American Civil War (1861-1865) are handled deftly, which allows for some genuinely heart-warming and tender moments. 9. The last 15 minutes can be summarised as succinctly as this: perfect cinema.

Cons: 1. The sound-mixing is a little dated, especially in regards to the dialogue. 2. Some of the dialogue is slightly too cheesy.",9
20 March 2020,By far my favorite Clint Eastwood movie.,"This spaghetti western was very good. Clint Eastwood and the rest of the cast did a spectacular job in this movie. The plot to the movie was very good and it's very entertaining throughout. The gunfights in this movie were pretty cool as well. This is a classic movie that everyone should see. You'll love it.

27 September 2004,"A great western, but drags a little too much, especially on repeated viewings","This, the third and final part of Sergio Leone's famous ""Dollars"" or ""Man with no name"" Trilogy was promised to be the epic chapter; that proves to be entirely true. However, despite Leone's talented direction, the film seems to drag in some scenes, and the length is almost unbearable on multiple viewings. The plot is very good, intricate, yet simple enough for the mainstream crowd; the way it keeps developing through twists and unexpected situations is also great. It keeps your interest, at least the first few times you see it. The pace is bad in some scenes, where the movie seems to drag on endlessly. I don't think I've been able to sit through the whole thing more than once(granted, technically that's enough, but a film should have some re-watch value, I think). The acting is very good; Clint Eastwood is the embodiment of the spaghetti-western spirit. Lee Van Cleef is excellent as well, as is Eli Wallach. The characters are well-written, interesting and credible. The direction is, as always when it comes to Leone's films, excellent. Apart from the few scenes where the plot drags, Leone keeps a great atmosphere and mood throughout the film. The action is about as good as it gets when it comes to spaghetti-western: excellent, intense and very, very cool. The dialog is excellent. The script is well-written. The soundtrack is among Ennio Morricone's best work. All in all, if you're into westerns at all, this is pretty much *the* western. It drags a little too much in a few scenes, though, and is probably best enjoyed if you only see it once. I recommend it to any fan of westerns, particularly spaghetti-westerns, as well as any of the three main actors, or Sergio Leone. 9/10",9
7 November 2002,Among those films you hope to forget a little bit...,"...to watch them again every other year with great delight. Alas, after a few frames you know you perfectly remember every single scene. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is such a feast people should be entitled to discover it more than once over a lifetime. Actually you can watch it again with friends, have your children enjoy it for the very first time and that's big time yet!

I recently headed for the 175min version, showcased as the 'Original Italian release version', hoping to catch up with the pristine of the first sprightly running. And the winner is... not me for sure but the well devised marketing babble.

First the original version makes no sense when you know the dubbed movie so well, plus Italian doesn't fit westerns when it's not your mother tongue. But most important, among the fistful of minutes more (14 exactly), you get only transitions scenes, which, at best, slows down the general pace. For example the first (and longest) patch only offers a square caveat of the gloomy war background Leone wanted to depict. So it heavily echoes the later scenes with wounded soldiers in the mission and dissolves the shock of the bridge battle scene where the horror and stupidity of war is much more striking. But the main flaw is it's only about Sentenza and Van Cleef displays the same experimented humane type he played in For a few dollars more while he is supposed to be The Bad in this movie.

Shorthand: don't bother about the bloated 175min version. It's kind of a 'sneak preview' which Leone decided to trim after the initial release, so IT IS NOT a director's cut but only the last step before the final cut. A step that shouldn't appeal to you unless you're a cinema archaeologist with a sweet tooth for deleted species. And The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is now and again fresh and alive.",10
20 June 2020,Great,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

23 October 2006,"Too Long, Too Slow , Just Watchable. Sorry","I really couldn't understand most of the reviews here that place this film as a great western or even the best ever for some fans. In my opinion this is just a watchable and good western, but not much more than that.

I think the only possible explanation would be that IMDb reviewers consider ""spaghetti"" westerns a sub-genre within the western genre. If that is so, ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" would probably stand among the best (if not the best)in the ""spaghetti"" westerns ranking. But the point is that in my opinion there are no sub-genres within the western genre. So I analyze this film just for what it is: a western film.

In such terms, this film has its moments, fine open-wide outdoor locations, good action gunfights (though hardly believable) and an acceptable plot. Good acting too mainly in Eli Wallach's Tuco.

But what really demerits this movie is its incredibly unnecessary overrun; there's no way the story can stand almost 3 hours in duration and so the development is definitely slow. Overruning has always been a characteristic of director Sergio Leone; he sort of engages madly with some sequences and he goes on and on and on at it (the final duel here is an example with all those unnecessary close shots in the men's faces and eyes). Another clear sample of what I'm saying was the incredibly long -and even boring- opening sequence of ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", where Leone takes more than 10 minutes in the opening sequence where three gunmen are waiting for Charles Bronson at a train station.

Come on guys, let's face it. ""Spaghetti"" westerns are ""B"" movies and even if at the very start they could have seemed sort of original and somehow enjoyable, once you take an honest critical look at them they're not great films but just good a few of them but no more than that. Sorry again.",1
29 December 2009,Three independent gunmen wander through the hell of war in their quest for riches...,"The setting: the American Southwest (Texas?) during the Civil War. The set-up: three gunslingers wander through the war-torn country in search of personal gain.

Lee Van Cleef is a hit-man (the Bad), Eli Wallach is a bandit (the Ugly), and Clint Eastwood is a lone gunman with scruples (the Good). Wallach's and Eastwood's stories are intertwined, and they eventually meet up with Van Cleef, although he disappears for long stretches of the film. The saga is long and drawn out and the characters are put through a lot in their quest for riches.

But I'm not sure that's what the movie's about. It seems to preach the gruesomeness and pointlessness of war, showing wounded soldiers, some who've lost their legs or arms on the battlefield. The three main characters are just passing through. They have no allegiance and their outsider's point of view helps emphasize the absurdity of all that meaningless killing. I wonder if the gunmen's quest is merely the framework for an anti-war movie...

Still, there's plenty of gunslinging action, as well as cannonfire and explosions. This Italian-made western is a pretty big production. The biggest of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, yet, following the low-budget ""Fistful of Dollars"" and ""For A Few Dollars More"".

If Eastwood's ""man with no name"" in Leone's ""Dollar Trilogy"" is meant to be a single character, this film (the final of the three) shows the birth of that man. This is where he acquires his iconic poncho.

As far as westerns go, this isn't the usual John Wayne cowboy fare. If you've seen Leone's earlier westerns, you have an idea of what to expect, except this movie is different even from them. It's not about saloons or cattle trails, cowboys or Indians. It's not even about a ruthless villain that must be stopped. It's about three men all looking out for themselves and all after the same thing. Three men who don't trust each other and who can handle a pistol. The movie is violent, but fun. It takes place across many locations, right in the middle of Civil War action. The war is the backdrop, not the Old West. The whole thing is not quite like any other western film I've seen.

IMDb currently rates this as #4 on its Top 250. I don't know if I'd rate it that highly after my first viewing, but it's good. There are many effective stretches with sparse dialogue and the film is full of black humor. There are several memorable sequences. An enjoyable watch.",

17 August 2012,Seen 100+ times and never grows old,"What can I say about this magnificent epic film that hasn't already been written or spoken? Saw this first as a teenager in the 1970s and was glued to the TV along with my two brothers. Great story, acting, scenery, and the score is fantastic. Clint Eastwood plays the Man with No Name who along with Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach hunt for a stolen cash box filled with gold coins buried in a cemetery during the American Civil War. They each know only one part of where the gold is buried so they have to keep each other alive despite the fact they want to kill each other. This 3 hour movie moves along gracefully and never gets boring. The final cemetery scene and standoff between the three main characters is riveting. Once again the score is unforgettable. Yes I have seen this film over 100 times and love every minute of it. Not only a great western but one of the best films ever made!!

Watching this great movie again on TCM in 2016. The difference is they now play the restored extended version with an additional 25 minutes included. These ""new"" scenes makes the story even more riveting and tie in some loose ends. To the director Sergio Leone all I can say is thank you for your talents.",10

3 May 2018,One of the greatest movies of all time,"As Sergio Leone was cementing himself as a great director after the excellent Yojimbo remake 'Fistful of Dollars' and the incredible 'For a Few Dollars More', with 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' he has managed to reach his quality climax.

With a lot of close ups, gorgeous landscape cinematography & stylish drawn out tenseful gunfights all of Leone's trademarks are clearly visible. Yet why is The Good, the Bad and the Ugly even better than his other masterpieces? The three main characters are ofcourse the stars of this show, with each putting in an exceptional performance, especially Eli Wallach as the eccentric bandit Tuco. Clint Eastwood & Lee van Cleef's natural acting talent show that there is no need for useless dialogue to insult the viewers intelligence, facial acting is an even more impressive kind of acting, and with van Cleef and Eastwood, they had the two best in the business. The little dialogue also gives the viewer a chance to listen to the absolutely incredible musical orchestrations by Ennio Morricone, which is always in a natural kind of harmony to Leone's direction skills, resulting in absolutely graceful scenes that delight the eyes. The dialogue that is there always seems to further the story or enhance character development ( specifically in Tuco's case ), and not insult the viewers intelligence. It even includes a parody on one of the most common Hollywood clichés when Tuco says: 'When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk!'.

Unlike Leone's previous films The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is set during the American civil war between the Union and Confederacy, and a lot of small subplots feature this war. Leone shows a sarcastic view on the purposelessness of the civil war in this film by putting the three main characters in its midst while maintaining its own personal story about greed. The alcoholic Union captain shows this perfectly, with his fed up view about the brutality and the senseless deaths of the civil war, or Angel Eyes's trip through a confederate hospital showing all the wounded as Morricone's dramatic music plays. As for morals, we see the nametags of the title of the movie added to the three characters, yet don't really see all three of them as more than common thugs at the start of the movie. However, the civil war changes this, showing Blondie a man of compassion when faced with a dying soldier, to whom he shares his cigar. A little gesture of great moral worth. Also showing Angel Eyes's indifference with his stolen identity as a fake Union sergeant only to further his own personal greedy agenda. Tuco is shown after the meeting with his brother to be forced into the way he is now, and even though he is a vulgar, dirty, ugly ( no pun intended ) character Leone manages to make him likeable when he is influenced by greed. Thus one of the greatest decisions Leone made was having the setting during the civil war, as its part in this story further enhances character development and brings up questions about the senselessness of it all. The blowing up of the bridge could be seen as the greatest ironic statement of Leone against war.

Yet the primary story still consists of finding gold in a certain cemetery, as a personal study of greed. This concept alone might not seem so spectacular, but Ennio Morricone's haunting score, the beautiful desert landscape cinematography, stylish gunfights and the brilliant acting results in an incredible primary story aswell. It is one of the films with some of the greatest final 15-20 minutes ever put to screen, resulting in a large payoff deserving of such a quality film. In the end we truly begin to understand why the tags 'Good', 'Bad' and 'Ugly' are stated in the beginning of the film, as all of the characters have evolved to their respective states during the affairs in the civil war. This is excluding Angel Eyes, who is shown to be evil, dressed in black, from the start, but that makes sense since Leone wanted to show the differences between the three characters in a morality contest during the film, and as Blondie and Tuco changed, Angel Eyes had to be different from them.

All of this cements The Good, the Bad and the Ugly as one of the greatest films ever made, and the greatest western ever made, since it tackles so many different kind of themes. It is one of the greatest pieces of entertainment, yet also tackling morality problems and making anti-war statements.",10
7 March 2022,The Unknown,"Three gunmen, one is, ""The Bad"", looking for the man who buried gold in a secret place, one is, ""The Ugly"", who knows the name of the place, a cemetery, and one is, ""The Good"", who knows the name of the grave where the golds are buried. Now all these three gunmen must reach the cemetery to get the gold in the midst of the Civil War.

The genres are, Action, Adventure, Comedy, War, Western.

The three gunmen are, Clint Eastwood, The Good, unnamed but called as Blondie, a bounty hunter. Eli Wallach, The Ugly, named Tuco, a wanted criminal. Lee Van Cleef, The Bad, a contract killer, hitman, assassinator, unnamed but called as Angel Eyes.

This movie seems so interesting from the very first scene. But this scene will tighten the viewers with their seat. Which scene? When Tuco and Blondie discover a horse carriage loaded with dead bodies.

Lee Van Cleef survived 64 years, died in 1989. Eli Wallach survived 99 years, died in 2014. Clint Eastwood, still alive, age 92 (2022). The genius director and writer Sergio Leone survived 60 years, died in 1989. The musician Ennio Morricone survived 92 years, died in 2020.

I mentioned these information because I made a little thesis about the most important characters & crews in this movie. I read the trivia, the goofs everything. Because which movie I liked, I read about them. I mentioned Ennio Morricone, the background scorer of this movie, cause he is one of the most important person who make this movie great. His music makes this movie more enjoyable and more interesting.

The character, Blondie, the good, is the hero of this movie, top billed fastest gun fighter. Whereas Tuco, the ugly, the funniest character and at the same time so dangerous, has the most screentime. But I liked the character ""the bad"" by Angel Eyes most. 'Cause I liked his personality most, mostly the way his face is, solid face.

Overall, one of the most enjoyable films I have ever watched. One of the most stylish movies in the world. More than greatest cinematography and background score made the movie a finest cinema in history. Visually stunning for the costumes, the location, the war, the cemetery (which will make you say, wow).

Recommended 100%.

Watchable with the whole family. Can be rewatch again and again. Watch it to believe it.",9
14 November 2009,The Most Epic of Westerns,"In The Good, The Bad and the Ugly Sergio Leone perfected his epic western. It's key is the trio of main characters who all bring something different to the table and all serve as integral ingredients to a film that might appear a mere adventure film on the surface, but which is both a comedy and character drama as well as a great war movie at the same time.

Clint Eastwood's the Man with No Name, this time called Blondie, continues somewhat on the more ruthless note he took on from the previous film (For a Few Dollars More). However, he's not a truly malicious character but more of jerk-friend who is also extremely observant and at the end of the day doesn't stab anyone in the back so hard that they wouldn't get up again. This creates his rather odd relationship with Tuco.

Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes is the very embodiment of evil as far as characters go. He wipes anyone who's in his way, is entirely devoid of any morals and generally manages to create a menacing mood with his presence. This is a stark contrast to the character he played in the previous film and made all the more unsettling by the fact that his appearance is almost identical to this character from the previous film, right down to the pipe.

Eli Wallach as Tuco the Rat is easily the most memorable character from the film. Appearing at first filthy, amoral and without any redeeming qualities he is suddenly thrust into a wavering partnership and later, one could even say, a type of friendship with Blondie. We find out that there is more to Tuco than meets the eye though he never stops being the seemingly greedy scum that he is at the start, by the end of the film the viewer is even able to sympathise with him to a degree.

What truly sets this film apart from other westerns and as well as the rest of the Dollars trilogy is that even in its close-to-three-hour length, the film doesn't feel excessively long. The length is justified. You 'want' to spend the 170 minutes with the main cast of characters.",10
8 February 2023,"A great movie, with awesome characters.","I went into this movie thinking the pacing would ruin the cinematic moments, but it makes the movie incredibly suspenseful.

We journey in the Civil War, with our 3 main protagonists that are shown near the beginning, and cross paths again at the end. The three separate stories really are well written with each others character getting their own spotlight without it seeming difficult to understand. The shots were very suspenseful usually have long shots or close-ups with a cool soundtrack. They give everyone such a charming and unique personality that builds off perfectly with the story.

This was my first Western movie, but I'm tempted to watch more because of how great everything was in this one.

12 September 2020,My favourite movie of all the stuff I have seen in my lifetime.,"Hello friends. I am a long time IMDb user and in October 2020 it will have been for 15 years. After watching the Mulan (2020) remake I sat here and I wrote my review in mild disgust. I then proceeded to evacuate my bowels for 45 minutes in a strange but calming grip of horror that maybe the mastery and art of cinema is completely dead.

However, what comes to mind is the Ojibwe saying from 'The Sopranos', which is: ""Sometimes I go about in pity for myself, and all the while, a great wind carries me across the sky."" I also realised that I haven't made many written reviews, even though I have watched and rated as of right now 2,781 titles.

In any case, I had decided to celebrate 15 years of me using IMDb by reviewing all the titles that I have rated a 10 out of 10 perfect score. A change of pace. A palette cleansing. There aren't many titles, mind, as I have noted here only 8 that fit the bill... out of 2,781. There are of course a whole bunch of good titles that I have given a 9/10, and I will probably list those later on.

So here we go, the 8 titles that I gave 10/10 are as follows: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), The Sopranos (1999-2007), Jaws (1975), The Shield (2002-2008), Seven Samurai (1954), The Shining (1980), Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964), and finally The Passion of the Christ (2004).

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. This is an adventure, with crazy characters, good music, a backdrop of civil war, and most of all a treasure hunt.

I love the character development in this title, each of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly have their own motivations, and mix in a whole load of grey area in between. I can't really explain it, but these three characters might be some of my favourites. I want to feel sorry for Tuco, but he's a wild animal. I want to root for the man with no name, but he is so ambiguous. I feel as if Segio Leone knew what he was doing in this regard, a commentary on the psychology of man and in particular the time period of the frontier west.

The attention to detail is ahead of it's time I feel, the longshots, and the rapid editing in the showdowns. This has been copied and copied time and again, but Lerone did it first I feel. His camerawork and positioning are top notch.

I love the backdrop, and I love the composition of music, scenery and atmosphere. This is masterful and well balanced. I'm almost certain he has encoded the 7 sins in this movie as well. Story wise the three main characters intertwine several times and end up on the same goal of finding the gold coins. I can't understand how well this plays out and the slow burn to the final showdown is just pure genius. I love this movie, and will continue to watch it until I die.

In any case, this is a perfect 10 out 10 film, certainly the best 'Western' ever created.",10
25 March 2020,A huge Western epic film,"A sprawling Western epic ,one that continues to get better and better with each viewing. The movie is long, but there's not a wasted scene in the film. Each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more about each character and what's going on The music is perfection.The way the music drives this movie is absolutely amazing. The story is riveting. There's not a single dull moment. It's a cinematic masterpiece and one of the most influential movies of all time. Oh , and it's also tons of fun, and you should see it in the biggest screen possible.

26 June 2012,"Leone, Morricone, Eastwood, Wallach, Van Cleef - the Western at its peak","Watching a Sergio Leone Western is like sitting down for dinner Italian style the way Leone enjoyed it: You've got the whole family there, its slow but keeps coming and coming and the whole affair eventually lasts for hours - but you savor every minute of it.

Part of the family are: Clint Eastwood (""the Good"") of course in his third and final installment in a Leone movie, Lee Van Cleef (""the Bad"") and Eli Wallach (""the Ugly""). Viewers familiar with the Dollar movies need no introduction to Eastwood's Blondie character, the gunslinger who spells cool, but his two adversaries/companions on the bounty hunt are on par in this one. Especially Eli Wallach steals the show with his twisted opportunistic, rough, down-to-earth, yet also outright funny performance, and Cleef's angel eyes never looked better and deadlier than in a Leone close-up underpinned by Ennio Morricone's extravagant, almost surreal soundtrack. The latter is a given considering Leone's previous collaborations with the master composer, but just as Leone's understanding on filming, Morricone's music reaches a new level in ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"". As for Leone: You've got it all here: The long shots over deserted lands, battlefields, hundreds upon hundreds of graves, counterbalanced by the extreme close-ups of characters digging deep into their minds and souls, plus there's the deliberate time the director takes to tell his story about greed, full of twists and turns, spiced up with irony. Unmissable.",10
27 February 2009,A Magnificent Film.,"In my opinion, this is the greatest western ever made. It's better than ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" and ""High Noon"". It really is that good. All three of the main performances, Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are spot on.

Being the last of the so-called ""Dollars Trilogy"", you get a sense that director Sergio Leone wanted to out do his first two westerns (""A Fistful of Dollars"" and ""For a Few Dollars More"") by having everything in it, the American Civil War, a Treasure Hunt, and the best climatic shoot-out of all time.

An interesting thing to note, is that it was the first Western Epic. Running out over three hours it was the longest Western of its time.

If you haven't seen ""Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo"" see it, if you have seen it, see it again now.",10
17 September 2013,Heavy Entertainment In Parts. ♦ 75%,"The plot is snail-paced if you consider watching it in now (2013) mostly because, many sequences have huge potential to bore the hell out of you at a time of fast-paced action-thrillers.

Now the discrepancies are mentioned, the epic western movie does strike multiple chords throughout its 3 hour time-line. The amazing climax, the gun-slinging shots, the surprise action moves & of course, human nature theme are portrayed with such brilliance that you wonder how much effort went behind them. The soundtrack is one more melodious thing about it.

Cast performance is fantastic & Sergio Leone's direction works wonders with the genuine locations. The story is fresh & entertains fine. A humble 7.5 out of 10 for the wonderful & most probably the best western to come out of 20th century; that 21st century stands out.

BOTTOM LINE: Recommended for people who love westerns. Others may get bored.

Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES

29 March 2010,Far more then a western.....,"The Good,The Bad and The Ugly is the best western movie that i have seen ever.No doubt,Once upon a time in the west stands on the same fame but it just towers a bit higher.This is a masterpiece from Sergio Leonne.Lets talk about the three characters in the film.

The Good: Clint Eastwood raised to stardom only due to this movie.The good man may have done some fabulous roles but this one from his past is one of his best.Great acting and those cigar scenes,just everything fits.

The Bad: Angel eyes or the bad or Lee Van Cleef rises to the occasion.Its just his presence that gives a dark effect to the film.He shows how to make a serious bad role into a contemporary easygoing kind of.He has the least role in the movie but still for me he was a stand out performer.

The Ugly: Tuco.......Fabulous.Who is this guy?What an act?So captivating and just his greed for money that you wish you always see his acting again and again.Perfect casting for a perfect role.

Here i add a fourth character.The master of Westerners.The emphatic Sergio Leonne.

Sergio Leonne: Words are hard to say how i feel about him right now.He is class.Along with Ennio Marricone he has a pairing that is the best in cinema.Beautiful directed scenes and soundtrack constantly echoing in your ears.The epic scene or the penultimate climax in the end is a rare art of cinema.Such scenes just make the movie or break it.The linking up of war,blowing up of bridge,fight for money,all add different emotionality to the movie.Specially the war scenes,the death of the general particularly,a scene i can never forget.A scene with such amazing music.

Words are not enough for this film.This is grand.This is magnanimous.This is far more than just a western....",10
24 January 2020,"Very GOOD, absolutely not BAD nor UGLY","I really liked ""The good, the bad and the ugly"". It's an odyssey around the west in which we follow these three characters played by Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef that have different paths that cross each other. As usual Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone are indescribable, in particular the last 15 minutes are outstanding as far as direction, score and also editing. And that final showdown is fantastic: 5 minutes of music and looks that keeps you on the edge of your seat, really memorable. The only complaint I have is that even if the movie is a great time, in some points I felt its length. Everything is necessary, I wouldn't have cut anything because of the setting in the middle of the secessionist war and so the movie takes its time to show the repercussions of it. But as I said sometimes I felt it too long. But that's not a big problem, indeed I really enjoyed ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" and if you like the genere you should definitely watch it.

8 April 2023,The GOAT of Italian westerns!,"Not only is GBU one of the finest western films, it's a fine film across all genres!

Whoever had the idea of casting the Jewish Eli Wallach as Tuco, the low-life bandido, was a genius! He is priceless! Perhaps the signature role of his long and illustrious career!

Lee Van Cleef is the consummate villain in a seemingly effortless portrayal. You really will be filled with both fear, loathing, and curious admiration for his ""Angel Eyes"" role.

And Clint Eastwood is the perfect lead star. I always wondered why Tuco chose ""Blondie"" as his character's nickname, since his character's hair is dark brown in all the scenes without a hat.

The sheer sweep of the story is what sets it apart from all other westerns: small pueblo villages in Mexico, southwestern one-horse towns, civil war battlefields, desolate badlands, thriving metropolises, & etc. It's truly a film for all generations of movie audiences!",9
26 May 2010,could not help but enjoy,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

26 December 2022,"Epic production for its time, but... where's the story???","Not sure where all the raging reviews originate from... Seems most people should learn how to watch a movie, then maybe write a review (I d suggest Talking Pictures: How to Watch Movies)

Alright, let's put into context the fact this movie was released in 1966 and the production is indeed epic.

From the number of extras and all the locations and the set design (especially the ending scene at the cemetery which was completely built from scratch).

And yes: the score by Morricone is magnificent and became an instant classic.

And yes: the editing was revolutionary with the fast cuts between establishing shots and extreme close ups .

And Yes: the classic western genre of white hat / black hat is indeed represented differently (the ""good"" is just good looking, he is as bad as the others)

That said: the 3 story act structure wasnt really a thing back then and it shows. I do not care about any of the characters. At all. A bit better with the ""ugly"" since he has a bit of a backstory and shows more humanity and facial expressions than the others.

Plus: the dubbing is horrendous sometimes; the whole thing is unnecessary long (especially the first hour or so which should be the end of the first act); too many deus ex machina moments move the movie forward which is utterly lame; certain events are just simply unrealistic or illogical (gun in the bathtub ready to fire... come on)",6
5 April 2020,The Cow Boy Music,"Set during the time of an American Civil War showing the era of 1860's the film is a visual gem. With a 3hour and 6mins of runtime the film is roaming around the 3 bounty hunters basically the Good, Bad & Ugly. The back and forth cat and mouse chases and survival is what you see in the movie. As stated above it's a visual gem the USP of this movie is its Cinematography, Sets, Camera work, Artwork and Costume design along with fascinating background score which I'm sure you have heared multiple times which we now call as Cow Boy Music"". Apart from it the trio has performed exceptionally which make this film nothing but a classic cult

26 March 2006,One of the Best Westerns Ever Made...,"'Buono, il brutto, il cattivo, Il' was at its release in 1966 a very unconventional Western epic that follows the travails of three gunfighters looking for $200,000 in stolen Confederate gold.

Also known as 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', it was Italian-born (Rome, 3 January 1929) Sergio Leone's third so-called spaghetti Western after 'Per un pugno di dollari', aka 'For a Fistful of Dollars' (1964) and 'Per qualche dollaro in più', aka 'For a Few Dollars More' (1965).

It is generally considered one of the best films of its kind ever made, a masterpiece, one that almost inexplicably continues to get better with each viewing. In a way, it's a morality play, weighing the consequences of good and evil, but it does so in its realistic portrayal that sometimes, crime DOES pay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good DOES go unrewarded.

This film ushered in a new concept of a previously all too oft told Western story, probably tolling the death knell for the traditional American-made, Good guy/ Bad guy, White hat/ Black hat Western that was so prevalent before it.

The three main characters of the film are as powerful as Leone's brilliant vision of the Civil War era America, he used as their backdrop. Lee Van Cleef ('The Bad') is evil in the flesh. Beedy-eyed and totally ruthless, he believes it only takes one thing to be successful: whatever is necessary.

Clint Eastwood ('The Good') is the now legendary 'Man With No Name', but 'good' only in a Western concept of non-traditional good. He has a sometimes detectable and occasionally observable sense of honor that motivates his behavior and conduct from time to time.

Eli Wallach ('The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most colorful character in the film. Impulsive and full of barely suppressible rage, Tuco gyrates wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be a best friend in one scene, trying to kill in another. Tuco truly represents 'the ugly' side of human behavior.

At two hours and forty-one minutes, the movie was lengthy for its day, but there's neither a single scene that seems unnecessary, nor does the film seem lengthy while viewing it. The film unfolds with a charismatic style and grace, slowly revealing more and more about each character and the film's story. The pace of the film expertly captures the flavor of the time, giving the viewer a rare peek into a page of American history come alive on film.

Director Sergio Leone (who contributed to another epic of note: 'Ben-Hur' as an uncredited second unit director in 1959) manages to build a lot of sometimes unsettling tension in the film, thus preventing the longer than usual movie from ever getting uncomfortable or predictable. Every typical Western cliché possibly imaginable is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling. Of special honorable mention is Ennio Morricone's original music score, which is about as masterful and complementary as it gets, culminating in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film. The music is so rich and powerful it easily stands on its own merits, and is one of the biggest selling original movie soundtracks to date. It is impossible to imagine the film without it.

'Unforgiven' may well have been the sequel to 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', the story of what eventually happened to the 'Man With No Name', and won Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director, and the nomination for Best Actor for Eastwood in 1992 (the film also was nominated in six other categories and won in three of those). Eastwood dedicated this movie to Sergio Leone who died 30 April 1989 in Rome, and who had believed in him early in his career.

Call it 'Buono, il brutto, il cattivo, Il' or call it 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', but after seeing it you'll call this movie absolutely brilliant at MANY levels, including the one mentioned above by Kitchener.

It is a classic like no other, and is easily one of the best Westerns and films of its kind ever made.",10
22 April 2007,The BEST western EVER,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it?

6 September 2021,THE MAN WITH NO NAME!,"Beware! Probably one of the longest westerns ever filmed, but you never get tired of the genius, regardless of the length. I have been a devout fan of THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY for the better part of fifty years. Basically, it's a tale of human nature at its worst, and under the worst conditions possible --the desert expanse. In rides the legendary Man With No Name, superbly played by another screen legend, Clint Eastwood, who must deal with two bandidos, equally played to the hilt by Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. The rest is cinematic history. A morality play, true, and then some, but an exercise in film-making at its very best, with superb character development, a dynamic script and excellent casting, right down to the bit players. A true labor of love. An interesting side note is that Italian director Sergio Leone may have taken notes from Alfred Hitchcock's films, and incorporated them into his western series, as there is, most definitely, a black comedy side to this classic that will stick with you for awhile. Indeed! Best line goes to Eli Wallach, delivered while he is in a bathtub(!) no less.... ""If you're going to shoot, shoot! Don't talk!"" See to believe, if you haven't already.",10
26 March 2020,wonderful!!!,"The three-hour plot is not only procrastinating, but also lively. The characters are full of image and clear personality. Definitely the best work in westerns. Incorporating the elements of the Civil War, the film's intention was enhanced, and the depth of thinking increased, without losing a relaxed and humorous atmosphere.

1 January 2009,"Impressive western, masterful music","So I have seen my first classic Western finally. This is a genre I tried my best to avoid. I am more into thrillers. But this one was special.

The plot is interesting in itself. 3 men are determined to get to the cash box that was buried under the ground in a certain place(trying my best not to reveal the plot here!). The excitement is in watching the many twists unfold. The characters are known as Blondie, Tuco and Angel eyes. The real names of the characters are not revealed here. We come to know a little more about Tuco in the course of the movie. It could be said that Tuco is the central character in this movie as he appears in most of the movie. The plot moves throughout America and they go in search of the cash box even to war torn areas. The story is set in the late 1800's during the civil war. So the movie also effectively works as an anti-war movie as well.

The most impressive thing about this movie is the great music by the legend Ennio Morricone. This might be the best ever music I have ever heard in movies. Maybe that's an exaggeration but surely this is one of the best. The music in the scene where Tuco searches frantically for the cash box is filmed brilliantly and the music builds into a crescendo at the end of the scene. Another aspect that impressed me is the beautiful cinematography in certain scenes of the movie. The long shots showing the beauty of the place are absolutely breathtaking. The war scenes are shot well and I was surprised to hear about the budget. With this budget I was surprised to see the advanced effects and the meticulous depiction of the war.

I also came to understand a few things about a part of history I didn't know - the American Civil war. The bridge destruction scene is also another one I totally loved. The closeups of the character's faces is also another feature that I liked specifically about the movie - especially when they are actors with such great screen presence such as Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach. I have never thought of Clint Eastwood as particularly good looking or talented. But this movie proved me wrong. His performance as the calm bounty hunter with a sense of humour enhanced his image considerably in my eyes. His quiet sexiness is something I have never seen in other movies of his(Maybe I am biased because I saw only his newer movies). Lee Van Cleef is notable for his portrayal of the villain. Eli Wallach's portrayal of the crooked and funny Tuco is IMO one of the best characters in movies ever. His line ""When you want to shoot, shoot, don't talk"" has become one of my favourite quotes as well.

Finally this movie has encouraged me to seek out more ""Sphagetti Westerns"" and regular classic Westerns as well. The movie is quite a classic and is highly recommended for all movie fans because it is more of an exciting adventure movie with beautiful camera-work than a Western.

4 May 2020,True hero,"This movie is classic because of his brilliant, logical and no lack of black humor plot. The good guy must win in the end. But the true and highly expressive storyline achieved the pinnacle of Eastwood's western hero image.

1 March 2023,Best-looking Westerns ever made.,"I'll make it short: it's simply one of the funniest and best-looking Westerns ever made. Director Sergio Leone's unique use of camera - long, continuous shots at wide angles with extreme close-ups - and Ennio Morricone's unique, highly imaginative soundtrack blend to perfection. The story is exciting. There is never a dull moment. The movie is long, but Leoni's direction is so good that one can enjoy this movie for three hours. If you haven't seen this movie, rent it. If ever there was a perfect Western, this is it. Not just a great western, but one of the best movies of *any* genre. This is a film of epic proportions; It's funny and violent, but has a strong anti-war message underneath.

7 December 2014,The Best Western Ever Made,"This movie is a legend. It changed the way we look at westerns. It's been endlessly imitated and parodied, but never equaled. It made Clint Eastwood a household name. And yet, as I watch The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I can't help but feel a little sad knowing that what is perhaps the greatest of all westerns was made in Italy. Yes, this is one of the much-maligned spaghetti westerns, but it's as far above the average entry in its genre as Star Wars is to Starship Troopers, or A Hard Day's Night to Spiceworld.

Surely we're all familiar with the basics of the story. The mysterious gunman Blondie (Eastwood), the rough hewn bandit Tuco (Eli Wallach), and the heartless killer Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) search the west for a hidden cache of gold, as the Civil War rages around them. There are countless twists, turns and betrayals, as each man realizes he can't do this on his own. You can't be sure of anything, except that before the adventure is over, there's going to be one hell of a showdown.

Sergio Leone has done an exceptional job of writing and directing. There's not one line of unnecessary dialog, in fact there's no dialog at all for many long stretches. And not since High Noon has a movie been as successful at slowly building tension. Of course in High Noon, the entire movie was buildup, until the final shootout. Here, Leone gradually builds tension in a scene, and then provides a stylistically violent payoff again and again.

Nowhere does he do it better than in the final standoff, where each of the three leading characters have a gun trained on one of the others. They each know that whoever wins here will walk away one of the richest men in the west, but they're also aware that pulling the trigger has a very good chance of getting both them and their target killed. And yet, if two of them where to ally themselves against the third. We in the audience are also fully aware of these facts, but the movie gives us no clue as to who will come out the loser.

Leone has also produced something that is a true feast for the senses. Through use of long unbroken shots, he shows the vastness, solitude, and desolate beauty of the west. Mesas, canyon lands, endless sand dunes, and scrub forest are all lavishly photographed, as the wind whistles and dust flies on the breeze. His sunrises and sunsets are works of art. Looking at this movie, it's easy to forget that it was filmed in Europe.

Leone has also added quirky touches, like the legless veteran who hangs out at the local saloon, quite literally dragging himself up to the counter, or the Union colonel obsessed with destroying the bridge he's supposed to guard, so there won't be anything fighting over and he can go home. Of course it's not just the director who's responsible a movie's success or failure. The actors matter as well, and much credit is due the leading men for their brilliant performances.

Clint Eastwood has long been one of my favorite actors, and this is by far one of his best pieces of acting. As Blondie, he's as tough as nails, utterly cool under fire, and one of the most mysterious figures since Jeff Costello. There's little of his past; he's in a rather unique partnership with Tuco at the film's beginning, and there's a history with Angel Eyes, but we get no idea where he's from, or what life he led before becoming an outlaw. He doesn't talk much either, preferring to puff on his cigarette. But he clearly follows some form of personal code, and there's no doubt that he's one of- if not the- best gunmen in the west.

Cleef's Angel Eyes is much more straightforward; he's the very embodiment of evil. This man has no qualms about killing. Indeed, he seems to relish causing death and suffering for its own sake, as when he smothers an elderly employer to death with a pillow, or carries out his iron-fisted rule of a Union prison camp. His every word drips with menace, and his smile is like gazing up death itself.

But the most interesting character just might be Eli Wallach's Tuco. He's got a rap sheet a mile long, and he goes to great lengths to carry out his revenge on Blondie, but he doesn't have the same aura of menace as Angel Eyes. He lies, cheats, steals, and sometimes kills, but not so much because he's evil as because he has no concept of morality. He's also funniest guy on the screen. In one scene he's all sweet talk, your best pal; not that he's believable for a second. The next minute he's launching a hilarious obscenity-laced rant against you and your family. Tuco's reunion with his brother- a priest! - is one of the best comedy scenes in any western. There are other comedic touches as well, like the legless veteran who hangs around the saloons, walking on his arms, or the Union commander bent on destroying the bridge he's tasked with protecting so that the fighting will end.

It's also refreshing how few clichés there are. There's no extraneous love interest, no Indian attacks or stampedes, and you never hear anyone shouting about ""gathering up a posse."" There is talking killer, but he's only a bit player, and Tuco lectures him on why you shouldn't talk when you can shoot- after shooting him, of course

Between the acting, the action, the characters, the production values, and the originality, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is an achievement to rival the best of John Ford. Any fan of westerns, and anyone who enjoys good film should watch this one. It is truly one of the great movies.",10
15 February 2001,"Way, Way, WAY too long","The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (Sergio Leone, 1967)

There are a number of great things about this movie. The first ten minutes. The last ten minutes. The theme music, which has come to be synonymous with the American west. Lee van Cleef, who was great in every role he ever played.

And then there was the middle hundred sixty minutes.

There's an odd tendency among filmmakers to take a razor-thin plot and stretch it far too long. Such is the case here, with the plot being a race between the Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood), a hired gun named Angel Eyes (van Cleef), and the Man with No Name's on-again off-again sidekick Tuco (Eli Wallach) to find a cache of stolen gold during the Civil War. This plot meanders for two and three-quarters hours before getting on track, and that's about an hour and three-quarters too long. The subplots are never developed, nor are the characters. Tuco switches allegiances every ten minutes. After a while, it gets just plain boring.

Definitely could have used a good editor. Eastwood's westerns got better with age (his, not theirs); Unforgiven and Pale Rider are better, tighter films. **",4
31 August 2022,"Absolutely best, keep re-watching it over the years","Watching every scene is scripted, shot and acted makes me think of a perfect art form, where nothing can be added or subtracted. Add to this a perfect score.

Every actor, not just Clint Eastwood , is perfectly casted . When i see any of them in other films i cant think of them as anything other than what they portrayed in this one.

For example, when desert scenes are shown, i feel the dust, the sun and my lips parched, feel like dying from the thirst.

And, of course the final 3 minutes scene of the shoot-out can be deservedly called a short movie in and of itself A++++

I re watch it every few years.

8 June 2017,"There's some good in this movie, even greatness, but also some bad and ugly","Released in 1966 and directed by Sergio Leone, ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" stars Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach as the titular three men (respectively) who are after hidden gold, buried in a Civil War cemetery somewhere. Of course, none of these men trust each other and the Civil War happens to be raging around them.

There's no question that Leone created a different filmic genre by melding the hysterically overdone Italo grand opera with Spanish picaresque convention. A Spanish term, Picaro means ""rogue"" or ""rascal"", and the picaresque yarn is usually sardonic, featuring the misadventures of roguish protagonists of low stature who live by their wits in a crooked world, and told with realistic and humorous detail. Here 'Blondie' (Eastwood) and Tuco (Wallach) are the two picaros, who have stumbled upon a way to make good money claiming bounty rewards for Tuco's many sins.

Someone criticized the film on the grounds that the geography doesn't look anything like the actual landscapes where these Civil War events occurred. Wrong. The events in the film take place in extreme West Texas and the New Mexican Territory. ""Santa Fe"" is even mentioned a couple of times. When Angel Eyes meets Baker, his employer, near the beginning it's in El Paso, which is 250 miles south of Santa Fe. The topography of Almería, Spain, is an acceptable geographical substitute.

Admittedly this Spaghetti Western is overrated, overlong and has some slow stretches, not to mention amoral & one-dimensional characters and a story that idolizes lucre above everything; it also has campy and goofy elements, which kills any realism. But, if you can handle all that, Eastwood is the coolest Westerner, Lee Van Cleef is the ultimate bad axx, the exceptional score by Ennio Morricone is iconic and the film pulsates with hip style (for 1966, that is). In short, there's some good in this movie, even greatness, which explains the ridiculous gushing of some reviewers; but, let's be honest, there's also some bad and ugly.

Director Leone strained to explain the theme: ""We all have some bad in us, some ugliness, some good. And there are people who appear to be ugly, but when we get to know them better, we realize that they are more worthy."" One reviewer took this and claimed that each of the three protagonists embody the three parts of human nature with Tuco representing the id (i.e. the ""flesh"") and Blondie representing the ego (i.e. the mind with its power of volition). Okay, that fits. But then he tried to argue that Angel Eyes (Van Cleef) represents the superego, which goes to show that he didn't understand this structural model of the psyche seeing as how the superego is the idealistic, heroic side of human nature (aka the ""spirit"") and Angel Eyes in the movie is anything BUT.

The film runs 163 minutes (the version I viewed) and was shot in Burgos, Granada, Almería & Colmenar Viejo, Spain, with interiors done in Rome. The screenplay was written by Leone & Luciano Vincenzoni with the additions of Agenore Incrocci & Furio Scarpelli.

29 May 2020,They're all Bad and Ugly!,"Well, there's 3 hours I will never get back! I really didn't see the point to the whole film and was it a western or a war film? It wasn't very good at being either.

I thought the soundtrack was great, but maybe that's because I know it so well. But what was up with the vocal track? The lips didn't sync properly for anyone!

I have to say that Eli Wallach did a great job in this film and deserved the main credit and a much better script and storyline.

My favourite bit was when Clint Eastwood was playing with a kitten. It was the only bit of the long and drawn out film that didn't make me yawn or sigh whilst checking to see how long it was before it would finish.

At least I can scratch it off of my bucket list poster now!",2
23 March 2020,The best western,"The three hour plot is not tardy, it's full of fun. All the characters are full-bodied with distinct personalities. It's definitely the best work in western movies. With the elements of civil war, the intention of the film can be improved, the depth of thinking can be increased, and a relaxed and humorous atmosphere can be filled.

While I can't say for sure, I'm pretty sure that there is no reason for why this movie is 3 hours long. If a movie is going to be that long then there should be things happening. Anything. Dialogue. Characters moving around. Literally anything of interest whatsoever.

8 December 2013,Greatness is Measured by the Number Bullets Your Six Gun Holds,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

8 September 2013,Greatest Film Ever Made.,"Clint Eastwood returns as the mysterious wandering gunfighter & bounty hunter ""The Man With No Name"" (AKA ""The Good""), along with Lee Van Cleef as evil gunfighter & bounty hunter ""Angel Eyes"" (AKA ""The Bad"") & finally Eli Wallach as bandit and lowlife ""Tuco"" (AKA ""The Ugly"") in Sergio Leone's brilliantly directed, unbelievably stylish, compelling, & mesmerizing finale to his ""Dollars"" trilogy, with an unforgettable, influential score by Mr. Morricone.

Story has the three men looking for buried confederate gold in a cemetery, and the long, winding path it takes to get there. Though long, it is never overlong, being an amazingly involving story of three ruthless yet disparate men. Performances are perfect, script filled with funny & memorable lines, and climax in the cemetery, both the 'Ecstasy Of Gold' & ' Final Showdown' the perfect cinematic experience, so memorably does it combine character, story, direction, and score.

My favorite film of all time, which stands up to repeated viewings. (I lost count!)",10
6 March 2007,"Except for music, Wallach, and Van Cleef, how not to make a Western","This isn't the worst of the spaghetti films, but it is a terrible films. If you don't know what a spaghetti film is, it means, great exciting music trying to make up for a weak stupid plot, uninteresting, unlikable characters, silly comic book style gunfights, terrible writing, terrible directing, and slow paced boredom. This film isn't a complete bomb because of the efforts of some of the actors. It's no secret that Eastwood wasn't a gifted actor, and he had to be surrounded by superior actors such as Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. Those two, and the supporting cast almost make this bearable. It involves three men. One is good, one is bad, and one is the guy who took your last girlfriend away from you. But which is which? The film literally has to tell you. Eastwood is supposed to be good, but the only two not completely vicious things he does are try to save a handicapped from hanging (so he can take him to be executed again), and offering a dying soldier a puff from his cigar-not trying to stop his bleeding or even give him some pain killer, but to just do a cigarette commercial in the middle of a movie. There's no reason to care about him at all. In fact, the guy who stole your girlfriend comes across as almost sympathetic (almost.) The plot is the three are after a decent amount of gold. The trouble they go through, they could've much easier just stolen that much cash somewhere is. So the plot is ludicrous. The characters are just an example of that era's movie making in which movie makers tried to outdo each other with evil characters. Billed as anti-heroes, they don't come close to filling that role. True anti-heroes are self absorbed, maybe somewhat selfish, probably anti-social, such as in ""Hombre"", ""The Lost Continent"", and the Edmond O'Brien version of ""DOA"". These guys are just vicious punks who you would not want to be your boss, your law enforcement official, your anything. That said, there is some great music, which doesn't match up at all with the mundane events and characters. The shootout scenes are ridiculous, probably comical, and unfortunately they paved the way for a multitude of later movies that copied these inferior techniques. For exciting shootouts you really need to go way back before these movies, or to more modern movies that know better. This cannot be construed in any way as a good movie, much less a classic. You will be bored to tears if you let one of these guys talk you into watching it. These are the same guys who would take you on a snipe hunt.",3
28 March 2020,Great.,"The western movie ""the good, the bad and the ugly"", the character each image plump, the personality is bright. Absolutely the best western movie ever made. The incorporation of elements from the civil war gives the film a heightened sense of purpose, depth of thought, and a sense of humor.The second half of the film focuses on the various elements that captivate the audience in the western films: the carefully designed gunfights, the runaways and chases in the valley, and the final duels between good and evil all bring a strong form of movement and rhythm to the previous plots.

28 November 1999,Best Film ABOUT the Civil War Ever Made,"During his 25 years as a director, Sergio Leone directed only eleven films. Remarkably, eight rate a 7.0 or better among IMDB members, and five are the on the IMDB Top 250 film all time best list! GB&U is the highest rated of Leone films by IMDB subscribers. GB&U is also the final segment of the most successful western trilogy ever made, the ""man with no name"" series; though GB&U is a prequel to the first film, A FISTFULL OF DOLLARS. Narratively, I've always felt GB&U is the weakest of the series. However, now that I have seen the DVD version with the excised scenes, I believe it is the strongest. Two scenes in particular tie the film together. The first, and most crucial, is a scene where Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) visits a battle-damaged Confederate fort and is told the best place to find ""Bill Carson"" (if he is alive) is in the Union P.O.W. camp. So Angel Eyes appearance later in the film at the camp as the chief jailer makes sense. The second excised scene shows Tuco (Eli Wallach) taking the horribly dehydrated Blondie (Clint Eastwood) to the nearest confederate camp, and finding out the mission where his brother lives is nearby. Now, Tuco's assuming the identity of ""Bill Carson"" makes much more sense.

I can still quibble with some other shortcomings of the film. Lee Van Cleef did such a terrific job as a the heroic Colonel Mortimer in the previous film in the trilogy, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, it is almost impossible to accept him here as the cold- blooded killer Angel Eyes (Could the name be referring to the ""Angel of Death?"" The narrative never explains.) Second, though Eastwood's hair is blonde in highlights, the name ""Blondie"" seems rather arbitrary and, again, jarring. Still, these are minor quibbles about a film and a series that transformed westerns completely. The influence of the ""Man With No Name"" series can be found in virtually every great western made since.

Though the narrative is, on the surface, about three incredibly ruthless men pursuing $200,000 across a landscape of the Civil War, GB&U's underlying agenda is ""anti-war"", particularly the Vietnam War. The film makes these points effectively without being offensively preachy.

Critics of the time criticized the film for ""putting a desert in the middle of the South."" What a crock! Although not in the

center of the War Between the States, quite a bit of action took place in New Mexico and Texas, and the film's writers even got the generals' names right!

This is the handsomest of all of Leone's films, and that's saying a lot. The art direction and set decoration are particularly impressive, down to the mortars, gatling guns and naval-style artillary of the time. Amazingly, CLEOPATRA, made four years before, cost almost 30 times as much! Never before or since have I seen so much of the budget up there on the screen.

If you plan to see this film, make sure you watch it on a DVD with additional scenes. You will need to turn on the English subtitles, since the cheap distributors didn't bother to hire ""sound-alikes"" to dub these ""fill-in"" scenes. Hopefully, CRITERION will one day release a restored version of this films with the additional scenes inserted in the film where they belong. After seeing the additional scenes, I raised my rating of the film from a ""7"" to a ""9"". THAT'S how important they are.",9

22 November 2021,"A classic, a masterpiece","I saw it for the first time when I was a kid and I was fascinated, then as I got older my fascination only increased. Altogether I must have watched it at least 15 to 20 times, until I got tired nowadays I can't anymore, I saturate it, even because it's a very old movie, it got dated, even with all its mastery.

For those who have never seen it, it is highly recommended, even though it is dated. Try to watch the movie knowing it was made 55 years ago, overlook the perfect shots and some funny expressions of the characters, the story is very good, it takes place during the American Civil War, a dying soldier buries 200 thousand dollars in gold and three men will go after this treasure, with the whole war scene in the background.

The soundtrack of this movie can be considered without a doubt one of the best three in the entire history of cinema, and it alone is worth the movie. Who has never seen a Metallica concert opening with ""Ecstasy of Gold"". So it is... In addition, great performances by a young Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef, added to a majestic direction by Sergio Leone.

Without a doubt, a 10/10 movie, one of the best of my entire life, even though I was already saturated.",10
15 June 2007,probably the best western ever made,"i first saw this film in about 2003. i had seen A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE on the television and i thought they were really good so i decided to buy them on DVD. Searching the shops for them i found that they came in a box set with a third film, THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY. I hadn't seen THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY at the time but I liked the first two so I thought that I would buy the whole box set, as that was all that was available at the time. What I didn't realise until after I watched all three was how great THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY was and I thought that the first two were good. it turned out that THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY was the best of the three. THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY was probably the only film I had ever bought on DVD without having seen it before and I'm SO glad I did. This film is excellent and although i have seen it many times it still stands up well after multiple viewings. it may be nearly three hours long but it is never boring. all the elements work so well (music, acting, dialogue, setting etc...) i can't really find fault in it. i liked it so much i bought the special edition DVD just to see the extra footage incorporated into the film. if you've not seen this, then rent it because i guarantee you'll soon be buying it shortly afterwards",10
8 August 2009,Superbly Atmospheric,This is one those films that most people could watch today and it wouldn't matter that it was made over forty years ago. For me it is almost three hours of excellent entertainment. I watch it every now and then but not obsessively. It is like an old reliable friend who comes round and is completely welcome. You know how pleasurable it is going to be while the friend is around and you enjoy the company immensely. You can watch this film twenty times and still notice something which you had missed previously. I enjoy this film for how it is I am not concerned or irritated by the historical errors or any other errors which may have been made. It is just so atmospheric you can almost feel the emotions on screen. In order to appreciate it more maybe you should watch the other two films first 'a fistful of dollars' and 'a few dollars more' but only because they were made in that order. There is violence in the film but the mere fact that the action is set during the American Civil War period is enough of a guide as to the content. In conclusion it is visual treat and is one of the best films ever made. Please watch it and enjoy the experience.,10
19 May 2020,A timeless classic,"What can you say about this movie that hasn't been said already?

28 October 2020,My favorite movie of all time,"Where do I even begin talking about this movie? This is the movie that made me interested in movies in the first place, and to this day I've not been able to find a movie that resonnates better with me. I'm astonished how well this movie holds up, even after 50 years, and it's almost a bit depressing when you think about how unappreciated it was at the time of its release. Fortunately, it has since then gained more recognition, and is widely regared as one of the greatest movies ever made, and in my opinion, the single best movie ever made.

From the opening credits you know you're about to watch something special. The iconic theme combined with the visuals that tell their own tale make for arguably one of the most entertaining opening credits. Then, we're immediately thrown into the action, as three bounty hunters try to hunt down Tuco, The Ugly, after a tense scene where they walk towards each other, leading you to believe that a duel between them is about to commence.. Speaking of which, Tucos introduction is practically perfect. In just one shot, we know almost everything there is to know about the character, by looking at his expression and the things he carries in his hands. Angel Eyes's (The Bad) and Blondie's (The Good) introductions are also incredibly good, quickly establishing the nature of the characters and how we will come to view them throughout the movie.

One of the things one must keep in mind when watching this movie, is that Sergio Leone prioritizes the individual scene instead of an intricately crafted story. What this results in is that EVERY SINGLE SCENE is a work of art, complete with suspense, it's own pacing and most important of all: the gorgeous cinematography that defines this movie. This means that every scene in this movie is iconic in some way, and it is in my opinion the movie's greatest strength.

The characters in this movie are very cleverly constructed in my opinion, and while I can understand people complaining about some being bland, I think they work perfectly for this movie. Blondies backstory is left ambigous, though one can't help but wonder what other adventures he has been on. He isn't very outspoken, and this gives him that iconic feeling of mysteriousness. Tuco IS given a rich backstory, expressed both in his conversation with his brother and his hanging scene at the beginning, where the sheriff lists up everything he has done. He's by far the most entertaining character in the movie, constantly talking and goofing around. Then there's Angel Eyes, which similar to Blondie doesn't have a backstory, but his tenacity and charisma as the ultimate villain more than makes up for it. The side characters are also generally very good, even though they rarely get more than one scene.

The themes of this movie generally revolves around morality and greed, and I love how it's not shoved in your face with unnecessary dialogue, but rather subtly shown through how the characters approach different situations. I also like how the three main characters are very similar in the beginning, but start to show their differences once they experience more and more of the Civil War and its cruelties. Angel Eyes, being truly evil, uses it for profit and to satisfy his need for violence and money. Tuco's approach is similar , but he doesn't have the charisma needed to benefit of the war, and so chooses a more pacifistic way of dealing with it. The difference is clearest with blondie, who start the movie as an immoral bounty hunter, but through seeing the cruel reality of the war he becomes a more merciful man, which culminates in how he spares Tuco's life at the very end, despite everything Tuco did to him.

If there has ever been a movie in which the director and composer has worked together in perfect harmony, this is it. As opposed to regular movies, Leone and Morricone sat down before filming to create the themes, before adjusting the actual shots to the music. This is in my opinion the movie where Morricone transformed into a composer god. Every theme is perfect, from the iconic main theme, to The Story of a Soldier, to The Ecstasy of Gold and The Trio. The music and action blends together perfectly to the point that the movie becomes an entirely different one without the score.

It's time to talk about the finale, the climax, the peak of tension. The entire movie has been building up to this: Tuco arrives at the cementary, and for 4 minutes the only thing happening is him looking for the grave he believes the 200.000 dollars in gold is buried. This scene is carried entirely by the score, the iconic Ecstasy of Gold theme. Then Blondie and Angel Eyes show up to the cementary. As it's revealed that Tuco's information about the spesific grave is false, they realize that only Blondie knows which grave it's buried in, and so begins the single best climactic showoff in ANY movie. Three men, all exceptionally skilled with their guns, stands in a circle, and for 5 minutes the only thing moving is the score, Morricone's The Trio, which builds suspense as it rises in power and greatness. There is no dialogue, yet the facial expressions and the editing still tells a compelling story in which the characters all try to figure out who will shoot first. As the music suddenly stops, Angel Eyes draws, only for Blondie to shoot him first, but only to injure. As Angel Eyes attempts to shoot Blondie again, he is shot and killed, and so ends the story of The Bad. Tuco and Blondie then digs up the gold, and we get a final showcase of Blondie's character arc: after ordering Tuco to put his head in a noose and riding off, he reappears and severs the rope, leaving Tuco alive. Then he rides away, The Good, The Man with no Name, to the iconic theme that introduced the movie in the first place.",10
15 May 2021,The fact that this was directd in 1966 says it all,"I cant believe the quality of performance I just watched. This is incredible, every character plays such an important rol and its so well acted, you simply cant even choose who did it better but in my opinion Tuco's performance was captivating and Eastwood's is simply iconic. Even 45 years later, I was able to watch this movie and enjoy every part of it. If you havent watched it for whatever reason, stop wasting your time.

Considered one of the best films of all time by many, the good, the bad and the ugly stands the test of time as a hilarious, witty, edgy and exciting classic that will go down in history as a masterpiece.

30 April 2008,The Definitive western....,"A truly magnificent 3 hour long tale of three bandits, on the trail of half a million dollars in stolen confederate gold. Clint Eastwood is Blondie, a mercenary gunman who partners up with the Mexican bandit Tucco (Eli Wallach) to play a con on several different western towns. Tucco plays the part of captured bandit, Blondie the part of bounty hunter who has captured the wanted criminal. Subsequently he collects the reward, and Tucco is to be hung. But being a con, naturally Blondie just shoots Tuccon down off the hangman's rope, and into the sunset they ride to their next con job. Into the fray rides Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef playing the role to menacing perfection), a ruthless killer on the trail of the stolen gold after two of the thieves turn on each other, both hiring Angel Eyes to murder the other. He may be a ruthless killer, but he does have a perverted sense of honor, and thus fulfills both contracts, but not before one of the men tells him the story of the stolen gold, and whom he should seek out to get it, another thief in on the heist, who has now joined up with the Confederate army. As the broad backdrop of the Civil War rages on, we are given a microcosm of the conflict with not two, but three competing sides. What's interesting here is the dichotomy of the characters being almost mirror images of one another. Each a skilled gunman, and proficient killer. However, what separates the three is the degree of morality each has; Blondie killing only when necessary, when he's confronted with no other choice. Tucco kills for convenience, his life of crime has made him many enemies, so he's often faced with the end result, those out for revenge. But Tucco has a softer side, and we see several revelations about his upbringing that place him in a somewhat more heroic light than he first comes across as. Finally, there's Angel Eyes, a demonic killer with no empathy, sympathy or moral direction. He's out to get everything in life for himself, and will sell out anyone that tries to stop him. He delights in torture, but seldom sullies his own hands. He prefers to let others do the dirty work, and enjoys the spoils. I really think he's a representation of the Devil. Someone that enjoys manipulating, killing and causing chaos. A being totally involved with the pleasures of life regardless of the cost to others. The film's climax with a Mexican standoff is priceless, and the entire film is a enjoyable, riveting experience that should be on the beginners list for Western film viewing. Interestingly enough, it is so deep and nuanced, it can easily go onto an Experts list for WEstern viewing as well.",10
22 February 2023,perfect in its own way in everything.,"Iconic like few others, it is definitely my favorite western and objectively I consider that it is also the best of all, it is raw, slow and makes you tense when he sets his mind to it, Sergio Leone controls the times like few directors are capable of, he directs you where he wants and the characters are legendary, they all have their particular mystique and the last 30 minutes of the film are enjoyable on their own. No context. Simply letting yourself be carried away by the betrayal and the memorable performances that will transport you with epic and iconic music to one of the most shocking scenes in cinema.

12 February 2007,The good the bad and the ugly,"A pure western.Will always be remembered for its great music and the personality of Clint Eastwood.In fact this was the film in which Clint Eastwood made his name.

Both Lee Van Cleef & Eli Wallach put in sterling performances.The direction is exceptional The real merit of this movie is that it brings to light the exact situation in the USA around the period 1864-65 when the confederates were losing the war.There was confusion & chaos all around & no real authority.Hence the proliferation of a number of bandits and outlaws.

The photography and direction are breathtaking and there is areal attempt to bring out the characters of those who dominated the period.Life could be extinguished at any moment & a man had to live by his wits and by his guns.Women were fair game to any outlaw.Hanging and capital punishment were routine

This was the real United States of that period and they could practice this culture in isolation,as the communication & technologies of the period were highly limited compared to today.",9

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

26 March 2020,a brief evaluation,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters.

9 February 2007,"Best of the trilogy, Leone at his best","By a fair margin, the greatest out of the spaghetti western films, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a cinematic triumph that will always be remembered most of all for the legendary score and stand off scene. What surprised me most of all was that a long film with quite a slow pace to it actually appeared to move quite quickly; this is thanks to Leone's superior direction and the frequent change of locations within the film. Clint Eastwood's iconic status was firmly established in this film as a bad ass desperado with compulsory cigar attached, Blondie makes Dirty Harry appear meagre in comparison! Whilst the characterisation provided by the supporting cast was over the top to an almost comic book standard, their performances and characters were still memorable and enjoyable as they provided a stark contrast to Eastwood's quiet loner.

Where a lot of westerns fall short is the plot, they tend to become a victim of style over substance but this film is an exception as it provides us with a fairly intricate plot. The way Tuco's (Wallach) murderous intentions regarding Blondie are quashed by the fact that Blondie knows the secret of the treasure, leading to Tuco fighting to keep him alive rather than kill him, is very commendable. The tie in with the American civil war is very enjoyable and provides some further tension and heightens the predicament that the main characters are in, especially considering Angle Eyes (Cleef) is a high rank in the Unionist regiment that Eastwood and Wallach have infiltrated. The tension is built up fairly well, even though it requires patience. The final stand off, for instance, takes a matter of minutes for the main characters to get in their positions with the camera ranging from extreme close ups to the characters' eyes to shots that appear to be a mile away. Whilst this sounds potentially frustrating, it induces overwhelming anticipation and once again, the music comes in to play, setting up a true piece of cinematic history.

Whilst there are no award winning performances on show, the leads are very good. Eastwood played greatly on his tough guy image and manages to tell us a lot about the character despite not saying much. Eastwood illustrates fantastically, a character devoid of trust and sentiment but also a character of great honour. It is plain to see that Blondie is world weary and he knows that it's kill or be killed. Eli Wallach is very good, probably the best performance in the film. His animated performance brings his character to life as a thoroughly dislikeable loudmouth who is too stupid to avoid trouble but greedy enough not to let his desire to kill Blondie stopping him get the treasure. Lee Van Cleef is even more dislikeable because where Wallach's Tuco is untrustworthy, Cleef's Angel Eyes is brutally honest with ruthlessness to match. The interrogation scenes in the Union camp really highlight this nature and makes sure that the audience knows he means business. The best thing about these characters is that they all flawed, it's not all black and white. Even Eastwood's 'The Good' is not all that good.

Laced with brilliant set pieces and memorable performances, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is very memorable and definitely a classic. Watching Wallach hunt Eastwood with his cigar stubs proves the film had a sense of humour but that didn't take away the fact that the film depicts a life of brutality where not even women and children are safe when they stand between power hungry men and their goal. Effective story telling mixed with macabre imagery assures this films place in cinema history and possibly even the title of the best western ever made.",8
21 December 2013,An absolute classic which is rightly hailed as being one of the greatest films of all time,"Having been hugely impressed with Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America and having enjoyed previous Clint Eastwood westerns, I finally decided to sit down and watch the Good, the Bad and the Ugly. My expectations were high as this film currently has an IMDb rating of 9.0 and is ranked as the 5th best film of all time (according to IMDb). Needless to say, my expectations for this film weren't just met, but they were exceeded.

The film basically follows Angel Eyes (Van Cleef) Blondie (Eastwood) and Tuco (Wallach) who are all trying to find some missing coins which are worth $200,000. Initially, it is only Angel Eyes that is aware of the hidden loot, but after Tuco has a chance encounter with an injured and rather thirsty Bill Bryson (who happens to be the man that Angel Eyes is looking for) Bill Bryson informs Tuco that he will tell him where the coins are hidden as long as he gives him water - he tells him which graveyard it is hidden in, but not the name of the gravestone. Desperate to find out which gravestone the coins are hidden in, Tuco obliges and runs to get water. However, in the few minutes that he is gone Bryson dies and tells a worn out Blondie the name of the gravestone where the loot is hidden. Reluctantly, Tuco decides to nurse Blondie back to health so that he can take him to the gravestone where the loot is hidden. Tuco had been punishing Blondie due to the fact that Blondie double crossed him earlier.

There are so may things to praise this film about; firstly we have that fantastic Ennio Morricone score - I loved his music in Once Upon a Time in America and was equally impressed with the score in this film. Who can also forget the iconic signature tune which is played in the opening credits and several times throughout this film? Just brilliant.

Then we come to the acting, Van Cleef, Eastwood and Wallach were all fantastic - check out the scene between Van Cleef and the guy that he intimidates at the start of the film. There is no dialogue between the men for a number of minutes as the 2 men just fix each other with icy stares- sometimes the best way to create atmosphere and tension is to use the 'less is more' approach and that perfectly sums up the first 10-15 minutes of this film. Eastwood was also fantastic and I feel that he is at his best when he plays the 'tough gunslinger'. He's a great actor and I feel that nobody combines grit and coolness quite like Clint. Wallach was also fantastic in the role of a fairly dumb outlaw. I thought he was convincing in this role and thought he was a really funny character.

For me, the biggest strength of this film lies with Eastwood and Wallach and for the most part it is them that this film belongs to. The continual point scoring and 'one oneupmanship' between the 2 men was hilarious to watch. They both share great on screen chemistry and that for me is one of the main reasons that TGTBATU works so well. Another strength is in the story telling. You are constantly left guessing throughout the film and as a viewer you are never quite sure what is going to happen next which certainly made sure the film held my interest throughout. Although this film is quite long it never felt drawn out and pretty much every scene was relevant in advancing the plot. The film culminates in a rather tense finale which proved to be a great ending to a great film.

TGTBATU is an absolute classic and is a film that I would recommend to everyone.",9
28 March 2009,Excellent Movie,"I only hear good things about The Good, The Bad & The Ugly. But I think that those things are not enough. This movie only gets better each time you watch it. It has an excellent plot, well crafted characters and all the other details that makes this movie so incredible.

It might not be the most accurate motion picture regarding that period of time, but its essence is not based on that. The other elements make this film one of the greatest movie of all times and definitely must watch before you die.

I can't believe that some people rated this film with only one star since this film deserves at least 7 (only if you hated the movie) but in the end it is all a matter of subjectivity.

They don't make films like this anymore..

27 April 2004,Great classic!,"Until I saw The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, I didn't know what the `big deal' was about spaghetti westerns, Sergio Leone or Clint Eastwood for that matter. After seeing this film, the proverbial `light bulb' came up over my head, and I understand the iconic imagery attributed to the genre, the director and the actor.

In terms of plot, it's quite simple  stay alive and be the first to get the gold. What turns probably an hour's worth of plot into three hours of film are the atmospheric touches  the vast expanse of the `frontier', and the many, MANY extended scenes of men looking at one another over and over again. I don't say this as a criticism of Leone, rather it is quite a compliment. To be entertained for three hours by a western is amazing, and I was entertained in spades. I loved seeing actors that I have long associated with different kinds of roles in this film  I know Lee Van Cleef as a B-movie guy from the fifties, later the Kung Fu guy, and Eli Wallach has always been Don Altobello for me. I loved a lot of the stylistic elements, such as the freeze frame with the nicknames appearing next to the character, the extreme close-ups, and the fantastic music.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film and am really glad I finally got a chance to see it. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly makes me want to explore the other spaghetti westerns of the era. Its reputation was very warranted.

2 June 2005,Leone's moment of perfection!,"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, stars Clint Eastwood as Blondie, Eli Wallach as Tuco, and Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes.

This movie is a masterpiece, and represents the qualities that good movies should exhibit. It's written with an interesting story, great character development, great character interaction, and great production values.

This movie is about 3 gunslingers who at times work together, or against each other in search of a bountiful treasure hidden in a secluded cemetery. At different points of the movie, Blondie and Tuco work together, then betray each other, then come to work together again. At other points of the movie, Angel Eyes works together with Blondie, leaving Tuco as the out man.

The story begins before Tuco and Blondie meet up. After meeting, they then work together to collect bounties on Tuco who is worth $1000s. The team can split the bounties as they move territory to territory scamming the law. With each new town, Blondie collects the bounty, then saves Tuco from actually being put to death, then they divide up the bounty.

Problems begin as greed sets in. With in a short time, Blondie abandons Tuco after rescuing him, even after Tuco warned him to never betray him and leave him alive. Eventually, the roles are reversed, and it is Tuco who abuses Blondie and nearly causes his death.

But this is where the story takes a major twist, as a run away wagon with a nearly dead passenger reveals secrets of a treasure, but each Tuco and the half dead Blondie only learn a vital part of the secret from. So now Tuco must save Blondie to get to the treasure.

The story continues from there, and we get to learn quite a bit about the characters. Especially Tuco, in my opinion Leone purposely allowed us to see that indeed there were no defined roles as who was ""the good"", ""the bad"", and ""the ugly"". Greed is very powerful, especially when life is such a struggle to begin with.

The final showdown is unbelievable. It is epic, and is absolutely worth anything to see. It's the pinnacle of movie making, the showdown, the movie, the characters, the drama building. Truly a masterpiece.

This movie is great, it's a cinematic masterpiece. As of this writing, it's #16 in the top 250 movies on IMDb, and deserves to be. Any western fan must see this movie, no excuses. Any fan of movies in general must see this movie, no excuses.

Thank you Sergio for making this movie.

23 September 2020,A masterpiece Western film you must watch at least once,"The situation in this film is simple. There is buried money. Three men pursue it. One man has power, and each of the other two has half of the information about where it is buried. The problem is all three are proud, arrogant, and the least cooperative in different ways.

Blondie is quiet, confident, and shrewd. Angel Eyes is sadistic, cold-blooded, and oppressive. The two men make a typical combination of a protagonist and an antagonist. What makes this film special is the third man Tuco.

Tuco is like comic relief. He quickly changes his attitude. When feeling threatened by someone, he pretends to be friendly and tries to appease him. Once the threat ends, all of a sudden he becomes aggressive and tries to take advantage. When he helps someone, we can't tell whether he is genuinely kind, or just tries to exploit the situation. Probably he can't tell himself either. He is the one who makes this at first glance simple plot unexpected.

It's partly a war film, set in the Civil War. Why Angel Eyes is the Bad is he is not just an outlaw, but he also covers his crimes under military authority as a sergeant. It is interesting that the fantastic Western film has realistic war scenes. When watching the battlefield, even Blondie blurts out ""I've never seen so many men wasted so badly"".

Every scene is not just explanatory but always compelling in some way. And the direction is excellent. Some scenes are only character's close-up shots combined with wonderful music, which is overwhelmingly powerful. Eastwood is of course a total badass. The ending is satisfactory. More than two hours and a half pass without a moment of boredom. It is definitely a masterpiece you must watch at least once even if you have no taste for Western films.",10
23 March 2020,three men,"Three darts with very different personalities, they used their unique acting skills to give the film the most temperamental point of view, walking in that era for nearly three hours, without any procrastination and fatigue, the monotonous soundtrack injected a hint of mystery into the film. Deserts, cowboys, revolvers, hangers, and other products of the bright ages, which emulate in such a world, a section of the fried bridge symbolizing peace is a classic, and the testimony tells the endless stories here.

9 October 2007,Sergio Leone The Master Of Film Making,"Sergio Leone is one of the best directors to ever touch a camera and this film proves that he is a master. The camera work of this film is brilliant. This also Clint Eastwood Best Film and also the other actors best film. I am shock that this film didn't get any Oscars and it has Oscars written all over it. This film should be honored and praise for it's brilliant film making, acting and it's cornerstone of film making. Sergio ranks as top 3 film maker of all time due to this films brilliant close ups and the length of the events that happen. Leone first when he was casting for the main role he wanted to cast Henry Fonda but could not afford him so he got Clint Eastwood and I'm glad that happen. This film also has one of the best villains of all time angle eyes also Tuco does a great job too. I must this film is a true masterpiece due to it's classic feel to and having the best gunfight ever. I highly recommend this film to anyone and if you like this one I highly recommend Sergio Leone Other Films.

6 November 2020,"""How is you digestion now?""","The third part of Dollars Trilogy The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is the longest and maybe the most profound of them. Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone have created very versatile movie by using emotional music and exciting situations at the same time. The Actors are the best quality you can get. A bounty hunter Blondie (Eastwood), a bandit Tuco (Wallach) and a mercenary Angel Eyes (Cleef) are main characters. Blondie and Tuco hear about a big sum of hidden Confederate coins. They don't trust each other and both don't tell their own part of secret to another. Angel Eyes who is a member of Union Army hears about the coins too. At Sad Hill Cemetary where the coins are the trio determines who will take the coins by guns. The last gunfight is the best scene in Western movies. Music and direction of that scene are absolutely perfect. The American Civil War has very big role in this movie. The war shows its brutal sides for example torture in a prisoner of war camp. Confederate soldiers' music is very sad to hear. Angel Eyes's violence is very sadistic. Tuco shows his ugly side memorably. Sometimes he has some good sides too. Blondie isn't hero or antihero. This kind of masterpieces isn't done very often. 10/10",10

26 April 2022,One of the best films ever,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is iconic. Its plot of bandits searching for treasure is seemingly simple, but deconstructs many ideals. The film examines notions of heroes, violence, war, and greed by presenting honest complexities. Protagonists are cruel, immorality is explained through backstories, violence is brutal, and war tragically destroys everything in its path. Thus, the self-interested characters are understandable reflections of their decaying world. Eastwood isn't deep, but Wallach counterbalances that with shifty desperation. Ultimately, this movie challenges viewers to reconsider romanticized ideals of action heroes who glorify violence in morally simplistic stories.

Technically, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is equally naturalistic, yet vibrantly stylish. The production has gritty details, yet grand scope. The effects are elaborate, real, and downright dangerous. The cinematography combines picturesque wide-shots with striking close-ups. The editing slowly builds tension, yet erupts with dramatic cuts that elevate suspense. Plus, these aspects are unified by Leone's legendary direction, creating a rugged yet beautiful atmosphere that redefined cinema. Finally, Morricone's music is possibly the greatest score of all time. Consequently, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a cinematic marvel. Undeniably, it's one of the best films ever.

Writing: 9/10 Direction: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Acting: 9/10 Editing: 10/10 Sound: 8/10 Score/Soundtrack: 10/10 Production Design: 10/10 Casting: 10/10 Effects: 10/10

Overall Score: 9.6/10.",10
28 November 2019,A Score to Rule Them All,"I am a huge fan of old spaghetti western films, and there is no one who does them better than the likes of Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood. These two men despite have a language barrier were able to create several amazing westerns that have set the golden standard for macaroni westerns.

I want to start with Casting... Clint Eastwood is a bad ass, there simply is no denying it. He is the Badass cowboy that will steal your girl and in the same instant earn your respect, and I have nothing other to say than he was born to play the role of Blondie. Now he also had a great lineup of supporting actors who helped him gain such acclaim but they just don't hold a candle to Mrs. Eastwood.

There is also the plot which is a like a headphones cord that is so tangled that the audience is forced to watch as Sergio Leone slowly untangles each separate knot, giving the appearance of separate stories but inevitably straightening to reveal that it is intact a single line. Now it may not be a complicated nonlinear story with loads of flashbacks but Sergio Leone proves himself a true filmmaker by unraveling a story rather the simple telling the audience the events that take place.

Finally I want to touch on the score. This to me is where the movie really shines, because despite all the cowboy reality it is the score that connects the story together. Building tension with every whistle and drumlins, changing the simple shots into something meaningful. It is not an understatement when I say that this score is the single most iconic score of all time.

I am giving this movie a 9/10 because this to me is more than just cinema, it is emotions caught on 2.35:1. (My favorite cinematic aspect ratio)",10
2 April 2006,One of the greatest westerns ever made,"First of three masterpieces by the great Italian director Sergio Leone and the last of a trilogy of westerns which he made with Clint Eastwood, this marked a significant step-forward on the two previous films on which they had collaborated, (""A Fistfull of Dollars"" and ""For a Few Dollars More""). The 'Once upon a time ...' movies would see Leone's films take on a much darker turn but although there is quite a lot of violence and death on display here, this is an almost jovial epic, (the humour comes from Leone's subversion of traditional western clichés). Almost every sequence feels, and looks, like a classic, (the climatic gunfight has the choreographed precision of a ballet), Tonino Delli Colli's widescreen cinematography is magnificent, and although dubbed, (very effectively), the English translation of the Italian script is first-class.

The plot is simplicity itself as Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef search for some buried gold but the plot is only the thread of a much richer tapestry centered round events in the American Civil War. Stylistically and thematically this film would later influence Eastwood as a director. At a time when, in America, the western seemed long past it's sell-by date, in Europe Leone's homages single-handedly revitalized the genre paving the way for a whole new breed of post-modernist classics.",9
15 October 2006,This is the reason why Leone is the greatest at what he does.,"Before watching this movie, I have seen A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars more and I was quite impressed with both. However, after I have seen this, Leone instantly became one of my favorite directors. Leone has a distinct style in his films and this movie pulls it out 150%.

The cinematography in this film is incredible. His use of extreme long shots and extreme close ups are unsurpassed. The film opens with the close up of a man with an expressionless face creating a sense of mystery and excitement. What will this guy going to do? What's going to happen? Then we are introduced to two new unknown men and the three walk towards the entrance. Silence. Then suddenly, the 3 bust in, guns are shot and Tuco busts through the window and escapes with a half eaten chicken (or pork) leg. One of the men is injured, tries to make a futile final attempt to kill him and falls to the floor; the other 2 are already dead. Just in that one scene, we are introduced to Tuco and can already guess his character, his background info, and skill... without a single spoken line of dialogue.

As a matter of fact, nobody speaks until about 10 minutes into the film. It is all visual. We, the audience, are forced to imagine what the characters are thinking, what might be taking place. Leone gives the viewers a chance to guess what might happen. Even in Once Upon a Time in the West, we see his mastery at the No-Dialogue introduction. I also believe that this is his way to introduce the character's personality traits without the viewers actually knowing that they know it. A subtle technique so when they see a character do something later in the movie, the viewers can accept the character's actions.

However, Leone would not be as great as he is if it wasn't for his partner Ennio Morricone and his unique and memorable soundtrack. The coyote-like music sets the mood for this film like no other western. It is something you must listen to and experience it to retain the full appreciation of it, and know why it has become the trademark music for the western genre.

These techniques go on throughout the film and bring us to the ultimate scene in film history, where Leone's style shines to it's full extent. His incredible use of long shots to set the stage, close ups to catch the expressions, music to set the mood, montage to create the tension, expand it and finally when you are at the edge of you're seat, the scene goes off like lighting in the incredible climatic ending.

Leone is not just any director. He is one of the best, and THIS is his western!",10
28 March 2005,Leone's Masterpiece,"There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best film ever made. And probably the best that ever will be made. Sergio Leone's absolute masterpiece.

It is often said that ""Fistful of Dollars"" was Clint Eastwood's show, ""For a Few Dollars More"" stolen by Lee Van Cleef, with Eli Wallach the main man in ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"" . Well Clint and Cleef are, as always, really cool in this movie. But yes, Wallach outclasses them both, as small time bandit - ""the Ugly"" Tuco. That said, the interplay between Clint's ""Blondie"", Cleef's ""Angel Eyes"" and Wallach is great, and one of the highlights of the film.

The Almeria landscape has never looked better. As rugged and barren as the face of Al Mulock that sidesteps into the frame at the beginning of the film. And never has a soundtrack been more suited to a movie than Morricone's now famous score. Ayeeayeeeahhh! Particularly superb during Tuco's dash through the graves at Sad Hill near the climax of the film, and the pulsating music that builds and builds for the final confrontation.

But what I love most is the way that the character's paths' cross by such a small chance of fate. And progressing from one double cross, to another double cross, to the gunfight of all gunfights! And there are so many touching moments in this movie too. Tuco's conversation with his brother, Father Ramirez; Blondie passing his cigar to the dying soldier; the look on the dying Captain's face as the bridge is blown up.

The film has been further enhanced with the inclusion of extra scenes, with Eastwood and Wallach adding their voices, and Cleef's provided by a character actor. Although the voices have obviously aged, the inclusion of these restored scenes benefits the film ever further.

If a better movie is ever made (not a chance) it will have to be one helluva flick! Ayeeayeeeahhh!",10
4 August 2018,They formed an alliance of hate to steal a fortune in dead man's gold.,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

31 January 2011,"Cinema Masterpiece full of one-liners, atmosphere and machismo. So good!","My first impression was 9/10, but just let the movie sit with you for awhile and it's scope, atmosphere, pacing, machismo, and sheer ""coolness"" practically force a perfect 10 rating. Unique and memorable!

I've seen it twice now and it has grown on me. The three main actors (Eastwood, Wallach and Cleef) are full of intensity, mystery, edginess. The plot twists and meanders and takes it's time, and I'm saying that's good! We go on this epic journey as the lives of our three stars criss and cross and we really experience the crazy fortunes (and misfortunes) life can throw at you.

Although I have not watched enough westerns to be any kind of expert, I think you can just feel ""cinema masterpiece"" when you watch this film. There are so many unique touches, quotable lines and atmospheric moments you'll come away from it caterwauling ""Ah-a-ah-a-aaahhhh..... wha, wha wha....""",10

1 October 2019,Turn up the volume and enjoy one of the Best Movies ever made,"I just watched this movie for the first time in maybe 15 years and all I can say is that it's 100% pure movie gold!

Clint Eastwood has his big breakthrough with this movie and delivers a solid performance as ""The man with no name"" or ""Blondie"" as Tuco calls him. The best performance however, in my opinion, is done by Eli Wallach who absolutely kills as Tuco! The first hour of the movie is almost exclusively with Tuco as the main character and he has by far the most lines and delivers perfectly in every scene. Tuco is also the inarguably best developed character and you get a lot of back story and personal encounters, explaining how he became who he is. Lee Van Cleef of course does a fantastic vilain as ""the Bad"" Angel Eyes.

Watching this movie as an adult has given me a new perspective: ""Blondie"" is not a saint and I can fully understand Tuco's wish for revenge, they also get back at each other several times in the movie which is really well done in the fantastic screenplay! Blondie's character is based on the ""silent and mysterious lone gunman"" which works for this movie because Clint Eastwood is so awesome and perfect for the role, but I do feel that some backstory or more dialogue would have lifted the character because you never really get to know him, which is sad only because of the fact that I want to know more of this the best ever Western character! I also see the fantastic musical score and how it's used to perfection. The 3 characters are a perfect match and the story is just absolutely amazing and you forget that you're watching a movie, dreaming away to days if the Civil War America.

What really holds this movie together and lifts it to the sky is the MUSIC. I cranked the volume up so high my ears started to hurt because I wanted to feel the music to it's Max. The exact right music in the exact right time lifts almost every scene and Oh My God is the music good! It builds suspence, increases intensity, and raises the level of the most massive scenes - Just amazing and well worth the watch on its own.

This is one of my all time favourite films and I could watch it on my death bed knowing it was a time well spent. Watch it, turn up the volume and just embrace the Masterpiece that is The Good, the bad, and the ugly!",10
14 July 2004,The King of all epic westerns.,"Nearly forty years after it was made this movie still holds and rightly deserves it's place at the top of the heap in western genre.

Adding yet another big American star to his company, (this time Eli Wallach,) Sergio Leone delivers his most optimistic effort in the Man with No Name trilogy. This film makes the previous two pale in comparison, not only in it's duration but on its grandiose and panoramic scale.

With an exiting plot and battle scenes which would make Sir David Lean green with envy, Leone pushed the Italian western boat out further than it had ever been before. If Leone's association with Clint Eastwood was to come to an end, then this was the high note for it to have ended on.

Eastwood plays our favourite anti-hero yet again, this time showing more humane sides to his personality, for instance the comfort he gives a dying soldier in his last few minutes of life and the fact that besides his life of killing, he is not beyond sitting down and stroking a kitten.

Lee Van Cleef, the veteran of many B westerns of the fifties and of Leone's second No Name yarn, plays Angel-eyes (the Bad) and he is evil to the extremes. Brutality and violence seems the key to his whole character and he plays it so well.

Wallach is out-standing as Tuco (the Ugly) and practically steals the whole film. His character is completely without morals or scruples and seems to have the longest criminal record in history. It is the interaction with Eastwood's character that makes this film so entertaining.

In the beginning, Tuco and No Name have formed an uneasy partnership to the effect that No Name catches the wanted felon, turns him in for the reward money, rescues him from the noose where-after the money is split and the same system is worked in the next town with equal success. This provides a few entertaining scenes between the two which rival most conventional ""buddy"" movies.

However, when they learn of a cache of hidden gold the two reform their reluctant partnership in their efforts to find it. This is purely because Wallach knows the name of the graveyard in which the gold is buried and Eastwood knows the name of the grave it is buried under.

Add to this Cleef's interest in the hidden gold and his murderous ways of getting to it and provide a setting as bloody as the American Civil War, you have an exiting film full of gun-play and double-crosses, that is both original and unique.

It is certainly the most bloodthirsty of the three movies and is at times horrific in it's violence. For instance, the scenes where systematic beatings are administered to the Confederate prisoners. If these images aren't graphic enough, the soft mellow music being played in the background is in such stark contrast to the action, you sense the suffering and pain more.

I think my favourite scene in any film has to be Eli Wallach running around the gigantic graveyard looking for the one grave he suspects hides the fortune. Accompanied by Ennio Morricone's now famous score and fantastic spinning camera angles, this scene is movie making at it's best and everything the cinema was created for.

I think it would be hard to find anyone on this planet who has not seen this film, but if you haven't do so NOW. Not only will you be entertained but you will have the gratification of knowing you have seen one of the greatest films ever made.",
1 July 2013,"Westerns Would Be Nowhere Without This Movie,","The Good,the Bad and the Ugly is a fantastic movie with a very well developed and smart storyline and a brilliant cast that know where well how to play in a western.I definitely feel this movie is overrated,number 5 on the IMDb Top 250 is way too high,it is good,but not that good.I think that the plot stretches out a bit too much,and there is a lot of detail that is not needed that could have brought this movie from two hours and forty minutes to just two hours.Another problem I had was Tuco,he was a great character,but he got way too much screen time,probably more than Clint Eastwood,he is the star of this movie and he's what makes the Dollars trilogy so brilliant and he needs the most screen time,also Angel Eyes needed more screen time,he is 'the bad' in the title and if he's one of the title characters and should have been in this much more.There is a lot of violence and action and magnificent performances all around in this movie,I don't think its as great as critics make it out to be,but it's definitely a must see for all fans of western's.

Two men work together in a scam in order to lead their way to the whereabouts of a cemetery with gold buried underneath worth over $200,000,but their not the only people that no know about this gold.",9
27 March 2007,Greatest Western of all Time,"Oh yeah!, I just Love Spaghetti Westerns Most of All Sergio Leone's Trilogy (Per un Pugno di Dollari, Per Qualche Dollaro in più and of course Il Buono Il Brutto e Il Cattivo. But I would not rate or comment on this movie only as a Western but as a Motion Picture that is watched by generations and has a great influence on filmmakers today. I watched this film for the first time when I was 13 and I just love it more each time I watch It

Il Buono Il Brutto e Il Cattivo is different from the classic Wayne and Ford Westerns, this movie as all ""Spaghetti Westers"" (called like that because of their Italian Origins and filmmakers like Sergio Leone) They show the darker Uglier and dirtier side of westerns and in my opinion also a more realistic feel to how people really where during the civil war, instead of the usual Twinkle from John Waynes bright teeth, We see three men who are ten times more believable real dirty and gritty. Eli Wallach's superb acting as Tuco (The Ugly) makes him my favorite character in the movie, constantly changing facial expressions based on each situation first he is angry then he is nice, he shows the brutal and greedy side as well as the genuine and caring human side So Thumbs Up Mister Wallach. Clint Eastwood on the other hand is in his usual cool self you see in the other two movies of the No name Trilogy, Very careful on which words he uses as well as not using any words but sending a strong emotion (when he offers his cigar to the wounded man in the broken down house) that cigar makes him unique , apparently Eastwood asked Director Sergio Leone if he could stop using it in some scenes, Leone answered by saying "" If you don't have the cigar, you don't have the same character.""

The Screenplay is very original and leaves a lot of suspense in certain scenes, you never get bored or tired although the movie is pretty long you don't feel time passing by you are just captured by the story and cant wait to see what happens next. Of course this film would be only be half as good if it did not have Ennio Morricone's Fantastic Score which sets a perfect mood to each scene, and I am not surprised to see many songs from this scored used in so many other movies, I am surprised it took so long for the Academy Awards to recognize him by giving him an Oscar.

Overall this movie is a must see for Western Lovers and Movie Lovers in general and I am very pleased to see it in IMDb's Top ten Movies.

Favorite Quote: ""You see , In this World there are two kinds of people my friend, those with loaded guns and those who dig, You dig!.""",10
3 February 2010,"Excellent film, but even more excellent on the new Blu Ray edition.","I finally got to view this film for the first time, and I'm glad. Since my first viewing was via the blu ray edition of the film, digitally remastered with high definition audio. I can see now why people consider this to be one of the best westerns or THE best of all time. Leone sure loved his wide lens and made brilliant use of it. The cinematography was amazing.

Clint Eastwood as usual was a pleasure to watch. He truly has a on screen presence that you can feel. It was the first time I ever saw him in a role that wasn't purely a good guy, if anything he was an anti hero. But even with some ""bad"" traits he still remained a stoic hero. The actor who played ""the ugly"" was amazing. Truly comical, but when it came down to business he knew what he was doing. The title sequence was great. And last but certainly not least, the musical score MADE this movie. The film would not be the same without it.

I definitely recommend this to all western buffs and fans of classic cinema. But watch it on Blu Ray.",10
4 October 2020,A Glorious Finale To The Most Popular And Iconic Western Of All Time!,"Sergio Leone's 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' (1966) is the third and final film in the 'Dollar' trilogy. The film's two predecessors are 'A Fistful of Dollars' (1964) and 'For a Few Dollars More' (1965). 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' (1966) is a very popular Western about... you know what? I won't even summarize the plot for you. Everybody needs to watch this classic by going in completely blind!

Let me talk about our 3 main actors. The ""Good"": Clint Eastwood plays ""Blondie"", a professional gunslinger trying to earn a few dollars. The ""Bad"": Lee Van Cleef plays the hitman ""Angel Eyes"" who doesn't mind going the dirty route when it comes to making money. The ""Ugly"": Eli Wallach plays Tuco who is a wanted outlaw. All 3 men have very different personalities, yet they share a common goal: making a ton of money!

Before I start talking about the specifics, I would like to clarify that my expectations for this film were enormous! I was expecting a specific type of Western and I got something else. Keep that in mind as you read my review. Of course I will rewatch the film and if my thoughts change in any significant shape or form, I will let you know with an update.

As someone who is a huge fan of 'For a Few Dollars More' (and literally calls it their favorite Western of all time), it was especially hard for me to accept seeing Lee Van Cleef play the bad guy. Having said that, he did a wonderful job as the villain of the story!

Eli Wallach did a really good job at capturing the behavior of someone who is desperate for money as well as revenge! He is a very unpredictable character since you never know what he is going to do next!

Finally our great Western hero Clint Eastwood who is charismatic as always and seeing him smoke a cigar has still not worn off one bit!

This is a film that will NEVER get old! It will always prevail through the test of time! I really cannot see people ever discrediting it!

'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' might just be the most complex Western in history! The thing about this film that really threw me off guard was that it isn't your traditional Western film (which I was expecting), but instead it goes the extra mile and gives us a little history lesson for the time of the 'Civil War'!

At times, I did think that a few of the scenes were a tad bit long, but nothing too major. The most important thing is that I never got bored and instead my eyes were glued onto the screen in anticipation of what would happen next!

I find it absolutely fascinating how this 3-hour-epic has managed to keep my attention at its highest level for such a long time! Rarely any movie can do that! But this isn't like any other movie, this is a really special one!

I would obviously be remissed if I didn't at least mention the unbelievably genius climax (the final 25 minutes of the film)! Everything that happens during that climax is pure perfection! The music, the cinematography, the acting, the stakes, the insane level of tension!

Speaking of the music, Ennio Morricone perhaps gave us the greatest soundtrack he ever created! There are so many jaw-dropping musical moments in there that clearly dominate on-screen and Leone lets the music shine in its pure and sheer excellence! Morricone has the ability to make you feel uplifted, motivated or to make you feel really unsettled! There is a reason why I consider him one of the best musical composers, arguably the best, in history! His music will always live on forever in the same way that Leone's movies will forever be relevant!

I also find it really interesting that, out of all 3 'Dollar' movies, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is the most emotional film! I genuinely love how the audience has NO IDEA what will happen next. This film is completely unpredictable! Sure, you can take a guess at what might happen and you might even get lucky, but you do not see these things coming from a mile away like with a lot of other movies!

Overall, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' was a real game changer in the entire film industry. Leone proved the world that you don't need to be an American or be a Hollywood director to make a great film! You can make a great film from no matter where you are in the world! This film is long, yet well-paced, complex, yet comprehensible! It is rewatchable, iconic, beautiful and strong! An EPIC, GRAND MASTERPIECE! 8/10",8

11 November 2013,"MY REVIEW: No Bad, No Ugly Only Good and Good!!","Three; The Good Blondie played by charming Clint Eastwood, the Bad Angel Eyes played by excellent Lee Van Cleef and the Ugly Tuco played by cunning, clever, comic and many more shades by terrific Ellie Wallach. These three are caught up in the hunt of the treasure worth 200 thousand dollars and what you get as an audience is the treasure of dialogs, acting, action, storytelling, music, back ground score, screenplay, camera work, immersing western atmosphere and in summary an extraordinary entertainer which relies on it wits just not its charm. Directed by western specialist Sergio Leone, the movie is funny, witty, clever, stylish and unforgettable from start to end. There are numerous scenes and conversations which you would like to revisit again and again. Ellie Wallach gives you a delicious portrayal of cunning and clever Tuco who befriends good guy Blondie in the hope of reaching to the treasure. Lee Van Cleef as bad guy gets less scenes and action but all are done with lots of style. All in all, coming from the old school of western thriller, this one is ageless entertainment. Don't miss any chance of watching it!!",9
25 November 2008,One of the best movies ever made - will leave you breathless,"Clint Eastwood returns as The Man With No Name in this final installment in Sergio Leone's epic Dollars Trilogy (or Man With No Name Trilogy). He plays Blondie (the Good), a sharp-shooter of debatable honor, iron will, and questionable motives. Leone also brings back Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes (the Bad), a sadistic man who always keeps his promises  as long as you pay him for it. Eli Wallach rounds out the trio as Tuco (the Ugly), a thief worried only about his own hide. The three men are held together by the wish to locate a stash of gold, its location imparted to them by a dying man. Alas, things are not so simple. The man whispers some of the information to Tuco, but only Blondie knows the true location. And so our thieves must overcome backstabbing and betrayal, as well as their mutual enemy of Angel Eyes, to reach the treasure.

Sergio Leone creates a visual masterpiece. Not even Orson Welles can hold the audience in his hands the way Leone can. The cinematography and editing are perfectly in sync, working together to mold the audience as Leone sees fit. The famous Mexican standoff, with its rapid-fire cutting and incredibly close shots, is jaw dropping, forcing you to hold your breath. And of course, the film simply could not work without Ennio Morricone's incredible (I repeat, incredible) score. Even if you don't bother seeing the movie, look up The Ecstasy of Gold on YouTube. It will leave you speechless and blow your mind.

After a disastrous experience with my first foray into Westerns (for the record, ""Shane"" is a horrific movie), I all but damned the entire genre to the pits of hell. But after repeatedly spying ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" atop film lists, I decided to give it a try. It had me on the edge of my seat, my eyes shining, my entire being entranced. In my opinion, ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" is one of the most spectacular movies ever made. Is it historically accurate? No. Is the plot nice and tight? Not really. But those are trivial matters in the face of what it is  an incredible spaghetti western. And as far as I am concerned, it is one of the best movies ever made.",10
11 June 2007,My comment,"Quentin Tarantino has called it ""the best-directed film of all time."" For me it is a majestic film. Sergio Leone is the greatest director. He is the complete artist, stylist. His films have a specially charm, though are full of the outrage. They are can watch for hundred times. It is a quality of the great artist what was S.Leone. The fine story, with a wonderful photography and adequate music of the greatest film music composer E. Morricone plus the rhythm generates a masterpiece. Does not need forget the excellent actors whose merit is the big for a global impression.

Thanks!

14 August 2001,To be brutally frank,"There is an operatic scene in a graveyard towards the end of this film that a lesser director may not have thought of. Though irrelevant, it is a moment of pure exhilarating cinema as Wallach runs around in a dizzy attempt to locate a stone.

The problem with Leone's films are their curious lack of suspense and tension. They plod along, then end. The characters ignore the fact that people are dying around them for real issues and values while their own cynical interests extend only to money. This obsession that cinema has with unsavoury and morally worthless people soon becomes wearisome as no amount of inspired camera work and direction can prevent the film being pulled down towards dullness by dull people.

12 January 2009,Perfect rated,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

12 August 2015,The iconic spaghetti western!,"This is the second sequel to A Fistful of Dollars, returning Clint Eastwood as The Man With No Name (Blondie), who forms an on-and-off partnership with bounty hunter Tuco (Eli Wallach) to find $200,000 worth of gold hidden in a cemetery while dealing with the nefarious hit man Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef).

Eastwood gave another solid performance as the gun-totting cowboy, providing much action, wit and incognito elements in a film full of drama and action. Like the previous film, I believe Director Sergio Leone gave us a very adventurous film with unpredictable moments that captures your interest, especially during the very tense scenes of the American Civil War (the scene where Blondie gives his coat and cigarette to a mortally wounded young soldier is the most touching scene, I believe). It is suspenseful watching Eastwood and Tuco race against Angel Eyes to find the gold, all in the mist of the war. For a three-hour movie, the pacing is a little slow at times, making you crave for more action. But, the drama, tension, and excellent acting (the unpredictable, suave yet good-hearted Blondie, the capricious and money-hungry Tuco and the cold-blooded and sinister Angel Eyes) keeps the movie captivating nonetheless.

Ennio Morricone gave us another catchy music score, perfect for a western movie and delivering one of cinema's most recognizable and iconic music themes. Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography captures the vastness of the dessert, the aura of the western towns and the chills of the war. Overall, it's another good western to catch.

26 May 2019,"brilliant work done by everyone, must watch one time","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) is an epic classic Sergio Leone's masterpiece film and a great conclusion to ""the Man with No Name"" Trilogy. This is my number 1 favorite Spaghetti Western about the Civil War and three gunslingers on a search for a lost gold. I love this film to death. It is my personal favorite western movie of all time. Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef are the best of the film in their roles. It has a great showdown in the cemetery on the end of the film, the way how it is edited. The cuts with people's faces and close up shots. I love this film to death and it is my number one favorite western in the trilogy. If I had to put then into a 'favorite ranking' list? 1. The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, 2. A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. Those are all three best masterpieces ! They are my favorite Clint Eastwood western movies in the series and they are really my favorite westerns that I am still watching today.

I love the music score by Ennio Morricone that did wrote different and new theme music score for this film. The Action sequences are awesome and the bullets are flying, the guns in this film are plenty. The scene action are also good which this film makes such an entertainment from begging till end. It is the third entry in to The Dollars trilogy or better known the Man with No Name, it is the final installment of The Dollars Trilogy. This film is a classic that made Clint Eastwood in to a big star that he is today.

An epic Western that follows the adventures of three gunfighters looking for $200,000 in stolen gold, Sergio Leone's 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is one of his best masterpiece, one that continues to get better and better with each viewing. A bounty hunting scam joins two men in an uneasy alliance against a third in a race to find a fortune in gold buried in a remote cemetery. The inimitable ""Man With No Name"" teams with two gunslingers (Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach) to pursue a fortune in stolen gold. But teamwork doesn't come naturally to the outlaws, and they soon discover that their greatest challenge is to stay alive in a country ravaged by war. Forging and Vibrant and yet detached style of action never before seen and not matched since, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly shatters the western mold in true Eastwood Style! The film is known for Leone's use of long shots and close-up cinematography, as well as his distinctive utilization of violence, tension, and stylistic gunfights.

The plot revolves around three gunslingers competing to find fortune in a buried cache of Confederate gold amidst the violent chaos of the American Civil War (specifically the New Mexico Campaign in 1862), while participating in many battles and duels along the way. The film was the third collaboration between Leone and Clint Eastwood, and the second with Lee Van Cleef. Still the race and the three gunslingers were just fantastic who will get the first the gold. The final scene on the cemetery is one of the best action scenes ever. The iconic Mexican standoff, with Tuco, Angel-Eyes in the middle, and Blondie is the best scene in the film. The trio all separately are traveling trough American Civil War who doesn't want any part of the war to do.

Clint Eastwood as ""Blondie"" (a.k.a. the Man with No Name): a subdued, bounty hunter did a really wonderful job as the good person, he showed that he is honest a good kind gunslinger. I think Clint Eastwood as Blondie did made memorable character and one of his the best acting performance on screen I have ever saw. Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes: The Bad, a ruthless, unfeeling, and sociopathic mercenary who always finishes a job he is paid for. Did a terrific job as the villain in this film, gosh this movie is awesome! He convinced me of his acting skills that he is a professional actor. Eli Wallach as Tuco ""The Rat"" The Ugly, a comical, oafish was amazing in his role, Sergio Leone choose him for this film with natural talent as the main cast. Those trio actors did a wonderful job as a different gunslingers on searching for a gold. The film also has humor and it is also brilliant in the both terms, the scene on cemetery where Tuco arrives first and is looking for a tombstone was brilliant. It turned out the gold was buried in a unmarked grave, that was hard to find. I was laughing when Blondie throws a shovel to Tuco for digging up the grave and the Angles Eyes comes and throws another shovel for Blondie, where both of them have to dig now the grave the scene was funny. They are a lot of moments in this film. 10/10 my number1 favorite in the trilogy, I love this film to death.",9
31 March 2009,"Leone and Eastwood define the American ""cool""","""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" is cool with brains. Most other action films, especially westerns, are celebrations of cool, but this film masters cool -- heck, practically invents it -- and also applies it sensibly. Nothing is merely for cool's sake, it is for the sake of telling a story full of mistrust as well as one that searches for depth in the blanket adjectives of its title.

Set in the West during the Civil War, the film identifies its characters right away: The Good, Blondie (Eastwood), The Bad, Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), and The Ugly, Tuco (Eli Wallach). Each is after nothing but money, making the word associations merely relative to the principles that they live by. Distrusting of one another, they are soon forced to work together -- specifically Tuco and Blondie -- in order to find 200 K in buried gold, because one of them knows which cemetery it's buried in and the other knows which grave.

Gold is also every word that comes out of Clint Eastwood's mouth. Although his body of work today is enough proof of his talent, he clearly owes much of his career to director/writer Sergio Leone. In this their third western collaboration, Leone knows what Eastwood's strengths are and he gives him some killer lines. Every man supposedly wants to be James Bond, but every American man should want to be Blondie. Every time he speaks, you know you're either going to be impressed or enlightened with his machismo and/or wisdom. Wallach is also invaluable to the film as Tuco. He keeps things interesting playing a money- grubbing rat. In a film of this length, he helps keep things from getting too serious and dull.

Leone also hones his craft in this movie. His gritty close-ups and split-second gunfire shots give this film its style, suspense and power. There's some ""it"" quality to his film-making that is hard to describe, but every shot feels important or at the least cool. Distinct ""chapter"" breaks also contribute to the Western mythos/tall tale idea that has made the genre an important one of the 20th century. There is a clear journey-like story line that recalls what made Homer's ""The Odyssey"" one of the first great Western (in the global sense) literary classics. There is a clear objective with obvious obstacles, unlikely partnerships and plenty of surprises.

If all that wasn't enough, there's the score. Ennio Morricone not only provides one of the most memorable themes in movie music history, but the timing of the music, the way it lifts the important scenes up into a realm of cinematic immortality is unlike anything before or since it. It's exciting and epic when it needs to and it's suspenseful and emotional when the action gets intense. With so much silence in this film, picking the right moments to break it is challenging, but Morricone nails it. And if it doesn't do all that for you, well, it's still cool.

""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" proves that all three of those descriptors are relative. It's no great revelation, but it's interesting to see how you watch and form opinions of characters assigned to general moral stereotypes and then to see how those opinions are affected as the film goes on. If that's too deep, than at the least you can appreciate how cool everything is.",9
18 April 2020,Nostalgic moment,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

10 January 2022,Okay,"OK, but certainly not the classic it is made out to be. Drifts a lot, and the plot isn't always very coherent. Desperately in need of editing, clocking in at nearly three hours.

Clint Eastwood does his usual cool, silent routine, and does it well. Supporting cast are pretty poor though - fairly hammy performances all round.

3 March 2023,Perfection in a imperfection form,"There is one that is the good one but is not that good. There is another that is tha bad one but it doesnt look that bad. And there is a third one that is the ugly but beauty apart is the most complete character of all. In a farwest environment he could be the good or the bad. That's what makes it ugly.

What is wright or wrong in the far west?

What are cowboys and how they relate to us?

Lee Van Cleef performance gave birth to future vilains and Clint Eastwood gave birth to future heroes in a twisted far west view of course.

An absolute cult film from every point of view you look.

Did you know that cowboys were like this at the same time of American civil war?

A movie that is a portrait and a influence till now days. The second amendment was passed a few years after this reality, when slavery was a serious subject but irrelevant or not exist in the far west. Law was made by honnor tell by the one who survives.

Cowboys ""maybe"" ended 100 years ago. Should we be allowed to carry semiautomatic guns under this mentality?

If you look at the present and project the past you realise that the past is the present.

This director was so extraordinary that shaped really till today.

The hole trilogy is a must watch for everybody till the end of times.",10

13 May 2004,An Italian Opera You Won't Nod Off To,"There are few films that have gained in stature over the decades as this one has. It's looking more and more like the latter 20th century's answer to ""Citizen Kane,"" a film that influenced young directors with its style and technique while managing to be popular with the public. More so, in some respects, because ""Citizen Kane"" was not the same sort of successful popular entertainment as was ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.""

If you haven't seen the movie, you may think you know the story, but you don't. There's this fellow named Tuco (Eli Wallach) who always finds himself on the wrong side of the law. He gets himself a partner, a silent type named Blondie (Clint Eastwood), and they go into business collecting bounties for Tuco and skipping town until Blondie leaves Tuco in the desert, vowing revenge. Meanwhile, weasel-eyed nasty Angeleyes (Lee Van Cleef) is hot on the trail of a fellow going by the name of Carson, part of the Confederate Army of the West, who knows something about $200,000 in gold coin. Meanwhile, all around, the American Civil War rages on.

Rest assured this all comes together, in a way that feels as natural as sunshine on a dog's bottom. The arresting thing about this film is how fresh and clever the journey is in getting there. It's not just cinema, but mega-cinema, the way every scene flows effortlessly into the next, while not one frame feels tired or overused. One worries a little about the new DVD that adds 20 minutes of footage. You can't improve on perfection. But the fact that this movie was ruthlessly edited after its Italian premiere for U.S. distribution suggests that this might be the one time a classic is actually improved on by such additions.

It's the ultimate guy's movie. There's not even a trace of a romance, unless you count Carson's whore. But it's a very philosophical film, too, even sensitive in a cleverly perverse way. The title, really one of the best movie titles ever, sets up an interesting premise that we see delivered in corkscrew fashion in the movie. Sure, Angeleyes is bad, and Tuco ugly in his morally conflicted manner, shooting people in cold blood and then making the sign of the cross as if to appease divine judgment. But Blondie as good? When we first see him, he's murdering three bounty hunters who just captured an outlaw and were preparing to bring him to justice. His treatment of Tuco, however enjoyable in its sadistically jolly way, is not good in any sense of the word.

But we do see growth in this man of few words, a sense of appreciation for the moral stands life allows us to take. He is concerned enough to ask about Tuco's fate in his first encounter with Angeleyes, and by the end of the movie, we've seen him show real concern for the senseless victims of war. The film works by throwing up a hard-edged tone of cruelty it never lets go of, but there's an undertone that posits something better, which leads to a conclusion that is one of filmdom's best.

What else is great? What isn't? Every line is a classic, especially Tuco's, like ""There are two kinds of spurs, my friend..."" and ""If you're going to shoot, shoot, don't talk."" There are some welcome faces from other parts of the Dollars trilogy, especially the indefatigable heavy Mario Brega as Corporal Wallace, who has one of the nastiest moments (beating Tuco) and then one of its funniest (when Tuco complains ""I can't while you're watching"" while trying to relieve himself in the boxcar).

It's impossible to overstate how good a movie this is. The only negative is that it's too long, but that very same quality is what makes it so enjoyable to watch over again. It's not even my favorite Sergio Leone film (that would be ""For A Few Dollars More""), but it's not only his best film, it's one of the best films ever made.",10
1 June 2020,One of the best of all time,"Simply perfect in any way.

The film addresses the story of three people who intertwine with each other, although it seems cliché Sergio Leone gives it in an unmatched way. The relationship that occurs between Blondie and Tuco is entirely natural, at no time is forced because one must be with the other, it is that humanism that there are between them two that is reflected throughout the trip, where with small actions It shows how well built the characters are, there is enough solidity in the lines and by God! Boy, no one demeans the characters, even the prostitute says consistent lines. The first scene of the bad is incredible, his great willingness to get what he wants is reasonable, he does not seek to dominate the world or defeat the good, only someone who has a goal in mind.

The re-enactment of the war of succession is avant-garde, it shows both leaders that there are no good or bad, only people who die for something that has no logic, we can see how those generals who are not in the history books saw the war as a suffering, a pain, a destiny to fulfill where the only thing there is death.

The film rejoices in the best photographs of the landscapes of Europe, the framing of the characters has the reason why it turns to the right, left, up or down, there is a reason and reason why go towards the character, because looking from afar, because take the horse's legs. The music is sublime, of the best songs in the history of cinema Ennio Morriconne is the only one who can compose for a confrontation in broad daylight and with Sergio Leone doing each take prolongs the sequence and still have that emotion about what will happen.

The edition as well as the art design do not remain relegated to the wardrobe, you can see the great quality and commitment that is in every detail.

Not to mention the performances, Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef manage to withdraw from themselves, forget who they are, that there is a camera in front and they do it like no one else can, they make art with their performances, of course Tuco does Laughing, as it changes from solemnity to sarcasm in a few seconds is worthy of applause. Angel Eyes manages to make a very organic antagonist, he does not need to scream, kill everyone, he knows when to shoot and at no time does he feel pretended. Bolndie is such an endearing character, even if he is from the old west you manage to feel his fear, his thirst, his kindness and his solidarity, and boy did he have to work hard to hold a rifle with his hands and they didn't shake.

I could talk more about the film, to notice how it influenced many directors such as Tarantino, Scorsese, DePalma, Kurbick, Spielberg, Lucas, Fincher, Nolan until the Russo but I will let you see it yourself and note that a dialogue with many is not necessary lines, a stellar and choral cast, great special effects and the best sound, you just need to have an idea, love and passion for your work, let yourself be overwhelmed by the creativity of a soundtrack and show that with little you can do a lot and that you cannot it is the ""what"" but the ""how"".",10
14 June 2018,"Still Good, Though Bad and Ugly in Parts","If nothing else, ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" deserves a ""10"" rating for its title alone.

The story is about three people of questionable morality in a chase for gold through the American Civil War; but despite occasionally donning uniforms they don't care about the conflict. Their eyes are fixed on the gold.

Following ""For a Few Dollars More"" Leone had more money than he should have been allowed and made a gritty masterpiece.

Coming off ""Rawhide"" and working cheap for Leone in ""A Fistful of Dollars"" Clint Eastwood proved he could hold the big screen even better than the small one. Eastwood knows how to walk, stand, and generally posture himself to attract the eye. Always an underrated actor, he made the trilogy, not Leone (despite the director's later wry comment that Eastwood had two expressions, one with a hat . . .)

Eastwood is ""the good"" in an extremely relative way. Leone's west is a world where towns might as well be different planets in science fiction, they're so separate. And none of them seem to have any law; despite the occasional badge, their law appears to be based on circumstance. And he was probably more right than we realize. This is Blondie's world and he finds intelligent ways to capitalize on it.

""The bad"" is second-string actor Lee van Cleef, coming into his glory. He played an avuncular character in ""For a Few Dollars More"" (not the same character, obviously). Leone tried to get his hooks on several better or better-known actors and got stuck with van Cleef again. Well, that worked out just fine. Bronson might have been excellent, but playing second fiddle to Eastwood might not have been his cup of tea.

NY stage actor and movie star Eli Wallach (legendary from this role) is Tuco, ""The Ugly,"" a bandit with no moral compass whatsoever. Wallach's comedy ""How to Steal a Million"" (starring Audrey Hepburn and an unlikely Peter O'Toole) came out also in 1966 and it's interesting to compare his two characters, one a jet-setting businessman and the other an unimaginably dirty western drifter). Oh, and in the scene where he's trying to find the grave, Tuco runs like a girl.

They can't make 'em like this anymore.

The first hour is character development. Sure, nearly every scene could have been trimmed, but absorbing who the characters are in relation to one another is extremely helpful in understanding their later by-play, especially the bizarre tenderness blossoming between Blondie and Tuco.

But Leone never loses the thread of yarn. As he proved in his even more bloated epics ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (where he dawdles through a credit sequence that is a mini-movie in its own right and longer than most ""short features"") and the pretentious but tedious ""Once Upon a Time in America"", Leone is interested in showing off what he can do with money. He spends as if his movies are government programs: the more he gets, the more ways he can find to waste it. But this is his best use of the dough.

The last half-hour, where all the ragged ends begin being sewn together, is the pure joy of film making. From the time they hit the cemetery it's one of the best climaxes in cinema history. This includes the trick Blondie pulls to make sure while ""Angel Eyes"" has to watch out for two opponents in the three-way duel, Blondie only has to worry about one.

The Good: 1) Ennio Morricone's legendary score. The movie's theme is rightfully iconic, and I love his ""Ecstasy of Gold"" (I'm a sucker for bells). His score also has foreshadowing of his delicate work in ""The Mission"" in the 1980s. 2) Clint Eastwood. While Eastwood's flicks as director are strangely humorless, Eastwood's wry humor and charm shine through. 3) Lee van Cleef. While no one's first choice for a costar, van Cleef seems to realize this is his moment and he makes the most of it, becoming one of the most slyly despicable baddies in westerns. 4) Eli Wallach. While I'm tempted to move him to ""the bad"" for stealing almost every shot he's in, his performance is good . . . If tiring when the movie his watched repeatedly. Wallach did not know how to dial Tuco back; neither did Leone who, I guess, decided to get full value for money. Eastwood can express more with a flick of his cigar, and van Cleef with an etebrow, than Wallach for all his overacting. 5) Spain. Franco, the one fascist dictator not targeted in WW2, ran an oppressive regime, but one where filmmakers found they could get anything they wanted for a well-placed bribe. The long shots of the land do resemble the never-never land of the old west, and they have their own stark beauty. Just as one can't go wrong with Tuscany, it's difficult to make this part of Spain look bad on film (Lean even used it in the second half of his magnificently watchable ""Lawrence of Arabia"").

The Ugly: Leone. His closeups of unattractive actors, his meaningless tracking shots, the very overwhelming bloat that might so easily, as in his ""Once Upon a Time . . ."" movies, might have gone woefully amiss.

Overall, a good story well acted by the three leads. Leone was never this good before and he was too much of a glutton to restrain his bloat afterward. This was everyone's moment. A wonderful film . . . But long. If you watch this for the first time, steel yourself for a marathon run.",10
13 June 2005,"When You Have To Shoot, Then Shoot Don't Talk","Not just one of the greatest westerns of all time but one of the greatest films too (as I'm writing this it's at no 11 in the IMDb top 250). Its difficult to know where to start in going through this films greatest attributes so i'll list them in no particular order: Music - Enricco Morricone's score is the peak of his collaborations with Leone iconic and instantly recognisable from the main theme to the final showdown. One of my favourite moments in films as the score reaches a crescendo then slowly winds down as the trio head for the final stand off.

Visuals - The sets, costumes, cinematography are all top draw creating some stunning moments. The highlights being a fully realised civil war battle and amazing representations of frontier towns.

Performances - Clint in the part he was born for, Van Cleef relishes his part as the bad Angel Eyes only outdone by Henry Fonda in Leone's later Once Upon a Time in the West as most sinister villain in a western ever. On top of this add Eli Wallach as Tucos the ugly who nearly walks away with the movie despite being evil he's almost funny in his reactions and battle with Clints the good.

The Showdown - The classic western scene, the ultimate face off three gunfighters face off the music kicks in, close ups and then the deadly, instant result.

I can't recommend this film enough its one of only four films I have rated 10/10.",10
24 August 2006,best western,"this movie is by far the best western ever made. yes unforgiven is great but it was made after and with the benifit of the latter. this movie was made in 1966 that is 40 years ago. I have watched this movie twenty times and maybe more. It has been a part of my life and I find it to be a great why to kill a rainy afternoon. I see something new almost every time I watch it. this movie changed the way gun movies were made.

Sergio in his wisdom or luck got it right, as they say three is a charm. If you are a fan of horses check out the Arabian that Lee rides in on, best western horse ever except for maybe Beau in True Grit. many forget that the horses are important too. this movie and director should have won the best movie and best director for 1966

30 May 2020,Great Stuff,"I saw this film in a cinema when it was first released and viewed it again yesterday on British TV. I have to say it was still one of the best westerns ever. But I think the real big star of it was Eli Wallach, not Clint Eastwood. Eli's brilliant portrayal of a no-good Mexican bandit was amazing, especially from his Jewish background! I only gave the film nine stars, because some of the long shots were too long.

16 May 2007,"""Best climax"" i have ever seen.","This is the film which made an effect on me when i watched this movie. What a wonderful cinematography, i think they made a good effort to do such a cinematography. When tuco and Blondie plant the bomb in the bridge i thought the blasting scene will not be realistic, but shockingly the blast was very realistic and i wondered that how would have they did that scene, really extraordinary. The ultimate scene in the movie is, when tuco,""who was eager to know the name of the cemetery from bill Carson, will kick Blondie when he was lying beside bill, but when bill dies and Blondie says that he knows the name of the cemetery, tuco suddenly cares for Blondie. This film has an excellent duologue's by making to understand the viewer indirectly. I think this movie has a best climax than any other movie. Adios..........

The talent reunited here is amazing, the acting, the story, the lines, the pace, the music (THE MUSIC!), the climax... Its unaceptable that Eli was not nomine by the Academy. Well, I have nothing to leave here further than the world already told about this movie. All I want is to give my deserved prayse for this memorable, masterclass of CINEMA.

13 December 2021,"good, bad, feo","I think Richard Schickel called this one of the 100 greatest films of all time. Hell, it's not even in the top 100 Westerns list! Any Ford, Peckinpah, Hawks, Walsh, Boetticher, De Toth, Tourneur, Karlson or Mann offering in the genre is better. ""3-10 To Yuma"" is better. Hell, even ""The Big Country"" is better! (I do, however, prefer it to ""High Noon"" or ""Shane""). What this too long, bombastic, and dull movie is, in my opinion, is the ""Dr. Zhivago"" of Westerns. The only reason it's at all superior to Lean's plodding work is that Ennio Morricone's end of civilization score is infinitely preferable to that treacly Lara's Theme.

I won't even get into how bad Leone's screenplay or Wallach/Eastwood's acting is.

5 October 2019,The Experience Of My Lifetime,"I've seen this film more times than I can remember.Yet I still look forward the the next viewing somewhere down the line.The fascination and the attraction never diminishes.What does that say..? This is a film that if you allow yourself to be immersed in it, will simply transport you onto a higher plane.Sounds pretentious..? As a testament to the power of movies and the revision of a genre,there is however nothing else that comes close.The haunting, elegiac score comes at you in a nostalgic all consuming fever dream, the images unfold upon a time when life was simpler and more pure, in relation to both its release date and what actually takes place on screen, which is now of course history.A blazing sun scorched artefact as film,it does rise to the level of art and must be seen at least once in the short time that we all have.

20 August 2016,A very good western but overlong,"This takes place during the American Civil War (but was shot in Spain). Three men (Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef) form an uneasy alliance. They don't trust each other and all hate each other but they all want $200,000 hidden away in a cemetery. The first hour is introducing the three characters--the remaining two hours deal with their journey.

This has been called an epic and operatic western. I agree! It's beautifully directed by Sergio Leone. He knew how to frame shots and use the wide screen perfectly. Most of the film is told by images not dialogue. Heck there's no dialogue for the first 10 minutes! There's plenty of shoot outs and action. The acting is OK. Eastwood was never a great actor but he's OK here. Wallach gets annoying but that's his character. Van Cleef is just so-so but has little screen time.

There's one big problem here--the length. There is no reason for this to go on for three hours. Scenes ramble on inconclusively quite a bit. There's also a long battle scene and talk with a drunken captain that add nothing to the main storyline. The battle scene is impressively done but it's not needed. Still it's an epic and should be seen at least once. Recommended.",8
4 December 2011,"The Good, The Great and The Fantastic","Most of what comes to mind when I hear the words ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" has already been addressed in prior reviews below. There are few words that describe the brilliance of such a movie, but considering as how this film remains (to this day) to be one of my all-time favorites, I thought I should compose a few to express my fond opinion about it for anyone who has not yet experienced the pleasure of seeing it.

To put it simply, this movie is utter perfection; the endless landscapes, the classic gun skirmishes, the solid performances, the incredible soundtrack... No western has even caught GLIMPSE of the heights to which this film soars, let alone reached them. This is not just the greatest western, it is one of the best films ever made, with almost no notable exceptions.

The music is utter brilliance. The theme song will be playing through your mind for weeks, if it has not already. Ennio Morricone is at his all-time best here, delivering one of the most poetic and outstanding soundtracks for any western (or, arguably, any film), period. And yes, Metallica fans, THIS is the true way that ""The Esctasy of Gold"" is meant to be heard: in its original version.

The camera-work is also of high notability. From the huge wide-angle shots of the walloping scenery to the close-and-tight views of the characters' narrowed eyes, the contrast in camera shots will turn even the slower scenes into sheer excitement.

Storywise, this film is without equal. The beautiful simplicity of a bounty hunter-turned-treasure hunter, his unlikely bandit partner and their evil rival racing to find $200,000 in Confederate gold is truly spectacular; but what makes it even more memorable is the broadness and scope on the jarring reality of the Civil War. In truth, this story isn't just about three men, but rather three men and their journey amidst the brawling past of a struggling nation, which is depicted fantastically. And the finale of the Trio Duel has got to be one of the most cinematically and musically excellent sequences ever captured on camera. Some may cringe when they learn that the film lasts a good 2.5 hours, but nowhere has a film of this length felt more fitting.

To describe the cast is nearly impossible. Lee Van Cleef puts up one of his greatest performances here--he seems BORN to play ""Angel Eyes"". His presence on-screen is truly what drives the story and conflict. Eli Wallach delivers an outstanding role as Tuco; his hilarious dialog and occasional brawls with Blondie make him by far one of the most memorable characters to graze any form of theater. Clint Eastwood is truly something to behold. Although Clint is definitely one of my favorite all-time actors, this is not quite my absolute favorite performance of his (admitedly because he's not quite as bad-ass as in, say, A Fistful of Dollars); however, this point is hardly worth mentioning, because his role as Blondie adds the perfect contrast to the others' personalities. While Angel Eyes and Tuco are considerably violent-natured, Blondie is much more passive; he rarely partakes in conflict except when he absolutely has to, but when he does he delivers the ultimate punishment to anyone dumb enough to stand in his way. In some ways, I think the movie wouldn't have been nearly as effective if Clint's character had stolen the show. Either way, every character is simply rounded and chiseled to perfection; there is no room for improvement here.

To sum it all up, this movie is simply breathtaking. It's absolutely fantastic; it's utterly brilliant. The music, the plot, the characters, and the incredible direction of Sergio Leone make this ""Spaghetti-Western"" hardly JUST a spaghetti-western and hardly worth any point of criticism. I have rated this movie a 10 because, unfortunately, there is no higher number available to select (believe me, I would rate this film a 200 if I had the chance). If you have yet to see this film, you must make it an objective to watch it--regardless of whether you like the genre or not. If you've been searching for a film that you could finally term ""THE BEST MOVIE EVER,"" then look no further. It is right here, and it's called: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.",10
27 October 2008,Can justifiably be called the best Western ever.,"Sergio Leone's epic tale of three men all on a different point of the morality scale is a thoroughly entertaining film that is certainly one of the best in its genre, if not one of the best films overall.

Clint Eastwood completes his ""trilogy"" of roles with Leone as Blondie, the quiet drifter who has few friends and plenty of bullets. In every scene, Eastwood's quiet yet brutally tough nature shows that he is one of the brightest stars of the last fifty years, and even though he has gone on to become a better director than actor, he still deserves to be considered a great actor.

All the acting is terrific, with Lee Van Cleef perfectly intimidating as the hit man Angel Eyes, and Eli Wallach stealing the show as the comically-violent bandit Tuco. They carry the story along and Leone paces it so well that even though it is quite long, it is well worth it to see the final sequence of the showdown between all three characters.

And of course, we cannot forget to honor the man who made this series possible. All throughout, Sergio Leone shows his enormous talent as a director and filmmaker. He certainly changed the genre forever with this film, and that is just one reason of why this may be the best Western ever made.",10
1 March 2010,Sergio Leone's Western Masterpiece,"I avoided seeing this film for many years. As a whole, I do not like westerns, they are typically clichéd and hokey. Finally after reading the raving reviews and a strong urge by my film instructor, I rented it. I was blown away and left in awe of Sergio Leone's spaghetti western classic.

The acting is very intense, especially from Lee Van Cleef's character Angel Eyes. Clint Eastwood does a great job as the righteous Blondie, but Van Cleef's character stands out to me more. The camera work is greatly done, especially in the graveyard scene and the associative shots used during the Mexican standoff scene. Being a huge Quentin Tarantino fan, at the end of the movie, I thought to myself ""so that's where he got his inspiration"" (meaning his later works such as the Kill Bill series and Inglorious Basterds). The thing that makes the film to me is the soundtrack. The music is used in very good taste, whether it is the classic theme from the beginning or the use of Ecstacy of Gold during the graveyard scene.

If you love westerns, this is a definite must. If you do not like westerns, this is still a must for any movie lover. Overall, it's a 10 out of 10 rating for the greatest western ever made and one of the greatest and most influential films of all time.",10
18 February 2011,"Great acting, music, story","Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

12 May 2005,Very Interesting and Entertaining Movie !,"Clint Eastwood has given a lifetime's performance to the character of Blondie in this all time MUST SEE western action and adventure thriller. The self-confidence and stoic fortitude of Blondie was adequately portrayed by Eastwood. In addition, Blondie is shown to be exceptionally fair as he justly and equally distributes the bounty between himself and the Ugly, at the end.

The crooked and cunning portrayal of a sheriff by Lee Van Cleef, who is head over heels for the lost bounty is also worth applauding. Cleef's facial contours and rugged appearance was exactly, that was needed for a bad, wily and greedy appearance of a selfish and cruel country sheriff.

Besides, the peculiar tune of music goes right to the heart with the flow of dramatic,stunning and at times, amusing events. The battle scene is magnificently pictured and even the cemetery chosen for the last duel is perfect leading to the climactic suspense culminating in the death of the Bad.

Well done, for both Eastwood and Sergio !",10

5 July 2023,Brilliance by Leone,"Sergio Leone... a great director, producer credited as the pioneer of the Spaghetti Western genre. Eventhough i am a big fan of once upon a time in america among Leone's productions this movie is greatest one. Amid the endless homages and the sheer adoration meted out to Sergio Leone's ambitious, pricier finale to his Spaghetti Western trilogy, it's easy to forget just how damn good the film is. It makes a case for Sergio Leone as a true artist and it slowly reveals itself to have real emotional heft when you begin considering some of the ambitious themes that Leone tackles. Not much needs to be said here. The best western ever made. Its mesmerizing score and epic plot combine to leave any fan of movies in awe.

27 August 2008,"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly: One of the best","Once every few years, a movie pops up that thousands or maybe even millions consider to be one of the best films ever made. The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is definitely one of those few. Blondie (Clint Eastwood), Tuco (Eli Wallach) and Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) are three men who are in search of gold coins that are buried in a cemetery. However, each man only knows a certain amount of information as to where the gold is and are therefore dependent on each other.

The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is an incredibly suspenseful movie and will have you on the edge of your seat throughout. The action scenes are top-notch and really kick in the tension. The famous showdown at the cemetery seriously had me guessing as to what the hell was going to happen to the point of being wide-eyed and I'm sure that it's the most suspenseful scene in cinema history.

Although Clint Eastwood gives an excellent performance as Blondie, it's Eli Wallach who shines as Tuco. The audience has a strange, ever-changing relationship with his character. At some points (mainly early on) we hate his guts and at other points we love him and can't get enough of him. He actually had me laughing quite a few times such as when he takes a desperate but brilliant measure to break free from his handcuffs. I won't ruin it for you, but it involves a train.

Even if you haven't seen the movie, you WILL recognise its theme tune. Ennio Morricone's music is one of the best things about The Good, The Bad And The Ugly and its theme tune is certainly among the greatest of all time.

The thing that amazed me about the film is that it keeps you entertained and interested throughout its three hour length. Films this long tend to get boring after a while and you eventually just lose interest, but TGTBATU will make you ask for more. Anyway, more to love.

I haven't seen the movie's predecessors A Fistful Of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More. I've heard good things about them, but I have to say that it would take A LOT for them to be better than this cinematic masterpiece.

The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is one of the best movies ever made and is also one of my favourite films. I give it 10/10.",10
31 October 2021,My Favorite Western,"I saw this movie when it first came out and liked it. Over the last five plus decades I've seen it again and again and in that time it's grown on me to where it's not only my favorite western, but generally speaking, the best western I've seen. There is so much going on here. It's rich in characters, cinematography, and story development. Eli Wallach should have gotten a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Tuco. It's ust a fun, well done western and Sergio Leone brings out the best in his actors. Plus, his use of unknown, unique looking extras, works. It works on many levels. Enjoy!

15 February 2023,The Quintessential Western.,"While it is a slow burn, with a lot of dialogue this film manages to be one of the greatest films ever made. The quintessential Trio of film including Eastwood's The Good, Lee Van Cleef's The Bad, and Eli Wallace's The Ugly make the film incredibly entertaining, tense, and Thrilling. The post world war 2 backdrop where people were still fighting even though the war had ended adds a very interesting component to the film. Two specific scenes are perfect, peak cinema, masterpieces. Those two scenes are the Tuco Graveyard scene and the famous stand-off scene. These scenes hit incredibly hard and give me chills every time. One last thing to bring up is the beautiful score by Ennio Morricone, the theme The Ecstasy of Gold is one of the greatest pieces of classical music ever. In conclusion this is the quintessential spaghetti western and a very well made film.

2 February 2020,The Greatest Film of All Time,"If it isn't obvious by the title of my review, I consider this to be the greatest movie ever made.

The Good, the Bad and the Ugly perfectly links all three character's stories together in a satisfying way and makes the ending of the film in the graveyard that much more powerful and impactful and perfectly reflects the title of the film itself.

Sergio Leone's directing, Ennio Morricone's orchestrating, the acting of Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach - every one of these people along with everyone else involved in the production of the film has created a masterpiece of cinema that stands the test of time and with every viewing continues to get more and more enjoyable.

14 August 2018,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly Review: A Stunning Western That Never Ages","The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is the first real Spaghetti Western that I ever saw. I hadn't even heard of the Spaghetti Western genre, I just watched the movie because I was a fan of Clint Eastwood at the time. After watching this magnificent masterpiece for the first time when I was a little kid, I was officially introduced to what would become one of my favorite genres, Spaghetti Westerns.

Now an amateur Spaghetti Western fan might ask, ""why is this the best Spaghetti Western? Why not Django, or The Great Silence or even Once Upon A Time In The West?"" Well I'll tell you why, all of those other films are fantastic films, but this one actually has a great plot, unlike some of the other Spaghetti Westerns that could come across as mindless and boring. This film follows a group of three fantastic main characters, none of whom you really trust, as they all compete to find a fortune in Confederate gold that is hidden.

Leone also excels the most in this film in terms of the phenomenal cinematography, the top-notch gun duels between the main characters, and the epic scope of the film. Everything time I watch this film, I see more and more of the extravagant scenery and I feel as if the whole landscape of the film is getting larger and larger.

In the end, The Good, The Bad And The Ugly succeeds in every area, and more so than any other Spaghetti Wester. Maybe it succeeds even more than any movie ever made. It is certainly my favorite movie, and I hope that it continues to age is well as it has since its release dat in 1966.

The Good, The Bad and The Ugly: 98% -two points taken off for it being a bit slow at certain points, and for it being too long.",10

4 December 2019,"Tarantino´s inspiration, obviously","This is an amazing film to have been produced in 1966. It took me all of these years to get around to watching it because I presumed that it was a western, which is definitely not my genre. Everything here is so well done: the music, the cinematography (which I gather has been remastered?), the gritty and grim postmodern view of humanity. A great antiwar critique along the way. I am impressed. Now I have to say that Tarantino seems much less original. His father was Sergio Leone, obviously. This is better than Tarantino because it does not indulge in a pornographic excess of violence. Plus it was made in 1966--when Tarantino was but a tot!

17 February 2022,So Overrated,"I forgot just how bad ""The Good, the bad, and the ugly"" was until I just now rewatched it. This film is way too long, it could easily have an hour cut out of it. And there is not enough dialogue or character development. It also makes no sense having major civil war action being set in the southwest. This film is beyond overrated. It is bloated and the director shows no restraint moving the film at a snail's pace. I rate it a 2/10 just because there is some nice cinematography and music, but the extreme slowness and long length with little depth make this film a major chore to get through. I'm not sure why people love this film and rate it so highly.

25 October 2017,"""Every gun makes its own tune.""","THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is a Spaghetti Western film that, through an unique perspective and style, brings us a magnificent view of the wild west, including plenty of violence. The story of three gunslingers who hate, love and torture each other to find fortune in a cemetery, while avoiding chaos of the American Civil War, is one of my favorite of all time.

I have watched this movie, regardless of the amount of violence, with great pleasure. This film captures you in almost three hours.

During the American Civil War, mercenary Angel Eyes interrogates a former Confederate soldier. A frightened soldier has discovered, in order to stay alive, to a dangerous mercenary a secret about a cache of Confederate gold. Meanwhile, Mexican bandit Tuco is rescued from three bounty hunters by ""Blondie"", a taciturn and enigmatic loner, who delivers him to a local sheriff to collect his bounty. It seems, that they are partners in a lucrative money-making scheme, however, these partnerships in the wild west almost always last for a very short time. Blondie grows weary of Tuco's complaints, and abandons him penniless in the desert. Tuco's revenge is brutal. Blondie life was saved by man with a secret of buried gold. The two carry on a portion of the secrets of buried gold, however, the third player, who wants to join, waiting in ambush...

Regardless of wartime background and some bizarre elements, this is a realistic view of violent, brutal and fanatical relations in the West. The title is a phrase of an ironic attitude, which is even more pronounced through three close characters which are trying to get hold of a hidden treasure, while thousands of people dying around them. It is impossible to remain indifferent to this film, given the cruelty, sharp dialogues and the wit that pervades through the general madness, which borders with an apocalypse.

The scenery is simply amazing, characterization is excellent, despite the fact that two of the three characters remain mystical. Well, the soundtrack .... the soundtrack is a masterpiece. Morricone's magic in the true sense of the word.

Clint Eastwood as ""Blondie"" (a.k.a. the Man with No Name) became a true symbol of the genre after this film. His facial expressions, cigarette and specific way of speaking somewhat borders with trash and again becomes an essential part of the film culture. Blondie is definitely not a ""good"" character, he is only smarter, more patient and quicker on the trigger.

Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes is a ruthless, unfeeling, and sociopathic mercenary who always finishes his job. He creates a certain counterbalance with his charisma, attitude and cruelties. Angel Eyes is antagonist, which has maybe a little ""different"" approach in order to achieve his objective, as opposed to the main protagonists.

Eli Wallach as Tuco has stole the show, as a dirty, arrogant, sore, but very capable outlaw. His fanaticism exceeds all reasonable limits. He has no right to make mistakes, because he walks through a thin wire between two completely opposite characters.

It is difficult to distinguish between good and evil, generosity and cruelty or luck and coincidence in this film. Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo is, in my opinion, the best western film of all time.",10
22 July 2019,Just another Spaghetti Western,"The bad guy and to a certain extent the ugly guy's character were uniquely designed. The good guy was plain boring w some super powers for me. Not enough smartness for me, though its not the genre either i guess. Maybe my expectations were too high from the rating and popularity.

10 July 2000,The third greatest Western ever made.,"THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is Leone's most sustained attack on the American values psychically embodied in the Western, and contemporaneously being globally disseminated culturally, corporately, militaristically (the Cold War, Vietnam). for instance, the Civil War (and this is THE great Civil War movie, shorn of heroics and ideals) is deliberately decontextualised, so that we have no simplistic dichotomy between noble abolitionists and evil racists, or arrogant Yankees and honourable Southerners. Robbed of context, war is seen for what it is, a mass slaughter, a gigantic mirror firing squad searing the land, the logical outcome of progress.

The Civil War is often seen as the defining moment of the American 'idea', the victory of certain ideals about liberty and fraternity. Here prized Amercian liberty is a sprawl of corpses and limbs. The 'good' Yankees, the ones who might be seen as carriers of the official myth, are lame, dying, ineffectual, drunk, neurotic, in both cases prone, helpless to stop the victory of evil. The truth about America, embodied in Angel Eyes, the one effective, powerful Union leader we see, is one of torture, robbery and murder.

Many have compared the prisoner-of-war camp sequences to World War II - Angel Eyes' Gestapo-like interrogations; the prisoners' orchestra like those in many concentration camps; the equation of the compound with these camps; the wholesale fleecing of prisoners; the trains jammed with prisoners going to their deaths. What is shocking is that the men equated with Nazis are the bringers of liberty to slaves, and the creators of a space for the American dream, free from European abuses and corruption. Leone shows that American history - the genocide of natives; the history of slavery (and Civil Rights was a traumatic issue is the US at the time); the obscene culturalisation of capitalism and its concomitant military Imperialism are not all that different from the Nazi project (never mind that it was the spillover of the Civil War that offset the Wild West).

What is most bitter of all is that in the midst of this holocaust, the mythic machinations of capitalism, as adumbrated in the opening DOLLARS films, continues unabated. Indeed, so powerful is the drive of Blondie, Tuco and Angel Eyes, that is can actually remove the obstacle of a full-blown war, clear history and human idiocy out of their ritualistic games (the bridge sequence). History tries to catch them; they are swept up by it on occasion, but constantly elude it, looking on at the spectacle just as we do, hitting the remote control when they're sated. It could be said that they are finally marginalised by the reality of America and history, that the grotesque, extreme close-ups are replaced by sweeping long shots full of anonymous distracted mass, but it's really the other way around, America and history have no way of stopping the mythic drive, indeed it depends on it.

GOOD makes all 'traditional' Westerns look thin. Like 'Ulysses', every scene is a classic in itself, rich in detail, character, incident, critique, meaning and form. Who'd have thought in the 1960s that the greatest, most celebrated and influential Italian director would not be Antonioni, Fellini or Visconti, but a hack of sensationalist oaters. But Leone's overwhelming mastery of form is near its peak here, as he brings together all the thematic concerns of the first two films. The opening vignettes adumbrate the terms of reference - ugly is defined by gluttony and constant quick-witted flight; bad is a frightening display of murderous, yet humorous efficiency, pinned down by a curious code of conduct; good embodies a systematic defiance and humiliation of the law, inhuman greed, betrayal and attempted sadistic murder.

The geometry of circle and triangle are repeatedly invoked to underpin the fabled linearity of the west, endless combinations from the boy at the well and the climactic shootout, to the opening triangle of Angel Eyes and Tuco linked to food, Blondie not. The themes of the family (Angel Eyes' opening slaughter; Tuco and his brother), religion (the monastary hospital; Blondie as Tuco's guardian angel, with the power to give and take life; his Jesus-like ordeal in the desert, taunted by the devil), the place of the body in a mythical landscape (and Blondie suffers a horrible lashing in the desert), and the contrasting of these mythic archetypes with gross, concupicent humanity, a humanity that opens and closes the film, because this is Wallach's film, a man whose crimes have understandable motivation (women, food, money for comfort etc.), who must live in while the abstractions haunt the Western landscape.

The score, though frequently parodic and comic as ever, is one of Morricone's most beautiful, though always ironic; its elegiac, ethereal adagios scoring scenes of intolerable barbarity. In a film bursting with comedy and action, with scenes of great formal beauty (watch Angel Eyes' exit after his first slaughter), of unforgettable set-pieces, the hallucinatory finale in the field of death, where the quest of the movie (and all American quests?) is equated with the grave, where the hilariously sexualised rite is rudely interrupted, has got top them all.",10
16 June 2020,great,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

4 April 2009,Words cannot describe the enormity of this film.,"There are certain things in life that are unexplainable and incomprehensible in their magnitude. These exalted anomalies include - in no particular order - Revolver, Guernica, The Sistine Chapel, The Ninth Symphony, The Waste Land, Macbeth and then there is this.

This movie expresses a gamut of emotions; every new scene shows a side of a character that one thought was unimaginable; the acting is nothing less than breathtaking and the use of sound and music is unprecedented.

I don't often make bold, sweeping statements, but here goes: this movie could not have been made any better in any regard possible.

Tarantino was quoted as saying that this movie is the best directed movie of all time; who am I to disagree with him? 10/10 without a shadow of a doubt.

P.S. I would have given it ten even if it were based on the Standoff alone.",10

7 September 2020,The gold standard of westerns.,"Few films are as iconic as Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Few characters loom as large over pop culture as Clint Eastwood's Blondie. Few scores are as recognisable and parodied as the one by Ennio Morricone. This film, simply put, exceeds even it's momentous hype. I've never seen a western which has sewn such exploding sequences, full of tension and anticipation, in such a basic plot. This film is a true masterpiece.

The seemingly endless western landscapes, which Leone has captured in all of its grandeur, is filled with endless storytelling possiblities. Sergio Leone has shown that how can one exploit the situations to build characters and make a film, even a significantly large one like this, with a plot which seems not large enough to get 180 minutes on screen.

The opening sequences of the film, the Civil War outbursts in between, Blondie and Tuco' s initial strife, all of these play vital part in character development. Even without too much of dialogues, we get to know about each one of them and their respective ways of operating, and this is the signature of a great film.

The use of close ups and extreme close ups in the film is extremely evident, and coupled with great acting, they serve in building our understanding of the characters as well as creating some of the tension scenes, which the film is famous for. An hour into the film, and we know what does a stare from Blondie means.

The film is set in the Civil War period. The sequences involving it add significant subtext to the film. The beating of the Ugly, the death of the Union captain (played by Aldo Giuffrè) are heart shaking. The beating sequence in particular looks very brutal rather than the cheesy and crafted. This wasn't a norm then.

As for the music, hadn't it been Morricone's masterful score, this film wouldn't have felt the same way. Especially in the final duel, as the camera captures the stares and nervousness, the music elevates the anticipation to a different level altogether.

The Good , the Bad, and the Ugly is the film which can make anyone fall in love with the western genre. It's influence on westerns is inescapable.",10
27 August 2022,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly","Part of my western movie journey. What can there be said of TGTBTU that hasn't been already. This is the first time I've seen it fully, just a few memes here and there so I know a couple shots/scenes. The bias and the hype surrounding this movie is undoubtedly affecting my feelings towards it. But here we go. In comparison I rate this movie the same as the two that came before, both are great stories with solid acting and directing. TGTBTU wins an extra point for simply being the more technically sound movie out of the bunch.

I watched the Remastered version, though the versions of this movie are a mess. The version I watched didn't have the chicken scene nor the new and very ugly gun sound effects. This seemed like the very best version to watch. No unnecessary scene and the guns sound like they sound in the previous two movies and keep their iconic ''twang'' and ''whines'' imo.

The characters here are great but it puts a strong focus on Tuco, which coming into the movie from the previous in the Trilogy I did not expect. I expected Eastwood to get the most time and development. But no, Tuco really is the main character in my opinion as he get's the most ups and downs, the character development, and simply the most screen time. Blondie at times really feels like just a sidekick, though a sidekick that's ''in charge'' if that makes sense. Sentenza (Van Cleef) is fantastic but I wished he got more screen time. He disappears sometimes a bit too long. Tuco is a fine character, but he is erratic and a bit silly, I get how people would get turned off by his demeanor and dislike the movie a bit when the character gets so much time.

Music is ... well once again, I think I've said this with all 3 movies: Iconic. But the soundtrack you hear in this movie is what everyone thinks of when you say western. There's no stronger defining soundtrack for westerns than the one found here. And of course there's bias for it. But it is incredible. Used not too much, making you eager to hear it again.

Sound is much better overall in this. But still it tough to get through the louder scenes due to how bloated the sound gets. It's a sign of the times but also budget and a lack of attention to detail regarding sound as other movies in this era don't all sound like this. The dubbing is much better though.

Morality is also a fun aspect, as things are much greyer than they were previously. Blondie gets the ''good'' title but you quickly find out that ''good'' isn't as black and white as they make it seem. He still uses a criminal to make money from and his only goal is money. And kills bounty hunters who might be portrayed as nasty but as far as we knew are good men trying to catch a criminal. The ugly is just a bad person no doubt. And Sentenza, well, his prison camp practices obviously are what make him the most evil. But A paid hitman makes him no more evil than Blondie, and they all want money so you can't say that is the differentiator.

In a weird way as well this movie feels like the prequel to AFFOD because Blondie only gets his iconic hat and poncho later in the movie. The only problem would be the money he takes with him as that wouldn't give him reason to care for the small amounts of money in the AFFOD...or he's that addicted to making money. Anyways it almost could've been a prequel. Though either way this ''Trilogy'' is has many actors playing different characters you really have to split them apart anyways.

Now the question comes which of the three of the trilogy do I like the most, based on score it should be this but it isn't. It's a bit too long and a bit too much sideplot and focus on Tuco. I think Volontè is really the actor I missed. Van Cleef is a great villain, a morally somewhat grey villain but still and I guess Tuco is a villain as well. That said I like the balance of characters and actors a lot more in FAFDM and I think that is my favorite at this time. I'm sure to rewatch this trilogy but for now FAFDM is it.

Been a great experience watching the beginning of the spagetti westerns, now onto the next.",9
12 July 2012,The best western i've ever seen,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

19 February 2011,A classic standard,"One of the great ones. It is a ""dictionary movie"" by which all subsequent films of its kind are measured or defined. The music, the scenes, the characterizations, the action sequences... they are what makes a classic western. The spaghetti western trilogy not only launched a modern icon, Clint Eastwood, into stardom but by doing so ushered in a whole new era of film making. Even with the dubbed dialog and dated effects, it manages to remain a favorite of so many fans. That defines classic. I remember when I first saw this film. I wanted to be the man with no name. I wanted to wear the cape, wear the hat and ride the horse. It has stuck in mind for over 40 yrs. Now legendary composer Ennio Morricone demonstrated why he became what he is today. The international theme has been used countless times in countless forms of art. The film has staying power. It's classic good verses evil. Themes of greed, lust, power all reflect the human condition. And it is every bit as relevant today as it was set during the civil war times the movie is set in. The faces of the supporting cast are indelible. Where did Sergio find these guys?! All in all I would recommend this film to anyone who is a film lover. It is a bit violent at times but it's not gratuitous. Parental guidance is definitely suggested.",10
9 December 2006,Rollicking,"Beautifully shot and packed with a wickedly grim sense of humour this is one of the finest westerns this side of John Huston. Starring a stony faced don't-laugh-don't-blink Clint Eastwood and a crafty, weasely Eli Wallach it covers most of the genre's typical themes, albeit in a more gonzoid fashion, ranging from public hangings to duels and back.

Sergio Leone goes to great lengths to create just the right atmosphere, filming even the smallest rolling tumbleweed if it improved on his vision. Consequently this an epic of epic length, which is bound to put some people off.

However, the huge amounts of iconic moments, the sweeping Morricone soundtrack and the sheer wide-eyed sense of adventure it oozes turns it into a great slice of cinema.

13 May 2015,It amazes me that...!?!?,"It amazes me that the 'Italians,' or, anyone else, can make a better kick-ass American western than us Americans!?!? Sure! There are a lot of great American-made westerns, but, there were also restrictions in the US as to what can and cannot be filmed. This movie, being European, had none of that crap.

Clint Eastwood, apparently, wasn't being hired at American studios, so, he went to Italy and made ""A Fistful of Dollars"" (1964) for $15,000. Then, he made, in Italy, again, ""For A Few Dollars More"" (1965) for $50,000. CLASSIC SPAGHETTI WESTERNS! :) Then came this work of art! This CLASSIC COWBOY, ASSASSIN, WESTERN that bettered the last two SPAGHETTI WESTERN CLASSIC COWBOY, ASSASSIN WESTERNS - ""The Good, The Bad, and, The Ugly"" (1966)! In TWO(2) years, Clint went from making $15,000 a movie to $250.000 a movie...F'N WOW! If you're a movie buff, you're life isn't complete until you've seen this trilogy, all three Sergio Leone movies, and, especially, ""THIS"" movie.

Not only is this movie fantastic, the Spanish dry-lands are very much like that of Mexico and Texas. (Yes, this ""AMERICAN WESTERN CLASSIC"" was filmed (mostly) in Spain...and, by Italians!?!?) Rumor has it that Sergio Leone (Director - Genius!) was a real creep to work for. I read somewhere that Clint Eastwood was told this early on by Ennio Morricone (movie music composer - Genius)(and, a great lifelong friend of Clint Eastwood ever since they met); but, he also said not to let it get to him. Rumor also has it that Sergio Leone once said something to one of his actors for ruining a costume, and, the actor committed suicide by jumping from a window.

Either and/or anyway - this movie is a masterpiece! Sergio Leone, Ennio Morricone...and, Clint Eastwood (The Good), Lee Van Cleef (The Bad), and, last but NEVER least, Eli Wallach (The Ugly)...are a magical movie-making team! I wish they all made more movies together! :)",10
18 August 2015,An outstanding Western film,"Firstly, this movie is in fact the best Western film ever made. It is amazing but it isn't perfect.

After 3 men find out that $200,000 is buried under a gravestone, it leads them to race for it. They encounter many different things along the way including the civil war but eventually, they all meet up by the cemetery which leads to a duel.

Most famous trilogies as good as they were, never quite captured the charm of the original. But with Leone's ""the man with no name"" trilogy, the movies kept on getting better as it continued on.

Despite the fact that Clint Eastwood's character is labeled as ""The Good"", he is not much better than the other 2. It's not quite clear why this movie was titled that but it's open for interpretation.

The memorable and haunting score does a great job setting up certain scenes and it feels very ""Western"" to me too.

The characters are introduced excellently as always in the opening. The movie often only shows eye contact and body language to convey their personalities. In fact, not a single word is said in the first 10 minutes.

Leone has an environment of ""every man for himself"" as the characters constantly lie and backstab each other as much as possible.

The ending when all 3 characters get in a ""Mexican standoff"" is one of the tensest scenes in cinema. It slowly builds up by the haunting music and the shots of the 3 men getting slowly closer to their guns ready to draw them at any moment.

The only thing that bugged me about this movie is that it took 1 hour and 15 minutes for the film to introduce the inciting incident. So the first act is unnecessarily slow moving but that's the only thing I didn't like about this.

This is the best Western out there. It's not perfect but its remarkable shots and filmmaking make it a movie well worth viewing a second time.",10
7 March 2017,The Best Of The Trilogy,"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly (1966)

Plot In A Paragraph: 3 men forge an uneasy alliance to find some buried gold.

Eli Wallace is a lot of fun as Tuco ""The Ugly"" Lee Van Cleef is the epitome of cool as Angel Eyes ""The Bad"" and I'm not quite sure Clint's character fits the moniker of ""The Good"" as he is far from the conventional hero, but he is superb non the less.

Due to the success of the last two movies, Clint's paycheck had increased from $15,000 for A Fistful of Dollars to $50,000 for For A Few Dollars More and he would be paid $250,000 (more than the first movies entire budget) plus 10% of the grosses for this movie.

Once again, a Clint character takes an unusual amount of torture. On this occasion Tuco, making him walk through the desert without any water or shade from the sun. This is one of the most unbearable tortures endured by an Eastwood character. Worse than the beating by the Rojo's in A Fistful Of Dollars, maybe only his unenviable fate in The Beguiled will top this one.

Bringing Sergio Leone's trilogy to a triumphant close The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is a triumph on every level. Right from the brilliant opening to the classic edge of your seat finale. Everything is spot on. The budget was increased again, up to $1.2 million this time, and every penny is on the screen!! Brilliant sets and locations and once again everything is set to Ennio Morricone's brilliant (now iconic) score.

Along with Eastwood and Van Cleef, Benito Stefanelli and Aldo Sambrell return, again playing different characters.

Grossing $25 million at the domestic box office, the movie ended the year the 6th highest grossing movie of the 1966.",9
27 April 2020,"This is, without question, the greatest western film in cinema.","""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (1966), this movie gives you everything that a great western has to offer, and then some! I've seen a lot of western movies in my life, and I enjoyed the majority of them. But, none of them have ever come close to matching this one. Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects and a perfect soundtrack. The story at first glance just sounds like your typical hunt for gold. But, I assure you that it's presented in such a very fresh and unique way. One thing to point out, most western films usually have a duel scene at some point during the movie. This film has a three-way duel at the end, you're probably wondering: ""how does that work?"" Well, that's all I'm going to say about that. You'll have to watch the movie and see for yourself! The acting is nothing short of sublime from the whole cast. Clint Eastwood puts on a flawless performance as Blondie. Eli Wallach is fantastic as Tuco, the friend/enemy of Blondie. Lee Van Cleef is exceptional as Angel Eyes, the main villain. As for the rest of the cast, they are just as exceptional. The sets/locations are spectacular and give this movie a great atmosphere. All of the special effects are very well-done, and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Ennio Morricone is phenomenal. It is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of my top 10 all-time favorite film scores. My personal favorite parts of the soundtrack are: ""The Ecstasy of Gold"", ""The Trio"" and the main theme song is one of my top 10 favorite opening theme songs in any movie. The film score sets the tone right from beginning to end. That's one way you can tell that you have a phenomenal soundtrack, when you play it at any random point in the song itself and recognize what movie, or show, it's from. The soundtrack for this movie is nothing short of memorable and iconic, kudos to you, Ennio Morricone! ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is a cinematic masterpiece. Another thing, it's just shy of three hours long. But, I can promise you, the three hours go by in a flash. It doesn't even feel like three hours, yet it is. What more can I say? I could watch this film 1,000 times in a row and never get bored with it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you love western films, and you haven't seen ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" yet, what are you waiting for? Go and watch it today! I promise that you will not regret it.",10
22 November 2021,One word to describe this - MASTERPIECE,"If someone was to ask me ""What one film you need to see before you die"" my answer would be this.

Casting perfect. For me Eli Wallach performance was the better out of the three for me. Clint Eastwood did his thing to perfection, Cleef played the Bad guy as he does so well.

Scenery, Storyline and Score just perfect, as with all spaghetti westerns.

22 March 2019,"Bad, ugly & not much good","Unless your idea of a good time is to sit through nearly 3 hours of Eli Wallach mugging & cackling, give it a miss. Eastwood and van Cleef are classy as ever and the scenery is epic. The civil war references add interest. The Morricone motif is unforgettable. But it's twice as long as it should be, with endless scenes that contribute little. And after 30 minutes at most you'll be praying for someone to shoot the Wallach character in the head.

16 January 2013,Classic End to the Trilogy,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)

*** 1/2 (out of 4)

The final part in Sergio Leone's trilogy has three men racing against one another to locate $200,000 in Confederate gold. THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY has become one of the most loved Spaghetti Westerns out there and it's easy to see why because it contains all the style and violence that the genre has become known for. It's also easy to see why this film gained so many negative reviews when it was originally released but I think it's safe to say that its reputation of a classic isn't going anywhere. As with the previous two installments, Leone does a masterful job with the style of thing and especially the ending, which is clearly one of the greatest ever filmed. It's really amazing to see what Leone was able to do with the budget he had and the fact that he constantly tried to top the previous film in the series is something mighty impressive. I think most directors would have been happy with A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS but Leone managed to build on that and then build on FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are all wonderful in their parts and there's no question that the three of them and their chemistry is now legendary. The violence in the film is often graphic but it's also very realistic and fitting for the subject matter. Then there's Ennio Morricone's score, which is so iconic yet it still sends shivers down your spine each time you hear it. The action scenes are excellently put together including the terrific battle on the bridge as well as some of the comedy relief early on dealing with hangings. If there's one problem with the film I think it runs on way too long for its own good. Yes, I know many love the epic feel of the picture but I still think it runs on way too long in its extended version.",
22 November 2011,"If more westerns were like this, it would be my favorite genre.","Out of all the movies I have seen, this must be one of the few that I have seen over a dozen times already. And that's coming from a non western fan!

You clearly don't have to be a western fan to have a love and appreciating for this movie. Every movie lover in general should be capable of appreciating the quality, art and talent that is all present in this movie.

It's one of those rare movies in which everything comes together perfectly. The story, the directing, the acting, the settings, the music. Everything fits and works out perfectly. All elements strengthen each other as well. The music strengthens its images, the director its actors, etcetera. Would the movie had been just as good and unforgettable with a different cast? Or different music, or a different director? Probably not. It would be like replacing an instrument in a Mozart composition, or changing some of the colors in a Picasso painting. All of the elements need each other to become the great masterpiece that ""Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo."" is.

One of the reasons why I have always loved this movie is because it's buildup as a real adventurous movie, in which the hunt for a treasure plays a very central role. It takes the main characters to all kinds of different places, where they meet all kinds of different people and each time run into different problems as well. Really, this movie is basically an adventure movie, disguised as a western. It also really makes this movie unique in its genre and so extremely likable and easy to watch, time after time, despite its long running time.

Also the interaction between the three main character is just great. They often trade roles and alliances with each other and constantly try to be one step ahead of the other. They never thrust each other and for good reasons. None of the characters are truly good or bad, even though the title of the movie might suggest otherwise.

And needless to say that the three main parts are also perfectly cast ones. Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef all rarely have been better. And they also make it real difficult to pick a favorite character. Each of them has their own qualities and certain amount of charm and likability level to them.

There is also no big surprise in it that the movie is really skilfully directed and put together by Sergio Leone, who obviously was a master of the genre. He perfectly combines both visual and story elements, with an equal amount of eye for detail for both. He pretty much perfected the spaghetti western genre at the time pretty much on his own and his influences can still be seen back in modern movies now days.

One of his finest moments of course comes during its final shootout. But I actually think it are the movie its last 30 minutes in general that are just great, the moment Tuco first enters the cemetery. It's really something that's among the greatest moments out of movie history.

The shootout, or Mexican standoff, itself is really nothing short of brilliant. Its compositions, the editing, its close-ups, the Ennio Morricone music. Could had things been more perfect? It has such a great buildup, in which the characters are slowly moving and looking around at first. The music helps to buildup the tension, then it swells up and when you expect things to go down it goes suddenly entirely quiet. However then the music suddenly starts again and the buildup gets even more intense, with fast cuts and even more extreme closeups. Truly one of the best and most memorable movie moments out of movie history.

The only shame about this movie is that there are actually still people out there who haven't seen it yet!

7 May 2020,"Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo","The three hour plot is not tardy, it's full of fun. The characters are full-bodied and have distinct personalities. It's definitely the best work in western movies. With the elements of civil war, the intention of the film can be improved, the depth of thinking can be increased, and a relaxed and humorous atmosphere can be filled.

24 January 2021,"infinite/10, Please watch it","I've chosen to review a very amazing movie whose directors, players and music artists are pure legends, I am talking about the Sergio Leone, Eli Wallach, Lee Van Clef, Clint Eastwood and Ennio Morricone and the movie ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (Italian: Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo, lit. '""The good, the ugly, the bad""'). First, I would like to stress out the movie setting and its history. In the 1960's Western movies were becoming very popular, the Hollywood Westerns included heroes that were often well groomed, had nice clothing, had charismatic voices and shiny new guns, often times very good gunslingers that fought the bad guys and always won. The Spaghetti Western on the other hand was usually a low budget movie recorded in Italy, most often in Sicily, hence the name. Spaghetti Westerns were usually very violent and included not heroes but anti-heroes who usually worked for their own personal gain, this made the movies appear way more realistic. It is also noteworthy to say that that the music in the Hollywood Westerns was much simpler, chilling and relaxing, the music of the Spaghetti Westerns was almost always really energetic, took a lot of effort and increased in tone and frequency as the time went by. The last thing I would like to add is that we often think that the US Civil war was an entirely moral war, with the North being the good guys and the south the bad ones but even though most Hollywood Westerns' timeline happened in 1860's, the US Civil War was almost entirely ignored, this is contrasted by the Spaghetti Westerns who saw the neither side as good, they would show that both sides were bleeding each other dry and both sides committed atrocities, denying the enemy basic human rights. In this movie we find 3 main characters, the ""Good"", we do not know his name but he is often called ""Blondie"" by the ""Ugly"" who's known as ""Tuco"". The third character, ""The Bad"" is known by his alias ""Angel Eyes"". All of these 3 characters are excellent gunslingers and have 1 goal in life; personal gain. All the characters interact with each other in the movie, sometimes working together and sometimes trying to kill each other, often times by outwitting instead of using blunt force. The characters in the movie often don't use too much dialogue, but say more by saying less thus stressing out the important part. Lastly, I would like to talk about this movie's scenography and music. The music was mostly composed by 1 man; Ennio Morricone. The music rarely overlaps with the dialogue, which leaves the viewer to listen to what the characters say better. The director and the music artist had a talent of working together, there are scenes in the movie where the music is used primarily to build up tension and to incite action, for this reason the music is only used when the characters are or are acting silent for example: when characters are sneaking or are under threat. Overall, the movie is widely recognised as a masterpiece and I agree, every single moment is either deeply embedded to the storyline or is action based, one can start watching this movie from any timeline and still find it interesting. For all these unique factors the movie offers I can do nothing but recommend it for everyone to watch.",10
18 July 2001,"Gritty, dirty, and unforgettable","THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY is the premier western, right next to THE SEARCHERS. With dusty trails, bloody gunfights, executions by hanging, and the Civil War, these elements are greatly equal to the

terrific performances of the leads. Clint Eastwood is at his squinting, menacing self as the Man with No Name, or otherwise known as Blondie, the silent gunman. He is on the hunt for treasure hidden in a

Confederate cemetary, but not without some competition. Lee Van Cleef plays Angel Eyes, the sadistic soldier who is also after the treasure, and Eli Wallach also shines as the greedy Mexican bandito Tuco.

THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY is a surefire winner for fans of the Spaghetti Western, despite being a little overlong and a bit violent.

23 June 2014,Watch This Film,"A wonderful film despite any anachronisms that were used. This movie was not about trying to be an accurate account of history but instead was telling a good fictional story.

I am not a big fan of the western films but this one is very good. The move does not have an exceptional amount of dialogue but it didn't need any - the expressions on the faces of the characters as well as their actions tells the storyline.

This is one of my favorite Clint Eastwood films and is among my least favorite movie genres: western -- that is saying a lot.

If you have not seen The Good, The Bad and The Ugly - see it soon! And this coming from a person that is not into most cowboy flicks.

1 November 2021,Bloated and Aimless,"This is one of those movies that you simply don't dislike. Everyone who loves movies loves Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Well, my opinion of the film has honestly just degraded with time to the point where I throw this in, ready to rediscover the love for the film I saw in my youth, and instead I discover a bloated, aimless mess of a film.

I swear I'm not trolling. I genuinely think this.

I felt like For a Few Dollars More was a nearly ideal meld of style and somewhat minimal substance to create a high-quality entertainment. Leone had discovered that his style required small, focused storytelling, allowing him to spend large amounts of time on heightened moments that really drove the film's enjoyment. For the first half of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I had similar thoughts to the earlier parts of his previous two films. Leone was taking his time to introduce his characters and his world. It was more self-indulgent than previously, but it was still pretty consistently entertaining.

We have our three characters, the Ugly (Tuco, played by Eli Wallach), the Bad (Angel Eyes, played by Lee Van Cleef), and the Good (Blondie, played by Clint Eastwood). Tuco is introduced in the opening sequence where he shoots several men out to kill him before jumping out of a window and racing off into the wilderness. Angel Eyes' first scene introduces the actual plot when he shows up to a remote house with orders to kill a man after he extracts some information from him, the pseudonym of a man along with some extra bits about a cash box. Blondie executes a con with Tuco in his first scene where he drops Tuco off in a town for a cash reward and shoots out the rope that's to hang him before Tuco actually strangles, dropping him onto the horse below and letting him bolt off to freedom where the two will share the money. However, Blondie decides that Tuco really isn't worth it, robs him blind, and leaves Tuco in the desert alone.

This is all fine, solid, cinematic storytelling from Leone. It continues, if a bit self-indulgently, with Tuco crawling back to civilization and robbing a gun shop before heading towards Blondie. Eventually catching up, Tuco takes Blondie hostage and forces him to walk into the desert without water, enjoying every second of it, until they come across a seemingly abandoned Confederate stagecoach with a dying man who promises Tuco $200,000 for a drink of water. Fate makes it so that Tuco receives one piece of information about the money (the name of the cemetery) and Blondie receives the other (the name of the grave), with neither willing to give up the information to the other. However, they both need each other if they want that cash. This is also, of course, the man that Angel Eyes was looking for information on in his early scene.

Tuco helps Blondie convalesce in a monastery that will treat soldiers on either side of the American Civil War, and this is pretty much the exact point where I feel like the movie ends its promise. A quality scene between Tuco and his monk brother leads to Tuco and Blondie leaving the monastery to head towards the cemetery. And immediately they're sidetracked when they get captured by a random Union patrol because the pair are wearing the Confederate uniforms they picked up. The story was just about to move forward, and suddenly we have to watch the two go into the Union's answer to Andersonville, complete with a subplot that goes nowhere about the commandant deciding to investigate Angel Eyes (who is now a sergeant in the Union Army? Whatever) for stealing from the prisoners as well as mistreating them. We literally never see the commandant after the scene he declares that he's going to investigate, so what's the point?

What this prison setting is supposed to do narratively is to tell Angel Eyes that Tuco and Blondie have the information he seeks (the coincidences around this are rather large), and for Angel Eyes to learn enough that he just needs Blondie instead of Tuco when Tuco gives up the cemetery name. So, then they're off with Tuco set to be executed...somewhere else. Tuco manages to jump off a train with his large guard chained to him without anyone noticing, cutting the chains with the next train on the tracks. Yes, our story is moving forward again.

In a town being evacuated, Blondie and Angel Eyes, along with Angel Eyes' five men, rest for a bit until Tuco shows up. Blondie decides team up with Tuco, presumably because Angel Eyes can't be trusted and he needs to whittle down Angel Eyes' men (an echo of For a Few Dollars More). The scene where they take out the five men is...curious. Saved by luck several times including a man with a rifle having worse aim than Tuco with a pistol (while also having the jump on him) and a shell landing right next to two of the men right before they are going to fire into the backs of Blondie and Tuco, they eliminate Angel Eyes' men, and then we're off to the cemetery.

Except, that bridge sequence comes up. I still maintain that this sequence can be hard cut out of the film (though you'd need some ADR to get Blondie to give Tuco the name of the grave). It's a pointless sequence in terms of the actual story. Stopping the film completely so that we can get some obvious metaphor for the quagmire of Vietnam is bad enough, but then it stops making literal sense after a certain bit. Recalling The Bridge on the River Kwai, but without even trying to explain how two men could tie explosives to a bridge in broad daylight without being seen by the army looking straight at them, Blondie and Tuco blow up the bridge, ending the conflict, and letting them move onto the cemetery! Well, after Blondie has a tender moment with a dying soldier he's never seen before and expertly shoots a cannon at Tuco (twice!).

And then we get our famous ending of Tuco, Blondie, and Angel Eyes at Sad Hill Cemetery. Yes, this ending is great. It's peak Leone in an individual sequence with a fantastic use of a fantastic score by Ennio Morricone, but it took us a meandering three hours to get here.

I do not question the many, many people who hold up this film as one of their favorites and even their opinions of it being one of the greatest films ever made. I simply do not agree. There is no focus to this story. This is Leone going epic and having no idea how to do it. This is Leone wanting to say something about Vietnam but not really understanding how to actually integrate that message into the story at hand. This is Leone being given a huge budget based on the wild success of his previous two films and not really knowing what to do with all the resources.

There's definitely entertainment to be had, but it's all mired in the middle of a story that never comes close to gelling, especially in its second half. Robbing itself of any narrative drive or even a basic point, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly becomes a tedious struggle.",5
17 July 2002,"The funniest, but not the best","Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

26 July 2020,Not much to add to one of the greatest films of all time.,"Just phenomenal. After all these years, it just holds so well. Maybe some of today's so called elite directors should spend some time studying Sergio Leone, Akira Kurosawa and Stanley Kubrick among other great ones.

2 February 2020,It's a masterpiece,"Everything is just top notch. The acting, the plot, the special effects (for a movie made in 1966) and of course the music. The theme defines western movie music and everyone have heard the song atleast once. It's absolutely the best western movie ever made. I love it.

22 July 2014,Dated,"This mess of a yawner is dated, boring, interminable. Even the gratuitous violence is cheesy. Now we know why the Italian trend to make westerns did not last. And thank goodness for that.

Incidentally, I read the hate-filled, prejudiced, pretentious drivel posted by somebody from the Russian Federation, I think, with much amusement. Lord knows I am no friend of Hollywood, but I found this ... person' Cold War-like rant even more laughable than the film we're reviewing. He/she/whatever sounds like a leftover from the 70s, all Indian beads, bell-bottom pants, Ban-the-Bomb signs, psychedelic-print rayon shirts, anti-American braying.

Like the film in question: terribly dated.

10 November 2012,An Excellent And Unforgettable Masterpiece From Sergio Leone. The Greatest Film and Western Ever Made.,"The Good,The Bad and The Ugly is simply a masterpiece of cinema and is not only my favorite movie of all time but,in my opinion the greatest Western ever made and the greatest film ever made. From it's great direction,acting and score The Good,The Bad and The Ugly is a flawless masterpiece that you'll watch again and again.

TG,TB&TU tells the story of three gunslingers named Blondie(The Good,Clint Eastwood),Angel Eyes(The Bad,Lee Van Cleef)and Tuco(The Ugly,Eli Wallach)who are on the search for 300,000$ in gold coins. With Blondie and Tuco teaming up and Angel Eyes not far behind,the three gunslingers will stop at nothing to get the gold even if it means going through the civil war or traveling through sunny,dirty grind of the west. It's an unforgettable journey that the three men and viewers wont forget.

TG,TB&TU is a film I love for many reasons and one of the reasons is that it's a brilliant finale to the amazing Dollars or Man with no name Trilogy. With A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More,Sergio Leone brought brilliant direction,tension filled standoffs and gunfights and changed the Western forever. But With TG,TB&TU,Leone created an epic film something bigger and larger than the first two films. The gunfights and standoffs are given a much bigger scale and filled with more tension and excellence. TG,TB&TU also succeeds at being a great third film because where in most trilogies the third film is always the weakest,TG,TB&TU is one of the rare occasions in film history where the last film of a trilogy is the best one and tells a great story. Leone obviously wanted to top the first two films and he tops them both in a flawless way and with the greatest of ease. Also, TG,TB&TU is a different film from the first two where A Fistful Of Dollars was about fighting families and For A Few Dollars More was about two gunslingers trying to get an outlaw for gold dollars,TG,TB&TU is about a journey through the West and a Adventure about trying to find gold coins and traveling through Hell and high water to get it. This is the greatest third film ever made and in my opinion when filmmakers want to complete a trilogy TG,TB&TU is a film that should be the template on how to complete a trilogy. Another thing I love about this film and the other two films is the way Leone paints the west the way it was:dirty,dusty and ugly. When you watch the film as a viewer you'll feel like you're in the dust and dirt with the characters giving the film a realistic feel and making you feel like you're in the west. With this film,gone was the white hat/black hat good guy/bad guy characters of the American western films. The characters like Blondie and Tuco aren't painted in black and white,there is a gray area with both of them unlike Angel Eyes who is a clear cut bad guy with no gray area and is vicious from beginning to end. With these characterizations in Leone's trilogy the western film was forever changed and the Western genre after this film became much more gritty and dirty and whether Leone mean't it or not reinvented the Western. The Civil War scenes are breathtaking and gives the film a sense of realism where you feel like you're in the civil war with the soldiers. I also love the fact that Leone shows the Horrors of the Civil War,showing the viewer how dark,brutal and bloody the Civil War or War in general can be. TG,TB&TU despite it's epic running time of 163 amazing minutes moves at a great pace and there is not a wasted scene in the film. This is an epic that feels like it's shorter. The Action and violence in the film is excellent and done in a fast and stylish fashion and will truly blow your mind when the Action happens. The last 20-30 minutes are some of the best moments in film history. Remember when I talked about the great standoffs and shootouts in the first two films? Leone takes the standoffs of the first two films gives us a final,excellent standoff that fits with the films epic tone and is so masterful and truly unforgettable and will stay with forever. This film and the first two films are the reasons Sergio Leone is not only one of my favorite directors of all time but also one of the greatest directors of all time.

Clint Eastwood is excellent as Blondie(The Good),bringing an intensity with his eyes,snarl and image,but also bringing a level of depth to the character. Next to Dirty Harry Callahan,The Man With No Name is his most iconic character. Lee Van Cleef is amazing as Angel Eyes(The Bad),a ruthless killer who will kill anyone or do anything to get wants. Eli Wallach gives a brilliant and masterful performance as Tuco(The Ugly),with Wallach bringing humor,intensity and depth to the performance. A great performance.

Sergio Leone's direction is excellent and masterful,giving the film an epic scope and landscape. Leone's gunfights and action scenes are excellent and have great suspense and timing. I love Leone's close-ups in the film and you can see the expressions in the actors eyes and what they are thinking. Great job,Leone.

Ennio Morricone's score is brilliant,amazing and one of the greatest film scores in movie history. From it's masterful opening theme,the score is intense,memorable and iconic and Morricone's best score although Once upon a time in the West's score comes close. A flawless and unforgettable score from Morricone.

In final word,The Good,The Bad and The Ugly is a flawless masterpiece from beginning to end that will live on forever and stand the test of time. If you love Cinema and Westerns I highly suggest you buy this film and see it now. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10
9 September 2008,They don't make'm like this anymore,"Like many here have already said what can you say that hasn't been said over the years about this film.

Made in 1966 (67) it has weathered the years and still today holds any top ten slot for spaghetti westerns of any decade the world over. Very few films can hold a candle to the Good the Bad and the Ugly. Few indeed can say after 50 years we made a brilliant film that is still loved by millions. This is truly a great film. One of my favorite westerns that sits proudly in my collection right beside ""Once upon a time in the West"", ""My name is Nobody."" and well ""Two mules for sister Sara"", and a hand full of others with Clint staring as the Bad bleep gun fighter he is.

Absolutely beautiful in all regards. My two cents.

18 September 2009,"""In this world there are two kinds of people my friend.Those with loaded guns, and those who dig...""","To me, movies from ""Dollars Trilogy"" and after them, final movie ""Once upon a time in the West"" are the best westerns ever made. The question is, will anything exceed them ever if we are talking about westerns. Unlike mainstream Hollywood westerns from 1950s and 1960s that were showing us idealistic picture of wild west of 19th century, with lots of patriotism and propaganda,these sometimes called ""spaghetti westerns"" are something completely different. Somebody said-""John Wayne would never shoot to a guys back. Clint Eastwood would never have a problem with that."" This main difference between typical representatives of these two different kinds of westerns is what sets them apart.

It began with ""A fistful of dollars"" and continued with ""For a few dollars more"". With each next movie they were getting better and better. ""Good,bad,ugly"" is crown of all of them. Story about three men searching for 200.000 dollars in gold and without choosing ways to get them. This is a real story about wild west, story about real people without make up. People without almost any moral barrier, instead of idealistic characters shown in Hollywood westerns of that time who were unrealistic. In ""Dollars trilogy"" everything is based on interest- association,rivalry and fighting for money. Allies and enemies change over night depending on current interests. Characters of Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef were allies in ""For a few dollars more"" but enemies in ""Good,bad,ugly"". That was all based on interest.

Man without name or Good (Clint Eastwood) is typical anti-hero,but you somehow feel that he is a good one. We know nothing about his past (that gets revealed in ""Once upon a time in the West"" with Charles Bronson) but there is something in him that makes us wish to be the way he is. He is ready to take the punch,but when he strikes back no one stays alive. And he always manages to outflank them. Like the rest he does everything from interest, but he is iconic figure because of what he is. Bad (Lee Van Cleef) is real bad guy who chooses no way to find out where the money is. He is calculated and ready to do everything necessary to satisfy his greed.Man without any moral brakes. And Ugly (Eli Wallach) known as Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez also known as Rat is comical in his greed and lack of any moral barriers. Slave of his own ego and instincts. His life credo is-""When you want to shoot,don t talk,just shoot"". If he wants something, he wants it now. Man of revenge (""If someone double crosses me and leaves me alive,he understands nothing about Tuco.Nothing""). But he forgets about revenge if it comes to interest. In the end he is left with half of the money but stiff,scarred and angry which perfectly represents his personality.

All three characters are allies and enemies depending on current situation and their interests as we see throughout the movie. The question remains until the end-who is going to outsmart who? And when they found a money there comes that final scene of gunfight between all three of them. Camera shows us their faces and eyes-we see what they feel and their personality. Good-Cold blooded and self-confident knowing that he controls the situation and with advantage because he knows that Ugly has no bullets in his gun (because he put them of from his gun when they were sleeping) and he can concentrate on Bad, but Bad and Ugly know nothing about that so they have to concentrate on each other and Good, which puts them in difficult situation in favor of Good. Bad-Calculated and moving around thinking who is he going to shoot first-Good or Ugly? Ready to fire in any moment. And Ugly-Scarred and also thinking who to shoot first. He is in most difficult situation. Such a dramatic psychological scene. And everything is over in seconds,Good fires first and kills Bad,Ugly has nothing to fire with as he discovered in that moment with feel of anger about Good. What a perfection in filming. Good leaves with half of the money and leaves Ugly with another half to continue to hate him for the rest of his life. Film has excellent soundtrack-opening melody, melody when Ugly runs on graveyard searching for money and the best melody-scene of final gunfight. There are also other good melodies in movie. In my opinion ""Good,bad,ugly"" is second best western ever made after ""Once upon a time in the West"" which is first. Jim Carrey once said about Man without a name played by Clint Eastwood in ""Dollars trilogy"" and Charles Bronson in ""Once upon a time in the West"" that he is someone who we all want to be-""He has no name,so that everyone can put his own.""",10
2 July 2007,A true epic and one of the greatest films of all time.,"I saw this movie for the first time on my tiny 15 inch screen of my TV/DVD player, and even on this minuscule format I was still simply amazed by the sheer scope of it. Now I understand and acknowledge the usual complaints against the film, namely the fact that the movie is almost three hours long with many scenes that tend to drag on for minutes with little dialog or action, however it is these scenes that make the movie the masterpiece that it is. Every shot whether it be an expansive landscape or an extreme close-up Sergio Leone draws you into his own version of the old west. A world where three men chase each other across the desert in search of 100,000 dollars worth of Confederate gold. Along the way they encounter Yankee and Confederate soldiers, Mexican bandits, bounty hunters in a journey that culminates in one of the most riveting showdowns in cinema history. What I found most interesting about this film however was the influence it obviously had on modern filmmaker Quentin Tarentino. Many of his trademarks (very memorable characters, long shots centered on a single character, intense standoffs involving multiple characters) can be found in abundance in this film as well. In fact Tarentino's Kun Fu epic Kill Bill goes so far as to barrow multiple songs from Leone's Dollars Trilogy. In the end all this adds up to make The Good the Bad and the Ugly in my opinion one of the greatest films of all time.",10
27 August 2019,"""Blondieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!""","This is a story about the fight for the tresure between three mans.Blondie (The Good) Angel Eyes (The Bad)and Tuco (The Ugly). The most interest part is the duel at last. The Ugly was pretty ugly at the end.

4 March 2017,A Western Epic That Is So Good In So Many Different Areas,"Very rarely does a movie get a five-star ranking from me when it is lacking in the ""plot"" department. In the case of ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"", however, the meandering plot is only part of the overall experience.

For a basic plot summary, this movie is about three Civil War-era members of the ""Old West"" who are racing for a stash of hidden gold. Blondie (Clint Eastwood) is the ""strong but silent"" type, Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) is rotten to the core, and Tuco (Eli Wallach) is the scumbag that everyone loves to hate.

As far as the plot of the film is concerned, that is about all that needs to be said. It is the simplest of all possible premises and manages to meander its way to a three-hour runtime. Usually, I criticize films like this that don't ""get to the point"" a little quicker, but in this case I hardly noticed the diversions. The reasons? Everything else in the movie is so expertly crafted!

For example:

-Casting: Van Cleef was born to play the mean gunslinger, I've never seen a better role from Wallach, and I had forgotten (after watching many of his newer films) just how good Eastwood could be in a western. -Tension/Pacing: Even at three hours in length, the film manages to perfectly pace itself. The tension grows and grows as the gold gets closer and closer. -Music: Besides boasting a main theme that is now so iconic it probably gets overused in parody, the sound effects and when little bleats of music are actually used are even more important. Director Sergio Leone almost uses the music of the film as sort of another character in and of itself (complete with human-like attributes of humor and drama). -""Feel"": While unabashedly a ""western"", ""GBU"" doesn't look like a typical entry in the genre. This isn't your John Wayne ""saddle up pilgrim"" type of movie. It is called a ""spaghetti western"" (due to its genre roots in Italy), in which visuals, music, and atmosphere are used to tell the story as much as words. While the original entries in what is now known as the ""Man with No Name Trilogy"" are a bit too sparse (IMHO), this one strikes a perfect balance between ""actions and words"".

Overall, director Leone created a masterpiece with ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"". It is a different type of film-making, to be sure, but one that is brimming with tension. Eastwood has played a number of ""iconic"" roles, and this one stands up very well with the rest of them.",10
22 April 1999,Prefer OUTIW,"One of the best westerns ever made. My personal opinion is that it lacks the drama of 'once upon a time in the west', which makes 'the good' second best to me. 'the good' has more humor, action and plot twists in it, but less scenes that make me shiver (except from the final shootout, which tremendously builds suspense). This is surely a 'must'.

19 April 2023,The Greatest Western of All Time,"There is no doubt that the Spaghetti Western genre saved what was a dying Western genre. It represents the birth, or at least one of the births, of the anti-hero in Hollywood. There are not many films where the word classic applies more than this one.

Sergio Leone's direction here is just perfect. No man understood the Western genre more than he did. The movie is a perfect combination of fun, serious, and thrilling. It is perfectly written and perfectly acted. The real story here however, as most people know, is the score by Ennio Morricone. This man defined the theme of the Western Genre. No filmmaker/composer would ever be able to create a Western that did not sound like Ennio Morricone's theme. It is just perfect. Clint Eastwood does an incredible job as you expect, but it is the performance by Eli Wallach that steals the show for me.

I avoided spoilers in this review because I want to try and attract a younger audience to films like these. Almost every film fan has heard of and most likely seen this movie, but there is a definite reluctance from the younger generation to watch older films. This makes sense given the popular films in the modern day, but it makes no sense if you have ever watched this film. If you are reluctant to watch older movies, this is a perfect place to start. It may open a world that you never knew existed.",10
1 October 2004,"The Good,The Bad,and The Ugly","This film is mindless even blind as to the evil done at the expense of the war between the states.It rates very low as to intelligence even possessing a lack of credibility.When I had the opportunity to first view this film in the fall of 1969 there was very little to say about this film that meant anything because the film was junk,however there was one area of the film that even to friends I expressed admiration,and that was the musical score.I thought then that what I had heard till that point in time was the best movie soundtrack I had ever heard.Though time has passed it still rates as a great soundtrack.I can recall looking for the soundtrack and indeed it was the purchase of the soundtrack that I felt the film was worth however some of the film is unmistakable in its relation to the soundtrack and had I not seen the film I may not of ever been able to know this soundtrack the way I did and even do to this very day.I think the soundtrack is excellent and maybe worth its purchase without having to view this film,that is really all this means and perhaps should mean, a great soundtrack accompanying a depraved and gross film.",1
19 September 2021,The King Of Westerns.,"A good Clint Eastwood, a bad Lee Van Cleef and an ugly Eli Wallach carry Sergio Leones masterpiece to greatness.

This is a true classic with timeless perfomances and of the most epic moments in cinema history. It's of course the final duel between the trio. Not to mention The Good, The Bad And The Ugly has one of the greatest soundtracks ever, composed by the great Ennio Morricone, who in my opinion composed some of the greatest movies themes ever: ""The ecstasy of gold"", Main theme and ""The Trio"" theme.

The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is one of the most important movies ever made and all the westerns you watch are partly inspired by this film (even Quentin Tarantino says this is one of the most inspiring movies, it's also one of his favourites).

The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is the best western ever made and one of the greatest movies ever.

13 September 2020,There is No Western Film Better than This Nor There will be Ever!,"*Cool and Menacing Gunslingers, Interesting Plot, Thought Provoking Scenerios, Stylistic Gunfights, Epic Music with Mexican Standoff and Treasure Hunt! - The Greatest Western Ever Made in the History of Cinema!

*""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" is a 1966 Italian Epic Spaghetti Western Film Directed by Sergio Leone. Based on a Story by Luciano Vincenzoni and Sergio Leone. Starring Clint Eastwood as ""the Good"", Lee Van Cleef as ""the Bad"" and Eli Wallach as ""the Ugly"". Main theme of the Film is Greed. Also it has Cruelty, Violence, Anti War theme. And as the Story progresses, The line Between Good,Bad and Ugly becomes Blur and with some Gray shade the characters become More like Anti Heroes. Nobody is Totally Good or Bad or Ugly, maybe Lee Van Cleef's Character is Totally Bad but you get my Point. As Leone noted that Like many of his Films, this is also a Satire on Western Genre, more like Satire on Old West Romanticism. It shows the More Violent, More Complex Old West. It has been Called the Definitive Spaghetti Western.

*The Plot revolves around Three Gunslingers, a Cynical and Confident Bounty Hunter only known as Blondie, a Ruthless, Sadistic Mercenary called Angel Eyes and a Fast-talking Cunning Mexican Bandit called Tuco. Set in 1862, During the American Civil War, the three of them Compete to Find Fortune in Gold Buried in a Cemetery. The Plot is very Simple. As the Story go Forward, They land in Many Difficult Situations and Gunfights. The Character Development of The Movie is Perfect. Every Scenes of Tuco And Blondie is just Great and Funny. Some Scenes like Tuco meeting his Brother, Tuco buying Revolver, Angel Eyes torturing Tuco with the Music in the Background, Tuco and Blondie meets the Alcoholic union Captain in the ongoing war on the Bridge, The Mexican Standoff Between the Trio are just Epic. Every Scene and Dialogue of the Movie is Great and I Love Every bit of It. The Cinematography was great too with the use Of Classic Leone Long Shots and Close-up.

*Sergio Leone is the Master of Western Films. By his Films, He expanded the Spaghetti western genre and Became an International Sensation. This film is The third of the ""Dollar Trilogy"" or also known as ""The Man with No Name Trilogy"", Starring Clint Eastwood as the Titular Hero. Although the Story is not Related in the Trilogy, the Films are - 1) A Fistful of Dollars 2) For a Few Dollars More 3) the Good,the Bad and the Ugly. I love the trilogy but This is my most Favorite films of All time. As I said Earlier, this is the Greatest western ever made, with ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" comes as close second, Another one of Sergio Leone. I also love his less Popular ""Duck, You Sucker"", it was a Great western too. American Westerns didn't come close to this, but ""The Magnificent Seven"", ""Stagecoach"", ""Rio Bravo"", ""High Noon"" were some Great Competitors.

*The Actors - Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach did a Phenomenal Job. Nobody Will ever forget their Acting,Character after Watching the film. Clint Eastwood is the Most Stylish, Cool Western Hero Ever. His Mannerisms, Quiet Behavior, Menacing Look, Cigar-Smoking Gunslinger is Immortalized. Lee Van Cleef also Acted in Many westerns as Positive and Negative Characters, but this is the Most great Character He Ever Played. As everybody that saw the film, will Agree with me, that Eli Wallach stole the Show as Tuco! He also had the Most Scenes to work too and He nailed it Perfectly as the Comical but Cunning Bandit. The Supporting Casts did Great too, specially Aldo Giuffre as Alcoholic Union Captain, Mario Brega as Corporal Wallace, Luigi Pistilli as Father Pablo Ramirez.

16 November 2014,Epic,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo."" (1966) is epic picture in every meaning of this word. I saw it couple of times, and although i like ""Unforgiven"" better, ""Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo."" is a true western, one of the movies that make the genre famous. Acting is very good here, cinematography is amazing, directing, settings are top notch. It's a long movie, and it takes it's time to tell a full story, but it's a very rewording experience. But the scope of this movie is simply epic.

Overall, ""Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo."" is one the best if not the best westerns ever made, it's captivating from start till finish, it's superbly crafted, well acted and combined with unforgettable musical score it's a genre classic.

15 August 2005,"Amusingly campy, but a great movie?","There is something amusing about the Italian fascination with the wild West, the absurd over-the-top score, the cheesy sound effects (at one point, one of the bandits sounds like he's walking across a marble floor in high heels), even the obsessive closeups of Eli Wallach's dentition. Less amusing is the relentless glorification of brutality and exaltation of greed--I can watch the NFL any time, I don't need a movie for that.

The campy fun of this movie is dampened by the knowledge that it has somehow been mistaken for a classic. All the characters are pretty equally repellent, unless you count Clint's gesture of giving his coat to a dying man 2 hours into the movie...in fact, this seems to be the only point where the movie even considers anything resembling humane values, and it's really not enough.

And the title is mistranslated. In English, ""the X,"" where X is an adjective, doesn't refer to an individual who is X, it refers to a class of people, and is always plural. The movie should have been ""Good, Bad, and Ugly"" or ""The Good One, the Bad One, and the Ugly One.""",4
27 August 2015,perfectly constructed iconic film,"Three gunslingers compete to find a fortune in a buried Confederate gold amidst the violent chaos of the American Civil War.

One of the greatest Westerns ever made. While Spaghetti Western For a Few Dollars more is debatably the better tale, The Good the Bad and the Ugly is grander in scale and scope (thanks to Director of photography Tonino Delli Colli) with the main characters even getting caught up in the New Mexico Campaign of 1862 complete with war camps, prisoners and an exploding bridge.

Clint Eastwood returns to the genre as protagonist Blondie (aka The Man with No Name) along with Lee Van Cleef who this time plays Angel Eyes (The Bad). Both Eastwood and Cleef are outstanding with Sergio Leone's 1966 offering benefiting from the addition of Eli Wallach who delivers a sterling and memorable performance as Tuco Ramirez (The Ugly). The characters written by Age & Scarpelli, Luciano Vincenzoni and Leone (with additional material provided by an uncredited Sergio Donati) are well defined archetypes which are constructed perfectly.

The Good the Bad and the Ugly has one of the greatest crescendo building endings ever and the film is complete with Leone's perfectionist directorial trademarks. Ennio Morricone's iconic theme completes the package as the score complements the three players double crossing each other throughout to the closing Mexican Standoff.

You can feel the heat and taste the dust in this highly influential recommended Western.",
4 March 2019,So slow for Clint's earlier movies.,"I've been diving into Clint's spaghetti westerns lately. I've been looking forward to finally seeing this one. It started slowly, but most of them do. But this dragged on for what seem like hours.

I'm glad it's off my list. But I'd say it's one if his drier and more dull ones.

14 September 2007,An incredible film,"It is already a long time ago, I have seen this film for the first time. I think it was sometimes in the eighties. The impression was good but not excellent. But until now i have seen this film so many times!! And I must say, with every looking, this film gets better and better. I have also seen the two other films of the ""Dollar""-trilogy and this film is the best by far. The sense of humor of this film is the key factor. Especially the performance of Eli Wallach is outstanding. For me the best actor ever. On the one side there are great actors (Eli Wallach, Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef) and on the other side there is a remarkable storyline. It's a story about three ""criminals"" who are playing some tricky games during the war between the South States and the North States. All in all its a very entertaining film with much suspense and great music! 10 points out of 10!!

23 August 2014,One of the greatest Western Films ever made that stands tall even today.,"One of the greatest Western Films ever made that stands tall even today.

There is an element of thrill right form the first frame till the last in this film. Mind you, this has a running time of nearly 3 hours (177 minutes to be precise). Thus, the greatness can be attributed to the fact that this film keeps a viewer engaged for such a long time. I watched this film a couple of time before and was always awed by the technical aspects of this film. When I finished watching it just now, I was thinking how a small story can be made into a grand script and then into a magnum opus too. It takes the vision of a director and his team. Sergio Leone definitely had that.

The music is iconic from Ennio Morricone and the theme music is great and the soundtrack is just terrific. The cinematography which was done as a cinema scope film in the desert and wastelands of New Mexico state is just amazing. Technically this film is flawless I must say and there is a touch of greatness too. Yes, this is taking forward the good work done in an earlier film ""For A Few Dollars More"". But the grandeur is something that's enticing.

The characterization is slick and straight, it's not complicated but very simple. Good plays good and Bad plays bad while Ugly struggles to be something in between. Ugly is perhaps the most interesting character in the three who does a wonderful job. Eli Wallach as Ugly is just impeccable.

Clint Eastwood, who plays the Hero is a master of style and he shows it here. With minimal dialog and mostly through the looks of his eyes, he conveys a lot. From the way he lights his Cigar to the way he triggers his gun, his style is unmatchable and indeed inspiring. I suppose, his style is replicated by many actors later.

Sergio Leone, has given one of the best cowboy films indeed. Also, he has given one of the finest films in terms of characterization, style, cinematography and music. I loved it and this film will be there and watched over by many generations. A 5/5 for this.",10
27 September 2020,BEST film I've ever seen,"There are so many dimensions to this film, it's hard not to write an essay. The characters are intense, the music touches your soul and the style is second to none. Directing at its finest.

20 May 2018,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger

Sergio Leone is a master at creating amazing westerns. This film is one of his best. The story is full of tense moments. The characters are so complex and the dialogue is amazing. The scenery is beautiful and the music adds so much to the tension of the film.

The acting is great. Clint Eastwood was born to be a gunslinger. In this film he shines as Blondie. Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef also perform exceptionally well.

The pacing is perfect. Leone takes his time created the characters and rising the tension.

The film is quite old and some of the special effects and violence is outdated. All in all, this film is very good.

Pros: Tense and perfectly paced story, complex characters, amazing dialogue, beautiful scenery, great use of music that adds to the tension of the story, amazing acting, and great acting by Clint Eastwood

Cons: The violence in the film is outdated

2 June 2003,A grave full of dollars,"The absolute best western ever made. My admiration and pure love for this film grows as the years pass. I've seen this at least 50 perhaps more times and never tire of it. I love Red River, The Searchers and the Wild Bunch but as great as they all are they're a distant second. To start with the score is mesmerizing haunting and beautiful. This film is funny, sentimental and very unique in its style and mood. Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef are the coolest antagonists ever matched in cinema however it is Eli Walach who steels the film in a very much underrated unforgettable performance.

Like all of Sergio Leone films there is a very thin line that occasionally is crossed on both sides of good and evil.

Tuco ` Walach ` is the center of three of the most greedy ruthless characters you will ever see yet you care about him and feel his pain when he is scorned by his brother for the path he has taken in his life. Only in the extended Italian version does Angel Eyes ` Cleef ` show any humanity as he enters a confederate hideout and displays compassion for badly wounded soldiers otherwise he is a bloodthirsty killer. If Blondie ` Eastwod ` is truly good were all going to heaven.

It's not only a great western but it is my favorite Civil War film as well. Aside from the Spanish terrain the costumes, uniforms, buildings and weapons are the most historically accurate I've ever seen on film. Leone does a great job of creating the look and mood of the time even better than any American production. Its beyond my comprehension how this film was produced for only a million dollars of which 250k went to Clint.

If there is anyone left out there in the world that has not had the pleasure of seeing it I envy you the thrill of seeing it for the first time. Below are SPOILDERS of my favorite scenes in the film. The order does not represent preference.

Angel Eyes riding at the opening of the film & Morricone's background score.

The announcing of crimes as Tuco is about to be hung ( hysterical ) done twice

Tuco robs a gun shop (hysterical)

If you're going to shoot, shoot don't talk! (hysterical)

Tuco and three men come to kill Blondie in his hotel room. There are those with spurs who come by the door, Tuco does the sign of the cross, and those who come by the window!

Tuco meets his brother after years of separation

Blondie helps comfort a dying soldier

Tuco searching for Arch Stanton's grave, Moricone's score

The final showdown between the GB&U.",10
6 January 2015,Absolutely unforgettable,"This is one of the rare movies that bring joy to my heart when I re-watch it once every 2-3 years.

At the basis it has a very straightforward adventure story about the treasure hunt. But it is the sophisticated embellishments that stand out - character development, brilliant acting, intelligent script and sharp dialogues, memorable score, fantastic photography, attention to historical detail, concealed humour, - the ingredients one may enjoy as a whole dish or give attention to and taste separately.

Rather disparagingly called ""spaghetti western"" this movie stands well above most classical westerns, which seem simplistic, brutish, witless and lacking self-awareness in comparison - all up until Clint Eastwood' ""Unforgiven"".

20 September 2020,"Il Buono, Il Migliori, Il Perfetto","There is one word to define The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. And that word is ""transcendent"". This movie is not only the pinnacle of the Spaghetti Western, but it transcended into the pinnacle of the Western genre in itself. It's safe to say it transcends that too, and can be considered one of the greatest pieces of filmmaking ever. It counts with memorable performances by three different leads, a story that breaks the ""black and white"" concepts of morale, and an original score that can only be defined by ""epic"".

Directed by the man responsible for the revitalization of the western in Italy, Sergio Leone, the film does an incredible job of introducing every character, and showing each and every one has a dubious concept of moral values. ""The Bad"", Sentenza, or Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), is shown to be a ruthless, greedy gun for hire, but also someone who lives by the mantra of always getting the job done. ""The Ugly"", Tuco, is a greedy backstabber, but he is also a man who comes from an extremely poor environment and family conflicts, showing a bit of determinism in the film. ""The Good"", Blondie (Clint Eastwood) is not much better himself. While he is surely the less greedy one, he also has no problem with killing and backstabbing other people. To put it in perspective, he is ironically announced as ""The Good"" right after abandoning a man to die in the desert. The story follows all these three personalities as they engage in their particular gold rush: a buried treasure that is hidden in a cemetery. In order to find it, they must form an uneasy alliance, while trying to outrun each other, and claim the prized gold alone. All of this while the Civil War happens around them. The performances are nothing short of amazing. It goes to show the range that Lee Van Cleef had once this villainous role is compared to his work in the previous installment of the trilogy, For a Few Dollars More, as a heroic, friendly and almost fatherly figure. His presence is as intimidating as ever, and one of the best he has given in his lengthy career. Eastwood is as eye-catching as one would expect: his deep stares and lines delivered in a whispery, yet gravelly voice, defined The Man With No Name. But the best of the bunch has to be Eli Wallach. His comedic timing is as precise as any bullet shot in this film. But the most outstanding part of his characterization is that while he is extremely funny, he also manages to be a credible threat for the ""hero"", Blondie.

The original music score for this film deserves a whole book just to talk about it, and it still wouldn't do it justice. It's simply a lesson by the maestro, Ennio Morricone, on how music can change a film. Thanks to a track such as L'estasi dell'oro (The Ecstasy of Gold), a man running around a cemetery becomes one of the most epic scenes ever made. Thanks to a composition such as Il Triello, three men staring at each other, pondering their options for seven minutes straight, becomes tense enough to have the viewer on the edge of its seat. There is simply no other way to put it: Morricone crafted one of the best scores in this art's history.

At the end of the day, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is more than just a great western film. It's a show of great acting, writing, directing and music scoring. It's a real once in a lifetime classic, that has been around for a long time, and not aged a little bit, and will still be talked about for generations of cinephiles to come. To conclude, all I can say is... There are two kinds of people, my friend. Those who have watched this film, and those who have not. You watch.",10
2 April 2020,Poor movie,"I don't understand how or why anyone would classify these ""spaghetti"" westerns as classics.

Atrocious acting, words not matching the speakers mouth, poor sound quality, silly plots, etc.

Because Clint Eastwood is in these, we are supposed to view these as classics?!

No thanks. Poorly done movies.

21 August 2014,One of the greatest movie i have ever seen!!!!!,"In the last and the best installment of his so-called ""Dollars"" trilogy of Sergio Leone-directed ""spaghetti westerns,"" Clint Eastwood reprised the role of a taciturn, enigmatic loner. Here he searches for a cache of stolen gold against rivals the Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless bounty hunter, and the Ugly (Eli Wallach), a Mexican bandit. Though dubbed ""the Good,"" Eastwood's character is not much better than his opponents -- he is just smarter and shoots faster. The film's title reveals its ironic attitude toward the canonized heroes of the classical western. ""The real West was the world of violence, fear, and brutal instincts,"" claimed Leone. ""In pursuit of profit there is no such thing as good and evil, generosity or deviousness; everything depends on chance, and not the best wins but the luckiest.""

27 September 2022,Big and epic in every sense !,"I've seen this movie many times. I always enjoyed it. Surely, it is long; some sequences are truly challenging the audience's patience. On the other hand, it might be why this movie has stood the test of time, because it does things slowly but surely, and masterfully.

The film consists of vignettes i.e. The characters go through a series of self contained various situations. The overall plot is that they're travelling through America, in the mist of the Civil War to find a buried treasure. Vignettes is the understood term for this form of storytelling, however a vignette is a very small image, barely larger than a stamp. Here, given the tone and tempo, it almost feels appropriate to describe them as frescoes. This film is big and epic in every sense.

It is a Western, in the sense that it has cowboys, revolvers and horses. Yet, it actually is a fully blown war epic, and our protagonist travel between both sides. Sergio Leone's whole approach with Westerns was both a sobering look but also a farce. It was at the same time: a mirror of the projected American image and a satirical riff of that image. If we push that metaphor, these films are like distorting carnival mirrors.

Ironically, that exaggerated hyperbolic look feels very real. Which is telling of how fake and superficial the Hollywood Westerns were but also how correctly the Italian films captured the essence of the Old West and of that Frontier spirit. It feels more real and authentic and spiritually meaningful than any other film of that genre and most of cinema in general. Because it is so effortlessly a farce of the previous standards and a challenge of our preconceived notions; it allows itself to be a better representation of reality. Not only does it better encapsulate the idea of the Far West it also better represents the idea of America itself.

Here in particular, the theme of the Civil war itself is treated realistically and as a rebuke of the dominant (""American mainstream"") narrative. It is done by mainly showing the Rebels as victims or losers and by showcasing a very brutal prison camp run by the North. I don't get the feeling that this movie is apologetic of the Southern cause, or that it tries to re-write history. If the film has a core message it certainly could be that ""War is Hell"" no matter on which side of justice you are. Yet, it allows us the viewer to empathise with the characters, the men that fought and died not just with the armies or the sides.

Those are the kind of things this movie makes you think of. It is rare for a film, especially a Western, to show the bad guys having humanity and showing that the good guys were not always good or rightful or motivated by pure and noble intentions. Obviously, those concepts are discomforting and challenging. Yet, it works because the film does it sincerely.",9
7 February 2015,Let me see can I get the music!,"It goes like this: Pa pa pa pa pa paaa paaa paaaa pa pa pa pa pa paaa paaaa, ouehee oeeehee etc. I think I am the first reviewer who tried to imitate what is the most memorable part of this film its music.

A lot of things have been written and said about this film, from how Clint Eastwood holds his cigar to this memorable music. Since I have nothing to add to make this film even grater then it is, let me tell you an anecdote. One of my older friends who do not know how to use youtube yet and he knows that I own a copy of this film asked me to lend it to him. I asked him why he wanted to watch it after so many years, he saw it so many times. He said without hesitation: Music!

15 February 2010,Just WOW!,"So I'll start by saying that when I was younger, I did not see this movie. In fact, yesterday evening was the first time in my life I watched it...

I love the movies from the present, movie's like Casino Royale, Avatar, Mission Impossible III. But after seeing this movie, I guess all those movies are almost nothing to me anymore. Let me say, that I have never watched a western movie, or anything with Clint Eastwood.

So after the first half hour of watching, I had to stop, but I couldn't. I was so absorbed by the whole setting, music, events... I actually forgot this was a movie. I found it beautiful the way the 3 main characters were introduced, because it was so epic. All I kept doing, was smile during the movie, because of its cleverness. And knowing this was the base for every nowadays western movie, I felt like watching the best movie ever.

I really liked the role of Eli Wallach(Tuco) as he was very convincing to me as this antagonist, but also sort of hero. But the star was Eastwood. I just know that he was the perfect guy as Blondie. He acted cool, and did a splendid job at that. Kudos, sir Eastwood! I have come to the conclusion that this movie is my second favorite, and even Avatar can't top this!",9
7 March 2005,35 years waiting,"It is so rewarding to be able to see this: after 35 years my favorite movie ever has made it into the top 20 as voted by IMDb readers. It is the more rewarding if we consider that this single movie made me a cinema lover in the first place, a Clint fan in the second, and has kept me tied to a screen for the best part of 35 years.

But to all the young cinema-goers who read this and might be wondering why I say this, I must remind them that in 1970 Leone was not, repeat, was not, the mythical director that he is today, and Clint not only hadn't won any Oscar, on the contrary, most of the critics were just killing him for the same reasons the whole world loves him today. The guy can't act, of course his directorial debut (Play misty for me) is not SO bad, but sure he won't make it on the long run, etc.

If you told the Kaels, Eberts or Denbys of that time that one day TGTBTU would be considered not only the BEST WESTERN EVER, but among the 20 best films ever, they would have had a diabetic coma. I remember writing to Spanish movie magazines to make sure they gave TGTBTU its due, only to be scorned at and being said you guy better change hobbies, maybe chess, bird spotting or something, because as a cinema-as-art reviewer you're pitiful.

Of course today this seems a heresy, but I assure you, down in 1970 spaghetti westerns were very ""seriously panned"" and considered to be a sub genre in any branch of the 7 arts, down there with graffiti or comics, or steel drum music.

It has taken a whole new generation of moviegoers and the expansion of DVD to reverse this long standing apprehension about TGTBTU. Thanks to them this absolute master piece of cinema has been enshrined where it belongs, where it has belonged all these 35 years, but now at least there's a way to certify it and make sure it will remain there forever.

And Clint, read my words, one day you will win the best actor Oscar, and that'll be it.",10
24 November 2020,A very rare 10 out of 10 from me. Reasons: Clint Eastwood plays the 'lone gunslinger' better than anyone and the soundtrack,"The Good The Bad and The Ugly is the last of the of Sergio Leone's 'Dollars Trilogy', in sequence:

Per un pugno di dollari (1964) (A Fistful of Dollars)
Per qualche dollaro in più (1965) (For a Few Dollars More)
Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966) (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly)


Of these, for me, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was the best. Having first seen it at a young age in the 80's and many times since then I have always enjoyed it.

So the Good, the Bad and the Ugly:


I would be surprised if anyone hasn't been given the chance to see this as it is often on TV, but if you haven't seen it and are looking for a good adventure in the western genre, then this is recommended.",10
29 July 2021,bare but too negative,"This movie is bare, meaning does not hide basic human problems like fear, hunger, betrayal, desperation like most modern movies. Although exactly for that reason I would not recommend any desperate people to watch it. Not good for poor people, sick people, people in trouble or sensitive. It just adds to our worry, and shows negative and brutal reality how it is or how it was. Feeling of survival and desperation dominate. Also too long like most oscars unfortunately.

13 March 2014,Epic! Leone was a true visionary! Wallach steals the show!,"Unless you hate spaghetti Westerns, this film needs to be in your collection. It's a classic tale of greed, backstabbing, strategy, and dumb luck. If you ever want to really understand a director like Quentin Tarantino, you need to watch at least one Leone film. Leone was a visionary! This is my favorite of the ""Dollars Trilogy"" thematic series. Eastwood and Van Cleef are completely badass in this one, but Wallach steals the show as Tuco! The cinematography is awesome, Ennio Morricone's score enhances the action and tension, and this film starts and ends epicly.

Good?? Good?? Just got round to watching it today as it is nearly three hours long and was amazed at how fantastic it was. I was hooked from the opening credits (well who can't be with THAT theme tune!!!!) I loved every minute of this film. Awesome acting, brilliant location and breathtaking musical score!! Could easily have gone right back to the start and watched it all over again. I actually watched The Godfather the day before and really wasn't that impressed with it. This movie should be number one for sure. It's really tense, edge of your set viewing. If you haven't seen it, I fully recommend it. Absolutely mind blowing!!!

21 July 2008,My Favorite Film of all Time,"When I first watched The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, I wasn't aware that it would turn out to be my favorite film of all time. I was never a huge fan of the Western genre until I watched this film and was perpetually astounded. This film sets the standard for so many other Westerns and other great films, in general. And some of the best scenes in film history are all in this wonderful film.

The story depicts three men, portrayed as good, bad and ugly, and their constant interactions with one another, in their attempts to find a stash of gold somewhere in the desert. I won't spoil any of the story here, but the film develops these characters magnificently and introduces all sorts of conflicts for these three characters to tackle. The actors themselves who portray these characters do an outstanding job. Clint Eastwood as the Man with No Name or The Good does a brilliant job and shows that he was and continues to be at the very vanguard of the Western genre. Eli Wallach as the opportunistic and savage Tuco or The Ugly, does an excellent job inspiring disgust, sympathy and pity, sometimes all at once. And Lee Van Cleef plays his role marvelously giving us a true canon villain and a great ingredient to the already spicy mix of Eastwood and Wallach.

The shots in this film are breathtaking as Leone shoots wide, panoramic shots of the Southwestern desert and gives the viewer a feeling of the openness and freedom. Shot during the Civil War, Leone captures the struggle and violence of the conflict in a multitude of scenes. I won't spoil one scene in any way, but Leone creates a devastating image when Eastwood and Wallach find themselves in a Union camp. Leone has shown that Westerns can be visually beautiful as well.

The film really pushes the genre and gives all sorts of depth to the characters and the plot. Ultimately, Leone gives the viewer one of the most intense and satisfying climaxes in film history. I assure you that you won't be disappointed. The film contains so many archetypes of the old West but also new, fresh and shifting paradigms that we, now in the present day, consider standard. There is just so much to like about this film that I can't really present in words. One thing I'll say is that despite the large amount of stale and same Westerns, this one stands out as something unique and truly is something special. Like I said, this is my favorite film of all time on a hotly contested list and while I'm not sure if that'll change in the future, this film will continue to endure and is a beautiful Western and a beautiful film, in general.",10
5 August 2001,Clint Eastwood style,"Truly the greatest western ever made. This film captures the reality of the west not like those John Wayne films. This film show cased what people would do for money. If you haven`t seen this film I strongly recommand this film because it`s by far the most ambitious, unflinchingly graphic and stylistically influential western ever mounted. The film is an engrossing actioner shot through with a volatile mix of myth and realism. Clint Eastwood returns as the invincible ""Man with No Name,"" this time teaming with two gunslingers (Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef) to pursue a cache of $200,000 and letting no one, not even warring factions in a civil war, stand in their way. From sun-drenched panoramas to bold, hard closeups, exceptional camera work captures the beauty and cruelty of the barren landscape and the hardened characters who stride unwaveringly through it. Forging a vibrant and yet detached style of action that had not been seen before, and has never been matched since, ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" shatters the western mold in true Clint Eastwood style. Now with the plot being said all I have yet to say is that Clint Eastwood surpasses John Wayne in each film. If you like a John Wayne film you will love this film more than any of his films put together. This film is a true masterpiece which features an unforgettable score by Ennio Morricone and is directed off course by Sergio Leone.

""A TRUE MASTERPIECE""

-Pimpin` Critic 69

DID YOU KNOW...? The director (Sergio Leone) undertook a Huge risk in filming the bridge detonation sequence. Investing six weeks' time for 500 laborers to erect the structure and 300-foot dam to create the river underneath, he knew the action could be shot only once. He strategically positioned eight cameras to ensure that every angle was captured - and in a few literally explosive moments, produced one of the most jarring and spectacular action shots ever filmed!",10
5 August 2012,Cigars and Spaghetti,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

14 March 2020,"Give justice, fairness, loyalty, cowardice, and fierceness to opposing roles for the dual purpose of persuasion and entertainment","The good, bad, and ugly people in the film do not mean literally good, bad, and ugly. In fact, the good man is good because he will not use any means to achieve the goal, and will not kill the innocent to destroy the enemy; the bad person The reason why he is evil is because he becomes insensitive to the feelings of others for the benefit; the ugly person knows both sides, so he is also rebellious and cunning. The film also shows the sorrow of the homeless in a point-by-point manner, and respects the different choices made by different people under the same life persecution from a neutral point of view, which is both counterintuitive and helpless.

1 March 2009,slightly histrionic and very tedious - cleef is great though,"If it were not for Cleef's great pacing and character or Eastwood's humorous character development, this film would be considered a great failure (at least it would be in my humble opinion). the humor, the camera work, and the music, make this worth watching at least once.

Unfortunately though, whatever pleasures one gains from the acting, is lost because Leone could not control himself when it came excessively long cuts. While he was clever and original in his cinematography and direction, his films would be much more tolerable had he spent some time studying under Hitchcock when it came to editing. Scenes that probably would have been 3 minutes during ""A Fistful"" became 6 minutes in ""Few Dollars More"" and 20 in ""Good the Bad and the Ugly"".

Yes, the story is great, as it was in Few Dollars More, but the payoff in the cemetery at the end (while clever) is just not worth the price of excruciatingly long scenes of eyes and melodrama. Pale Rider and Josey Wales, even in their lamest moments, put this one to shame at its best.",5
17 July 2008,Stunning and Timeless Masterpiece,"Il Buono! Il Brutto! Il Cattivo! Indeed, there isn't a lot of bad to be talked about. And ugly certainly isn't the word. But good, now you're on to something. If there was any doubt that a western could be regarded as a truly great film, 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' solves that problem. And though it is without question one of the greatest westerns ever made, Sergio Leone's masterpiece is also one of the greatest crime dramas to be told. An epic rendering where the landscapes and score play as much of a role as do the actors, this spaghetti western is still today a suspenseful and glorious work of extreme art.

A haunting story about three men brought together in unlikely ways in their search for a dead man's golden treasure, there's a brutal and gritty feel about the film as it drops us in the middle of a barren and dry landscape. Raw, but also indescribably beautiful. Sergio Leone paints his canvas both with grand shots that appreciate the vastness of nature, and devastating close-ups for a first-hand point of view. Leone simultaneously puts both styles to practice, and with electrifying results. Yes it's long, but there's a passion within this story that deserves to be told. And like all great filmmakers, Leone doesn't simply tell us. He shows us.

Long before his Oscar-winning days, Clint Eastwood ('The Good') reminded us what a simple facial expression can do. With Leone's personal close-ups that allow us to see every bit of his sun-blistered face, Eastwood skillfully leads 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' with that piercing gaze that's both menacing and pure. Eli Wallach's ('The Ugly') performance is just as good, if not better. Bringing a fierce two-headedness to his character, you're never quite sure what direction he's going to run with. It ups the suspense, adds to the fascination. The characters here aren't merely cardboard cut-outs, but complex and unpredictable people with different motives and different intentions. And when they're all together, expect fireworks.

But above the actors, more powerful than the scenery, there is one who reigns supreme. Ennio Morricone's haunting score is one of the single-most recognizable products in cinematic history, and it gives 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' a bite that would be sorely missing otherwise. Absolutely brilliant, it makes Leone's picture an unforgettable experience that captivates us, 3-hour running time and all. A sprawling Civil War era epic that takes its ideas about money and greed and power and betrayal and friendship and intertwines them all together in a cool, collected piece of work. An improbable masterpiece of sorts, but a profoundly rich one that deserves to be seen in all its intended beauty.

12 April 2020,A movie changes my eyes on western movies.,"I, who has always been unable to lift the spirit of the western film, actually spent three hours watching the western film of the 1960s. It was still a dark tone, the dust and the sound of gunfire, but it changed my unreasonable aversion to westerns. Yes, I admit that my disgust is unfounded, because I haven't watched the best Western films before.

22 July 2012,The Ecstasy of Music is far higher than the ecstasy of gold,"This movie is not only sheer entertainment, it has the most profound music in the number 'ecstasy of gold' by Ennio Morricone. Although there is no comparison in the quality of one musical piece with another, but I would rate 'ecstasy of gold' as the best orchestral piece ever - simply a masterpiece from Morricone, who has produced the best music for western genre films. The theme music is also superb.

The mood of the film transports you to that time and world and gives a feeling of that time and places were everyone was desperate, adventurous, daring, even reckless for the most coveted thing - gold. It has been called the yellow fever - a state in which people were willing to die or commit massacres for gold.

This is the theme, and although it is a sad and haunting picture of man turning into wild beast - more savage than the so called savages, the action, the plot and the acting turns it into an ecstasy. Not to be missed.",9

2 February 2004,Second best of his spaghetti westerns,"This is a superb spaghetti western. Certainly still low budget, with a terrible score, but the acting is decent and, this time, has a strong story to back it up. Eastwood is beginning to hit his stride. Lee Van Cleef stars also and this is a great film. I still think that High Plains Drifter is better, but this is his second best of this genre. A true classic keeper type film!

29 August 2020,"A great Western, if Westerns are your thing...","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a classic Western. It has a cleverly written and easy to follow plot following three characters. The way the film follows these individuals and how their stories intertwine is quite interesting. There is a back and forth relationship between the characters and a, literally, long journey for all of them, specifically the 'Good' and the 'Ugly' characters. The action scenes are well executed and fairly exciting. Some of the cinematography and editing is top notch, the end scene specifically comes to mind. The score by Ennio Morricone is legendary and adds suspense and intrigue to a film that could otherwise suffer from slow pacing. Where the film falls a bit flat for me is the depth of the characters. The three title characters are actually not all that different, even though the title would suggest otherwise. While these characters do differ in style and personality, which does create some contrasts, their convictions and morals are quite cliché (although maybe less so in the year the film was made) as they all want one thing and they are all willing to commit the same deeds to get there. Due to the lack of depth and sympathy in these characters this created a scenario where I did not really care what happened to any of them, or who won out in the eventual end to the tale. Having said this, the characters do very much compliment each other with the few subtle differences they have, specifically in personality; they all have their own unique charm, while sustaining a ruthlessness that is needed to succeed in the wild West...

While having some downfalls, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is nonetheless a very good film and is well worth watching.",9

20 February 2022,Very entertaining Western...,"Oddly enough I have only seen the 1966 classic spaghetti Western movie ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" (aka ""Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo"") once before sitting down in 2022 to watch it again. Sure, I could remember the general outlay of the movie, but I have to say that it was a blast to sit down and watch Sergio Leone's classic Western movie once again.

It is easy to see why Sergio Leone's ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" is a classic Western in every aspect, from the narrative storyline, the acting performances, the cast, the atmosphere, and of course the music.

Now, the storyline, as written by Luciano Vincenzoni, Sergio Leone, Agenore Incrocci and Furio Scarpelli certainly is an interesting and entertaining one, as there are lots of great moments throughout the course of the 2 hours and 41 minutes that the movie run for. And I will say that I was genuinely entertained from start and up to the very end of the movie.

They certainly had an intersting cast ensemble for this movie, and of course the likes of Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef needs no introduction, as they are iconic actors in themselves, but I will say that Eli Wallach was actually also adding a good portion of character building to the storyline with his performance and role in the movie.

As a Western movie, then ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" takes the audience on a wild horseback chase, as we go through a lot of Western tropes as the movie progress. But it works out well, because the storyline is so nicely constructed and brought to life on the screen.

The music in ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" is iconic. And I am sure that just about everyone is familiar with the classic melody that dominates the movie.

""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" is Western done right, and it certainly is a movie that you should watch if you enjoy Western movies, or if you're a fan of Clint Eastwood or Lee Van Cleef. This is certainly a movie that I can warmly recommend.

My rating of ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" lands on a well-deserved eight out of ten stars.",8
11 July 2016,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: Italian Masterpiece!","What can a non-professional reviewer, like myself, say about The Good, the Bad and the Ugly that hasn't already been said? It's one of the God-sends of cinema, a platinum accomplishment in film-scope that has inspired every Western cinematic epic after it to achieve greatness. It shows the old west as a diverse, adventurous but desolate place to live. What happens when three men search for Confederate gold in the midst of the American Civil War? We see three very different men who represent the morale of war: the ugly (Tuco), the bad (Angel Eyes), and the good (Blondie).

Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach make a dynamite trio for this film, and Sergio Leone's ceaselessly observant and pitch-perfect direction of the actors adds to the experience of watching the film. The film is big, really big. The sweeping cinematography easily ranks among the best cinematography in cinema history. We not only see the story of three men out against each other, but the world around them is composed like a visual song that shows how devastating the Civil War really was.

This is truly Sergio Leone's finest piece of work. He never wasted the time he was given on his projects; he squeezed the value he could get out of every second he had and it's payed off with his movies. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly deserves to be seen on the big screen (or the biggest you can find/use yourself); it practically commands itself to be seen in the best format possible.

P.S. This is the one of the films that greatly influenced Quentin Tarantino. Also it's a personal favourite of mine. It is for Westerns what Homer's Odyssey is to Greek Mythology. It's that good and that epic.",10

21 December 2012,The Greatest Film of All Time,"I have just come from watching that pigswill, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, so I thought it only fitting that I review what I believe to be the greatest film of all time.

I don't say that lightly. If you dislike this film, you have a problem. This is why:

1. Characters are perfectly cast and perfectly executed. 2. Story is perfectly executed. 3. Dialogue is perfectly executed. 4. Screenplay is perfectly executed. 5. Pacing is perfectly executed. 6. Tone and feel are perfectly executed. 7. Acting is perfectly executed. 8. Direction is perfectly executed. 9. Music is perfectly executed. 10. Set design is perfectly executed.

And I mean PERFECTLY EXECUTED.

There is not one negative I can find about this film (apart from the fact it ended). Not one. Even the added scenes were brilliant and only added to the spectacle. The whole film is a masterpiece, and unlike a lot of films with that tag, this film deserves it. I have not seen another film this perfectly executed across the board. I haven't the words to describe just how well made this film is from every point of view. I never get bored of watching this film or quoting it.

And guess what... no CGI, no stupid chase scenes, no action scenes for the sake of it. The film couldn't be made today because people just aren't capable of this level of magnificence anymore.

Finally, Eli Wallach stole the show as Tuco, even upstaging Clint Eastwood. If you haven't seen this film yet, I envy you.

19 August 2012,Spaghetti Masterpiece,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly has become a metaphor for the relentless and ruthless pursuit of wealth (the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow) and the victims and victors (mostly victims) it produces along the way. The beauty of this film is that it does not take itself too seriously, it is a precursor to movies like ""Sin City"" , ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""No Country for Old Men"" that have a comedic and ""matter of fact"" feel to the graphic violence. Plus the musical score and cinematography are excellent. Who would of thought that a ""spaghetti western"" would become such an honoured classic movie masterpiece? Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef all play characters that are right out of a Greek tragedy who represent different aspects of society. Watch, enjoy, and don't take the movie too seriously, that's how I believe the director wanted the audience to watch it.

A lot of holes in script. Go really slow and for no reasons scenes included just to have a feature film length video. First dialog comes after 11 minutes start of movie. Actual expected story starts after 1 hour. No idea why it is that much rated. Only one thing goes good and that is acting nothing else up to mark a expected.

31 May 2010,Too Bad Eli Wallach Ruined the Movie!,"Clint was on a tear in the 60s with his spaghetti westerns. He proved a washed-up American TV idol could reinvent himself successfully and end up rich enough to make splatter movies for decades before doing a few artsy films for fun. I'm unsure of his politics, but the man has to have bad dreams always. I detested them when they came out; now, I find them amusingly quaint considering how vulgarly violent the newer films have gotten. Unfortunately, these films brought about the disintegration of morals/manners in the world, an antihero crazy society and the notion that only very wealthy people can make a film anymore. They are essentially a very bad thing for humanity, but there's no turning back now.

Eli, Eli, what made you think you could pull off a Mexican accent/persona? You are a joke. The NYC grit is still there but mixed with spicese, it becomes a very bad scene. Your tristate accent cannot be squelched. You sound like you're about to hail a cab at any second. And you're just not mean enough, dear. You're basically a teddy bear and it shows. Did you owe Eastwood a favor or did he offer you a bundle? It's very sad because your performance drags down what might have been a more interesting film.",7
31 May 2007,The greatest western of all time..,"The Good, The Bad & The Ugly (written December, 2006)

Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach finally face off in the macabre dance of death, the most intense, artistic and stylized shoot-out the western has ever known and just one of many qualities making this great visionary achievement the greatest Western ever. The film is a moving piece of artwork from start to finish, and the sequences are complete classics. The music score adds to the style and suspense beautifully, and the twisting, turning search for Confederate gold gives us a fantastic plot. I have viewed The Good, The Bad & The Ugly time and time again, and it never grows tiresome.

24 February 2022,Western is the beauty!,"A sprawling Western epic that follows the adventures of three gunfighters looking for $200,000 in stolen gold.

The movie is long, but there's not a wasted scene in the film. Each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more about each character and what's going on. The pacing is incredible, as is the direction - Sergio Leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film which keeps you engage.

The three main characters make the film. Lee Van Cleef ('The Bad') is evil personified. Totally ruthless, he'll do whatever it takes to get what he wants. Clint Eastwood ('The Good') is the Man With No Name, not really 'good' in a traditional sense . . . But he has a certain sense of honor and tries to do the right thing. (Watch the scene when he gives a dying Confederate soldier a puff of his cigar - powerful, and it sums up everything that the Man With No Name is all about, without saying a single word.) Eli Wallach ('The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most complex - if not the best - character in the film. All impulse and rage, Tuco spins wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be Clint Eastwood's best friend in one scene, trying to kill him in another - Tuco truly represents 'the ugly' side of people.

At last I wanna say even if you are not into the western genre then just try it out. Movie's production is not that old, it at least gives you the vibe of 90's movie (like not too old), despite the fact it was released in 60's.",9

Anyway, having given a short synopsis of the movie I would just like to say that this is probably the best ""Spaghetti Western"" ever filmed. There is plenty of action, a good soundtrack and all three give excellent performances. And although it is a bit long (161 minutes) the story flows smoothly from one incredible scenario to another. Definitely worth a watch.

26 February 2001,"""People With Ropes Round Their Necks Don't Always Hang""","Angel Eyes, the cruel assassin, hears of a fortune in Army money, lying hidden in a graveyard. Blondie is the benevolent free spirit, Western Man in his perfect incarnation. His partner and nemesis is Tuco, the irresistible rogue who combines charm, courage and total amorality in equal measure. Only Tuco knows where the graveyard is, but only Blondie knows where to dig, so each must keep the other alive if they are to collect the money.

""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" is the keystone of the 'Dollars' trilogy, and the pinnacle of the Spaghetti Western genre. Neither before nor after did the format achieve this sweeping majesty, this clarity of characterisation or this narrative power. Leone's curious hybrid of American art-form, Japanese look and European sensibility worked beautifully - and hit its zenith in this picture.

Ennio Morricone's revolutionary musical score is universally acclaimed. The conservatoire-educated composer came up with material for this film which is more than merely innovative and arresting - it sets a new benchmark by which to measure cinematic composition. The central motif was an instant worldwide hit and has never lost popularity, but the score has much more to offer than one engaging melody. Insistently-picked guitar enhances moments of tension, and the lasciviously latin trumpet passage at the film's climax expands the meaning of the photographic images. Music melds with visuals like paint bonding with plaster to form fresco. Without that music, this film is almost unimaginable.

A picaresque story in the great European tradition, the film recalls (and extends) the line of inheritance which runs from ""Lazarillo de Tormes"" through Voltaire and Dickens. Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows, and Blondie and Tuco find themselves meandering in tandem through an evilly-disposed universe, lurching from one scrape to another (the desert episode, the prisoners-of-war episode, etc.) This western Quixote and Sancho double act draws on the selfsame comic proposition, that two very different men, yoked together by fate's whimsy, can forge an understanding that comes close to love.

Though Blondie is the 'doer' and the presiding intelligence, the heart of the film is occupied by the unforgettable Tuco. What a character! Comical charlatan, savvy killer, conscienceless swindler and lovable monster, Tuco remains fascinating for every second that he is on the screen. Fine writing delineated the character but it took Eli Wallach's inspirational performance to breathe life into one of cinema's immortal rogues. With the natural courage of a wild animal and the vulnerability of a born loser, Tuco is suffused with a vital humanity which leaps off the screen. His introductory vignette is a masterpiece of exposition, told entirely in images. Our anti-hero escapes a gunning-down (not for the last time!) and makes off gnawing a chicken leg, wiliness, vigour and sensuality mingling in one great affirmation of life itself. Tuco is the other, the dispossessed, the one who must rely on his wits to survive. He is the most frenetic character in the film, and the one who constantly wears a noose around his neck. He has developed his 'otherness' and transmuted it into a life force. Tuco is, par excellence, one of ""those that come in by the window"".

If you think of the world's great novels, it is surprising how many of them are comic - ""Ulysses"", ""A La Recherche"", ""Oliver Twist"", etc. And so it is with this cinematic novel. Virtually every scene is casseroled in a piquant comic sauce. The lists of Tuco's outrageous crimes, read aloud at his various hangings, the wild fluctuations in the relative fortunes of Blondie and Tuco, the transparent attempts of Tuco to save his own skin in every tight corner - all combine to make this a richly comic work, though the humour is usually dry and always understated.

This is a film of immense visual power. Each of the three protagonists is given an opening vignette: extreme close-up forces the viewer to take note of the vulpine quality of Lee Van Cleef's extraordinary eyes, fixing him in the mind as a merciless predator. Blondie is seen, not as a man whole and complete, but fragmented by his defining symbols - hat, cigar and gun-holster. The desert sequence contains an image of Blondie staggering on foot, with Tuco's mounted shadow pursuing him over the sand, an object lesson in conveying mood and information without words. Tuco sets an empty bottle rolling down a dune, and in the next shot it hits Blondie in the face. Tuco's ascendancy and Blondie's fading hope are communicated in a single gesture. Blondie's compassion for the whipped mongrel Tuco is enshrined in the little act of sharing a cigar. In the gunshop scene, Tuco hardly utters a word, but his purpose, his knowledge of guns (and the lethal beauty of the weapons themselves) is conveyed powerfully. Tabernas, the Spanish location, is a place of parched hills and scrubby desert, and the film makes superb use of wide panoramas to capture the quality of the terrain. The American Civil War happened on the green pastures of Virginia, not in this barbaric Nowhere, but it doesn't matter. Rock and sand provide a mythical context for these exotic characters who never existed, and never could exist.

The finale, with its three-way draw, is epic in scale. Tuco's crazed run through the tombstones is brilliantly shot, with the short field of focus rendering the graves a single unbroken blur as Tuco's greed blinds him to reality. Rapid cuts between the eyes of the participants in the draw heighten the tension dramatically, and then after the explosive release, the closing conceit is a comic gem worthy of a Moliere or a Goldoni.",
20 November 2021,This is a top 5 western that is an American cinema masterpiece,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) is a move in my DVD collection that I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline for this picture is around two scam artists, The Good and the Ugly, who also have details that when put together leads to a buried treasure from a historical heist. When The Bad forces them to get the money and split it, the unlikely trio embark on a journey while trying to avoid the trials of the civil war and various unrests going on around them.

This movie is directed by Sergio Leone (A Fistful of Dollars) and stars Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven), Lee Van Cleef (Escape from New York) and Eli Wallach (The Magnificent Seven).

The soundtrack for this is legendary and up there with the all time great westerns. Leone always does a great job of using music to create intensity. The settings and circumstances are awesome, as is the cast and dialogue. The character introductions are so good. The chemistry and establishment of the characters are fantastic. The infusion of the Civil War elements was also interesting. There are great twists and turns throughout the movie all the way to the final conclusion.

Overall this is a top 5 western that is an American cinema masterpiece. I would strongly recommend this movie and score it an easy 10/10.",10
18 October 2022,Best movie ever made,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

4 February 2018,Masterful tale about honor and morality!,"This is it. Sergio Leones masterpiece. Why do I feel like writing the 841th review on this movie would change something? I don't know. Maybe it's just the feeling of having to publicly show my love for this film. Saying that ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" is a good film is a massive understatement. It is the best Western Movie ever made; But not just that. It is one of the best Movies ever made, period.

The story is built and executed so perfectly that you don't even notice that the whole complex plot is just a simple storyline following three guys, each of them with different character traits than the other, chasing treasure. Yes, indeed, it is as easy as that. But how can a movie, with such a simple story, last nearly three hours? This is what makes ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" so great. 179 minutes of screen time, but it never drags. There is no confidence in exactly knowing what is going to happen next. From the tough beginning, through the epic three way showdown. The time in between is paved with delightful bits of story telling, combined with classic, smooth and cool Western obligatory. The perfect mix of beautiful visuals and sadistic violence and brutality. I sadly didn't had the honor to see it in the theater/cinema but even on a TV screen the landscape is still one of the most beautiful sceneries in any motion picture. The violence is tough and of course there are lots of brutal death/fight scenes, but they are never distasteful. The humor is brilliant and the laughs keep coming although they are never fully essential. The movie score is up there with the best music scores in any other movie and it fits the movie greatly.

""The Man With No Name"" is one of the best and iconic movie characters of all time. And Although I think there could be an argument made for Al Pacino's Michael Corleone in ""The Godfather"" as the best antihero in cinema history, ""Blondie"" takes the cake. ""The Man With No Name, played brilliantly by Clint Eastwood is no hero. He has not the moral integrity of a hero, but he is a man of honor and respect. That makes him a character more relatable to, as we (as normal humans) probably also aren't heroes the way society in general wants us to be. It's especially ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" that establishes the co-work of Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood as one if the best, if not the best actor/director relationship along. That should not take away from the rest of the cast. Lee Van Cleef's ""The Bad""/Sentenza is again, the perfect antagonist and Eli Wallach's ""Tuco"" just fits perfectly as the ""third wheel"". It's a tale about three men, that so often had the opportunity to kill each other, but never did that until the epic culmination. Three guys just starring at each other and waiting for the other one's move; Priceless.

If you read this review and now think 'Okay, this is a generic spaghetti western flick, with maybe some cool characters and visuals' you are so wrong. This would be like saying that ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) is a generic superhero movie, although it's NOT. Of course the movie's primary ""use"" is too be exciting, funny and gripping, but sometimes, there is just more to it than we think. Sergio Leone brilliantly captures the cruel and pointless destructions of war. The movie shows that the war has no mercy, but in the end the war helps nobody. The melancholic atmosphere when ""Blondie"" and ""Tuco"" walk through the dead bodies, or the huge size of the cemetery just imply that. ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" is a chess game, with little dialogue, but with so many iconic one liners that explain more than some overly long stretched dialogue. The most striking thing about the film is it's moral context. The way it presents each 3 characters but doesn't want to honestly separate all of them into ""good"" and ""evil"". It could be argued that ""The Good"" is ""The Bad's"" opponent. But who says that ""The Good"" is really 'good'? And what does ""The Ugly"" do, when there is already someone 'evil'? In fact, exactly this lawlessness and honesty describes and characterizes the film and perfectly develops all three characters.

""There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend."" Summing up, ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" is a perfectly paced, nearly flawless western classic, with unforgettable scenery, music score and characters. It is in my top 10 movies of all time and therefore rightfully deserves the perfect: 10/10",
17 September 2019,"The setting, the OST, the characters, the tension","Everything about this movie is great. Sure, some elements might be a bit dated, but overall is a timeless masterpiece without a doubt.

10 March 2022,Masterpiece,"What can I say?

Perfect soundtrack, probably the greatest of all time.

Perfect casting.

Perfect cinematography.

Perfect costumes and makeup.

Perfect details, like the bugs crawling around in various scenes.

Perfect stunts, like the incredibly dangerous scene with the train running over the handcuffs.

Perfect story. From its initial scenes with no dialogue, to little things like Tuco's backstory, to that epic finale, it's like Shakespeare in the Old West.

Even a perfect title, with the irony being that all of these characters are bad guys, brutally violent, driven by greed, and looking out only for themselves while the rest of the country is torn apart fighting the Civil War (Eastwood's character's small acts of kindness notwithstanding). Not that the war is particularly virtuous either; that scene with the senseless slaughter over a meaningless bridge is brilliant, and must have resonated with Americans reading the news out of Vietnam. The film romanticizes the shooting prowess of these gunslingers, but it doesn't romanticize human nature. Its larger than life scenes, such as the one with Tuco running madly through the graveyard while the music swells, are simply extraordinary.",10
3 October 2011,"Stylish, cynical, brutal, humorous and epic - this film has it all","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly will always be near the pinnacle of the western genre. There are several reasons for this. For one thing, it has never really dated at all in all these years. The immorality of its central three characters is a factor of course. The black and white moral certainties of the traditional American western are nowhere to be found here. One of the reasons for this is the film's Italian origins. The movies of Italy had no qualms with projecting morally ambiguous heroes onto the screen. Nor did they see any issue with and filling their stories with plenty of violence. Add to this, the Italian tradition of operatic drama and you have the basic ingredients of the spaghetti western. The immorality, cynicism, violence and operatic sense of drama were the template where this most American of genres was filtered through, the result was a somewhat distinctive sub-genre.

But what makes The Good, the Bad and the Ugly stand out from most spaghetti westerns is because of the personnel behind and in front of the camera. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and, especially, Eli Wallach all shine in their respective roles of 'the good', 'the bad' and 'the ugly'. While behind the scenes were two monumental cinematic giants in the form of director Sergio Leone and composer Ennio Morricone. These latter two form one of the most outstanding director-composer partnerships in the history of the medium. Leone shoots the film with consummate brilliance, with extreme close-ups and widescreen vistas; he has an understanding of cinematic space like few others, while he paces events within that space in a highly individual way - he takes his time, is quite minimalistic yet is always dramatic and at times epic. Of course the film would not be anywhere near the masterpiece it is without the contribution of Morricone. The soundtrack in this film is quite honestly legendary. If you were to have looked at his ideas on paper without hearing the end result you would be forgiven for thinking that this music would be wildly inappropriate for a western - electric guitars, feedback, chanting, avant-garde elements - yet it hardly needs saying that the result is one of the greatest examples of film music ever composed. It will always remain so.

The fact that the film is epic, yet simultaneously tough, muscular and cynical is a somewhat unusual combination. It's storyline of greed, betrayal and brutality is not one usually given the epic treatment. No doubt this is one of the aspects that confused critics back in the 60's who disparaged this film. It does seem extraordinary from a modern perspective that this movie was greeted with a lukewarm reception. But I suppose this may explain why it seems nowadays to not have dated at all - it was clearly ahead of its time. Its fair to say that this will always be a template example of the western genre, and one of the great films in general.",9

15 December 2020,The perfect movie is here,"This movie is the best of the best, the greatest of the great, it has everyhting you could dream of, and it's actually one of the most entertaining pcitures in the market. It's one of those movies you want to see a remake of, but not changing anything. The film shows you it isn't needed an intricate plot or a side romance to be the best movie ever. It has so many memorable quotes and moments (the best being the final shootout). It was snubbed at the Oscars in everything:
Clint Eastwood for best actor (Clint Eastwood really gives a thrilling performance)
Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef for best supporting actor (they both are at his best here, and there could have been easily been a tie between this two contenders). EVEN ADOLF GIUFFRÉ GIVES A FINE PERFORMANCE IN THE 10 MINUTES HE APPEARS ON THE FILM.
Anyway, I think I have made my opinion pretty clear, considering it among the best 5 movies of all time. Hope is useful!!!",10

23 November 2007,"The good, the bad and the ugly","Upon release of this movie the critics were not so mild with there comments, but this is in my opinion the best western ever made! Everything in this movie is well balanced. It shows how the west really was in my opinion. The director Sergio Leone takes his time to tell the story. He uses different types of camera angles, extreme close ups etc. This makes The Good The Bad And The Ugly a feast for your eyes! Also the actors are well casted. Eastwood plays his part with excellence as do the other two actors. Especially Eli Wallach is perfect in his role of Tuco. The music of Ennio Morricone is also the best! The openings-tune is known all over the world.It's a movie I can watch over and over again. And every time I do so, I discover new things.

28 September 1998,A fantastic western,"This movie was real fun to watch. It had drama, action and a healthy dose of comedy. It didn't have the usual simple western movie plot and I was interested right through, despite its length. Even if you don't like westerns, you should see this movie. Eastwood only made one other western that was anywhere near as good as this , the dramatic Unforgiven.

26 August 2020,An immersive journey through the wild west,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is one of the most iconic movies ever made. Growing up I saw homages, parodies and references everywhere (mostly the music), and it was always got the reference even without seeing the movie until now. For a movie from 1966, it holds up extremely well.

The movie centers around 3 characters on the hunt for buried gold. Two know the name of the graveyard ion which it is buried, but only one knows the grave. All 3 main characters steal the scene, and by having Title cards of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly, we get an idea who they are right away and why they are important. Clint Eastwood's Blondie is the most well known and the hero of the story, but Tuco and Angel Eyes are just as engaging and fun to watch onscreen.

The overall story largely takes a back seat to smaller stories that happen along the way. It's about the journey rather than the destination, and the movies really takes it time developing its characters and set pieces. The scenes move slowly, with lots of stare downs. At 3 hours long, I admit a few scenes went on a little too long for me, but overall I really liked the pacing.

The action still looks great, and holds up well. The fights are brutal and the gun battles are tense. The old film grain too gives this movie a very rugged feel.

The visuals still look amazing in 2020. The scenery, set design and camerawork all come together so well and make for some impressive shots. I'm a sucker for long wide takes of scenery and the Good, the Bad and the Ugly has these in spades. You really get a feel for the old West here.

The music is iconic and still spectacular, always setting the stage well. The main theme is just so cool, it plays a lot in the movie but I never get tired of hearing it. The ADR is definitely off-sync though, and dialogue doesn't always match up. The tech might have not been there yet to probably do this (in fact this problem still happens), but I couldn't help but notice it and it took me out of scenes. I got used to it after a little while and with the rest of the movie standing out you might not even notice.

Overall, it lives up to it's gigantic legacy and I highly recommend everyone watch the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. I wished I watched it much sooner.",9
8 October 2011,It goes out with a bang,"Now this is what a great spaghetti western is all about and once again the third installment delivers. It just seems this trilogy gets better by each installment. This movie maybe the notorious out of the three films in this trilogy but I think I liked the second one the best. But overall I just have to give this movie a higher score by slightly because of the pacing of it all. The pacing to ""For a Few Dollars More"" was slow. This movie even has a trademark western theme that will be used in many parodies to come. Like the title there is three main characters in this movie and each one brings a lot to the table, I first thought The Ugly would be the one left in the shadow. But that character stands out a lot to this movie and brings life into it. Despite his devious and mischievous characteristics he is still sort of likable. The Bad is played by Lee Van Cleef and he does a good job of portraying the charismatic and yet ruthless villain in this movie. The good is more of a anti-hero of sort than actually a good guy, but he does still have that code of honor which he carried with him during the previous films. He is cool and calm gunslinger but just isn't the good guy in this story. Anyways the character Tuco aka The Ugly surprising stood out a lot in this, I mentioned it before but he is really good with his role and slightly reminded me of Jack Sparrow when it came to his characteristics and mannerisms. Not a lot but very slightly. Each and every character from the three stands out. And when it comes to the plot it boils down to the three gunfighters going after $200,000 in stolen gold. And it takes place during the civil war so there is many obstacles they must overcome, including each other. Compared to the previous two film in this trilogy this one is most definitely the most character driven one and has a lot of character development. This movie is the longest one out of this trilogy but is the fastest paced on as well and most of the running time of this movie isn't wasted. From the story direction, character development and music really gives off the feel of a classic western. Sergio Leone done it once again in creating a memorable western that goes out with a bang.

8.6/10",
3 January 2000,Action where there should be action,"One of my all time favorite westerns. The pace alternates between leisurely and solid action. Yet, the movie does not jump directly into a fight scene but builds to it naturally with exciting results. The final scene between the three men is brilliant in the director's editing and the music as they perfectly compliment each other.

14 July 2011,Best of all time?,"I don't really believe in lists that much or calling one song, movie or whatever the best since there is a lot to be said about different good things. But Tarantino put this movie at the nr.1 spot of greatest movies of all time and he may just be right. Sure, there's a lot that can be said about what's not right about it like the much debated behind the camera scenes not getting noticed till the characters are supposed to and about a dozen other things, but I think that's unimportant compared to what IS right about it. As someone else already mentioned, the last 20 minutes or so, from when Tuco does his running to the shoot-out climax is like an emotion. It's Opera, it's every comic book, every great song, every fairytale, it's what every movie is supposed to do, it's well....everything. Call me a woos but it can still almost make me cry every time I see it, it's that beautiful. Blondie, Tuco and Angel eyes, should a alien civilization ever try and contact us send a clip of these 3 guys. We send this movie with a song of Otis Redding, the work of Michelangelo, a copy of 1984, a picture of the Sagrada Família, a V8 engine and a few other things and they will know what we're pretty much about and what art we can create. But that's just my humble opinion of course.",10

16 September 2010,"One of the best, maybe the best Western ever!","This is the definitive of the so called Spaghetti Westerns. Everything about it is so great. For a rare this Man with no name trilogy is one that just got better and better for each film. Sure all three are stand-alone adventures but Sergio Leone really got it perfect here.

This film absolutely has it all, the action, violence, humor, great characters and the music. Clint Eastwood is always cool but as a cowboy he is the coolest. The man with no name so though, secretive, fearless, hard facial expression, cool clothing. It is a quite long film but still it never ever gets boring. The slow pace works just perfect for the films tone and style. An impressive combination of great humor and hard violence that works just perfect, impressive because it never feels awkward like one might fear it would get. The style of the action is perfectly done and like stated it is quite violent maybe more than one might suspect if you don't know anything about the movie. The characters are superb, Clint Eastwood is of course the best and the coolest. The bad is a really brilliant villain and the ugly is great comic relief. Even though this might seem like a light weight no depth movie with stereotype characters, it's not because they are so well done and brilliantly acted that the viewer gets a stronger feeling for them than any other film like this. Sure the story is not that deep but it's neither predictable, just perfectly balanced. Then the music, must be among the best ever for a Western film, especially at the ending such a feeling it gives. It brilliantly helps build up the suspense in the action.

It's hard to put in words how good this film is. A classic that most have seen and those few who haven't should. Maybe the best in it's genre and even outside it's group I would rank it among my top movies ever. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a timeless classic.",9
3 October 2006,The best movie ever made,"Sergio Leone is the definition of artist and director. This movie is just the masterpiece of the art of cinema. The pictures, the dialogs, the actors, the location, the music, everything in that movie makes you feel that what you see is art. There is harmony, rhythm and especially there is realism in that film, something that's missing from the typical westerns. When i first saw that movie i felt like a car had run over me. Since then i still feel the same way when i see that film. Despite the large amount of films that i have seen since then this movie still remains the best film i have ever seen. I think Leone was a man with a very certain idea about cinema that personally finds me agreed. Of course that's just my opinion and i just want you to respect it.

4 February 2017,One of the best films in history and with an EPIC Score!!,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

6 May 2000,Clint's coolest performance,"In this world, there's two kinds of people, my friend - those who like spaghetti westerns and those who don't. Personally, I think this is one of the greatest films ever made. Nothing can match Sergio Leone's masterful direction, the twangy score by Ennio Morricone, or the ever-cool presence of Clint Eastwood. It's near enough perfect. There are also memorable performances from Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef, who as always has an air of menace about him. The film is also packed full of memorable moments - such as the climactic final showdown - and there is plenty of wry humour to keep you amused as well as amazed. Idiots? It's for you!

23 January 2023,"Best of the Spaghetti Westerns - The Good, The Bad and The Ugly","This film has very little socially redeeming value, and is shallow as a puddle after a short rainstorm. However, it is visually and audibly superior to most other films, even though it is short on content. Satire is a difficult thing to do in film; and doing it in a Western is seldom done well. Offhand, only Blazing Saddles and this film (or all spaghetti Westerns) make that distinction. Only young teens would believe any of these characters could exist in real life, and there is nothing wrong with fantasy in film. However, most adults will be laughing in spots where teens would most likely be enthralled. The film is a lot like an episode of Seinfeld (a story about nothing). Seinfeld proved that such plots could be extremely successful on the small screen. This movie proves they can be successful as well on the big screen.

11 August 2013,"The good, the bad and the ugly...","""The good, the bad and the ugly"" is a western movie and for many people considered to be the best western movie of all times. It's a really interesting movie such as the plot and the storyline.

I am thinking that at least one of the three protagonists of this movie (Eli Wallach, Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef) should have won an Oscar. I also think that maybe Sergio Leone should have won an Oscar for the direction and if not for this movie maybe for all the other good movies which has direct for example: For a few dollars more and A Fistful of Dollars.

I like very much this movie because is a classic western movie with really good cast Clint Eastwood as The Good, Lee Van Cleef as The Bad and Eli Wallach as The Ugly.

24 August 2022,People with ropes around their necks don't always hang.,"A bounty hunting scam joins two men in an uneasy alliance against a third in a race to find a fortune in gold buried in a remote cemetery.

This film is the greatest western of all time. That's no hot take, and for a good reason. This film's style, music, cinematography, characters, everything is just the definitive old west style that everyone knows today.

Spaghetti westerns are known for their bold, action-packed and often violent styles. But this provides more than just the canon and fistfights that the genre is known for bringing.

The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a masterpiece for many reasons, one of which being its runtime. It is one of the longest westerns ever made, just short of two hours, which guffaws at the hour-and-twenty-minute runtime that most westerns had. This film stretches out scenes to their limits, building extreme intensity, and making their conclusions all the more satisfying. The way the film is stretched out with unnecessary scenes and unnecessarily long scenes makes the ten-minute ending scene one of the most intense and greatest in film history.

This isn't just a western for fun shoot-outs. It's an emotional film, providing backstories, and making its characters seem so simple, and yet so great. Especially 'The Ugly', Tuco. He is ugly in his actions, not his words, and as greedy as he is, he has a whole six-minute backstory scene, that will make viewers feel emotions as strong as seeing a bloody fistfight.

The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is one of the greatest movies of all time, and may be the best western. Of course there are other masterpieces in the competition-High Noon, The Searchers, etc. But for all the emotion and fascination packed into the others, this film here is for all viewers. It's 3-hour runtime will leave viewers thinking there's more to go. It goes by too quickly, and yet you feel how long it is. Long enough to make each of the three main characters much more than just the words to describe them.

The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a retrospective western, although many people don't talk about that. But it's the end of one of the most basic western plot ideas-there's an object of desire, there's a lone, heroic drifter, there's a partner/other competitor who wants the riches and there's loads of action. This film fleshes out all of these aspects more than any other western, and that makes their end feel like the end of an era. And indeed, it was. In America, westerns were fading out of popularity. But in Italy, with the smash success of director Sergio Leone's previous other films and the rise of new western stars like Franco Nero and Lee Van Cleef was the beginning of a new era of westerns. A more daring, more gritty one. The American westerns of old were of course great. Amazing artistic achievements about times that some of those filmmakers even witnessed. But the average b-western from that time was just that-average. There's little action, more one-dimensional romantic plots. But the average spaghetti western has at least two memorable and creative fight scenes, and while their characters were basic, they generally carried more depth, even if still not always much. I'm definitely not hating on classic American westerns. I love those. But I'm just trying to explain how genius and relevant The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was.

This film is one that everyone should and could see. If you are willing to sit through 3 hours, then you will have a great time, even if you don't like westerns or old movies. Because this is as modern as any film from the time period. This is one of the greatest movies of all time. And while many modern audiences don't want to watch something like the great Citizen Kane or another masterpiece like The Godfather, this film is pure popcorn entertainment, as well as a great, character-driven film. If you haven't watched it, you need to spend your next free three hours with it. There are very few better ways to spend that time.",10
29 October 2019,"See you soon, id... idiots, it's for you","Loved this film as a kid, does it still stack up now.

Yes;)

I watched this gem again on the big/wide screen and found it still to be only matched possibly by Rio Bravo.

The version I saw was the extended one but both are good.

While all three are perfectly cast and great in their parts It's Eli Wallach that steals the show. Clint Eastwood & Lee Van Cleef rely on charisma rather than acting as both their characters are just killing machines. It's Eli Wallach's portrayal of Tuco that is the most flawed & human.

This isn't a quick flick at around 177 minutes but there was an interval.

This was the high point of the Spaghetti western era of filmaking, everyone except Hollywood saw this but the studio wanted another western from Leone who warned them that it wouldn't work.

Regardless to keep the studio happy two years later he then made Once Upon A Time In The West, a great film but just made its budget at the box office.

Its been said that this was the only Spaghetti western with a real Hollywood budget Serio Leone had impressed Hollywood that much and he delivered.",10
26 July 2016,"Great, wonderful and epic.","Spectacular, it is' 'the good, the bad and the ugly', the soundtrack is magnificent (Thanks master Ennio Morricone), the picture is beautiful, the script is impeccable, the film has three hours but it seems that has ten minutes, all script solutions are great and well resolved, creating hooks and more hooks up to its outcome, to really let the three men in conflict, all solutions are great, the acting is incredible, Clint, Lee Van and Wallach are clean, they really get lost in the character '' the good, the bad and the ugly 'is not only one of the best western movies ever made, is also one of the best in general and for me is a top 5 of the sacred 60, '' the good, the bad and the ugly '' is a treat for anyone who likes the western genre, and is also a mandatory film to anyone who likes the seventh art. Thank you Sergio Leone.

23 June 2014,Those with the guns and those who dig,"Still the all time greatest Western ever made, although the Cohen Bros True Grit is considerably awesome. So many badass things happen in this movie, so many unforgettable quotes...people try to talk to me about Tombstone, but I know what movie Tombstone ain't. People try to tell me about Unforgiven, or Rio Bravo or The Magnificent Seven or Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid or even Dances With Wolves,each and all great movies yes but I know all those people are wrong because I have seen this movie, I have seen The Good The Bad And The Ugly. So many epic westerns have come since and none, NONE!, can equal this movie. Someday some one will finally figure out again how to make a peerless western but until then The Good The Bad And The Ugly is the grand champ, and I myself am contented.

20 September 2018,"The Good, the Better and the Best","They say nothing's perfect, there's always room for improvement. I say they never saw ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"". It's pointless for me to write about this movie, because it would be just a listing of every single aspect of it and saying it's perfect. So I'll just mention the most perfect of perfections - the music. It's not just the masterpiece among movie soundtracks, it is a legendary monument of music overall.

3 April 2020,Overrated but still enjoyable,"Going into this movie I had high expectations but unfortunately this movie didn't love up to those expectations. The plot was good with some interesting twists but overall it was too slow for my liking and the characters weren't very interesting either. They're all one-dimensional with some simple character traits but the acting was very good, especially Eli Wallach's performance. Another gripe I have with this movie is the sound editing. At certain parts the lips don't sync with the words that the character is saying which I found really annoying. The movie's strongest qualities are definitely the score and the cinematography, they're both phenomenal. The last scene was amazing but unfortunately the rest of the movie dragged on too much. Solid 7/10

3 November 2021,It simply is the best,"Such a joy to watch every single time, it's a masterpiece in every way a movie can be. Iconic, epic, perfect. I wish we could have westerns like this again. Sadly no filmmaker has yet to capture the same western magic as Sergio Leone.

The only other western stories that matches, or even surpasses this in my opinion, is Red Dead Redemption 1 & 2, and the original Lonesome Dove miniseries.

8 August 2012,The Good,"And so concludes the Spaghetti Western Dollars Trilogy. Following A Fistful of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More, The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is the final film in Sergio Leone's trilogy that redefined the traditional American western.

Many people have described this film as the best Western ever made. Without a doubt, as a standalone film, The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is simply superb. The complex relationships between the three protagonists had me on the edge of my seat throughout the film, never knowing if they were going to work together or kill each other in cold blood.

The soundtrack too is utterly iconic. While I associated the predecessor's tones with cowboy music, I often associate the whole Western genre with The Good, The Bad And The Ugly's backing tune. It has also become quintessential as the accompanying music to any stand off, whether it be in a parody or simply on the school playground.

Any fan of the series will know that Eastwood's character appears alongside van Cleef's character in For A Few Dollars More. This would be my only criticism of The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, as this previous relationship has been forgotten (or is cleverly disguised in the fickleness of the characters) as they both appear to not know the other exists.

As a result of the latter paragraph, I have literally spent days deliberating over whether to mark the film down. It did make the film more confusing for me - but only as I'd seen the previous two films in the trilogy. But, crucially, Sergio Leone's trilogy is rarely marketed as a trilogy set piece and the films can be watched standalone. Anyone who watches The Good, The Bad And The Ugly by itself will happily watch the film in sweet ignorant bliss of my character confusion.

So, as a standalone film, The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is the pinnacle of Sergio Leone's Western renaissance. Simply brilliant.",9
10 January 2022,"Very good no doubt about it, even if I feel it's an odd fitting third installment","Very good no doubt about it, even if I feel it's an odd fitting third installment of the Dollars trilogy.

In case this review sounds negative at any point, I wanna explicitly state for the avoidance of any doubt that 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is very good! Any cons noted are relative.

I just feel like it's a drop-off from the brilliant double of 'A Fistful of Dollars' and 'For a Few Dollars More'. The near 3hr run time is one of the reasons, though the pacing is actually pretty good in fairness. I guess it's more so the plot, which is filled with an American Civil War setting which I didn't feel matched the characters.

The man in the middle/bounty hunting aspects of the original two films are perfect for the characters of Clint Eastwood & Co., whereas them tagging along for the war just felt odd; the story didn't feel as raw or volatile to me.

As stated, it's still - on its own merits - an entertaining western. Eastwood remains quality, while Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are extremely worthy onscreen counterparts. I will say Van Cleef feels forgotten about, probably just by me, towards the end until he magically reappears. Still, as a trio they are really enjoyable. The plot away from the war is properly fun, much more in keeping to what I was expecting. The score is also awesome, yet again.

Minus the ACW and a shorter run time and I'd probably be classing this as great as AFOD and FAFDM. It's still very good though, which I evidently want to stress, and I'd definitely revisit it.

Watched: ""Extended English-language version"".

Even though this version is the same as the original Italian release (177 minutes), but seemingly the US shortened run time is considered the true incarnation? Odd.",8
5 April 2013,Clint Eastwood give a good performance.,"This movie works for the12+ crowd. Clint Eastwood plays the main character and gives a good performance. I am a fan of Lee Van Cleef. He always plays good supporting roles. The movie was a bit slow. It is highly predictable and runs the gamut of a typical western. I don't believe that most people under the age of 25 will appreciate the movie. It does seem to have a timeless enjoyment factor in it. It's enjoyable landscapes, scenes, costuming, and gunfights do make it a timeless western. Clint Eastwood's performance is stellar like always. He alone makes the movie worth watching. This is a movie you can watch it again and again and still enjoy. It does not require intensive viewing nor is it a nail biter. Instead, a passive viewing works. The scenery, landscapes and the acting of Clint Eastwood will involve you enough to enjoy the film.

14 September 2020,Seems Just Like Old Times,"Clint Eastwood. Lee Van Cleef. Eli Wallach. Sad Hill Cemetery. Hidden Gold. With these five elements, Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone build what for many of us is the best ending in Seventh Art history. But before talking about the ending, it is essential that we review the events that have led us to such a situation and, what is even more important, the characters who, in one way or another, are predestined to face each other. On the one hand, we have Tuco, played by Eli Wallach, who is probably the character that viewers will most easily sympathize with. His motivation is simple: making money, and he has no problem about crawling on the floor or being humiliated to get it. Sergio Leone is in charge of constantly emphasizing these personal traits, summarized in the following sentence: where we were born, in order not to die of hunger, we had to choose, be a priest or a bandit. Next to him, we have Blondie, played by Clint Eastwood. No one doubts that his main motivation is to earn money, but it is undeniable that he is a character with greater pride, it means that he is not willing to take the money if he must kneel for it. He is a cold, calculating and intelligent character, and those adjectives are also useful when talking about Sentenza, played by Lee Van Cleef, who is not much different from Rubio, but with an even more evil and perverse background. The construction of characters throughout the film is simply wonderful, the picture shows us different scenes and situations in which we can draw conclusions about the behavior of each of the protagonists. The photography follows a very similar style to that of Leone's other films, with its characteristic zooms to the faces of the characters, which somehow help us to understand the emotions they express even more easily. Leone is also capable of managing the narrative tempo and tightening the dramatic chord in certain scenes, without forgetting that we are watching a Spaghetti Western and that, by definition, it should be entertaining for the viewer. The soundtrack should not even be commented, because Ennio Morricone once again creates one of those soundtracks that remain in the public's head for centuries, being part of popular culture and representing an entire cinematographic genre such as the Spaghetti Western. However, and although it is undeniable that the first two hours and twenty minutes of the film are of impressive quality, it is the last twenty minutes that make it one of the greatest classics in Seventh Art history. The ending is so good that we don't have to talk deeply about technical topics to understand and analyze its greatness, I think it seems unfair to have to talk about photography, editing, performances, music, etc. when talking about this ending. And the thing is, I truly believe that the magic of the ending is that, unlike in many other so charged with drama endings, the characters end up behaving as planned, just as the script has shown us throughout the film, being faithful to the script and, consequently, to the viewers. In that instant, you realized that The Good behaves as good fellows do, The Bad ends as bad guys end, and The Ugly ends up depending on the honor of good men. It is at that moment that Clint Eastwood looks at Eli Wallach and says: it seems just like old times. It is at that moment that you understand that everything fits, and then the music, photography and editing merge into a same element, and each character ends as the title of the picture suggests: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.",10
28 June 2023,"An Epic Western Masterpiece That Defines the Genre - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly","""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is a monumental masterpiece in the Western genre, a film that has left an indelible mark on cinema history. Directed by Sergio Leone and released in 1966, it remains a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences with its sprawling landscapes, memorable characters, and an unforgettable score by Ennio Morricone.

Set against the backdrop of the American Civil War, the film follows the intertwined journeys of three distinct characters: the Good (Clint Eastwood), a cunning and resourceful bounty hunter; the Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless and opportunistic outlaw; and the Ugly (Eli Wallach), a charismatic and cunning bandit. Their paths cross as they search for a buried treasure, each driven by their own motivations and ambitions.

""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is a triumph of storytelling. Sergio Leone's direction is masterful, deftly blending moments of intense action and violence with quieter, contemplative scenes. The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing the audience to savor every moment and build anticipation for the climactic showdown.

The performances in the film are exceptional. Clint Eastwood embodies the rugged and enigmatic Man with No Name, delivering a charismatic and iconic portrayal that has become synonymous with the Western genre. Lee Van Cleef exudes a chilling presence as the ruthless antagonist, while Eli Wallach steals the show with his charismatic portrayal of Tuco, the Ugly. The chemistry between the three leads is electric, creating a dynamic and unpredictable atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.

Visually, ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is a feast for the eyes. Leone's use of wide-angle shots and long takes captures the vastness of the landscapes, from the arid deserts to the war-torn towns. The film's meticulous attention to detail in production design and costume further immerses the audience in the gritty and unforgiving world of the Old West.

Accompanying the stunning visuals is Ennio Morricone's iconic score, which has become synonymous with the Western genre itself. The haunting melodies and evocative use of instruments create a sense of tension, excitement, and melancholy that perfectly complements the film's narrative.

Beyond its technical brilliance, ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" explores themes of greed, morality, and the human condition. It delves into the dark and complex nature of its characters, presenting a nuanced and thought-provoking examination of the choices they make in pursuit of their goals.

""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is an epic Western that has stood the test of time. It is a film that defines the genre, with its iconic characters, unforgettable score, and powerful storytelling. Whether you are a fan of Westerns or simply appreciate exceptional filmmaking, this is a movie that demands to be experienced. Prepare to be transported to a world where honor, betrayal, and the pursuit of fortune collide in the most gripping and exhilarating way possible.",10
6 January 2023,Very good,"I recently saw this film and was pleasantly impressed. For a movie made in 1966, the effects, sound and graphics rise above expectations. I can strongly compare this movie with any other blockbuster made in the last 10 years without being afraid that I will be able to choose a winner without thinking. The plot is not predictable, at least not for me, something that I can't say about most of the films I've seen recently, where already from the middle of the action I realized what the denouement would be.

Yes, I can say that the ""Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo"" made me want to see more westerns.

15 August 2022,Purity of Form,"I finally got around to this film a couple of days ago. Of course I have heard of it, it is after all a legendary film. I was surprised however by how polished the film was. A lot a spaghetti westerns have technical issues-especially with sound recording-because of their budgets and/or language barriers. This has the assured stylish flare of Leone's other two Dollars films but without the limitations of budget. It is a great film and it captures gritty realism juxtaposed with the operatic of Leone's style completely.

2 June 1999,A Masterpiece,"A masterpiece, easily Leone's best film, probably Eastwood's as well. And Eli Wallach steals it with a performance that adds a dimension of humor to the Mexican bandito he created in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. It's hard to appreciate a traditional Hollywood Western after seeing this.

6 October 2013,The Trilogy: 1st-The AMAZING; 2st-The Epic-Badass; 3st-The BEST Western ever made!,"Leone after the underrated failure that was ""The Colossus of Rhodes"", Leone decided to put his career in order doing the remake of the Japanese classic ""Yojimbo"" turning it into a American-Western filmed in Europe. ""A Fistful of Dollars"" not only launched his career, but started a new era of Western films. And then came the superb sequel that was ""For a few dollars more"". And as if that was not enough, Leone made the 3rd chapter of the story of the man with no name. And not only surpassed its predecessors but ended up being (maybe) the best westerns ever made.

""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" starts when Tuco (Eli Wallach), an Mexican outlaw, finds in the desert a Confederate convoy with all soldiers killed inside a wagon. But one of the soldiers was alive and tells Tuco about a certain treasure he hid in a coffin in a cemetery. Tuco goes to fetch water on his horse, to give to the soldier so that he could speak better, but when he is back the soldier died, and the only one who heard the name of the coffin was Blondie (Clint Eastwood) Tuco's former business partner which was being tortured by Tuco crossing the desert without drinking water because Blondie had betrayed him. Blondie knows the name of the coffin but it doesn't know the location of the cemetery, which Tuco does. Now both bastards have to work together to find and maybe split the treasure. But the mission becomes difficult when both meet Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) a lieutenant of the union army that knew longer about the treasure but it didn't know the name of the coffin. Now the three men who hate each other will have to join and across an America at war to find the mysterious treasure.

And why this movie is (in my opinion) the best Western ever made? Again, it was the fault of Leone and the exuberant cast. What Leone made in this film, was bring was what was excellent in the first two films and put it all together in this masterpiece. From the 1st movie is the superb narrative that flows in history always perfectly highlighting their characters in the story with chilling and (believe it or not) reflective dialogs.

And of course, Leone also destroys (in a good way) in his amazing direction. Giving not only spectacular and epic duels (which here contains the best ones of the trilogy), but also with breathtaking Italian landscapes serving as the Old West. Thanks to the success of the previous films Leone manages to give the film a huge magnitude, with gigantic landscapes and moments with beautiful scenery. Not only landscapes but presents us with one of the greatest cinematic battles, the Battle of Langston Bridge.

But as I mentioned before, Leone uses his genius in both script and direction, giving reflective moments to the story. Not only humanizes his characters, but gives the film a huge critic to America using a Western cliché. This cliché is the civil war, if you look at most Western movies (especially John Wayne's ones) they always had as stage the civil war. And through it Leone makes his criticism. It comes in moments like when Blondie and Tuco met Angel Eyes, they had been imprisoned by Union soldiers. In this open-air prison, the Confederates soldiers are forced to play and sing songs against their will, while the guards torture other prisoners. Clearly a metaphor comparing the Union soldiers to the Nazis, but this is based on facts. In many prison camps during the war, there was heavy torture and even rumors of cannibalism. And even a time when Tuco unwittingly confuses Union soldiers to Confederates ones, because they were covered in dust. Another metaphor trying to say that no matter what side you are, everyone is equal.

In performances the movie definitely surpasses its predecessors: Clint Eastwood once again the badass as he ever was in the trilogy. In this film we can see more of his human side and clear, despite his schemes and greed, it has clearly a ""good"" side; Eli Wallach excellent. Maybe his performance certainly reach the performance of Eastwood, as this character that even with ""ugly"" attitudes have a pure side; Lee Van Cleef again superb now as the villain. But maybe he's the only ""bad"" thing in the movie. Not his performance, but his character doesn't has moments of exploration that Tuco and Blondie had, but Leone does an excellent job showing why he is the devil in the movie.

In conclusion, Leone did absolutely in his masterpiece the best Western ever made. Thanks to an ambitious narrative that not only gives unforgettable characters but makes a big social criticism. Thanks to a huge and beautiful direction with incredible views that captures tense and epic moments; thanks to a creepy and classic soundtrack by Ennio Morricone; thanks to superb performances; thanks to Sergio Leone with his genius that brought us a masterpiece trilogy that redefined the Western forever, concluding it here perfectly making it legendary.

23 March 2008,One of the greatest movies ever made!,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

17 July 2021,Probably the best shootout in the history off the (spaghetti) Western,"""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is a (or maybe THE) spaghetti Western made by THE (without any doubt) most prominent director in this genre: Sergio Leone. Leone made two trilogies. The ""dollar trilogy"" (1964 - 1966) of which ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is the last one and The ""Once upon a time trilogy"" (1968 - 1984) of which ""Once upon a time in the West"" was the first one.

Technically speaking a spaghetti Western is a Western made by a non American director (often an Italian), shot on a non American location (often Spain) with not to expensive American actors (often at the beginning or the end of their career). More interesting however are the substantive differences. I shall discuss three differences, all of which are also to be found in ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"".

In the first place the role of the American history c.q the images about nation building in the storyline are far less prominent in the spaghetti Western. In spaghetti Westerns no native Americans or trail to the West. In ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" there are rather South American influences. The Ugly (Tuco played by Eli Wallach) is a Mexican and The Good (Blondie played by Clint Eastwood) dresses like a Southerner (poncho). The American civil war is no more then a coatrack for the rather minimalistic plot about treasure hunting.

In the second place the view of the world is far more cynical and pessimistic. In spaghetti Westerns no good guys against bad guys. Despite the title the three main characters in ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" are bad, even more bad and also bad.

Last but certainly not least the design of the movie. Sergio Leone liked long takes going all the way from panorama shots to (extreme) close ups. In the famous shootout at the end of the movie he takes this preference to the extreme.

Just like Eisenstein he liked weathered faces and for the supporting roles he used no professional extra's (as Hollywood would do) but local farmers. Leone also liked minimal dialogue, gaining space for the iconic music off Ennio Morricone.

For a long time ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" stand in the shadow of ""Once upon a time in the West"". The last years times are changing and on IMDB ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" has in the mean time the higher rating. For wat it is worth, ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" at least has more humor. The Good and the Ugly together form a duo vaguely reminiscent of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. The Tuco of Eli Wallach is a jester like figure that plays for a fool but in reality he is not. For this character Sergo Leone had however to set aside his preference for minimal dialogue.",8
6 November 2006,Let Me Count The Ways,"This is one of my favorite movies. I have been familiar with this movie since my youth (ah, those were the days! Before everyone had become so sensitive to viewer age ratings...) and it's always a welcome sight. Sure it's long (my DVD has extra footage added into the regular film) but that means there's always something new to focus on. I could go on and on about this movie. Eli Wallach gives one of the greatest supporting performances ever in a movie; in truth, he's really the star of this film. The direction is top notch with a gritty, funny and tender script. It is also a tribute to a different school of film-making, that which used the dubbing technique. The audio is a separate entity by itself, enabled to its height by Ennio Morricone's legendary soundtrack. I sometimes run the movie just to listen to it. There is a lot to talk about when discussing this film. Clint's hero seems to emerge at the same time in the 60's that John Wayne's hero seems a little out of touch - coincidence? I think not. This picture is worth at least a thousand words, but I'll spare you for now. Welcome this sight to your television!

5 April 2011,An epic masterpiece for the ages,"Exactly one year ago, I wrote my first reviews on this web site and this one is my review number one hundred. To underline and celebrate this kind of anniversary, I decided to pick one of my favourite movies of all times.

Everything about this movie just seems perfect to me.

Let's start with the director's work. Sergio Leone is one of the most gifted directors of all times and he had a feeling for monumental and impressing landscapes. His images are as epic as the scripts and stories. I also adore the way he captures the emotions of its actors. The devil is in the detail as he concentrates on seemingly instinctual nervous movements and actions, the impressions of the actor's faces and especially the looks of their eyes. Even almost fifty years after the release of this monumental milestone of the western genre, his way of filming remains unbeaten and unreached. It is emotional, well crafted and perfectly organized.

The filming goes hand in hand with the majestic score of the movie. Ennio Morricone is maybe the greatest composer for cinema alive. The instruments are diversified, the melodies epic and still catchy and filled with emotions of pressure, anger, despair, hope and joy that fusion perfectly with the chosen images. Without the music, often only chosen randomly to underline a conceptual background by many others, the movie wouldn't be the same. Sergio Leone really knew what he wanted and I music has never had such an important role in a movie since the end of the age of silent films. Without the works of Morricone, there would have been no place for many grand composers such as John Williams or Hans Zimmer that create stunning soundtracks nowadays.

Another amazing thing is the acting around the three key personalities. Lee van Cleef as Angel Eyes does the best work of his career as a cold hearted, pitiless and cool villain with an eerie look. He is not the usual bad guy but a rather silent, patient and intellectual villain and this what makes him appear so cruel and dangerous. Eli Wallach as Tuco, one of my favourite actors of all times, does also the best job of his long career in this movie. He plays an ugly little bandit that seems to be naive, superficial and rude at first sight but turns out to be much more diversified and is finally a crafty, darkly humorous and brutal villain that is nevertheless very sympathetic because of his high degree of charisma and the high amount of bad coincidences that he lives throughout the whole movie. Finally, Clint Eastwood as Blondie does also an amazing job and has developed since the first two movies he had done with Sergio Leone before. In this movie, he is extremely smart, calm and thoughtful but nevertheless a mean villain that plans and organizes everything at his advantage and that never stops to surprise. Those three memorable actors at the peak of their early careers have an amazing chemistry and I have never ever seen a movie with three outstanding actors. Normally, there are one or rarely two actors that give good movies a certain kind of soul and creativity, but this movie is graced by the works of three great actors. If that was not already enough, the supporting actors such as Aldo Giuffrè as a drunk and desperate Union Captain that befriends with the characters of Wallach and Eastwood.

One must also underline the story itself. It takes the time to slowly introduce each of the characters in their own special ways. The viewer gets the time to get used and connect with them before the main plot kicks off which is an unusual and great idea. The further development reveals more and more about the characters and their past. Lee van Cleef is shown as he fulfils his dirty works and contracts, Eli Wallach meets his brother, a catholic friar that confronts him with old family problems and Clint Eastwood remains the tough vagabond and mysterious man without a name. The story is filled with many memorable and diversified situations, connecting a the elements of a treasure chase with a tale of revenge and scenes of the American Civil War. The movie is not just a western, it's has some slight social touches that look behind the brutal characters and gore or desperate war or prison scenes. The movie has some touches of a drama, an anti war movie, a satire of the usual westerns and an epic adventure flick. There is much to discover and analyze beyond the main plot that is a breathtaking treasure chase filled with cliffhangers.

Finally, this movie has also had an important influence on an entire genre. The Italian spaghetti western genre got finally accepted and boomed as well as the whole western genre. The movie made an incredible gross with a very low budget. Many critics regard this movie as a classic nowadays and even people which use to hate westerns happen to like this flick, especially women. That's why this movie is way more than just a western, it is an epic masterpiece for the ages and everybody that disagrees on that has a very subjective point of view because the artistic factor of this flick is very elevated and the acting memorable. Everybody that hasn't seen this movie yet should do this right now, it is one of those movies one should have seen at least once in a lifetime. Personally, I watch this flick at least once a year and I'm always looking forward to it and never get bored. I happen to invite friends that don't know this movie yet to open their minds and until now, I never got less than enthusiastic comments.

I would say that this movie is probably my favourite one of all times until now and will surely stay in my eternal top five.",10
17 December 2016,Possibly the greatest movie ever made,"I can see why this is considered one of the greatest films ever made. The film is about three very different men in the old West looking for a two thousand dollar treasure. The acting is a tour de force, especially coming from the actor playing The Ugly. The soundtrack is famously outstanding. The gun play and action is so real and visceral. The build up works with the tension and a million other things to bring the story to life. This is practically a three hour movie but it seems like just an hour because you're having a great time watching; and you are so invested in the characters and plot. I can not say enough about this film, it is brilliant.

10 December 2003,Boring and slow,"I consider myself a movie freak and sat down to watch The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly with baited breath.

What a long and torturous road it was.

One of the most overrated movies of all time, up there with 2001.

I have nothing against slow movies, if there's a point to them and if we give a rat's behind about any character in it. Not in this movie.

Even the memorable score is loud and overused and becomes annoying before the halfway point.

Avoid at all costs.

11 November 2013,One of the best !,"One of the greatest movies ever made...It's long but it's good ! The actors are awesome, the story's great but the shooting is really incredible ! The final scene is breathtaking and there's quotes everywhere ! Sergio Leone at the top ! And Eastwood too. The music by Morricone is one of the best soundtrack ever (the main theme is one of the greatest music ever made). It's a must-have film. A classic. You just have to see it. It's a thing to do when we love movies. And the note is... 9 out of 10 (not 10 because it's a little bit too long). Buy the DVD, buy the Blu-Ray, buy the VHS, laser disc, buy all ! The climax of spaghetti western. The best trilogy ever made with The Godfather and Back To The Future.

What I did not like is how slow the film was, some scenes just dragged on forever, staring and waiting. Also the Bad guy had way less runtime than the Good and the Ugly, I wish all three characters had similar runtime.

19 October 2010,Fourth Place All Time For Me,"I recently watched the 2003 DVD that contains the fully restored three hour version of this classic western. For those of you not familiar with the storyline, it revolves around the attempts of three rouges to find a missing fortune in Confederate gold in New Mexico during the Civil War. The 2003 DVD has an excellent audio commentary by film critic Richard Schickel, who also collaborated with Eastwood on a definitive Eastwood biography. I gave this film a 10 out of 10 star ranking in IMDb. It scored 20 points in my ranking system, placing it in fourth place all time.

Here's the Good:

Eli Wallach and Leone created one of the great villains in the history of cinema. Tuco is equal parts amoral scourge, paisan sympatico and stand up comic. The only characters in the history of Westerns that compare are Little Bill in ""Unforgiven"", Judge Roy Bean in ""The Westerner"" and Joe Erin in ""Vera Cruz"". Gene Hackman and Walter Brennan both won Best Supporting Actor Oscars for those performances. If the Academy ever decides to start handing out retroactive awards, this would be a good place to start.
























The Bad and the Ugly:",10
19 January 2016,"Better civil war movie than ""gone with the wind""","This is the first western film I ever saw, and I must say that it was a pleasant surprise. While it's made clear which characters are the good, the bad and the ugly, There's no real 'good' in the film: all of the three main characters have their 'good' side (except maybe the bad, who seems the only really cruel character). The first really good thing is the setting. With the civil war background, it gave quite realism to the whole story. The film could make feel the horror of thew civil war much better than 'gone with the wind' did, simply because it showed one single battle. Tuco's character is maybe the most interesting one. Ennio Morricone's music felt sometimes too peaceful respect the scenes it was meant for, but was still really good. The best thing about the good, the bad and the ugly is that despite it's 2h 40m long, and there's not too much action, it keeps you on. While I'm not really happy with extended violence, and this movie has plenty of violence and cruelty, I really enjoyed this film. I don't usually say if a movie is the best ever made, but this deserves its high position in the top 250.

1 March 2023,Heavy on Style that Just Doesn't Click with Me,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966): A grossly overrated Western that never comes close to justifying its three-hour runtime. Like Sergio's Once Upon a Time in the West, this film is drenched in memorable style (spaghetti Western art direction and that iconic Morricone score) but lacks genuine substance. I don't think there's a single thing this film does better than the two previous entries. If anything it doubles down on all the worst parts of the first two. This is the Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End of the ""Dollars Trilogy"" - tons of ambition, drenched in the style of the first two, but it never feels substantive or clicks like the earlier ones. The plot is a cat and mouse chase for Confederate gold with the Civil War in the backdrop. The narrative always feels like a continual wheel spinning to me and I never remember it long after watching. The shootouts are dramatic and iconic (but not shot as 'action' scenes), and like the previously mentioned style, are the saving grace of this three bore fest.

22 April 2020,More 'important' than 'good,"POSITIVES:

.The three central performances are great .The Ennio Morricone score is iconic .The film is clearly important and has inspired / been ripped off by many films since .The cinematography is beautiful

NEGATIVES:

.There is no need for any film to be 3 hours long .The poor foreign language dubbing is just lame .It takes half the runtime before the film even properly starts, the detours frustrated me

16 January 2008,Timeless,"Varying opinions on this film posted, but for me its a top quality, ground breaking film that is timeless. This is the ultimate test of a great film. It stands up with any modern classic, it has humour, twists, stylised violence, and its just a top film.It wasn't the first spaghetti western i know, but i think its by far the best. I just wish they had done a sequel to this. Some how i don't think Tuco was a man to take this lying down .... or hanging around.

""Hey, Blond ... You know what you are? Just a dirty son of a-bi .....""

Tuco now had all the money he could wish for, but no one double crosses Tuco and lives . . .

21 May 2008,Pure cinematic brilliance,"Sergio Leones ""The good, the bad, and the ugly"" is one of the greatest films ever made. It's funny, sad, brutal, intelligent and everything that a movie could ever want, or hope, to be.

The directing: Every camera angle seems perfect. The camera catches emotions in extreme closeups, and shows the startling beauty of the landscape in huge panning shots. It's the perfect mix of Closeups, and landscape shots. The camera never seems to be in the wrong place, and ever movement is exciting and stylish.

The plot: This movie isn't very plot based, and Sergio seems to be more interested in how the characters react to situations, instead of being interested in those actual situations. Yet this doesn't hurt the movie one bit. In fact, it frees up the plot, and allows the viewer to fully enjoy the movie's style without being hampered with the plot. Occationally, Sergio indulges himself in a few side plots that maybe break the pace a tiny bit, but generally work with everything. To take those out would seriously diminish with the beauty of the film. The plot is atypical for western movies, but you don't really worry about it being cheese or not because the movie doesn't dwell on plot points.

The characters and acting: The good (clint Eastwood) is a flawed bounty hunter. There is a certain irony in his performance, as even ""the good"" is imperfect. Eastwood's Man with No Name performance is incredible, and he manages to be cool and slick in any situation. The bad (lee van chleef) is brilliant character because he makes the other two seem like little floating angels. Angel eyes is heartless, and the epitome of pure evil. The ugly (eli wallach) is immoral and disgusting, but strangely likable. Eli Wallach gives a brilliant performance, that sometimes threatens to outshine the other actors (this never happens though).

The music: There are not enough good words in the world to describe the music. It is beautiful, heartbreaking, heroic, and magical. The use of yodeling and electric guitar combine perfectly to make probably the most unforgettable theme song yet.

Thanks for reading.",10
8 September 2010,A masterpiece,"This film is one piece of unparalleled Cinema, you just can't avoid film like this to leave an impression upon you. This film gives me a Film fever that I enjoy the most.LET ME SAY IT SERGIO LEONE was a Master Filmmaker:One that was neglected during his lifetime,not taken seriously by critics as well. I can't wipe the memory of this film when I saw it first in 2002,it was just the musical score first that grabbed my attention but later on entire film took my breath away. I can write loads about this film,This will go down in the history of film making as one of the finest films ever made & Certainly one of the best Western ever made.Score by ENNIO MORRICONE is one of the best.I am never tired of watching this film again & again.Everything about this film is great from Script to Direction. VIVA SERGIO

25 May 2020,Classic Western,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is a sprawling Western epic set in the civil war. A bounty hunter and a bandit join forces against an assassin in a race to find a fortune in gold buried beneath a war grave in a remote cemetary. The script is full of shootouts, double-crossings, and witty banter.

Watch. the theatrical version, not the extended version. The theatrical version is already quite long. Other than the length, the only flaw is that the musical score is repetitive.

30 August 2019,Your Cinema Apogee...,"In widescreen? Nothing touches this film for its scope, it's grandeur and it's ambition. I can think, like you, of better movies but for big cinema it's untouchable. It's the zenith of ""westerns"". It's Wagnerian in its scope & breadth. It's the height of Morricone & Sergio Leone. Argue if you differ...

1 August 2008,Stylish Classic,"I don't generally like ""Western"" genre movies because they romanticize violence. But, this movie was an exception. It is so stylishly made that it is difficult to criticize its portrayal of violence. Director Sergio Leone has transformed a simple treasure hunt story into a finely crafted piece of art. Even though the movie is pretty long and slow moving, it still keeps you engaged till the end with its many, unexpected twists and turns. The background music is brilliant and conveys the feel of an anarchic and violent climate. The actors fit their character roles perfectly, especially Eli Wallach as Tuco. Though, I would not rate this as the best movie ever made, I would certainly agree that it is one the greatest movies of the last century.

15 May 2006,One of the Finest of the Western Genre,"Sergio Leone's masterpiece, the finest of his Westerns that were far superior in artistic merit than the term ""spaghetti western"" implies. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach make a splendid trio of rivals endeavoring to outsmart (or put a bullet in) each other, and grab a lot more than a fistful of dollars.

Rampant symbolism, which over the years has become more and more prevalent in westerns, is in abundance here. This movie shirks the old, clearly defined, white hat/black hat rivals that have a predictable shoot-out in the street at the end. Now you have a backdrop of the Civil War and its tragic consequences. Also, there's a third gunfighter, ""The Ugly"" (Wallach) equal with a gun as the other two, and just as cold-blooded in using it as ""The Bad"" (Van Cleef). For good measure, there's a lot of greasy-and sweaty-faced would-be gunfighters who have the misfortune of messing with these guys. Even ""The Good"" (Eastwood) is less than perfect (but his tarnished halo gleams when he's compared to his two rivals).

Lots of ""running"" dialog is here, and it's tantalizingly tempting to use a ""there's two kinds of people, my friend"" joke in the review. Each of the three men has information about where a cache of gold is hidden, but none of them has all the clues, so they have to form uneasy alliances. There's good character development, as you learn about the relationship of the three gunfighters, their backgrounds, and why they act as they do (particularly Wallach's character).

Also, there's ongoing and poignant Civil War episodes that move parallel with the gunfighters' story. The scene of a character running madly through a cemetery is stunning in its double-meaning eloquence.

This story inexorably approaches the ultimate western movie signature event, as they gamble their lives against their 1-in-3 chance to survive and claim the golden prize. However, the classic duel in the sun is here built to with exhilarating tension, as the combatants assume a unique positioning for the fight; all the while, the famous music score rises in intensity to complement this climactic moment of truth.

Don't dismiss this epic masterpiece as a ""horse-opera"" or a ""spaghetti western."" There's a lot more going on here than good guys and bad guys riding horses and shooting it out. It's a brilliantly executed story, a classic of its genre.",10
19 June 2011,"The good,the better,and the best","The Good,the bad and the ugly IS the greatest western ever.That is a fact,now you know,nothing can change it.To be quite fair,this film is perfect,flawless,epic and awesome.There are two kinds of people in the world:Those who love The Good,the bad,and the ugly,and those who don't. Okay,let's say you have never heard of the film and you have never seen.Well that does not change the fact that you have heard the theme score at least once.The main theme score which was composed by Ennio Morricone has been spoofed,imitated,made fun of,homaged,ripped off on so on and so fourth.Every single human being has heard the score.Hmmm...lost my train of thought here,now where was I?Oh,yeah of course.PERFECTION!

The music is perfect and flawless The cinematography is great The performances are all very convincing The story sucks you in The dialogue is very good The humour always works The action is top notch The landscape is awesome

The only thing you may not like about this movie is length.I do not mind,because watching something perfect for 3 hours is really fun.

CHECK IT OUT! If you do not check it out,well then you are missing out!",10
15 February 2007,Artsy-Fartsy Duality Thing,"Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is two movies in one. No, not a movie I can't make up my mind about, but two different and separate entities. It's the damnedest thing! The first movie is a visually fascinating, heavily plotted Euro-Western with elements that Americans can easily identify with and enjoy. It's a bloody, emotional, and almost mystical horse opera that can't help but get under your skin and keep you enthralled for three hours. It's cinematic art and commercial dynamite. I've love it and been riveted by GBU for thirty-some years.

And yet . . .

It's also an embarrassing, sweaty, badly-dubbed, cartoonish bowl of sticky pasta and blood red sauce. It's so over-the-top that at almost any moment, you expect Clint, Lee, and Eli to stop working and break into a you-gotta-be-kidding-with-this-crap fit of hysterics.

I think the movie is like one of those double image toys you had as a kid, the ones that would change their image if you angled them this way or that. Both images were there, it just depended on your angle.

Or in the movie's case, your mood.

Over my years, I've seen the movie probably a dozen times. In bits and pieces, maybe another dozen. I've found that the really good movies are the ones I'll switch to even if I know it's already been on for awhile or hold on to it when I'm just spinning the dial (how's that for a phrase that's both obsolete and understandable?). There's an old Judith Crist saying, ""Even bad Hitchcock is pretty good.""

Well, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is great and awful and visually mesmerizing. To paraphrase Crist, even a few minutes of GBU (which she hated) is a better use of time than most of the kludge you'll find on the tube or in the ""New"" section of the video store.

And you can't go wrong with a movie that has the line, ""If you're gonna shoot, shoot. Don't talk!""

Considering the quality of my writing, I should commence firing right away.",
28 July 2009,The greatest movie ever made. Period.,"Where do I start? Good Bad and Ugly was such an awesome, awesome film. From the second it began, I was glued to the screen, continuously wondering exactly what would happen next. Having watched it for the 2nd time last night, I am still unable to get this amazing piece of art out of my mind. There is no way possible that Sergio Leone is not the greatest director of all time. But enough of me rambling, let me give a reason for my madness.....

This film has some of the best acting you will ever find from an allstar cast. Clint Eastwood returns in his role as The Man With No Name, or as he is referred to in this particular film, Blondie, and he plays the role flawlessly, supplying lots of memorable quotes in the process. And then there is Eli Wallach playing the comical bandit called Tuco. Tuco is one of the most hilarious characters ever in movie-making, and there are plenty of scenes where he makes an absolute fool of himself, as well as making others look like idiots in a very funny manner. Finally, there's Lee Van Cleef playing the role of ruthless hit-man Angel Eyes. Van Cleef does superbly in getting the audience to really despise the character he plays because he obviously puts so much emotion into playing the merciless Angel Eyes, who doesn't hesitate to kill ANYONE.....for the right price, that is.

But it has been proved numerous times that good acting alone will not make a movie a classic. And fortunately, Leone's masterpiece features one of the most clever plots ever. The story revolves around gunslingers Blondie, Tuco, and Angel Eyes looking for a treasure of gold buried by Confederate troops in a remote cemetery. But here's the interesting part- none of them are able to find the gold without one of the two others. See, each of the three men know a vital fact about the location of the gold that the others need in order to find it. Tuco knows the name of the cemetery, Blondie knows the name of the grave the gold is buried under, and Angel Eyes, like Tuco, knows the name of the cemetery. With an innovative story like that, a director like Sergio Leone, and a stellar cast of actors like Eastwood, Wallach, and Van Cleef, you know ahead of time you are going to see something special. Everything unfolds at such a smooth pace throughout the film, and there are lots of interesting twists that keep you guessing.

But there are two things about this film that stand out to me, even above the acting and story. And those two things are the musical score done by Ennio Morricone and the ending climax of this film. I won't say anything other than they are two things that need to be heard/seen by everyone. Awe-inspiring stuff.

So going back to my original statement, Sergio Leone's The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly is without a doubt the greatest film ever made.

26 May 2013,"'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly' with an emphasis on the 'good'","What makes 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly' iconic ranges from many things such as Ennio Morricone's memorable score not only defining this movie, but spaghetti westerns, to its unforgettable scenes, depicting beauty and grit in the world created by Sergio Leone. Watching the movie feels like listening to a long musical composition, watching it build and build into a heart pounding crescendo, at the same time basking in the scenes where time feels like it slows down so we could soak in the beauty that this ugly, fragile world has to offer.

What I love about this film, is how it can be light-hearted and fun, yet still feel deep, heavy and contemplative at times. We don't get to know the characters at all (except a bit about Tuco), but we get to know them through their actions, and we truly find out the nature of why these three characters have these titles of 'the good,' 'the bad,' and 'the ugly.' To see these characters interact is a treat to watch, but what captivated me about the film was the great Clint Eastwood and his performance at 'The Man with no Name' or 'Blondie' as Tuco would address him as. He is the definitive embodiment of the stoic, anti-hero with an air of mystery as to where he comes from and his motives, which is what kept me in suspense through out the movie. From his strategic thinking in outsmarting Tuco, he is basically floating through a world of chaos, adapting to any unexpected messy situation these characters get thrown into. Then, when we finally get to the ending, we don't know what will become of the characters and that unpredictability is what makes this one moment in the movie one of the most intense scenes in cinema. Without spoiling anything, all I could say is that I felt the ending was clever in a way I didn't see coming at all.

With a great setting, a great score, great performances and a simple, but very great story, this is a western film I highly recommend you should watch, if you have never watched any westerns before. On that note, this is not only a great western film, but a wonderful piece of art from Sergio Leone. From the films I've watched by him, everyone of those films possess that layer of depth to them that feels like that feeling of bliss in life that comes once in a blue moon. Even with a film as dark as 'Once Upon a Time in the West' or 'Once Upon a Time in America,' Leone still manages to emit a feeling of warmth through his stories, and with all its guns and grit, 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' is pure beauty on film.",10
9 April 2020,I could only make it 1 1/4 hours...,"So excited to finally watch this during the corona lockdown though I was worried with the 3 hour run time.

We Loved the cinematography but why was all the dialogue dubbed?!? It ruined it for me. This isn't a foreign film for goodness sake.

Then the story line was slow and tedious and it just kinda stunk.

Maybe the next 1 3/4 hours gets better but we didn't want to watch it.

So bummed.

16 January 2006,Not a wasted shot,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

11 October 2017,One of the Greats,"When a good director meets up with a great story and quality actors join in along with an impressive music scoring you then have quality entertainment coming your way. In this case you will not only enjoy spending quality time with this movie but visit the days of the Wild West from different points of view. Good and bad guys, old towns, civil war, women, guns, gold, and three men who stood out in their time. This movie does something I always look for i.e. memorable scenes which is the reason to ""comeback"" and view this movie several times in addition to wanting it for your personal collection. Its a sure thing for your viewing pleasure. The characters in this movie make us believe without effort that this is really happening and we can relate to it because it is so close to real human nature. Survival instincts, greed, vanity, betrayal, trust, and so many other human nature points are all acted out making us relate. I like to eat while watching a movie and there are some eating scenes that make you want to ""eat-a-long"". Highly recommend a stew type meal, bread and a tasty drink or Turkey legs for this movie. Make sure you catch the extended version for maximum enjoyment. Also, the music score is such an important part of this movie almost like a movie itself. Enjoy the good, the bad and the ugly",10

22 September 2018,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly Review","The Good, the Bad, and the ugly was a joy to watch from start to finish. From its acting to its beautiful cinematography, this is a must watch for anyone who is a lover of Western film. The story itself is interesting. Three men after a bunch of gold is a very simple set up, but as the story progresses it gets deeper than that. My only issues were the voiceovers and some of the scenes that seemed to drag out, but other than that The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is indeed one classic film. 8/10

3 June 2019,"Not only the best western, but arguably the best movie ever made","I can go on and on about this movie which has been my favorite for over 20 years now, but it's all been said a hundred times already. Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone are both geniuses and so are the 3 lead actors, they will always be remembered because they created perfection itself.

If you love anything about movies, anything at all, then you MUST see this movie, hell if you just like music then watch it for the score. Forget that I am a western fanboy and that it is my favorite, objectively it is one of the 5 finest movies ever made, it is flawless.

9 May 1999,This is what a western should be like,"I'm no western buff. Heck, I haven't even seen a John Wayne movie through to the end. But if I can imagine a western, it should be like The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly. This movie (yes, it's a plain, down to earth, good old-fashioned MOVIE), was histerically funny at times. It was sharp and witty at other times. And it was even sad at some points. But overall, it was fun to watch, which is a lot more than could be said for most of today's ""entertainment"". Whether it's historically accurate, I don't know. And I don't care. It was just too much fun to worry about anything else! Hee-haw!

26 September 2011,Sergio Leone's masterpiece,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a masterpiece. However way you put it, it boils down to this. It's by far the best of Leone's 'Man With No Name' trilogy, and in all likelihood the best western film ever made; and like The Godfather, it's one of those rare films that satisfy completely both as entertainment and as art.

The artistic elements in the film come together fantastically well. It's perfectly shot, edited and scored. In fact, the final scene is one of the finest examples in cinema history of an inspired composition of sound and image.

It's the best film of Clint Eastwood's career, and his most iconic performance, but it's not the best performance in the film - Eli Wallach spectacularly steals the show from right under his nose.

25 September 2006,An Ageless Western,"Just watching it right now for the first time, i'd honestly would have a hard time believing this was made back in 1966. This is probably for the simple fact of the matter that Sergio Leone and his crew were thinking way ahead of their time, a method of thinking and shooting that critics couldn't even comprehend at the time.

Fortunately, the audience did. And the audience has grown stronger as the decades rolled by.

While I can't say the climax was as great as I thought it was going to be, everything else is rock solid. My favorite parts were in the beginning, the shots and scenery chosen by Leone were nothing short of perfect. The trademark extreme closeups look as stylish today as they did four decades ago, a trademark that Quentin Tarantino later used in his breakthrough hit ""Pulp Fiction"".

The story itself is simple, but simplicity is always a good thing. Three bandits (Angel Eyes - Bad, Blondie - Good, and Tuco - Ugly) cross paths and double cross each other all in search of a common goal: hidden treasure. And that's pretty much it, everything else in between is very good filler and bits of character development (most notably for Tuco). Though I wished the Civil War bits were more interesting and the climax was better, it all doesn't ruin the rest of the film (which is nothing but greatness).",8
3 October 2013,Timeless and Fresh,"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is the final film of Sergio Leone's The Man With No Name Trilogy. This film is recognized by most as the best film from the trilogy, some argue that it's Leone's best film overall. I, on the other hand, found this film great but it did have it's flaws. I also cannot say this film is the filmmaker's best as I found this film to be equally as good as For A Few Dollars More.

This film was mainly written by Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni. Both also collaborated in writing the previous film. I'll start by saying the great things about the film's screenplay. The film is huge in comparison to the previous film and even more when you compare to the A Fistful of Dollars. The best part of the film in my opinion are the characters as Leone and Vincenzoni have created people that are very focused on their goal, but at the same time keeping them interesting by adding personality with these characters which clearly defines them. Though I do wish that Lee Van Cleef's character was written more screen time to allow us to understand more about the character, which Leone did incredibly well for Gian Maria Volonte in For A Few Dollars More. The film's title is ironic because each one of the main characters are just as ugly as the other one, being driven by greed and will do whatever they can to get the gold, even if breaks the partnership between characters. The bad part, nothing ugly, about the film's story is the middle part of the film which at times can become a bit too draggy and doesn't keep me on my toes as it does on Leone's previous films. That is just a minor nitpick as it's still tolerable and it only affects me a few times during my many viewings of the film.

Leone's direction and vision for this film is much bigger and concrete. The man knew what he wanted to do for this film and since his other two films he has gained a major boost on his confidence. This made the film feel very patient, showing shots that take it's time in moving on to the next shot or scene. The scope of the film has drastically expanded, showing huge location shots with actors looking very miniature on screen, which at times juxtaposes with the extreme close ups that are also abundant of this film. I think Leone was influenced by David Lean, as moments feel like something that came off from Lawrence of Arabia or at least similarly. Leone is known for creating a memorable climax, and this one may be the most memorable one.

The film's director of photography is Tonino Delli Colli who would then work with Leone later on his future films. I wished that Massimo Dallamano came back for this film, the previous film's cinematographer, as he has created a particular style that suited Leone's direction and vision, but Colli didn't do a bad job for this film as he still kept it like a western and increased the scope of Leone's previous films. His work here has definitely become iconic but personally I felt that his best work was Once Upon A Time In America. Leone and Colli's photography shines specifically on moments like the scene with the open desert and the graveyard climax.

Ennio Morricone comes back for this film and is definitely his best work. Morricone's score here is much bigger in comparison to his previous work. Morricone's score for this film is much more complex and diverse than his first film with Leone. Leone has created a particular melody and created three styles of delivering it, relating each to a character. Morricone's score stood out the most during the climax as it felt like a throwback to his previous score but interlacing it with his current score. A moment in the POW camp where the prisoners are playing music to drown out torture noises was a moment that showed so much emotion; this was achieved with great acting, beautiful photography, but mostly due to the music. This was the first time I felt that Leone can create something emotional and dramatic, which was not really present on his previous films.

The acting spotlight here is equally shared by Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach. Eastwood plays it darker in this film, due to his character being very driven to obtain that gold and will do whatever he can to ensure that he'll get it. At the same time, Eastwood is given moments in this film that showcases a humanitarian point of view, which I thought was a nice touch. Van Cleef's character was a little underused in this film as Wallach and Eastwood had a wider screen time, but when he comes on screen (like the introduction of the character) he plays it cool and at times a bit dark. Van Cleef definitely surprised me because I never really saw him as a villain due to his fantastic performance from his previous film. Eli Wallach was like breath of fresh air, his humor and style of acting really drove the film forward and kept the tone light. Leone has brought back familiar faces from his previous films, kind of like a cameo and a treat for people who are fans of his work.

The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a very well made film but it's minor flaws prevent it from being perfect. It currently ties with For A Few Dollars More but this is just my opinion of the film at the time of writing. I may end up loving this film a lot more as I grow older and with repeated watching. The film has definitely stood the test of time and remain feeling like a fresh and unique in comparison to the many Western films of that era.",10
16 March 2019,Greatest of the Trilogy,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is a timeless classic. It stars one of America's greatest actors of all time, Clint Eastwood, in his prime. Its fabulous soundtrack is in the fabric of society. And the title phrase itself is used countlessly in popular culture. This is one of the first, one of the few, to attain such immortal status

25 August 2001,Great but weird western,"This is the grand-daddy of all spagetti westerns. It is a journey epic of greed and mischief, made all the more strange because it is set during the Civil War but appears to take place in the far American West -- which is actually somewhere in Italy. All of this provides a surreal quality to the movie as it follows the three title characters on a quest for gold the likes of which hasn't been seen since John Huston's TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE.

There is an underlying sense of humor and satire in the film. Eli Wallach steals guns, money, watches, snuff boxes, gold -- and the whole movie -- with his wry comic performance. He is a nasty, nasty bandit to whom nothing is sacred, but he feels that it is necessary to bless himself ever time he sees a dead body.

This is a classic.

17 August 2020,"Many Iconic Moments, But Also Too Long, And Flat During The Civil War Scenes.","Too long, and flat in places, but with several iconic scenes mixed in. Not to mention some very iconic music. When I first watched it as a teenager, I of course loved it; but when I watch it now as an adult, I find it less riveting. I think (and many would probably disagree with this) that most, if not all of the Civil War scenes, tend to,make the film less flowing. Certainly they make it unnecessarily long. If Leone had chosen to not concentrate so much on creating a spectacle or epic, but focused on the key point of the movie (i.e the gold) I would have personally enjoyed it more. Heck, I would have given it a 7, or 8 even. All three leads do a good job, with Wallach providing the comic relief, and Eastwood most of its cool factor. The last 20 or 30 minutes, I have to say, is classic, and near perfect. So overall worth watching, great ending, but be prepared to nod off here and there.

When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

3 November 2010,Breathtaking,"Just this one movie could make Sergio Leone one of greatest directors in the history but he was capable of even more. This is just breathtaking from the very first ten fully speechless minutes where not a word is being said till the very end where's Mexican showdown with a strongest emotional tension is shown and developed through its tiniest details.

I couldn't say what I love most about this film. Whether it is a truly epic approach that combines U.S. Civil War showcase from its both sides with a treasure seeking story and coincidences their pathways all the time. Or it is ultimately charismatic heroes Blondie, Angel Eyes and Tuco who're saying short but sharp phrases and joking all the time. Or it is one of greatest Ennio Morricone achievements where his music is put more than perfectly behind the action. Or it is an ultimately beautiful cinematography that shows you both close shots and great panoramas. I just can't decide but the movie just sucks you in and never lets you out of it's simply but astonishingly well told story.",10
22 November 2013,Best movie ever (In my humble opinion),"Let's start by mentioning that if Sergio Leone hadn't made the ""Dollars Trilogy"" as this movie is part of, western movies would have died out, they were on the brink of extinction, so I say that we should pay our respects to the unfortunately passed away Mr. Leone.

Now to the movie. This movie is in my opinion; *beep* amazing. Everything from the acting to the setting to the beautiful score by Ennio Morricone, it is all perfect. The cast does a superb job in this movie, I am especially fond of Clint Eastwood as ""Blondie"" or as he's more known as throughout the series, ""The Man With No Name"". And from what I heard, this movie is a prequel to the rest of the series. This is in my opinion, the best movie ever. It is not only because of every good thing in the movie but also because I have a soft spot for westerns, especially older spaghetti westerns. But my favorite thing about this work of art is probably the main theme song that was composed by the amazing Ennio Morricone, it is probably one of the most recognized theme songs ever, I even knew it when I was 10 and I had not even seen the slightest of this movie or even heard of it.

This movie is a masterpiece that will be loved Western fans and Film- buffs alike.

Hope this helped!",10
12 August 2008,Man's inhumanity to man,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters.

14 October 2012,Clint Eastwood at his best!,"I love Clint Eastwood in pretty much everyone movie he acts in or directs. He is just such a bad ass in all his movies and it makes them very enjoyable. I don't even much care for westerns but I really liked this one. It had good action and good story line. If there is something wrong with this however it is probably that it is too long. Overall I say give this one a watch if you don't mind older movies and westerns.

When a movie is made in 1966 its obviously not going to have the production values of the movies these days and thats why I feel the old movies are getting lost by everyone in the new generation and im only 20 but I know none of my friends like good old movies.

18 June 2006,The Quintessential Spaghetti Western,"Between 1964 and 1975, it is said that there were no fewer than three hundred Italian-made (though shot in Spain) so-called ""spaghetti westerns"" made. Most of them were done on the kinds of budgets that wouldn't even cover the catering costs of most big budget Hollywood extravaganzas of today. And, truth be told, most of them weren't very good, with badly dubbed voices, and sadistic violence. But Sergio Leone, though he loathed the term ""spaghetti western"", was different. In his famous ""Dollars"" trilogy, he not only became a director of international renown, but he also elevated his star Clint Eastwood from the Rowdy Yates years of ""Rawhide"" to immortality as The Man With No Name. The first two films of that trilogy were 1964's A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and 1965's FOR A FEW DOLLARS more, both of which were released in America in 1967. The final, and best, film of that trilogy was the mercurial THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY, made in 1966 and released here in America at the end of 1967. In the nearly forty years since, it has come to be seen quite rightly as the quintessential film of the much misunderstood spaghetti western genre.

Eastwood reprises his Man With No Name role, having come across information from a dying casualty of the Civil War regarding a $200,000 treasure buried in a massive cemetery. The problem is, of course, this dying soldier has only told Eastwood part of the information; the other part of it is with a Mexican bandido named Tuco (Wallach, in an extension of his role in the 1960 western classic THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN). They form an uneasy alliance as they travel across the hellish landscape of the Civil War-era Southwest, along with the sadistic Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef, extending his role from FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE). Everything, of course, comes to a climax in that massive cemetery, and a traditional Leone-choreographed showdown of tremendous intensity.

In contrast to A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS (which was indeed made with a fistful of dollars--$100,000) and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE (made, of course, for a few dollars more--$400,000), Leone lavished $1.2 million on THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY; and every red cent (or lira) shows up on the screen. Leone and his cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli never miss a trick, as the film juxtaposes wide-open, albeit sun-scorched, landscapes with extreme close-ups of the characters' faces. That last aspect is most in evidence during the climactic showdown. There are also plenty of good lines to be had as well, many of them variations on ""There are two kinds of people in this world."" The extremes in the performances of Eastwood, Wallach, and Van Cleef may make it seem like Leone doesn't have any control over the film, but he does indeed, and those extreme performances are absolutely right for this outrageously successful film.

But the thing that really seals the deal in THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY, of course, is Ennio Morricone's intense music score, one of the finest composed for any kind of film ever, western or otherwise. The main theme is known to just about anyone who has ever seen even part of this movie; and the cues for the ""Ecstasy Of Gold"" and ""Trio"" scenes at the end burn with fiery intensity and sweating suspense. This successful collaboration of Leone and Morricone, begun in the two earlier films, would reach its apex in the 1969 epic that is generally agreed to be Leone's true masterpiece, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST.

Very lengthy, often blackly comic, flamboyant, and unquestionably violent, THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY is the definitive film in this much-maligned genre, and a film that, aside from the typically bad dubbing of the Italian actors, keeps having an impact to this very day.",8

28 January 2002,Comical and Cynical at the Same Time,"Il Buono Il Brutto Il Cattivo/The Good The Bad & The Ugly(1966) which portrayed as a sequel is actually a prequel. One indication that this is a prequel is the fact that Man with no Name begins to wear trademark outfit here. Also, story takes place right before events depicted in For a Few Dollars More(1965). Finally, film sets Blondie up as a mythical antihero in the making. Only film in Dollar trilogy where Clint Eastwood does not get beaten up. Surperbly crafted Western with hardly any flaws or boring moments.

American Civil War and its grim aspects are important to plot of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly(1966). Portrays participates of Civil War as money hungry, glory seeking, absurdly idealized people. Examplified by a North and South army's fight for control of a bridge. The battle scene that follows shows Civil War in unromantic viewpoint. Cynical film about realities of American Civil War in same way that Giu La Testa/A Fistful of Dynamite(1972) was on Mexican Revolution. Civil War is shown in a harsh and realistic manner akin to that of an Ambrose Bierce Civil War short story.

Blondie is an opportunistic bounty hunter with both heroic and villainous tendencies. His introduction to story is both suspenseful and tense. Clint Eastwood gives his most satisfying performance here among three films he did for Sergio Leone. Blondie is also a mythical person who has a good understanding of human nature. Although his main concern is money, Blondie still has some honorable qualities within him as expressed in his interaction with a dying soldier. A cool character who in story turns disadvantage into advantage.

Angel Eyes as played by Lee Van Cleef is a purely evil and vicious gunslinger. Angel Eyes introduction is memorable as he takes out rivals who hired him to kill the other. Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes is second to Henry Fonda's performance in Once Upon a Time in the West(1968) as Leone's best villain. A pinnicle role in the career of Lee Van Cleef. Angel Eyes is the mirror image of Blondie with his skills with the gun and hunger for money. Makes Villains in contemporary Hollywood films look like wimps.

Tuco is the most complex and sympathetic of the trio. Has an outlaw persona with traits of humanity that does not make him an entirely bad person. The Good The Bad & The Ugly(1966) is Eli Wallach's film in same way For a Few Dollars More(1965) was Lee Van Cleef's film. Eli Wallach turns Tuco into a comical and daring character who is always trying to better himself. In a sense, Tuco is alike to Vasco of Sergio Corbucci's Companeros(1970). A well written and three dimensional character due to fine work by Eli Wallach and Sergio Leone.

Sergio Leone shows Wild West life and scenery in stylistic realism. Sergio Leone by the time, The Good The Bad & The Ugly(1966) came out had mastered his skills as a filmmaker which shows in direction and screenplay. Sergio Corbucci did his own take on this film a couple of years later with !Vamos a Matar, Companeros!(1970). In Companeros(1970) there is also an uneasy partnership as well as a good(Franco Nero), a bad(Jack Palance), and an ugly(Tomas Milian). Plot of The Good, the Bad, and the ugly is characterized by switching partnerships and double crosses. Each person teams up with one or the other to make it easiler to get the hidden treasure.

Il Buono Il Brutto Il Cattivo is explicitly known for its flamboyant Ennio Morricone score. Its title song became a part of American popular culture. One of the ten best film scores by Ennio Morricone. What makes Morricone my favorite film composer is his ability to create music that is eccentric and grandeur. This film definitely has a big love for music which shows in the partnership of Ennio Morricone and Sergio Leone. Like in other Italian Westerns, each main person has his own theme song.

Violent nature and sadistic behaviors contrasts it with romantic portrayal of American Frontier in Classic American Westerns. I think of it as a Western Noir because of the involvement of greed. Also, main characters are not clear cut good or bad guys but people with both characterizations. Humor is around the viciousness of story especially in the hanging sequences. The moment when Blondie shoots Tuco off the rope and hats off everyone else's head is the funniest sequence. Mario Brega is imposingly memorable as the sadistic henceman of Angel Eyes, Corporal Wallace.

A dangerous moment was the blowing up of the bridge which is brilliantly set up with some excellent editing moments. Trip around the cemetery in search of hidden treasure contains fast paced editing, relentless cinematography, and tight framing. Sam Peckinpah was inspired by bridge explosion moment for his own bridge explosion scene in The Wild Bunch(1969). Cinemtography is flawless especially in composition, movement, and scenery. My favorite line is from Tuco who tells a bounty hunter he kills from a tub, ""When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk."" Both Mario Bava and Sergio Leone had a love for the European arts, music, and painting.

Highlight is three way duel between Blondie, Angel Eyes, and Tuco. Morricone composed a fabulous score which builds and builds until tension is big enough to explode. Excellent set up, crisp editing, and beautiful camera work makes scene an instant classic. Never lets down in sustaining a suspenseful mood. Coolest and most imaginative duel in a Sergio Leone western. One of many great moments from Il Buono Il Brutto Il Cattivo/The Good The Bad & The Ugly(1966) which makes it unforgettable.",

Minnesota Clay 1964

Ringo and His Golden Piston / aka Johnny Oro 1965

The Specialist 1968

The ""Comedy Spaghettis"" with the Terence Hill/Bud Spencer, known as the ""Trinity"" films (Whether you find these Hill/Spencer westerns funny or not is a matter of taste. The Italians love them, I personally prefer the first three more serious Westerns they made in the 60's to the Trinity films. I have already mentioned Ace High which also stars Eli Wallach, above. Actually, it was part of a non-comedy trilogy with the Hill/Spencer team. Boot Hill and God Forgives, I Don't are the other two.)

God Forgives, I Don't 1968

Boot Hill 1969

They Call Me Trinity 1971

Trinity is Still My Name 1971

------------------------------------------

*Well that's it for the ""top 50"". Actually, I'm not so sure about 26-50, but 1-25 are must see and rock-solid. If you can't get enough of this type of movie, rather than wasting your time with the mostly substandard 400 to 500 hundred remaining Eurowesterns (the vast majority of which stink to high heaven), I would recommend trying the Clint Eastwood films Hang 'Em High (1968), Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970), Joe Kidd (1972), High Plains Drifter (1973), Outlaw Jose Wales (1976), Pale Rider (1985) and Unforgiven (1992). Obviously, they aren't spaghetti westerns, but the Leone kinship is obvious. Think of them as the Leone/Eastwood films they never got around to making together.

Also, the films of Sam Peckinpah, especially, The Wild Bunch (1969), The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970) and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1972), which were also key films in the ""deconstruction"" of the Western. Oh, McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971) by Robert Altman is another key film.

P.S. By all means, avoid Spanish ""Paella"" Westerns, which are even worse than the very worst Italian made ones. Especially A Town Called Hell (1971) by Eugenio Martin, it is absolutely lousy despite the stellar cast.

P.P.S. Contrary to what some people may try to tell you, there are no Late Spaghetti Classics (after 1973). No, Keoma, Four of the Apocalypse and China 9, Liberty 37 are not lost classics, they are pretentious, preposterous failures, deservedly (and mercifully) forgotten. The two post '73 spaghettis I did mention were only due to the involvement of Leone and Corbucci, I wasn't endorsing those films necessarily.",10

At first I was mad that the movie was 3 hours long but, it payed off. At the end you're literally at the edge of your seat. Truly a classic. Calling it overrated doesn't mean anything really.

11 December 2015,"Not the First Great Western or the Last, but Certainly the Greatest of Them","There is a reason that this movie has inspired so many parodies over the years. There is a reason it is the first thing that comes to people's minds when they think of Westerns. There a reason that its theme is instantly recognizable.

It is the best Western movie ever made, plain and simple.

Every angle is perfect. Every line contributes something. Every event both captures your imagination and sets up what is to come. It does not involve me as much as Skyfall does, but it is just so inhumanly great without sacrificing its very human grit and style. Even people who are not film critics or analysts of any kind or even frequenters of high art can look at this movie and say, ""That's a really good film."" Of course, this movie is not watched by as many people as it should be. I'm willing to bet that for every twenty people who have heard of this film, maybe one or two have actually seen it. Again, I get it. If you're not a major film buff or film buff wannabe or die-hard lover of Westerns, it is hard to convince yourself to take a full three hours out of your busy schedule to watch a slower paced film that was made fifty years ago. But if you ever have a chance, check it out.

There is everything to be said about this movie. About how it subverted many traditional western tropes while laying the groundwork for far more. About how it catapulted Clint Eastwood into stardom, stardom that he has fostered and still basks in fifty years later. About how it took what worked in the first two Sergio Leone Westerns and made some additions of its own. And so much else that I could likely think of if only I rewatched it. From what I remember, it is so dense despite being so sprawling.

There is also nothing to be said about this movie. It is like the American West itself (ignore for a moment the fact that this film was shot in Spain by a team of Italians). I've been fortunate enough to explore the West myself, and let me tell you, no words can capture the open freedom that you feel out there. This movie is something similar. Just like any journey, everyone will have a separate experience. But like any journey to a beautiful place, it will be worth it.

There is something about the movie that makes you wish, at least for a second, that you could be in that world. Not the Old West, though that would be interesting. No, I'm talking about this film's version of the Old West. There is pain and danger and adventure and action and risk; but also those long pauses that allows everything to sink in. Combine that with the fact that they are going off of a real place, and you can both see yourself there and legitimately want to go.

The main, is, of course, played by Clint Eastwood. He is subdued but fierce and sly. Whether or not you consider the 'Dollars Films' a trilogy- I don't- there is no doubt that his character here could easily be the same man from the other movies. This doesn't mean he hasn't changed; he is more visibly weary here, something that both helps this film stand out from and tie together to the other two films.

But of course, he is only 'The Good.' The other two, Lee Van Cleef's 'Angel Eyes' and Eli Wallach's Tuco... Ramirez, make up 'The Bad' and 'The Ugly,' respectively. The three of them are searching for some hidden Confederate gold, and yes, it is an epic quest that takes them across the West. This is one of those movies where it's less about what sets the story in motion and more what it does when it's there. So much happens. It builds up and up, so high up that if the climax isn't spectacular, you would be disappointed and let down.

But of course, that's fantastic as well. I'm not going to spoil what happens (though I don't think I'd be hurting anyone if I did; this film came out over fifty years ago) but I will say that you are in for a treat. On the surface, it's simple, if cleaver and well-written and smart. But the way they shoot it and direct it and score it and act it gives it so much depth and atmosphere. Ennio Morricone has composed many, many great pieces in this film alone, a few of which even people who have never seen this movie would recognize, so often are they repeated and parodied. But for my fist full of dollars (couldn't resist), none tops the piece that plays hear, simply called 'The Trio.' This scene is famous for what people who went to film school might call 'super tight shots.' The camera zooms in right on the character's eyes. This, like any artistic technique, can be used masterfully or horribly, depending on the production (check out the Dutch angles on Battlefield Earth; I shudder every time I see clips of it.) For this film, of course, it is the former. It is the crowning cherry on the top of three hours of conscious, radiant camera-work.

In fact, now that I think about it, this scene perfectly captures the essence of the movie. The drama, the emotion, the art, the pure statement of excellence: it's all there. Catch the clip and see what the film's about. Just don't forget to watch the rest of the flick too.",10
25 June 2023,Enjoyable but not one of the best movies of all time for sure,"Usually when I decide to watch old films is a hit or miss regardless of their high ratings. Some old films like Harakiri stand the test of time and are brilliant to this day, others like Apocalypse Now are super borefests. Funnily enough, the god the bad and the ugly is neither. It is a rather enjoyable movie that starts strong and introduces the three main characters nicely. The pace is fine although I find some of the subplots a bit unnecessary making the movie too long. Clint Eastwood is born for this role but the other two are also interesting characters in their own ways. All in all, it is a rather enjoyable movie to kill some time but it definitely doesn't belong in the top 250 movies even accounting for its legacy.

19 March 2012,Excellent Eastwood Film!,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

20 April 2021,By 1966 the ugly used to be shot in b&w; and {wow} so were the good,"1966 was a watershed year in terms of the cinematic chromatic process: it was the last year in which most productions were in black and white. Since 1967, color has practically covered all of the screens. Perhaps symptomatically, on my personal list of best films of the year only one was made in Technicolor. It was not the Leone spaghetti-western, it was Fred Zinnemann's Man for all seasons. TV was also b&w, and '66 was the year of the last of the 271 episodes in the fine series Perry Mason , started in '57.

26 June 2005,"You see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend:","Those who loved Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo and those who haven't seen it yet. I loved it...

I believe I'm quite a movie fan and I've always been told it was a shame I didn't see this movie. It's only when I saw it a year ago that I understood why. The broadcast was poor, it was late, dubbed and cut several times by commercials (in France, this is hopefully seldom) but oh my God did I enjoy the film.

Everything in this movie is exciting. As soon as the opening credits begin, you know you're gonna watch a great flick; the acting is marvelous to me: Clint Eastwood represents exactly the cow-boy you always picture in your head when you're a kid but that's precisely because this character has set a landmark in the movie-making history. Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef are just as good.

The script is quite different from other westerns too: it's not just about revenge or save a city from bad guys, the story leans over deeper human feelings: greed, friendship, national pride. The characters are far more intricate than in other westerns I've seen, you never know what really motivates them and, which is to me the best: the Good guy isn't always good, the Bad guy isn't as bad as you could imagine, and the Ugly guy might be the most attaching gangster I've known. The dialogs will always be remembered: in this movie, the three guys shoot more with words than with guns and you cannot believe the amount of lines about which you will think ""Gosh, I wish I could tell one of these.""

The movie might seem a little long but to me, it was worth traveling through the Wild West in the middle of the Civil War considering the last but one scene. The final shooting is so intense, the stake is so high and most of all, for the first time since the beginning of the movie you can really listen to (and not just hear) the incredible score by Ennio Morricone. Besides, I recognized the music from the Kill Bill 2 trailer but it took me a long time to recollect where I heard it before. Anyway, the last half hour of movie is magic and I could watch it in any language, in any conditions and still enjoy it.

If you've not seen this movie yet, watch it as soon as possible, I promise you will love it (or at least you could shine on every one on ""how much you didn't like Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo""). As far as I am concerned, I still wonder how I could live without it.",10

26 February 2009,I'd take fast food over a steak any day.,"In the sad little world of critical reviews, both professional and written by jobless house-husbands, the words ""MASTERPIECE"" and ""CLASSIC"" are always used to mask any disappointments a film may have. When you go to a fine restaurant and spend half your paycheck on a piece of meat, you unconsciously force yourself into denial that that piece of meat is the best you've ever eaten. Even if you would have been more content with McDonald's. Why? Because you just spent half your paycheck on it, and some French guy somewhere says it's fine meat, thus you have to agree. You HAVE to. You're unwilling to admit your disappointment. You tell yourself that your taste buds just aren't evolved enough, even though that is just stupid. It works the same way with movies. Once you've seen 500 pages of perfect reviews, read that the film received 100% rating from professional critics, admitting to yourself that you weren't content with the film isn't easy. It's even harder to admit it to other people. It's nearly impossible to write a review stating it. This opening paragraph can apply to thousands of movies. But this is how I felt about The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. It wasn't bad, but it lacked the full contentment I expected.

Emphasis on story/plot has died out over the years. In 2009, top critics put only slightly more emphasis on it as they put on the color of the main character's shirt. Perhaps this is why we see movies, forget about them, go see another one just like the last one, forget about it: repeat the same hollow cycle until we die. Aristotle put story at the center of all fictional work; modern critics put cinematography and acting at the center. Whether you side with an ancient dead guy or bitter middle-aged men devoid of sex lives, it's hard to deny that the latter mindset just leads to pretty moving pictures and eventually is completely forgettable. That is the main flaw I had with The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.

While this film has purely awesome moving pictures (more on that later), the plot is weak. In fact, it's so weak and so predictable that I found that I could quickly care less about anything happening. For the film's credit, I will say that the predictable linier plot did have some quirky variation, and added scenes that you wouldn't normally expect in a Western. However, the fact that the driving force of this epic film is nothing but a cliché treasure hunt is the reason I found it so lacking. Couldn't the writers have been a little more creative? If they had been, this would have been an absolute perfect film. If they had been, there would be nothing for me to criticize. Even those who already find this a perfect film, can you really deny that a little more creativity would have made it even more perfect? Furthermore, the Civil War scenes pumped an even more annoying vibe into The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly because they were just copy/pasted from generic war films. They added nothing but another layer of seen-this-thousand-times to a generic plot that was already getting annoying because I've seen it a thousand times. And none of this criticism is from a modern standpoint. Everything I just criticized was unoriginal in its time.

What was good was the ugly. You've read this part in hundreds of other reviews, so I'm not going to take much time here. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly perfected true grit like never before. That's where the credit lies. From rugged faces to rugged deserts to rugged clothing to rugged buildings to rugged camera style, nothing was left of the sanitized world we live in. Some people criticize the realism of this and the realism of other aspects of the film, to which I say: I just don't care. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly can be taken as a mature fantasy set in a overdone western worldwhat's wrong with that? People also criticize the film by saying it's not as good as its prequels, which is a matter of taste. However, it isn't a matter of taste that the prequels didn't even come close to the epic scope or raw grit of this film. They didn't have the brutal nihilism of the characters. They were more polished, with tight conventional plotting and less overt backdrops.

Another incorrect criticism of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is that it is nothing but a macho, quirky, masculinity-fest with no bearing on the realistic world. Those people make me laugh. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly pretty much singlehandedly brought the nameless antihero into cinema. While this character really gets annoying in modern films, he works here because he was one of the first, as well as one of the best. While I will agree that he has little bearing on real life, it's the secondary characters that break the cliché. The title of the film as well as the film itself both illustrate the opposite that the typical period western would illustrate: the world is not black-and-white. Good doesn't always win. People can stand on both sides of the moral line. Good guys can do immoral things. It's here that the true underline genius comes out, because this is something even modern filmmakers don't understand.

Overall, there is nothing I can say to shake people from the belief that The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is the best film ever made. Be it due to nostalgia, or be it due to a level of depth I missed, I can't change that. I'm not trying to. But I just want to say that The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is typical in some aspects. In others, it's legend. I just refuse to give it a perfect score because it's a supposed ""CLASSIC"".

17 May 2015,acquaintance with western,"I was born after 90-s and this film make me familiar with the genre ""western"". I want to say, there was one of the best three hours in my life, the atmosphere of that ancient times transmitted as good as it possible. You just forget about the present and dive into west with it bewitching characters, revolvers and gold hunting. Not the first time I notice, that films of 60..70-s are much better transmit the picture for viewer, directors of that time exactly knew what to show. Tongue does not turn to call the special effects ""pure"" or ""funny"", cos they seems more real in this picture, than all modern effect together. The great soundtrack was the thing, because of which goose appears on my hands and the room fill with heroes's tension and resoluteness. So, I was very pleased, watching this film and soon will continue getting familiar with this genre and creations of great Sergio Leone.

11 April 2014,The rebirth of the Western,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly produced in Italy and Spain in 1966, is to western fans and cinephiles, as Harry styles is to teenage girls; as soon as we hear one note of the sensational score and catch one glimpse of our heroes squint of an eye. Instantly our pulses quicken, heart races and we must try our hardest to suppress a squeal of joy.

Following on from two film predecessors; A Fist full of Dollars and For a few Dollars more, in a inherently Sergio Leon way, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly opens up with a series of intercutting close ups of sun beaten faces looking out towards the horizon, and wide shot of the setting, which appears to be an old rundown little town. But just as you would expect from the spaghetti western master, we are given very little information from the start. We don't know who these men are at first or what their intentions are, but from the looks of them, they don't seem all that two friendly. But what the opening shots do reveal, in particular Leon predilection for wide and close up paring, is that Leon was avid art collector; the close ups where reminiscent of Goya, while the vast unyielding landscapes where an allusion to surrealist painting style Leon was a fan off.

As the men make their way down into what appears to be a salon, we don't follow them in instead we hear a shoot out occurring, then all of a sudden the camera pans to focus on a window in which 'The Ugly' leaps out with wine in one hand and a half eaten pigs leg in the other, this is Tuco (Eli Wallach), and those two items some him up best, he is a bear drinking, untrustworthy swine. But on the other hand he does phenomenally inject a whole lot of humour and wild edge to the film. Next we find ourselves with a little boy riding a donkey; he looks to the distance where he sees a lone man riding a horse towards him, we then passes him with little regard. Little does that boy know that man will go on to mercilessly shoot and kill both his brother and father, for that man is 'The Bad' also known as Angel eyes (Lee Van Cleef from John Ford's High-noon). Then last but not least, we return again to The Ugly we find himself in a tricky situation, involving three gun slingers. But cue the introduction of the man with no name (Technically he does have a name, its Blondie in the film and Clint Eastwood in real life) who saves Tuco only to return him to a nearby town to cash in on his bounty, justifying his title 'The Good' . But not everything is what it seems, it soon turns out the both men are in collusion and turning Tuco in is merely a trick to get the bounty, save Tuco from getting hanged and then gets the heck out of there. The plan is so genius that they could continue getting away with the same trick, oh wait they completely hate each other and can trust each other as far as they can throw. The relationship between the leads make for a great stand up duo; Tuco the loud mouth and Blondie the silent brooding one, similar to famous magicians Pen and Teller. Eventually for the rest of the film The Good, The Bad and The Ugly must unite in search for $200,000 loot stashed inside a person's grave, but only The Ugly knows where the grave site is, while The Good only knows which name it is buried under, but of course they can't trust each other with that information.

While other western director like to cut to the chase and draw out the scenes violence such as Howard Hawks and Sam Penkinpah, instead on the other hand , something I particularly love most about Leon is how he always extends all precursors before a shot out or a act of violence which eventually end rather quickly . It's better that why, because we invest ourselves deeper into the characters, whilst also allowing the tension in the scene to build up to almost excruciating levels even before the first bullet is fire.

What I also love about The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, is the moral ambiguity that runs thick throughout the film, never are the lines between good and bad really competently drawn through. I guess that it down to the decision to keep back stories and exposition rather low. But what it does offer you is the freedom to choose what side you cheer for because there isn't any real distinct good guy in the film, which makes it all the more exciting.

At a lengthy 2hrs and 50 minutes, GBU is almost David Lean and Lawrence Arabia-esk in terms if scope and grandeur, and you can also drew comparisons between the two films in the deployment of the incessant use of panoramic shoots of the vast scenery and man insignificant compared to it. As long as GBU is, not once to I find the film meandering or tedious, despite its length it was able to move a furious pace, so it felt that we the audience were ourselves almost sucked into the action by an almighty whirl wind. But in a largely dead genre, we can look back to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly with great nostalgia and affection, for it a shinnying beckon of what great film making is.",10
15 October 2021,The Soundtrack,"The soundtrack to this masterpiece is the fourth main character. It's so awesome! If you watch this and don't find yourself saying ""Ah-eh-ah-eh-ahhhh.....Wah-wag-wahhhhh!"" , then you have no soul.

22 February 2019,Masterpiece,"There are movies like The Shawshank Redemption that are absolutely spectacular and true pieces of cinema art... and then there's 'The Good The bad and The ugly'. This is one of the Most important and influential movies in history, this is what directors should watch for inspiration when they are trying to make a 'great' movie. People Cannot call themselves 'Movie buffs' until they have watched 'The good the bad and the ugly'. Clint Eastwood plays his role as 'The man with no name' Elegantly, keeping the mysterious tone the character had in the previous films whilst still showing different emotions as the movie progresses, this is one of Clint Eastwoods' finest roles. Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach also played their roles tremendously with each of them displaying their characters emotions and motives clearly and beautifly. The movie has some of the most suspenseful and engaging action sequences in movie history and I was left at the edge of my seat at the end of most of them, as for the final showdown; let's just say it's one of the greatest scenes in Cinema history. The movie also has a brilliantly written script and some of the finest cinematography ever, this makes the already engaging and action packed story even better. The good The bad and The ugly ticks all the boxes when it comes to doing things right, directors from today need to remember how geniuses like Sergio Leone crafted pieces of art like the good the bad and the ugly, with an fantastic story, brilliant actors, incredible script, suspenseful action scenes, beautiful cinematography and one of the finest soundtrack of all time, not only is 'the good the bad and the ugly' the greatest western of all time... It's the the greatest movie ever made.",10
13 August 2019,Clint Beastwood,"This is a great, classic western. Sergio Leone is an expert, and every shot is thought-out and well executed. The characters are compelling, the setting is immersive. Clint Eastwood and his costars give great performances. Funny, action-packed, dripping with style. One of the finest movies I've ever seen.

8 August 2001,Best Western ever,"The third, and best, part of Sergio Leone´s spaghetti Western series is set during the American Civil War and circles around three scoundrels who are after a cache of gold hidden in a graveyard far, far away. We have the extremely skilled revolver man The Good (Clint Eastwood), the ice-cold bounty hunter The Bad (Lee Van Cleef) and the noisy and talkative thief The Ugly (Eli Wallach). In their search they sometimes have to help each other, but just as often they try to kill each other, in pursue of the gold.

Sergio Leone´s successful trilogy is certainly one of a kind. ""Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" and its precursors ""A fistful of dollars"" and ""For a few dollars more"" are all top class, but this is the best one. It includes several funny and smart lines, and many memorable scenes. The cast that portrays the trio of gold searchers are all perfect. One of the best actors ever, Clint Eastwood, makes his best performance ever, it actually tops the one he made in Dirty Harry. Eastwood is well fit as the lone gunman who doesn´t talk unless it is really necessary. Lee Van Cleef is just as cool as the bad guy and Eli Wallach is funny and likeable. Great performances by all three.

The only minus is probably the length, especially the part when Eastwood and Wallach help a dying officer to blow up a bridge towards the end. This could easily have been ditched since it makes the movie unnecessary long and doesn´t move the plot forward. But all the other essential bits are topnotch.

The best western ever, it´s funny and exciting at the same time. Many twists and the score by Ennio Morricone is definitely one of the best ever written. The final scene is a real thriller and gives me goose bumps every time I see it. Everyone should see this. It´s an important piece of movie history.

5 April 2020,Definitely the best work in Western films,"The three-hour plot is not procrastinating, and dripping freely. The characters are full-bodied and have distinct characters. Definitely the best work in Western films. Incorporating the elements of the Civil War enhances the film's conception, increases the depth of thought, and yet is filled with a local relaxed and humorous atmosphere.

25 June 2002,Simply good but turning bad later.,"I enjoying western movie quite much but turn my way back after at last minute where the civil war broke out between two groups of people. Why is that western movie has to obtain this materials for the movie. This movie has been nominated quite high maybe for the actor and for the action itself.

Also, the best about this one is the first ten minutes which is almost silent and it creates a highly tension between the audience and the characters. Pretty good if you seen this on DVD like i do but in the cinema? people can't fart... and if they do, everybody will definitely hear that.

30 April 2013,The Western that all others are judged by,"Sergio Leone's story of three loners, loyal only to their quest for $200,000 in gold, set a new gold standard for the ""western"" genre. The famous score, trend setting direction and memorable amoral characters combine for a film touted as one of the greatest of all time. Yet, this Italian creation is plagued by horrible dubbing. making it hard to believe the film is set in Confederate country in the Civil War. No matter, as the other characters only serve to move the plot forward but do challenge your patience again and again in this long drama. Clint Eastwood cool and Eli Wallach shananigans carry the drama, while Lee Van Cleef adds a villain to root against. The final scene is enough to earn high praise.

14 January 2022,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly","Tuco: ""When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk""

First released in Rome (12-66), home of its director (Leone), its USA premiere coming a year later (12.29.67) to complete the PEA-UA trifecta which began with A-Fistful-of-Dollars (Jan-67), then A-Few-Dollars-More (May), serving a full plate of the new spaghetti Western to audiences worldwide who feasted, turning the leads of its third and best entry into international celebrities. The year 1939 is tabbed best in film and it's hard to dispute with makes like Gone-With-the-Wind, The-Wizard-of-Oz, The-Women, Goodbye-Mr-Chips, Stagecoach and The-Hunchback-of-Notre-Dame. Then there's 1967, no runner-up as it produced more game-changers than any other: Guess-Whos-Coming-To-Dinner, In-the-Heat-of-the-Night, Bonnie-and-Clyde, The-Graduate, To-Sir-With-Love, Cool-Hand-Luke and The-Good, a Western like no other, featuring an anti-hero that made the rest look like boy scouts. Filmed in Italy and Spain, terrain which compares to the southwest US, and scripted by a team of writers (Incrocci Leone Scarpelli Vincenzoni Donati Knox), Good had the biggest Produzioni budget and it shows.

Set during the Western phase of the Civil War, it follows 2 non-combatants, Blondie the good (Clint) and Tuco the ugly (Eli) who partner in scam of criminal justice, then have a falling out, only to tenuously re-team in necessity when each is given partial clue to locating a buried CSA gold shipment, swag also being sought by a well-informed, third gunslinger, the ""tidy"" bandito known as Angel Eyes (Lee). Shaky alliances form and fade, encountering family (Tuco's priestly brother) (Pistilli) and fighting along the way (war weary Union Captain) (Giuffrè), culminating in a triangulated, graveyard showdown with only spirits of the dead in attendance to beckon new members. Most noteworthy for its performances in lead, signature English dubbing, epic length (177m), Morricone's singular score (Ah-eh-a-eh-aaaaa, waaah WAAAA waaah), advanced sound effects (Pacella DeSisti) and a persistent brutality, mitigated by a Tuco-Blondie entente that emerges late. The trouble today is too MUCH epic. Adding back edits merely to boost DVD sales or turn a classic into a new movie so fiddlers can make it into the credits, is becoming a real problem (See; director's cut). In what is known as the American Edition, 15 minutes in three needless scenes were inserted: Tuco at his hideout talking to a dead chicken, lead-up to the monestary and Angel Eyes visits a CSA camp to pump a wine-dribbling rebel. More is not always better. The presumption should be to protect earlier edits, whatever their motive, be it choisis or finance. They are the movie.

The best Civil War treatment to date, Dances-With-Wolves the best opener (""Get down Lieutenant, these guys are shooters!""), by an Italian in Spain, no less. The Good is that rarity where a series finale, typically the weakest (T3 Alien-3), is instead best of the bunch, a film fantasy where bad guys aren't all bad, good guys have demons and YOU decide the moral. Is Good the best western ever made? After writing this review, I might say, yes, until I see Shane or Red River or Lonesome-Dove or The-Big-Country or Little-Big-Man or The-Searchers or Winchester-73 or The-Last-Picture-Show or, you get the idea. In a crowded field, it's certainly the most unique (4/4).",10
10 May 2003,10+/10,"Gritty, beautiful, tactile, brilliant, scenic, entertaining, funny, serious, touching, artful, clever, ... ad infinitum.

Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleaves, and Eli Wallach as ""Blondie,"" ""Angel Eyes,"" and ""Tuco,"" (the good, the bad, and the ugly) make this movie simply amazing. My personal favorite is Eli Wallach. His acting as the loud mouth crude ""Tuco"" is excellent. Lee Van Cleaves as ""Angel Eyes"" was made for this part - his eyes fill the screen. Clint Eastwood - the ultimate classic hero.

7 May 2021,Where have you gone Hopalong Cassady?,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

5 December 2017,An Epic Masterpiece of Tremendous Proportions.,"Sergio Leone is a genius at directing this movie and employed innovative usage of extreme close- ups, unusual camera angles, extended sequences and amazing action that changed how films were made after that. What keeps us coming back to this movie time and time again is the wry humor and the MUSIC!! Along with Jaws, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly elevates itself to the level of the greatest motion picture score of all time. It has become a cliché now when the opening whistle melody embodies the Western shootout in movies, TV, commercials, you name it. Keep in mind, before this, the western ideal for music was always the large orchestral scores with sweeping melodies ala Copland, Korngold, Moross, Elmer Bernstein, etc. Ennio Morricone used electric guitars, whistling and hyena howls!! Talk about innovative!! The Ecstasy of Gold sequence is a cinematic clinic on how to unite editing with music.

27 August 2021,It is THE western film from some time ago,"The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly directed by Sergio Leone is often regarded as one of the best films ever made, well a lot of films that serve a great inspiration to movies of the same genre past it, are often labeled under that category. However, whether you have seen this picture or not, you have most likely heard its theme song in the past, even if you are not necessarily into movies. The main narrative, revolves around three men, on the search for Bill Carson $200,000 worth of gold buried in Sad Hill Cemetery with each one, wanting all of the prize to themselves, or so it seems. Before the release of this film, Sergio was known for his work on silence motion pictures, which explains the lack of dullness and exposition present in this movie. Instead Sergio is more known as a director that prefers situation over story lines, the characters find out about their problems around the same time, that the audiences do which makes it feel like you are also part of the situation. The cinematography of this picture, also compliments this point, as what ever is not included in the frame of the shot, not only can't the audiences see it, but the characters within the frame will not be able to see anyone that lays outside it. This is a great technique to subvert the audiences expectations of the given moment, when the viewers see a character surrounded by an obstacle that just so happens to seem unescapable, they may never know for sure, if the character time is up until its really over for them, as their help could easily be a couple inches away from the frame of the camera. The same thing goes for when the characters appear to be in a favourable and safe position, the danger could just be a few feet away, which also subverts our expectations, as if the characters feel like they are in control, it will make the viewers go under a false sense of security, therefore if the danger does approach, it tricks both the audience and the people within the frame.

Sergio Leone, years of silence film making, comes into play when it comes to constructing suspense prior to the hits of an action sequence. He does this by lingering around the same pattern of switching shots between the character's faces, and cutting back to the previous character several times, when ever an important battle is about to go down. This is a great way of showing the evolution of a person's thought process, during the heat of the moment, as the character's plot their strike. He is also great at visual foreshadowing, for instances, when the first character to make a move, is about to strike, during that specific character thought process evolution, he would have multiple shots cut to that person's weapon, which shows the person that is going to deliver the first blow. However, what separates the tension developing process in this film, over other movies is the score by Ennio Morricone, without his theme, it wouldn't sell the importance of a situation as much as he did. Every time it plays, it comes off as like a ticking time bomb, where if one of the characters don't take the proper steps fast enough, they wouldn't come out alive.

In conclusion this film is one of the best movies ever made, there are never any moments that feel dull or to drag the runtime, each scene has a reason for being there. However a nitpick that I would have with this film,(A small thing) is that sometimes there are moments that come off as way too convenient, like when two characters split up without plaining to meet each other at a certain time, somehow find each other again in a matter of minutes without supposing to. Also there was a scene where, just before a character is about to be finished, get saved by a cannonball from out of no where, that just so happens to land into the exact house that this person is in. Overall through, this film is a masterpiece, it feels much less than 2 hours and 58, there are so many intense moments from start to finish, with some of the best cinematography of all time considering the time it was made. This film is a gift to cinema, and has accomplished many aspects of film making and beyond, that no other western film can replicate to this day.",
24 September 2003,Terrific western!,"Are you looking for a suspenseful, epic and exciting adventure? If so, ""Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo"" is the movie for you! Starring Clint Eastwood as the Good, Lee Van Cleef as the Bad and Eli Wallach as the Ugly, three fast gunnin' cowboys on the trail of two hundred thousand dollars, hidden in a grave somewhere.

The Good is a quiet but obviously deadly blond, the Bad is a sinister and corrupt Civil War Officer, and the Ugly is an ungrateful and greedy Spaniard. Together they make one of the most interesting movie trios. There's Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli from ""The Two Towers"", and there's Han, Luke and Chewie from ""Star Wars"", but none beet this unlawful bunch.

I think one of the reasons for this being IMDb's number one western is the authentic background music. Growing up I heard it many times in different parodies, but I never had a clue where it came from. That's why I smiled when I started ""Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo"". The opening credits blast out this great music like there's no tomorrow, and I loved it.

One last thing I feel I must address: my favorite scene. Around the middle, the Good and the Ugly walk through a broken down ghost town as the Bad's thugs shoot at them. This is one of the best filmed shootouts I've ever scene. The partnership of Good and Ugly and their protecting each other was both entertaining and exciting to watch.

""Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo"" = Great Western Fun, 8.5/10.",9
14 October 2019,The Best Movie on Youtube,"The good , the Bad and The Ugly is worth watching. If you are desperately looking for a movie , and you don't happen to have Netflix , this is the best that you could get for free. If you'd find a reason not to watch this as you'd find old movies boring , well , this is also your movie. The cinematography is very modern featuring close-up shots (this was not a trend at that time).The very familiar theme song is undeniably good , unlike the orchestras that ruined most old movies.

Those who despise violence should beware , but apart from it , this is a great watch for most ages.

21 February 2023,A classic (American) cultural masterpiece by a non-English speaking (!) Director,"My personal definition of a classic piece of art is one that you come back to multiple times and unlike the majority of films, songs, albums, it becomes more enjoyable each time rather than less.

The actors, especially the big three were amazing, Tuco stole the show for me.

The music elevated the movie even more.

The callbacks were great (two types of people ..., the noose).

I still have to figure out how the intended meaning behind the title and character descriptions the ""good bad and ugly"", as clearly the ""good"" defintely had some ""bad"" behavior as well :), perhaps that is the point, this movie supersedes the usual shallow character archetypes of good and evil (think about Voldemort and Sauron), both good and evil lies the behavior, which is mutable.

Sergio Leone created a cultural iconic (espeically American) masterpiece; the fact the man did so despite the fact he did not speak English to the extent that he required a translator to communicate with his actors is astonishing.",9
6 July 2000,"""Blondie, Do You Know What You are? Your a dirty Son Of A......""","Any truly successful film should convincingly create it's own world, and, from the very beginning, draw the viewer into that world. It should be a world with it's own point of view. It's own morality and rules. It should then stick by those rules and force the audience to see the world through the eyes of it's director. Sergio Leone's ""The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly"" fits all of those qualifications as well as any movie I have ever seen. Ennio Morricione's score, coupled with leone's melodramatic, exaggerated, off-beat visual style create a world like no other. This movie has got to have one of the best endings i've ever seen for a western or an action picture. it's got to be seen to be comprehended. It's the best payoff imaginable after nearly three hours of build up. Is this film over-the-top? Hell Yes. Is it realistic? Of course not. Is it a great film? Your damn right it is.

2 November 2022,Nostalgic from the First Watch,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

21 July 2005,The best western ever made,"As you all know The good the bad and the ugly is the best western ever made not just because of the good plot, the good acting but also the scenery of Sergio Leone because he took time and entered civil war scenes in the movie that makes it interesting and it shows how the battle took place and how hard the man fought for there country at the time. The acting in this movie is very good for a movie of the 60's and the script is brilliant and i'm glade that Sergio Leone chosed Clint to be the man with no name.

Anyone who like western movie and you never seen this one i suggest you go see it now and does who doesn't like western movie well this one is still worth watching so go rent it.

22 June 2004,WoW !!,"What can one say about a masterpiece ?? PERFECTION!!! This movie is perfect. You have landscapes and locations that are amazing by themselves. There's the score by Ennio Morricone which has the spirit of the West all over it. There's the acting core of Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef. And there's Sergio. Out of all the Sergio Leone films that I've seen, this is the most complete (even more complete since I've seen the remastered DVD). It has a story that is more than revenge and has subtle humanistic and political messages (POW camp, references to Andersonville prison, the meaningless bridge war, the missionary hospital, the dying confederate soldier,etc). Of course the most refined was Fistful of Dynamite (a.k.a - Duck, You Sucker), but it didn't have Eastwood and has a different ""feel"" from the first three. Also in that same light as Once Upon in America (also politically charged and Eastwood-less). It is safely the most refined of the Eastwood-Leone trilogy. It has a protagonist that is not the classical hero type. He is more of an anti-hero. You have the villain that is ruthless beyond measure and in between there's the dangerous comic relief brute. This is a must see film for anyone that likes movies. The best scene is the duel scene at the end with all 3 of our protagonists dueling each other in a Mexican standoff/chess game.",10

6 September 2003,The Italian Gourmet.,"God bless Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone, since these two put a face and sound on immortal characters that are so alive with us for the forty odd years. Clint Eastwood made these movies for a pittance and I saw his movie ""unforgiven"", I think he acts better when he is paid a pittance!. Eli Wallah, an incredible actor and the best of the lot. If cheek bones were any indication of meanness Lee Van Cleef,probably the meanest looking character ever. The haunting, resonating music of the master Ennio Morricone that hugs the landscape and made this movie a Classic. When you are fed up with oil dripping fast food like ""Beutiful Mind"". ""Lord of the Rings"", this is an Italian gourmet. The ace is Sergio leon a Lawyer turned Film Maker and marvellous at it. Eli Wallah, from Spagetti Western's to ""God Father"", one versatile actor. There will never be a trilogy like-GOOD the Bad and the Ugly.

13 November 1999,Sergio Leone Gives Us Another Classic Spaghetti Western!,"Sergio Leone directs this spaghetti western with his usual talent and flair. It really showcases the acting talents of Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef as three me of dubious character, trying to find a buried treasure chest. Each man knows a small piece off the puzzle as to where the money is hidden which ultimately leads to someone getting hurt. A great story of greed and what it can eventually lead to. There is some debate as to whether this film comes up to Once Upon A Time In The West. Let's just say if you enjoyed one, you will certainly enjoy the other. Try to see this film on a large screen TV if at all possible. Add the great score by Ennio Morricone and you've got yourself a first class western!

11 February 2009,The Best Of The Best,"There really isn't much to say about this film.Three men,three guns, beautiful scenery, high tension, excitement...A work of art. You can almost feel you're there,trying to avoid bullets. This is Leone's final western from the trilogy, and clearly the best.Here, he showed all of his directorial techniques,the legendary close-ups,the 10-minutes-of-silence-and-tension scenes and similar. Ennio Morricone composed a truly remarkable soundtrack for this film,and,as a musician,I would say it perfectly fits in the whole story.Every character has its specific tune played with another instrument every time(Man With No Name-flute,Angel Eyes-organ,Tuco-human voice). Clint Eastwood shows us what we'll see from him in the future with his smooth talking, laconic speech, mean looks, and that ever persistent cigarillo in his mouth.Don't forget the legendary one-liners he is saying throughout the film such as- Man With No Name: You see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend: Those with loaded guns and those who dig. You dig. I laugh every time I see it. Lee Van Cleef gives his best performance here.His little,piercing eyes make him ideal for this role. Eli Wallach is also perfect as Tuco, the nosy bandit who never stops talking and has a key role in the film. Finally,I think everybody should see this film, simply because of its greatness,magnificence and cinematic significance.It defines the word ""cool""-and makes you wonder every time you see it.It holds 4th place on IMDb 250,it deserves it in every aspect,but for me,damn it,it's the best movie ever made.Seriously.",10

I've also seen High Noon, which I liked very much but it faded in my eyes when I saw The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. I liked a relationships between characters and that they always were trying to trick each other. There wasn't much dialogs, only Tuco was the chatty one (he also was my favorite character). Clint Eastwood's character was tough as always and I liked him more as Blodie than Harry Callahan because this time he was not completely a good guy. Lee Van Cleef's character was a typical bad guy, he looked very dangerous sometimes.

4 December 2006,One of the all time best Westerns,"The best movies are those movies which you can watch over again and enjoy even more than the first time. The Good The Bad The Ugly is one of these films. When I first saw it I thought it was rather slow but still memorable. The second time I watched it it didn't feel slow at all, and I found myself more impressed with it.

The movie revolves around three gunmen looking for a fortune of gold hidden in a cemetery during the Civil War. Clint Eastwood plays Blondie (The Good)a guy who though not really good, has probably the most morals of the three and a sense of honor. Eli Wallach plays Toco, (The Ugly). He is a man looking out for himself and nobody else, but I never got the sense that he was totally evil. Selfish and distrustful but not outright bad. That's probably why Toco is the most beloved of the three. He also gives the best performance in the movie. Then we have Lee Van Cleef who stars as Angel Eyes (The Bad). His character name is totally misleading because he is the most outright evil of all three.

Each of these characters knows a bit of information about the gold, and so they have to rely on each other to find the location. Of course neither one is inclined to share. So this all leads to an ending which boasts one the best showdowns in any cowboy western.

Though the story is mainly about these three characters, director Sergio Leone never lets us forget about the horrors involved with war. Even though these three men are hunting for treasure, the war surrounding them as they make their way is shown in good detail to remind us what it might have been like back in those times. It is definitely a great movie.

On top of all this, Sergio Leone is an expert with the camera. He uses close up shots of character's facial features where we see every tick and expression, but he is also able to expand out and give us panoramic views of the land surrounding these people. The opening scenes were excellent, as were so many more that followed. Great characters, great pacing, and incredible gun fights with sweeping views of the country make this western one of the best ever. And let's not forget the fantastic score which is one of the most memorable ever. Sort of a signature for the entire movie.",10
17 February 2022,"Boring, Excruciating, and Bloated","The 3 hr extended edition was excruciating. Fast forwarded and still way too slow. Ignore the trolls. This is clearly a pedestrian and mediocre (at best) film. I don't think it even warrants average rating - no character development, poor editing, bizarre civil war major battles in Southwest, thin plot, tedious scenes, and so forth. The final 30 minutes of film finally picked up pace a little, and then more filler scenes appear the destroy the nascent momentum. Do NOT recommend.

You soon find out about tons of gold and the characters are off looking, teaming up one moment, then killing each other the next.

The most interesting character was Tuco, who truly filled the role of the 'ugly.' He was a twisted man, and extremely enjoyable to walk. There's some great action and it's amazingly shot, with extreme close ups, most noticeably in the standoff in the finally, as the camera switches between the eyes of the duelers and there hands about to grab there guns. As it gets tighter and tighter and tension rises the guns go off in an extremely great scene. A last note the score is awesome.

You must see this movie. Truly amazing.",10
26 September 2021,Leone was a precursor of the comedy action movies that today are the recipe of the MCU success,"The film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is the greatest exponent of the spaghetti western and for some it could even be the best film of all time in this genre. The three-dimensionality of the characters in the film is unmatched. Fifty years before the MCU, Sergio Leone laid the foundation for epic action films that successfully amalgamate comedy in an organic way and feature antiheroes capable of connecting with the audience in a natural way, as we see him more frequently today in movies of James Gunn or Taika Waititi.

29 August 2013,Perfect in every way,"The best western ever made period! In the last and the best installment of his so-called ""Dollars"" trilogy of Sergio Leone-directed ""spaghetti westerns,"" Clint Eastwood reposed the role of a taciturn, enigmatic loner. Here he searches for a cache of stolen gold against rivals the Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless bounty hunter, and the Ugly (Eli Wallach), a Mexican bandit. Though dubbed ""the Good,"" Eastwood's character is not much better than his opponents -- he is just smarter and shoots faster. The film's title reveals its ironic attitude toward the canonized heroes of the classical western. ""The real West was the world of violence, fear, and brutal instincts,"" claimed Leone. ""In pursuit of profit there is no such thing as good and evil, generosity or deviousness; everything depends on chance, and not the best wins but the luckiest."" Immensely entertaining and beautifully shot in Techniscope by Tonino Delli Colli, the movie is a virtually definitive ""spaghetti western,"" rivaled only by Leone's own Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).

31 July 2010,A benchmark in the history of film-making,"The movie was a classic. It was one of the trend-setter in the history of film-making. It not only changed the face of Hollywood but throughout the world. It is a movie which has everything. It has action,drama,suspense and comedy. Although the movie was approximately 3 hrs long but throughout the movie there was not a single instance where one would feel that the movie is boring or is going out of the track.

The story of the movie revolves around 2 bandits Tuco(Eli Wallach) and Blondie(Clint Eastwood) who share a common hatred and want to kill each other but are forced to work together to find a hidden treasure whose secret is half-shared by both of them. While they are on their way for the gold they are being chased by a bounty hunter Angel Eyes(Lee Van Cleef) who also knows only the half secret, the part of Tuco. But the journey is not as easy as it seems to be. The mainland is not just a common mainland it is a battlefield where a war is going on and these criminals have to make their way through it.

The storyline of the movie is very good and the director has kept a good hold on the story from the very beginning of the movie. The direction is superb and the climax is quite nice and thrilling. This movie has a unique style and the background score is excellent. All the actors in the movie have done a great job. When one sees this movie he feels himself 150 years back in the land of outlaws. A really remarkable movie",9
12 October 2004,9 on a scale of 10,"Otherwise known as The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. A true classic. Easily the best western ever made as far as I'm concerned. Of course, any movie with that acclaim would have to include Clint Eastwood as the star.

This was the first full length motion picture I ever went to a movie theater to see. I remember it fondly for that reason alone. I had no way of measuring it at the time, but over the years, I have watched it from time to time and actually like it better each time.

It is explain what makes a western great. Action, obviously. Suspense, obviously. But, GBU has a great plot and it develops the relationships between the adversaries in a most enjoyable way.

Actually, I cannot think of a single thing wrong with it. Except for the fact that it is a western (not my favorite genre), I would give it a 10.",9
20 June 2011,classic movie,"this movie is only for certain

type of movie watchers.When I first sawit,it was slow so i saw only half

of it in first go and next half the other day.This movie is really worth

watching even if its a slow one.The direction of the movie is fantastic.

The film is shooted in a remote barren place you really feel the heat of the desert while watching it and imagine what these cowboys

would be feeling.It has a very good cast to make it a movie worth watching.

6 February 2014,Love it,"I absolutely loved this film when I saw it 10 years ago, this is one of those movies that you could watch time and time, over and over again without getting bored even one slight bit. the good, the bad and the ugly is my most favourite movie, Clint Eastwood's character Blondie who is the good is one of my most favourite heroes of all time and Lee van Cleef's character angel eyes who is the bad certainly without a doubt is my favourite movie villain of all time. I also loved how the scenes were set and shot in this movie especially the Mexican standoff scene one of the most iconic scenes of all time. the music is also brilliant and hugely iconic and inspiring for many generations, the opening theme is also one of the most well known movie songs of all time. overall this movie is a 10 out of 10

16 December 2014,Hypnotic and Entertaining,"While I believe Once Upon a Time in the West to be a better film overall, I still believe that The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is one of the finest westerns ever made. It's hypnotic directing and story, combined with the grittiness and operatic nature of the music compound to create an absolute treat. If that's not enough for you, the performances in the film are entrancing. Clint Eastwood as the Man With no Name is as good as it gets and Lee Van Cleef is as excellent here as he was in the previous film. Add in Tuco, a character who has some real memorable lines, and you have one heck of a movie.

Not my favorite western, but darned close!

6 May 2007,"The good, the really good and the not-so-good","If this were the only movie Leone made there wouldn't be enough praise you could lavish on it. It is amazing and fans of this genre will be thoroughly pleased. However, this is not only not Leone's best, but actually is his third best! Yes, I am aware Fistful of $ is a remake- doesn't matter, watch the movie, it's mesmerizing. You had the classic opening 10 minutes with no dialogue, the clever storyline where each character knows something the other doesn't and the climactic gunfight. One mustn't forget the wonderful Morricone score. There were some problems though that we might not want to face because we love Sergio and Clint, but let's face them just the same shall we? Brutal violence is a trademark of this genre, but here it was done over the line where it was unnecessarily vicious. It worked in Fistful because there was a sort of logic to it whereas here in scenes like the shot through the pillow and the abandoning of Tuco it came off as being just too cruel to justify. Slapping of women and leaving people to hang are tough elements, but ones that had a feel that they belonged. As for the gunfights, they were good of course, but you get the feeling that they could have been better or more convincing. Also, I must agree with those who say it's a trifle long and before you say ""Hey, you have to get the feel of the movie and you don't understand what Leone's trying to do"" remember I'm a huge fan and am merely saying that there wasn't quite enough here to fill out 3 hours worth of movie. To say this movie was awesome doesn't really do anyone any good because we all know that. What we don't seem to know judging by the fact that this is #4 on IMDb is that there are better movies out there that didn't have these kinds of problems. Leone took his concepts and gelled them into the masterpiece that followed called Once Upon a Time in the West. I dare you to watch that one and then still give GBU a 10. OUATITW does all the things exactly right that this movie almost got right and then some. Even Morricone's score gets better in that one if you can believe it.",8
25 November 1998,Overrated Western,"In the likes of Ford and Zinnemann´s masterpieces, Sergio Leoni´s film ""The Good, the bad and the ugly"" looks like a parody. It is mostly based upon violence and unjustified killings. The film tells the story of three men, who´s greed leads them to an eventual, highly predictable conclusion. During this time we get to witness children getting killed, ridiculous comments and a very overrated score, by the terribly over-estimated Ennio Marriconne.

Instead of showing something of historical relevance or moral justification Leoni made a highly overrated film, that can not be compared with ""The Searchers"", ""High Noon"" and other great westerns. A talentless movie which becomes no more than a rather mediocre, entertaining film.

31 October 2018,One Of The Most Important Films Ever Made,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

5 November 2021,Best Clint and best western ever,"A truly epic movie that encompasses some of the best direction and most iconic characters in the history of cinema. Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name hits a crescendo along with a equally epic score. Eli Wallach is the charismatic and greedy Tuco who plays off of Clint like a western Laurel and Hardy. Lee Van Cleef is the nasty and greedy character nicknamed ironically ""Angel Eyes"". All three vying for treasure buried in an abandoned cemetery while trying to outpace the armies fighting the Civil War. Awesome movie with an even better ending.

23 December 2018,The Best Western Of All Time!,"For numerous reasons this is the best western of all time and one of the most impressive cinematic masterpieces ever made. The long, uninterrupted shots are beyond legendary and the performances of the cast are considered iconic and unforgettable. Add to that the incredible soundtrack by the master himself Ennio Morricone and you have a legendary film engraved in pop culture and the inspiration for generations to come.

6 September 2018,A memorable Western with a peculiar international flair,"Sergio Leone's THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY is a classic Western film. Clint Eastwood is the Good, aka the Man with No Name, a taciturn wanderer who follows his own sense of justice. His opposite is Angel Eyes (Lee van Cleef), the Bad, a brutal mercenary who kills anyone who stands in the way of making ready cash. The film's comic relief is Tuco (Eli Wallach), the Ugly, a Mexican bandit wanted in several states who ends up inadvertently doing some good turns. At the height of the Civil War, as Union and Confederate armies battle each other in the West, these three men vie for an abandoned cache of gold coins.

The film is especially memorable for its pace and cinematography. The opening scene, for example, juxtaposes closeups of anxious faces with vast panoramas of the Western landscape, and 10 minutes passes before a single word is said. It's like Tarkovsky transplanted to a vastly different setting. That's not to say it's all so serious, though. In a sense the film is a ""two buddies on the road"" movie, with Tuco the wisecracker and Eastwood's character the straight man. It is also a war film, with Leone apparently sparing no expense in presenting a realistic image of hundreds of men charging each other on the battlefield. This is not among the greatest films I've ever seen, but it's very well-made.

Because this is a ""spaghetti Western"", an effort in the genre realized by a joint Italian-Spanish production team with American lead actors, the film has some curious qualities. Because of the use of locals, all the faces of Civil War soldiers are so clearly Italian, even though Italian immigration into the US picked up only later. The Mexican bandit Tuco is played by a Polish Jewish actor from New York, and furthermore Leone mocks the character's Catholicism in a way that Americans of the era would, although the faith would be in no way foreign to his Italian audience.",7
12 July 2008,Yet another flawed classic,"This is the colossal story of three men. Two of which are bounty hunters who are at opposite ends of the moral compass, with one (Angel eyes) who will kill anyone and anything in order to reach his goal and with the other (Blondie) with limits that make him desire the right outcome, even of he sometimes doesn't get it. The third member of this triumvirate is a criminal (Tuco) who will do anything to remain free.

As Tuco teams up with the Blondie in order to perform a bounty collecting scam, a missing treasure to pay soldiers in the civil war has been uncovered by Angel eyes, as the film progresses the final piece of the puzzle of the treasure's location is revealed to Tuco and Blondie. The remainder of the film sees the two of them split, team up with other people, intervene in a major civil war battle and have a final reckoning where only one can be the winner.

This is a colossal film in terms of its vision and scope. The running time at 161 minutes is a tad long and the film is at its best after the first 40 minutes when the pace is a trifle slow. It is only when the treasure's location is revealed that the film really starts to move and we feel the scale of the vision being revealed. The characters are excellently drawn and each of the three men are interesting and even likable in their own ways. Angel Eyes as the villain is a magnificent one and he is great to watch as he sneers over the screen. Clint is magnificent here and around this time with both this, and Dirty Harry, he has a couple of his best ever performances. Eli Wallach doing a sterling job representing the worsts aspects of greed and selfishness of humanity, however, even within this vessel of degradation there are still redeeming features that he attempts to hide.

Directing such a colossal work must have been a nightmare and Sergeo Leone does an incredible job of combining the disparate strands without losing track and, largely, doing so while moving the story forward. The musical score is impressive and during the quieter moments is at its most effective, as, for me, I find the larger pieces too invasive and take over scenes rather than compliment them, and for this and the issue of pace at the beginning marks this down for me, but then again it is a question of taste.

Nuff said Em",8
25 November 2001,Indulge,"Clint Eastwood--Blondie, Biondo, or the Man with No Name, The Good (sort of).

Lee Van Cleef--Angel Eyes Sentenza, The Bad (definitely).

Eli Wallach--Tuco, The Ugly (both in outward appearance and certainly inside).

These three are rivals for treasure in this terrific Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western. All three actors are great. Clint Eastwood is icy, cool, quietly efficient. He turns in accused criminals for bounties and frees them before they are hung. Lee Van Cleef is also cool like Eastwood, but he is actually more slick and smooth, and dressed in black, is decidedly evil, and more dynamic than Eastwood in execution, if not better. But Eli Wallach, as Tuco, actually comes out best, in my book, perhaps because of the nature of his character. In Leone's Spaghetti Westerns, the idea is not John Wayne white hats versus the bad guys with black hats. Instead, our desire for entertainment is catered to through exposes of visuals and base instincts. Tuco embodies those base instincts. However, altho he is my favorite (including most humorous) character of the three, like I believe he is for many, he is certainly not one for my self-image. I hope not for yours, either. Anyway, at least Blondie has somewhat of a conscience. Angel Eyes and Tuco do not.

Tuco personifies raw greed, and he will do anything to get the treasure and keep it all for himself. He is an archtypical Mexican bandit, who displays sincerity like a con man and proceeds to stab you in the back. He draws out the emotions, the tensions. His greed has great promise, but then his frustrations are greater, and his displays of both are sort of the life of the film. And he is funny. Well, actually, lots of the humor is because he is such a loser, so often outdone by the two other principals. Even tho they are not wonderful people either, we laugh at Tuco. That's part of the entertainment: Our emotions are not worked up to see the bad people beat the good people, since this distinction is not defined or even conceded to exist. Tuco is a greedy fat buffoon, Blondie and Angel Eyes are slick. Who do you want to see get it?

This movie has lots of action, lots of violence. It might not be called outright graphic violence (in the strict sense of some Italian films), but it is certainly partially there, and it is well shot. The cinematography is superb, as the Italian Leone presents visual images that portray the American West very believably. The shots of the vast barren (some mostly, some all) landscape are excellent, with good colors and the camera bringing you around, in and out. Arouse us with all this, and the search for treasure, of course being stolen gold, keep arousing us. Then there is the score. It is western majestic, concise, catchy. The score's visual images are perfect for this film, which ventures into the wide open spaces.

A great movie is not complete without a good ending. And it is great, beyond great, climaxing the themes of the film. As entertainment, ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" blows away traditional westerns by far. Treat yourself.",9
31 January 2022,Must Watch!,"This movie is so amazing.

10 June 2011,"When all westerns are forgotten... There will be The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly.","Top 250: 4

In the final chapter of the Dollars trilogy, 3 men search for a stash of Confederate gold. The road there, and how it all plays out, is pure movie magic.

Right from the start, you know this is going to be an essential. The three men, slowly walking towards each other, then opening the door, BANG BANG BANG... then the Ugly, with his twisted expression and meat in hand, mid jump. Then an epic plot begins to unfurl, and yes, GBU is very epic in every sense of the word, and exceeds its predecessors in every way.

The plot of this film is less straightforward than in the previous installments. There are now three characters that demand your attention, and they're all after the same thing. It's like the best treasure hunt ever. While in the other Dollars movies the first 25 or so minutes are cloudy and require lots of thinking to comprehend what's happening, GBU lays it all out to see the whole way through. Filled with great fights, battles and a very tense conclusion, the Good the Bad and the Ugly's story will grab your attention for its 3 hour runtime.

I didn't like that Clint had to share the spotlight in A Few Dollars More. But here, it's not only acceptable, but exceptional because of who and what he shares it with. Lee Van Cleef expertly handles the ruthless Angel Eyes, who will do whatever the job as long as he is paid. Eli Wallach becomes Tuco, the crazy bandit whose only allegiance is to himself and his money, and Clint plays Blondie, the 'good guy' , who fights for himself, cash, and whatever else he feels like. 3 standout, differentiated characters, each with names other than their respective actors. It may not be a big deal to you, but I like each character's nicknames.

Each character is deep and layered, with moral haze that leads to some very intense scenarios. Who will betray who, and when, is asked by the viewer several times during the run of the film. The characters stand out, and a very well acted.

As usual, the music is perfect, drawing from the earlier Dollars movies and creating a new score. It perfectly sets the tone. The Confederate soldiers sadly singing to drown out torture is an incredibly sorrowful tune.

The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is brilliant cinema from start to finish. In fact, it is the closest thing I've seen since the Godfather to be considered by me as a perfect film: the plot, characters, music, camera-work and ending are sublime. It's a subtle, stylish masterpiece that shouldn't just be seen by fans of the genre, it should be seen by anyone who likes movies. 9.7/10",10
23 June 2005,who is the good?,"Will somebody please help me out here? Who is 'the good' among those greedy killing beasts in that western jungle framed by this 'cinematic master' Sergio Leone?

You mean Blondie? Is there anything he has said or done stands for any tiny weeny goodness and righteousness? I tried to look for it but failed.

I am totally confused. If it is up to me, I would call this film 'the bad, the worse and the worst'. Or 'the ugly, the uglier and the ugliest'. Which one I can't make up my mind. But certainly these titles are much more appropriate to the content.

22 April 2017,To Europeans - America is a cultural trash can 'except'....,"....their fascination with the 'American West'. That 25-30 year period from 1860-1890 that defined us as a nation and all the legends that flowed from it.

This film was Europe's homage to the USA - it took that most horrific war in our history and used it as a simple framework for a story mythic in scope and engaging as few films have ever done for that which attracts all to the USA.

I remember Tommie Lee Jones in a movie talking about working in Japan and sayin ""...hell they don't want to see America ...they want to be Americans!"" His comment was, as expected, based on the west.

The film is epic in every sens of the word but what makes it truly majestic is the casting of 'three' rather than 'two' and, even though we know who to root for and who is the the buffoon and who is the bad guy we still 'watch' Wallach's sole performance that matches this is 'Caldera' in Sturges 'The Magnificent Seven' - Lee Van Cleef's only memorable role is as the Federal Marshal to Kurt Russell in 'Escape From New York' - this film was Eastwood's breakout role no matter what Stallone had directed him in prior to this masterpiece and why you ask? Because of the sound score composed by Ennio Morrocone. No need to go into plot development nor twists and turns suffice it to say the length is worth it even when it drags a bit or the much welcomed comic relief via Wallach i.e. telling a dying soldier asking who he (Wallach) was ""I'm Lincoln's grandfather!"" John Ford and Howard Hawks both directed equally classic films and in some ways more tightly scripted accounts of the west but for any real aficionado of what makes the tales of the western USA unique in all of human endeavor nothing equals this film.

'Blank' Europe - we die for them and we force them to recognize our genius in the one art film we have always excelled in - not - literature or sculpture or graphic art or music but FILM! Best line by 'Tuco' (Wallach) ""You pig you could have gotten me killed!""",10

It shows the complete waste of a whole generation of Americans, and for what? Something that was inevitable anyway. I think the quest for the gold was better to die for, so did blondie.

13 August 2020,"Not only the greatest Western, but greatest of 'any' kind","The good the bad and the ugly(1966)

This movie not only the greatest Western, but greatest movie of any kind.

The story is about three characters, Clint Eastwood who played good guy was charismatic, cool n intelligent. The charm he pulled with cigar can put anyone to shame. The bad guy was villain who can go any extent to get what he wants. Third one showed the ugly side of human, he was funny, unpredictable & a 'rat'.

Sergio Leone widely known for his Western movies did a terrific job as a director n cinematography is brilliant.

Ennio Morricone's score for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a vital part of why the film is so majestic and epic, and it's easily one of the all time greatest scores in the history of film.

It has one of the most epic endings in cinema history.There's barely a word spoken, just music and images combined to create a sequence which is tense, exciting and beautifully constructed.

Compare to other great classic movies this movie is underwatched. Highly recommend to classic movie fans who haven't watched it yet.",10

14 November 2013,Long long long-and that means more more more of a good thing!,"This is an imperfect world and like Shel Silverstein used to say, ""there ain't no tens"". I give this a ten grading on a curve. Every scene is good. Every sub plot is good. Even the bad things about the movie are good as they give you a feel for the imperfections of the time.

Who has not seen ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly""? Filmed so many years ago, yet even the title has earned its spot as one of our most popular clichés today. No spoiler here-probably one not needed. Just my vote and a blurb about why. And one more thing-you can watch this one many times and almost never get tired of it.

5 February 2014,One of the best movies ever,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

11 April 2003,Can't Get Any Better Than This!,"THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is not only the best of the Dollars Trilogy, but it is also the greatest western ever made. Clint Eastwood returns as the Man With No Name, who, this time, rivals two other strangers (Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach) in search for buried treasure during the height of the Civil War. Well cast with an over-the-top script, Sergio Leone's legendary epic is an outstanding achievement. Given the popularity of the first two, THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is an astonishing success and is always watchable from start to finish.

15 November 2001,you won´t even notice that it´s more than 3 hours long,"I saw ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" when I was still in my early teens and didn´t like it much then. I thought it was like an action movie but without the comforting elements usually associated with action movies like moral clarity and extremely spectacular fight scenes. However, recently, I saw it again on video and liked it for this exact same reason and more. The movie begins with a credit sequence of gun shots, grainy photos from the movie, and great music by Ennio Morricone that already tells you to expect a trip that´s exciting and fun. Then it rushes straight into a set of fight scenes which introduce the three main characters very dramatically (complete with titles to let you know which adjective in the title each character represents). Each of these characters is a morally flawed person who makes a living off of death. The ""Bad"" Angel Eyes makes his living as a soldier and a mercenary. The ""Good"" Blondie makes his living by making a travesty of hangings by always freeing the convicted men he turns in for reward money just before the rope should kill them. His ""goodness"" is only relative. The ""Ugly"" Tuco basically makes his living any way he can and his list of crimes is absurdly varied (ranging from all kinds of violence to statutory rape). He is a true opportunist without overriding morals but not entirely without a conscience. Played by Eli Wallach, Tuco actually steals the show from his 2 more famous costars because while they are almost superhuman in their skills, he is strikingly human in all his flaws. All three of these men, on individual terms, eventually come to know of a fortune buried in a graveyard and constantly keep fighting each other for knowledge of its exact location since each man only knows a different hint of where it is hidden and not the whole story. While such a plot does not seem too great, Sergio Leone choreographs every scene (violent or otherwise)to make it as suspenseful and expertly made as possible. The film also gets a lot of its entertainment value from Tarantinoishly holding nothing sacred. The three heroes scheme against other characters with a joyfully effortless malevolence, and not even the American Civil War is held sacred as the men try to manipulate the ""senseless"" conflict full of hopelessly drunken soldiers to make their quest for the treasure easier. The result of all this is that although ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" is more than 3 hours long, there is never a dull moment, making it seem about an hour or so shorter than it actually is. What´s most important, though, is that it is a thinking person´s action movie which unpretentiously demonstrates the absurdity of real life and helps us to laugh at it. If there is such a thing as a perfect western, this is the one. 10 stars out of 10 !",10
1 February 2005,"The Best, Bold And The Beautiful","One of the best movies that I've ever seen. Before seeing the movie I was sceptical whether it would turn out to be one of the typical Western movies of the 60's. The type on which the bad guys get the heroine and the hero goes and does some cool bit of shooting to save the day for his love, and the movie. But this was totally different from the other movies.

Clint Eastwood does his bit of the Western star. He steals away the show from Tuco (The Ugly). The movie is set in a background of the civil war plaguing America. The villain ""Angel Eyes"" (The Bad) is looking for a loot, which is hidden by a certain Jackson whose alibi is Bill Carson. Incidentally Carson dies whilst fighting in the war and he tells the secret of the hiding place to partly Tuco and partly to ""Blondie"" (The Good). The two go across the country facing the soldiers, and braving the fiery desert and fighting their mutual distrust to the hiding place. The movie has plenty of funny comments and plenty of action. It must be mentioned of the excellent camera work and the superb shooting locations bringing out the scenes and creating a permanent image in the viewer's mind. Lastly Ennio Morricone deserves an applause for his mind blowing music. His theme for the movie and the instrumental played during the graveyard sequence (aptly titled ""Ecstasy Of Gold"") is mind blowing.

Overall this movie is damn worth Ten Stars. Watch it Now!!!!!!!!",10
26 December 2005,Cinematic masterpiece,"'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' (TGBU) is quite a unique film. On paper it sounds like it could be a boring, arduous task to sit and watch this film: a 3-hour long story of a few bandits chasing the same treasure. But there's so much more to it than just that. TGBU is the final part of Sergio Leone's 'Dollar Trilogy' and if you've seen the previous two films, TGBU seems a lot more polished. Similar elements seen and heard in the first two films are used in TGBU, but to greater effect, producing a truly unforgettable experience.

I remember watching this film many times when I was about 8 or 9 years old and loving it back then, and I hadn't really seen it since then, until I was 23. Seeing this film again was such a joyful experience for several reasons: the soundtrack - often the part of a film that's overlooked, not so here (Ennio Morricone - bravo. Multo bravo); the fantastically-executed telling of the story (gets better on repeated viewing); the ending - still can bring a tear to my eyes (rare for me) just because of the tense drama produced here; the dialogue; the cinematography - still very unique, even though some directors have tried to use similar techniques, none have really produced a film of similar overall quality.

The only downside here is the sexual politics of the film, and of all the 'Dollars' films it has to be said: there aren't many women in this film at all. On t'other hand though, for the purposes of the story, it wouldn't've made much sense to put more women in just for the sake of having more women in the film. The ideas behind the story cater for a mainly male cast: the time it was set in, the shenanigans of the main characters. Watch TGBU and you'll understand what I mean, I hope.

Go on. I dare you not to be enraptured by the story, visual effects and soundtrack of this film. A masterpiece in cinema.",10

13 July 2003,"The west was never won, it just faded away.","Although Clint Eastwood is remembered for this 'prequel' of the ""Man With No Name"" trilogy, and Lee Van Cleef is remembered as the ultimate western heavy, and Sergio Leone is remembered for his genius in creating these counter-culture western, see this just once, and you'll agree that Eli Wallach is just beautiful as Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez, the Ugly.

Eli Wallach plays Tuco, the kind of character, that will steal your heart away...or anything else he could, if he stood close enough to you!....and yet he'll still envoke sympathy from you anyway!

Eastwood, with no name, is the badest good guy you'll ever see in the west and Van Cleef, is a ruthless gun slinger, who always sees his job through, once he's paid.

Sergio Leone decimates all previous images of the Hollywood image of the old west, in spite of some obvious goofs, a loud but catchy sound track, and some of the most ridiculous ricochet sound effects that you've ever heard!

It's a must see, and if you see it once, you'll see it again and again.",
4 January 2023,the most overrated top 250 imdb movie i have ever seen,"The movie is okay to watch for a single time; it's a 5-6 star movie, but it's not even in the top 300 to be a 10.

Can you imagine how much a movie like this would get in the ratings if it was released in the 2000s, 2010s, or 2020s? But it doesn't because it's from the 1960s.

Clint's performance is great and so cool, but the rest is meh, and Eli Wallach is actually super annoying, and his reactions is overacting.

It's a 3-hour-long movie that could have been a 1-hour-30 or 1-hour-15-minute good movie, but the director chose to make every scene 12 minutes long without needing to and that made the movie boaring, I respect all people who see this as a 10 or 9-star movie, but I really can't see why they think that about this movie. My advice is to watch it once just to have the experience of watching it and forming your own opinion about it.",5

23 April 2003,"The worst in the series of excellent ""Speghetti Westerns""","This movie, unlike the two previous (""A Fist Full of Dollars"" and ""For a Few Dollars More""), is borish, long, contrived, and for once, the ""Man without a Name"" is anything but a good guy. In this movie he's a liar, a thief and is more interested in money; compare this to the first movie where he is more of a quiet hero who ends up giving his money away to a girl, her husband and son and leaves town with nothing more than he came in with (although the town is cleaned up) and the second where, although less of a benefactor, he helps take down a vicious madman.

The story is a rampant anti-war film made in 1966, right when the war in Vietnam was really heating up. The last two movies did not make themselves allegories (which rarely hold up as good classics over time) but rather well crafted short stories made into movies.

Do yourself a favor and skip ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"". It's one of those things where, until you see the movie, you won't realize how much worse the dialogue, pace and tempo is.",4

21 December 2022,Insanely badass,"This is the first western I have ever seen and it blew me away with how well it has aged. The effects are timeless the acting is phenomenal and the plot had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. You barely feel the three hour runtime, it flies by so fast that it feels like an hour and 40 minutes. The score is just iconic, I am amazed at how many movie trope's this movie created. This is a GREAT movie witch i would recommend to almost everyone that I know. It is remarkable how well this movie aged and I just cannot believe all the groundbreaking things that this movie pulls off

In conclusion. Go watch it if you like action movies, you won't be disappointed.

3 June 2015,Possibly the most influential western of our time!!,"Is not a matter of something deep in the story. It's about style, the mood and it's about film-making technique that brought by Sergio Leone and the crews. Lavish idea and concept that make huge influence in future cinema. So splendid, phenomenal achievement in cinema history.

Focusing on 3 characters, to survived the hard times. Entertained with each own conflict of interests. I know it's just a simple idea. What makes extraordinary is how Sergio Leone played with long shot, zoom control angle, sticky conversations, and the most important is amazing musical scores by Ennio Morricone. God I love that way. I think that the biggest influences that always be remembered and many copied by the other filmmaker, that makes us still feel the mood of Sergio Leone in every genre.

Anyway, in essence, I know The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is pure entertainment only, not likes Once Upon a Time in The West, which probably has something melodic or dramatic fundamental elements that raised by Leone. I believed also that every entertainment things is beatable by times. But, you still can't replaced the originality, it's already changes the modern cinema forever. It's timeless classic!!",10
14 February 2014,The music will last forever,"I've watched this movie over 15 years ago and I just watched it again today Feb. 14, 2014. If there was ever a film in which sounds defined it, this would be that film. I watched the Bluray 5.1 surround version and every single sound was just ideal. A lick of the lips. A dropping rock. Suspenseful music score. Hard shoe soles against harder wood. Gun shots. Massive explosions. A little fly landing on a face. Every single thing seemed to have had a little microphone attached it. This added to my appreciation of the story line.

The story line was very ""story-like"". A good man, a bad man, and an ugly man all wanted the same thing. But, they couldn't all get it. It reads like a story book you would read to your kids before tucking them in. I wont go into further details of the story, but just know that it is a classic that will last forever. Every character has well defined traits that make them unique. If I happen to watch this film again in 15 years, I may not remember the story line. But, I do know that I will never forget the characters and the music.

22 July 2021,A Western for a New Generation,"With his ""Dollars Trilogy"", Leone virtually single-handedly reinvented the Western. The old formula of civilised white heroes valiantly battling native savages, or po-faced lawman struggling to establish order in their immediate domain were replaced with an ironic, stylish, sui-generis swagger. The Good, The Bad and the The Ugly was the apotheosis of this reinvention. It was a Western but not as anyone had ever known it, it was a Western for a new generation: a more self-aware, savvier generation.

Clint Eastwood is the face of this swagger. He is cool, calm and effortlessly heroic. A man of few words and no name, he represents the rugged charm of the old west. And is there any cinematic image more iconic than Eastwood squinting into the middle-distance, toothpick or cigar clenched between ivory teeth, muttering a laconic witticism to his unsuspecting, uncultured victim. Eastwood's persona was clearly drawn from the morally ambiguous heroes of classic film noir: think Humphrey Bogart from films such as ""The Maltese Falcon"" or ""The Big Sleep"". What's possibly even more impressive, however, are the number of archetypes this character was able to inspire: from 1980s action movie heroes, to more recent Marvel superheroes, there is a nod to one of cinema's most enduring influences: the original man with no name.

One, of course, also has to mention Ennio Morricone's soundtrack: once heard it is never forgotten and even those who haven't watched the film will recognise it. It's pure genius in its simplicity and effectiveness. It reaches out and pulls you immediately into the action and atmosphere of the film.

Personally, despite the above, I don't believe this film to be either Leone's or Morricone's best work, both would come with Leone's next film in my view. Yet it would be ridiculous to argue that this was not their most iconic cinematic offering. It's burned into popular consciousness to this very day: a testament to this lingering, enduring cinematic treat.",8
4 February 2014,The Best Western of All Time and One of the Best Films of All Time,"Clint Eastwood and westerns go together like peanut butter and jelly. Throw in one of the ultimate bad guys in Lee Van Cleef and the great Eli Wallach and you have a masterpiece. The third and final installment of the ""Dollars"" trilogy, the Man with No Name (Eastwood) gives us one more epic performance supported brilliantly by the calculating hit-man, Angel Eyes (Van Cleef), and the wanted outlaw, Tuco (Wallach).

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is probably the most recognizable western of all time as well the greatest, in my opinion. The world-renowned theme music also makes it one of the most famous and beloved films ever, with it's more than impressive #6 rating on the IMDb Top 100 being proof. With all due respect to other legendary westerns such as High Noon, Once Upon a Time in the West, and The Searchers as well as legendary stars of westerns like John Wayne, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly as well as the legend that is Clint Eastwood take the cake as the best of the genre. It is also a film that anyone with appreciation for great films should watch at least once.",10

3 January 2002,Fantastically Bad,"Alas. Allow me to surmise a bit of history: having created two of the greatest westerns ever with ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and ""For A Few Dollars More"", some unscrupulous soul was able to convince Sergio Leone that he was a creator of great cinema, instead of a creator of great westerns; this movie was the result. Gone are the brilliantly set-up action sequences, replaced with senseless and dull confrontations, with size, not even quantity, trying to make up for the lost quality. Gone are the witty and interesting characters and the deep character development, replaced with annoying, inconsistent, and flat caricatures. As to just what Leone was trying to say with this movie, for clearly he felt it had a message, it is either horribly unclear or completely and pathetically trite. In his quest to make a movie with meaning, Leone cast aside what had made this movie's ""predecessors"" so wonderful, and found that not only did he lose the bird in his hand, but he couldn't catch the ones in the bush and fell in a pile of excrement in trying.

19 July 2004,Me pot of gold.,"Not having seen this until very recently, I'm going to try and give an objective review for this film with tentative criticism. I'm not all too educated in the Western genre, but supposedly this is the best, so I figured it to be a good place to start.

Absolutely stunning cinematography technique, excellent characters and actors, and one of the most memorable musical scores ever help define TGTBATU's spot in film history. It's no wonder it's achieved the status it has. Having never seen any of the old spaghetti westerns before, I really didn't know what to expect. I was surprised but also delighted. For some reason I thought this film was going to be extremely realistic, so I was a little surprised to see hats getting shot off and rope cut in half by a bullets. I suppose it is part of the genre's characteristics and probably takes a little getting used to. Also, at the same time the film is very realistic as it introduces the theme of the Civil War at different parts throughout the film giving us a small glimpse of it's effects back then.

Easily my favorite component to the film, the cinematography is simply amazing. Panoramic backgrounds and extreme close-ups do their respective jobs quite nicely to give this film more character that it needs, which is not a bad thing. I'm sure it's played a huge part in the film's notoriety and support since it's release. The score and the well-cast actors obviously had a part in this also. Oh yeah, and one more thing, Clint Eastwood...born for these parts.

Being new to the genre of Spaghetti Westerns, I offer up my criticism with much reluctance. For the record, I enjoyed the film quite a bit and was not disappointed. However, I was a little surprised to find the film rated so high, even if it is the genre-defining classic that it is. What's wrong with it? Well, it's a tad too long for one. Not that I can't stay interested, I just felt they could have cut a few of the scenes. Also, while the cinematography is beautiful, and complimented by long shots, I feel these longs shots are sometimes a little too long. The cemetery and stand-off scenes in the end come to mind. They're wonderful sequences, just too long. It's not that big of a deal, just sensing a little pretension leaking out here and there. And lastly, the sound quality is fairly terrible, even if the score is decent. The quality makes it sound like everyone was in a cave, including the impressive score. I do realize that the film was dubbed...some of which isn't all that great, which explains some of the off-key lip movements from some of the characters, some of them English speaking. Other than those three little gripes, that may not have been such forty years ago, this is a great film that I enjoyed immensely. I will definitely add it to my collection soon and continue my quest to see all of the great Westerns. Anyone interested in Westerns, great adventures, or simply film in general should not miss this hallmark.

Highly recommended, but not for everyone.",10
30 January 2008,What a film,"This film has it all, story, scenes, actors and amazing soundtrack.

The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a must see for any western fan.

This is the last of Sergio Leone's films staring Mr Eastwood but this must be his greatest film.

This was the first time I had heard music by Ennio Morricone, ""Ectsasy of Gold"" is highly recommended.

The scenes are breathtaking (Trivia question, why are they called Spaghetti Westerns, answers on a postcard please) and the ending is not your typical shootout in the middle of a town...

If not already please watch this film (uncut version if possible) and you'll see why its so highly rated on the IMDb top 250.",10
7 September 2003,Masterpiece,"Easy one of the best films of all time.

The camera work in the film is amazing, Leone's use of the close up, especially during the final shootout captures the emotions of the characters & the use of the scenery also great.

Eli Wallach as Tuco is at the peak of his abilities in this film. Wallach's warm & charismatic performance helps make the character more than just a greedy, violent bandit. Instead Tuco is the most interesting character in the film.

Ennio Morricone's score is one of the most brilliant, if not THE most brilliant in the history of film. It is Morricone's score that takes this film from very good to masterpiece category. Well worth checking is the new version, with scenes cut from the original English version now included. Many of these scenes help explain how many of the characters (mainly Angeleyes) ended up where they were. 9/10",9

9 February 2014,My favorite film of all time...well tied for first favorite,"My favorite movie of all time. It doesn't get any better than Leone's Spaghetti Western masterpiece. The visuals are striking, the script is flawless, the acting is good, and the score is the best of it's kind. This film is an utter classic and is without a doubt the best Western and best Spaghetti Western. It's gritty, it's dirty, it's violent, it's compelling, it's clever, and it's perfect. This is one of those films that has inspired me to enter into the film industry myself and I do not think a film gets more of a nod from me than this film ""There's two kind of people in this world; those with loaded guns and those who dig. You, dig.""

11 March 2005,Arguably the Greatest Western Ever Made,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is without a shred of doubt absolutely one of the greatest Westerns ever made and very, very few can even come close. In fact, it is among the greatest films ever made and I can only think of 2 other Westerns that can even compare.

Brilliant in every respect, the film is original, tense, very gritty, and very atmospheric. Throughout the film there is an incredible energy and sense of tension that suddenly mounts tremendously to a breaking point in the finale. The film, outstanding the entire way through, is pure magic from the moment Tuco stumbles upon the cemetery until the very end. In a short period of time, this last portion of the movie crams in the incredible scene where Tuco looks around to see the immense number of graves before searching for the treasure, and the extremely tense, gripping, and unusual three-way stand-off in which the tension becomes almost unbearable before the sudden, unexpected, and powerfully anti-climactic (if that makes sense) shootout.

The cinematography is creative and artistic. It powerfully helps convey the moods of the events and adds tremendously to the feeling of tension. As usual, Leone made the film with extreme care and artistry, combining his ""trademark"" tight close-ups and huge longshots, sometimes, with incredibly stunning visual results, in the exact same shot (as near the end when we see a close-up of Tuco's gun and his hand slowly inching down toward it, while the bulk of the view is a longshot of the cemetery with another of the gunmen in the distance).

The characters are fresh, entertaining, and beautifully portrayed. Lee van Cleef, Eli Wallach, and Clint Eastwood are all perfect in their roles, imbuing their characters with immense realism and personality while emphasizing their differences and their similarities. Lee van Cleef emphatically shows how good and versatile an actor he could be, despite the fact that he far too rarely got such big roles. After compellingly portraying the utterly sympathetic colonel in For A Few Dollars More, he is entirely convincing as a terribly ruthless baddie. Clint is great as the taciturn Blondie and gets in some great, convincing gestures, etc. Eli is the most incredible of the lot here as the garrulous, untrustworthy, but likable and sympathetic Tuco, a man boiling with life and quirky humanity who contrasts the other taciturn, calm characters wonderfully.

Another element of this film that I love is the great attention to detail, another Leone strong point that pays off in all of his films This is particularly true with respect to the three main characters. So much thought seems to have gone into even the smallest aspects of their personalities, such as how each one carries his gun in a totally different manner. My favorite is probably how Tuco carries his gun stuffed into a pocket and likes to have it simply hang from his lanyard when ready to fight.

There is also a wonderful sense of humour and I love how this pops up to break the tension even at unexpected moments like the cemetery and the final shootout.

I also want to comment on Leone's handling of violence. His films certainly are violent in the sheer number of deaths (compare The man Who Shot Liberty Valance, where I remember only 1 person being killed), adding a grittiness to the films and making them less idealized and romantic. At the same time, Leone's scenes of death are quick and sharp, with most of the time spent on building the tension beforehand. I actually think that this not only makes a much more interesting picture with greater tension and less gore than something done by, say, Sam Peckinpah, but the quickness of the deaths actually is more brutal in a way than a drawn-out death. It hits home the cheapness and fragility of life in a way that a long, bloody death never can.

Finally, Ennio Morricone's music is utterly perfect. It's brilliant and perfectly helps convey all the drama, tension, and general atmosphere of the film in the right ways at the right times. I don't think there has ever been a better score for a Western.

This is one film that I can watch over and over, every time enjoying every little detail. One of the most amazing things, and one which really hits home Leone's incredible ability as a filmmaker, is how Leone can take this genre, and what is really a very simple story, and produce a film that goes far beyond what might normally have been with the film, turning it into a real piece of art and something far grander and more powerful than it otherwise would have been in the hands of other filmmakers.",10
15 April 2016,The Man with the Harmonica is gunning for you!,"A great Spaghetti Western film. I think this film has everything you would expect from Spaghetti Westerns. Clint Eastwood was great as the rugged, antisocial Blondie- the rogue anti-hero.

The camera-work was also great as well from the sweeping long-shots of the desert to the close-up shots of the actor's faces. The soundtrack is iconic and did brilliantly in building tension.

If I were to criticise this film for anything, I would say Sergio Leone did stretch out the film a little. He did overdo the tension building, particularly during the final standoff which could have been significantly shorter.

4 November 2020,this is the best western movie that I've seen!,"I don't like ""a fistful of dollars"" and ""for a few dollars more"" but this is the western movie that I really expect to watch... I really enjoy it but when I compare this movie with some other great movies I can't give it the full score but I think 8 is fair!

12 October 2013,Masterpiece - Best in every aspect!,"If you would look at the era this movie was released, movies were purely on the script... Not like today where gimmicks/effects do the work and scripts are weak and illogical...

The beauty of this movie is the excitement it generates and gets you closer to feel like a cowboy/ westerner.

1) An simple story but an amazing script. It all depends on how a story is being told... 2) Absolutely sophisticated acting by each actor. 3)The characterization is so superb in this movie. You don't feel that actors are acting.. rather it appears that real characters have been incorporated into the movie.. 4) The direction - Sergio has turned this into an epic and classic movie. The direction was different from other western classics - close shots of the faces, desert and the chase/fights... 5) Ennio Moricone soundtrack is magic...

4 March 1999,This Movie leaves you with a better outlook on LIFE!,"The Good will usually conquer the Bad! The Ugly will be tolerated, and even laughed upon, but you will find it not as hard to forgive them for their faults. This classic western will always be one of my favorites, it has the touch of genius that great film makers, and viewers desire.

3 July 2019,First Time Reviewing,"This is one of the rare movies that I have 10/10 points. Everything in it is just so solid. What amazes me about this movie is that it doesn't feel like it's made in 1966 to me. The shootings are so timeless. Settings are great. There are many iconic scenes. And I must say Ennio Mocorelli made the soundtrack so perfect that I still listen to some of those iconic songs today.

2 June 2021,The best,"Definitely one of the best films ever.

It isn't fast paced at all and that may seem extremely boring!-but you literally cannot turn it off. It's like a mystery, you want to know who will get the treasure in the end. The Good? The Bad? The Ugly? Who?!!

I watched this with my family about 2 months ago for my older brothers 15th birthday and all of them had already seen it but me. I was blown away. Usually I don't really watch Spaghetti Western Movies, but I gave this a chance.

The cinematography. The acting. The setting. The plot. It. Is. Truly. Magnificent!

1 October 2022,The highest expression of its type,"Blondie, Tuco, and Angel Eyes are three mistrustful men who make their livings outside the law. After they learn of a hidden trove of gold coins, they must work together to claim the treasure, as each knows something about the location. Who will get the gold?

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is peak spaghetti western. The score from Morricone: incredible; I especially love the music from the final standoff and the reference to the music-box tune from For a Few Dollars More. The zoom-in eye contact: unsurpassed. The cast: it's hard to think of better people to play our villains than Eastwood, Wallach, and Van Cleef.

It's probably too long, but hey, the extraneous parts are still pretty entertaining.

10 September 2023,"One of those movies you are ""not allowed"" to dislike","Yes, this is another one of them, and I am sawing it. :)

The movie is very beautifully shot and has very fine music, but it doesn't fit my taste.

It's not more than that, I just don't like it, and you who get upset by this opinion that people will have, you MUST accept it! Atleast if you wish to have a nice life.

Only Sergio Leone film I like is Once upon a time in America. That movie is like a dreamy tale about the same kind of men this movie is about. I think I have seen Harmonica - Once upon a time in the west also, but I'm not sure and will therefore not comment it. More than I will watch it some day.

To all who shares my opinion but keep the mouth shut due to other people not accepting your opinion, do not keep it to yourself any more!

You are allowed to not think this movie is a masterpiece. Just like you are allowed to think it is, if that's what you think!",1
1 October 2020,A Western masterpiece,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

10 April 2020,Completely highly over rated!,"Banal argument, interpretations nothing special, I really don't see anything that can classify this film as excellent, except technical details for the time it was made. I'm just an admirer of films in terms of entertainment and momentary travel during their duration, which is what they are made for, but this film did not stimulate my brain, so I will definitely not see it again...

25 January 2004,I don't like westerns usually but Goddamn!,"On so many levels this film is amazing. I am a huge fan of Italian Horror films and leone is making me a fan of the spaghetti westerns. My father was always a huge fan of the dollars trilogy and had many times told me that the good the bad and ugly was the best. Perhaps the best thing about this film is the many ways it has influenced the film makers of today. I think many of my favorite films would not be the same at all with out a leone influence and his great films raising the bar.

Eastwood will own you every time you watch this film with his pitch perfect performance as the man with no name. While he doesn't say much at all part of the charm of it all is you know what he is thinking and you almost can't believe he is able to hold it in. When Clint opens his mouth it is quotable everytime. `there are two types of people in this world, the ones with loaded guns and the ones who dig'.

Awesome film. That is saying a lot because I generally hate westerns. As you might be able to tell from my user name I think the enslavement of animals is wrong. I don't think it is ok to `break' horses or exploit them for any use. This makes westerns and many Kung fu movies that I love mildly painful in moments.",9
12 May 2011,Greatest movie I have ever seen,"Let me tell you guys how I came to watch 'The Good The Bad The Ugly'. Being an ignorant about Hollywood movies till few months back..I was not at all aware about this movie. I found the uncut version in BluRay from a friend and watched this movie last month only... Let me tell you guys it is the greatest movie I have ever seen. Great story, great actors, great locations and yeah..Great Music. I love the way the music drives the movie. I never imagined that such kind of westerns can have such great music. I have become great fan of the director and have watched all the movies directed by Sergio Leone. This is my first review on IMDb and definitely the worst ever! But I don't have words to describe this great movie. WATCH IT BEFORE YOU DIE !!

1 April 2014,"You see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend: Those with loaded guns and those who dig.","Everything about this film is brilliant. The directing, characters, acting, story and the theme score is excellent. The best western i have ever seen. A three hour journey of excitement that leads you to the long awaited and explosive climax. I can honestly say that the last twenty minutes or so of this film is the best twenty minutes of film i have ever seen. Absolutely phenomenal. Sergio Leone's directing with the three leading actors makes this one of the best films i have ever seen... Perhaps the best. Actually yes, this is my favorite movie of all time and i don't see that ever changing.

What makes 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly' iconic ranges from many things such as Ennio Morricone's memorable score not only defining this movie, but spaghetti westerns, to its unforgettable scenes, depicting beauty and grit in the world created by Sergio Leone. Watching the movie feels like listening to a long musical composition, watching it build and build into a heart pounding crescendo, at the same time basking in the scenes where time feels like it slows down so we could soak in the beauty that this ugly, fragile world has to offer.

What I love about this film, is how it can be light-hearted and fun, yet still feel deep, heavy and contemplative at times. We don't get to know the characters at all (except a bit about Tuco), but we get to know them through their actions, and we truly find out the nature of why these three characters have these titles of 'the good,' 'the bad,' and 'the ugly.' To see these characters interact is a treat to watch, but what captivated me about the film was the great Clint Eastwood and his performance at 'The Man with no Name' or 'Blondie' as Tuco would address him as. He is the definitive embodiment of the stoic, anti-hero with an air of mystery as to where he comes from and his motives, which is what kept me in suspense through out the movie. From his strategic thinking in outsmarting Tuco, he is basically floating through a world of chaos, adapting to any unexpected messy situation these characters get thrown into. Then, when we finally get to the ending, we don't know what will become of the characters and that unpredictability is what makes this one moment in the movie one of the most intense scenes in cinema. Without spoiling anything, all I could say is that I felt the ending was clever in a way I didn't see coming at all.

With a great setting, a great score, great performances and a simple, but very great story, this is a western film I highly recommend you should watch, if you have never watched any westerns before. On that note, this is not only a great western film, but a wonderful piece of art from Sergio Leone. From the films I've watched by him, everyone of those films possess that layer of depth to them that feels like that feeling of bliss in life that comes once in a blue moon. Even with a film as dark as 'Once Upon a Time in the West' or 'Once Upon a Time in America,' Leone still manages to emit a feeling of warmth through his stories, and with all its guns and grit, 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' is pure beauty on film.",10
30 December 2004,The definitive spaghetti western,"One of the best westerns ever made. Boasts an unforgettable Morricone score, a typically charismatic performance from Clint Eastwood and stately direction from the master of the genre, Sergio Leone With A Fistful of Dollars (1964), Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone gave birth to the spaghetti western. So it is appropriate that he should take the helm for the quintessential example of the genre with this, the best and last of the Dollars trilogy (after 1965's For A Few Dollars More).

Anti-epic, brutal and displaying an often overlooked gallows humour, The Good, The Bad And The Ugly centres on the aptly described protagonists. Eastwood (The Man With No Name - other than 'Blondie', or the Good), Van Cleef (Angel Eyes, or the Bad) and Wallach (Tuco, or the Ugly) are the three degrees of moral ambiguity searching Civil War-torn America for a buried payroll.

In truth, however, the plot is incidental to the film's appeal. The spectacularly bleak landscapes, Morricone's cheekily melodramatic score, and the physical interplay between the leading men all contribute to the film's (and Eastwood's) iconic status.

The finale's showdown is an inspired set-piece of sweaty tension and invention that has been blatantly lifted by directors all over the world from Woo to Tarantino. As cool as a cheroot in a heatwave.

Verdict Sergio Leone's masterpiece is as enduring as the scorched desert in which it is filmed. Also receives props for most effective use of whistling ever.",10

16 December 2004,"One of the best westerns, with or without spaghetti","TGTBTU is a work of art. It took an Italian director to get the Old West right, at least on screen, dumping the hokey musical scores and make believe good guy/bad guy cowboys and indians hokum that killed a lot of Hollywood westerns, while retaining the epic scope that the vast landscapes evoke (even if it was really Spain). This 3rd movie centering on the Man with No Name (not exactly true, but its catchy) was the 1st that Leone got the inimitable Ennio Morricone to score from the outset, and that score has such an impact there's no doubt it has a lot to do with TGTBTU's attraction through almost 40 years. It really sticks with you! This Ultimate Spaghetti Western was also elevated by a bigger budget and much stronger screen presence of its principal characters. Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef are true screen legends, competing any which way they can for the stolen bags of gold, culminating in the most famous gunfight in moviedom.

I also rate Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West a 10. It is a less revered movie than TGTBTU but in some ways is Leone at his absolute peak.

The 2 DVD pack is an absolute must for anyone with even a mild interest in film. The remaster is a wonder of restoration technology and looks glorious. It now has a 5.1 DD audio soundtrack that remains mostly at the front, with an occasional surround explosion or gunfire that surprises you. They've added 18 minutes to the film, essentially the initial release of the film seen in Rome, and if you're a Leone fan you can pick out at least some of the added footage. The additions were good overall; for the most part the story flowed better but there was some unnecessary fluff. The 2nd disc has some good featurettes that include some modern commentary by Eastwood and Wallach, a little documentary on the Civil War backdrop, trailers, and even a couple of deleted scenes! The DVD gets a 9.7/10, losing a bit because it is in a non standard case that has no reason to be higher and wider than usual.",10

21 August 2021,Clint - the flairful US star of the Leone trilogy,"The Italian-western genre of the '60s and '70s was imbued with a sense of the surreal and playful Italian ''comedia-delle-arte'' style. When interviewed by the Beeb in 1989, film scholar and Leone expert Christopher Frayling remarked that Leone wanted to deploy a sense of 'flamboyant rhetoric' which went beyond the traditional US western oater style. Clint Eastwood's performance as a taciturn supercool gunslinger has great flair. Memorable scenes include Wallach's shooting of a baddie while he is in a a bath - 'If you're gonna shoot - shoot!'; the poignant prisoner-of-war scenes with the choir comprised of wretched Confederate soldiers which conjure visions of violence and brutality and the equally moving scene when Eastwood shows compassion to a dying young soldier by offering him a puff of a cigarillo. Morricone's angelic soaring romantic 'The Ecstasy of Gold' is stirring stuff.

I don't want to give away the story, but as you watch it you'll will find the story very easy to understand indeed. the director Sergio Leone in my opinion has to go down as one of the finest directors in the history especially the 1960s era.

9 June 2022,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly - Review","My gosh finally I watched this movie and oh my is it good. I mean, the amount of charisma of the main trio is immeasurable, loved it! Loved the characters, loved the setup, loved the atmosphere, and especially the score - Morricone is a genius, but that's a well-known fact. So why not a full rating? The events with the civil war were kinda slow and it just decelerated the movie a lot. The tempo was broken off and it did concern me a bit. Yeah, we got some of the important information in this phase of the movie, but yeah, it is a flaw. I love this movie anyway, I think it's better than Once Upon a Time in the West and I was in love with the zooms and stuff - it's obvious that Tarantino was inspired by spaghetti western in Django Unchained - one of my favs of all time. So yeah, it is definitely that good and I'm sure that I'll watch more westerns in the future because this genre has a lot to offer. So yeah, watch it if you don't and remember - this is the cinema.

26 August 2017,Bad. Just bad.,"Not the worst western ever made. More like the top of the bottom of the pile. Two-dimensional characters, ridiculous plot, predictable yet implausible scenes. Good for 12 year olds on a Sunday afternoon, but not much else.

If you want to get out of the kiddie pool and see an actually good western movie, watch one that was directed by Clint Eastwood, such as Unforgiven or The Outlaw Josey Wales.

24 September 2003,Great Score - shame about the film.,"3 men out west seek hidden loot in the civil war.

The Good the Bad and the Ugly starts brilliantly, with each of the three in question shown in their own opening scenario. Eastwood is quickly established as the 'Good', Van Cleef the 'Bad' and Eli Wallach as the 'ugly'. Though generally there's no difference in their characters, as they all steal, kill and betray. Blondie (Eastwood) and the ugly repeatedly steal from the law by collecting ransom demands for the latter, not stopping at one to forgo the increasing value on his head. Van Cleef murders anyone for money. There a rather spirited bunch. From their on the experience becomes tedious and very slow. There are some great set-pieces including a battle on a bridge involving hundreds of extras, and the standoff at the end is excellently done, with extreme close-ups that heighten the tension. Once again the Italian scenery is efficiently, if excessively used. It's just a shame that it's alloyed by Wallach's hamming and a ten minute scene of Eastwood crossing the desert - sound exciting ?. The film is badly dubbed but even this doesn't mar the enjoyment as much as Ugly's cringe worthy sentimental scene with his brother, superfluous ? -not entirely. It does lead to some 'Good-Ugly' relationship humour which is where most of the film gets it's laughs. To be fair, none of the humour seems out of place with all the explosions and blood as the film doesn't take itself entirely seriously (Sergio Leone seems to have been satisfied with the over-the-top performances by virtually every character except Eastwood and Van Cleef). But this doesn't matter - because the score is one of the best for any western ever.",
15 June 2019,Simply the greatest.,"I have seen this film so many times and still see something new each time. In my humble opinion it's the greatest western ever made. It's my favourite film.

When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

7 February 2001,"Okay, but far from great","I don't quite understand why everyone loves this movie. It's way too long and doesn't have any new revelations in plot. The simple story is about three men who all want the same thing: a buried treasure. That's it. Two of the men team up and the third guy is the villain who pursues them. So it's nothing new, but the background imagery goes all out and that's why this movie is so well known. It puts scenes like one of them crossing a bridge, right smack in the middle of the civil war. It's elaborate in settings, but anything but elaborate in plot. The characters are for the most part just okay. Then there's the ugly guy who is funny as all hell. If he wasn't a part of this movie I would have certainly disliked the film because there isn't that much great about it. That one character makes the movie and sets the tone. So this is an okay movie, not what you'd expect based on word of mouth, but not bad either.

3 February 2018,One of the best in history,"Tuco: Is this a joke. Blondie: (cool) It's a rope not a joke. LOL*

I guess I have a man crush on Clint Eastwood's Blondie! But seriously If i had only 3 hours to live i would watch this movie, it gives me goosebumps the moment its legendary theme plays, one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to get technical about it because it's magic for me but it's cinematography perfection especially the last fight scene it's devine everyone in the world knows it old or young, the dialogues are well written the framing is a work of art the characters are catchy and complex a full study of human nature, justice and war. can't wait to watch it again!

and btw good always wins!

29 September 1999,I want that music playing on my wedding day,"This has to be the greatest western ever made. The director Sergio Leone created such a piece of art it should be hung in a museum right beside the painting of the Last Supper. Clint Eastwood is more memorable in this role than John Wayne is in all of his roles put together. Cleef is dynamic (for once) and is more evil than the snake from the Garden of Eden. Eli Wallach simply steals the entire movie with his performance. He could have taken out ""the Magnificent Seven"" all at once. There are quite a few westerns that have come close to perfection (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Outlaw Josey Wales, Dances With Wolves) but none closer than this one. Just the fact that the Civil War is considered a sub plot goes to show you how entertaining this film is. I still believe the soundtrack is the best of all time. Every country should have it as a national anthem. There has never been a more original soundtrack ever produced by anyone. As for the ending, where should I begin. It is a tremendously satisfying ending (the only ending I can think of that is better is Shawshank Redemption). When those three guys got into the circle and the music started playing, WOW. 3 guys in a showdown? unreal entertainment. Better than any western John Ford could produce that's for sure. I think its safe to say you already know what my rating is for this movie. P.S. email me for any comments, questions, Eastwood movies, they don't call me the ""tree of knowledge"" for nothing.",
27 July 2020,Excellent movie,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

9 September 2023,THE MEDIA OF OUR TIME...,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a glorious, God send of a cinema of our time. It's personally not only the most impeccable western film, but any single media ever made and I've ever seen. The most parodied, most competently creation of a film, most recognizable score from Ennio Morricone and Sergio Leone's masterclass of storytelling.

But there is a interesting aspect of a reason for The Good, The Bad and The Ugly to be unique and a well known cinima. It's because there hasn't been a satire of not only western, but also anything umaginable. And this movie delivers something that becomes so recognizable that later on, other western movies will start looking similar and will give the audience some familiarlilies of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. And proves that no pop-culture media related to western can make an accurate western looking, setting, tone and a good western with parodied to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.

Ultimately, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a glorious throwback to the classic that lives forever. Because of how popular it is, it is a heavily implied that this film is more than a special movie. It's an a experience out of any other movies that goes on and so fourth.

I fully recommend it.",10

24 February 2003,The 'Ultimate' Western? You Decide.,"This Western has everything, and that's why in some quarters it is regarded as the best one ever made.

Arguably it took Eastwood until 'Unforgiven' to make a film that even comes close to this one.

The music score is fantastic, one that people from all generations enjoy and remember.

This film is sheer entertainment people, and with Clint, Van Cleef and Wallach, you have three actors that carry a hugely enjoyable piece to watch.

10/10.

2 August 2020,Iconic Western film deserves the acclaim,"This film deserves to be iconic-and for many purposes. The cinematography is excellent, and helps add to the tension/conveyance of emotions of certain scenes. The camera shots are well-planned and help convey emotion/reactions, while also using visual storytelling in effective ways. The score by Ennio Morricone is also incredible, and includes well-done themes that help convey/evoke the atmosphere of the film. Simply put, The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly should be on the AFI list of 100 Years...100 Movies. I am appalled that it isn't on the list.

23 December 2015,"I recommend to viewers to watch this an extended English language version, remastered for a time of 179 minutes!","Recently I watched an extended English language version, remastered for a time of 179 minutes, which I was particularly impressed. The whole team of artists from the author of the story, writer, director of photography, composer, great E. Morricone, to a great director S. Leone with excellent actors made this movie possible. It is, in my opinion, the best film of all time, not only westerns. We should not forget that the producers have also greatly contributed to film such a movie, a true masterpiece. It is unlikely that will ever to gather team of artists to shoot something! This film can be the younger film makers serve as an example on how the film should be. Leone me in all these movies, among other things, most impress the wide shots and close-ups of characters by which he would like a director be remembered as an innovator successful in conjuring up the space in which the action of the film occurs as very credible presentation of feelings through which characters go during action.

The film faithfully shows what happened in the whirlwind of the Civil War, the three main characters whose main goal is to avoid being directly involved in the war to each of them got hold of the hidden treasures of 200,000 US dollars. Many events on reaching the finish line as the creators of this extraordinary film great advantage that through a combination of violence, humor, skillfully weave with excellent dialogues into a unique the filmic story.

I recommend to viewers to watch this an extended English language version, remastered for a time of 179 minutes! The vast majority will enjoy it, I do not think a smaller number of skeptics who always finds it.",10
18 June 2000,"perfect, except for the dubbing","i am not a fan of westerns, and i have seen the others films in this series and didn't really enjoy them at all. but there is something about this film that makes it my all time favourite. the direction is magnificent. the combination of sound and visual is beautiful organised. the acting is spot on, whether the actor be good, bad or ugly, they are great at it. and also it is extremely funny when it wants to be, and deeply moving when it needs to be. spot on across the board.

I never get tired to see this great epic spaghetti-western. Great music score by Ennio Morricone, fantastic widescreen pictures and close-ups by Sergio Leone.

9 January 2001,"A cinematic masterpiece, anyone?","The first time I watched this film, I started to think about what all the fuss was about. But in time I soon realized that I was'nt just watching a good ol' regular western, but a treasure in cinematic art.

After growing up seeing countless westerns like, HIGH NOON,THE WILD BUNCH,HOW THE WEST WAS WON, THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES,etc. It was clear that THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY had left more of an impact on me than the rest of the genre ever did. And now that I have watched it numerous times over the past few decades, (Theres the proof that I never get sick of watching it!) It's dawned on me that this flick will go down in history as one of the greatest masterpieces of film.

So...Where to begin? First off, I knew I was in for something different when the first 15-or-so-minutes of the film opens with no dialouge. Plus the first appearance of ""The man with no name"" ,which occurs much later than everyone would be led to expect, gives new meaning to the phrase of ""grand entrance"". THERE'S MORE! Lee Van Cleef's ""Angel Eyes"" is the epitome of evil..Enough to qualify him as, The Bad. But Eli Wallach's performance as ""Tuco"" aka The Ugly, is the big scene stealer! Just about every line that comes out of his mouth brings a chuckle of laughter out of me.

Sergio Leone's camerawork still amazes me. Never before have you seen such close-up emotion on the faces of the gunslingers and soldiers, combined with the backgrounds of Spain (Many shots strongly resemble different parts of my native California!) Of course I could'nt end this review without giving more praise to the musical score by Ennio Morricone.Easily the most definitive western music ever! The theme sounds glorious during the ""Tuco on Blondie's trail"" scene..Just ONE of my many favorite moments from this classic.

""When you have to shoot, Shoot! Don't talk""",
10 January 2023,"Not good, pretty bad and a little ugly","THE GOOD: The scenery and landscapes maybe. Some scenes were ok.

THE BAD: The acting including Eastwoods acting (never liked him anyway, the guy is overrated, with his tiny eyes, his face has no expressions, unable to show emotions, like good actors can, he is like a stoneface). Too slow paced ( I like slow paced, but this is just too much.)

THE UGLY: Blend movie, boring, characters not interesting at all.

Overall a very overrated movie, I really dont understand how this could have such a high rating. I dont like westerns and this movie was not an exception. Maybe it was better in the 60's, but on the other hand, I saw many movies in the 60 which were good and this was not one of them.

18 September 2008,See it in High Definition,"HDNet just broadcast ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" in High Definition. I haven't seen the film for many years and I was astounded.

It is not apparently available on Blu-ray yet so try to catch it on HDNet. I hope they repeat it. The DVD cannot do it justice.

In spite of historical inaccuracies, some preposterous scenarios and other plot weaknesses, brutal violence, some awful acting, and lip-sync problems with the Italian actors, it is a great film that engaged me completely for three hours.

It is visually stunning with Leone's extreme close ups and its recreation of the time of the American Civil War. The protracted scenes (often whole stories in themselves) add to the visual poetry and to the evocation of the time.

It is Leone's homage to the classic American Western. It relies heavily on the standard Western conventions but it is not constrained by them. Leone does it with his tongue planted firmly in his cheek. It should not be taken literally or even seriously and should be enjoyed for what it is.

The characters are multidimensional. Eastwood's non-acting and Wallach's over the top performance add to rather than detract from the movie.

It is possibly the most accurate portrayal of the American Civil War on film, showing it as the brutal and senseless conflict that it was.

Its comments on greed, violence and human nature are poignant and yet the humor leavens the lessons.",9
14 November 2013,This is a very epic Western film.,"I've watched hell lots of western movies but I've never seen so epic like this. The Good The Bad The Ugly surely is a good film. No, good is not enough, great film. Frankly, I stopped watching this film after like hour later but after few months later, I re-watched the entire film and shame of myself, IT WAS A MASTERPIECE. Some people says that this film is really boring but I really doubt if they watched the whole film. The last battle scene was totally mind blowing. The editing was so well pasted and the musics by Ennio Morricone was absolutely good. The ending? So good. The best ending I've ever seen was Fight Club by David Fincher but this one was brilliant too. If you are hesitating to watch this film, just watch it. Pretty sure that you will not regret it.

In this movie Clint Eastwood gives off an excellent performance without the use of a lot of talk which i like about it. Also the spectacles are unbearable to this day never mind back then. The movie could really inspire anyone to be a cowboy. It has gun sequences every turn,you never know what the man with no name is gonna get into. It is a movie for anyone who likes action. This movie changed the era of modern John Wayne western style classics. It is breathtaking and i don't think anyone should miss it. I give this movie a 10 out of a 10 for being a great movie and Clint Eastwood's best performance ever captured on film.

25 December 2006,Philosophy and art,"With more than 40 pages of reviews, what can I add? Let me focus on a few sides I haven't read about. The first one is philosophy. Movies, which aspire to be philosophical usually are boring and pompous. Probably Leone did not have such ambitions. Still philosophy - together with myth and religion, as pointed out by others - plays an important role. Since the antique times of the Greeks and Romans philosophers ask themselves the question: how can one lead a virtuous life in difficult circumstances? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is Leone's answer. There is no doubt about the Bad (Lee van Cleef). His name Angel Eyes must refer to the Fallen Angel, as he represents Evil. I don't know Italian, but I would not be surprised if the correct translation of Il Brutto should have been the Hypocrite. Tuco's (Eli Wallach) ways are ugly, only doing good when it is in his own interest. But what about the Good (Clint Eastwood)? His name, Blondie, refers to medieval characters like the Lady in the Tower with the Golden Hair, or Siegfried from the Nibelungen saga. Blondie certainly does not represent good the way all religions would like to see it. He is cynical, mean, ruthless, violent. He only shows compassion when he can afford it. I think the final scene of the movie gives the answer: in a lawless world being virtuous means being in a position of power and then apply a rudimentary kind of justice. Can anyone assume, that Tuco will have nice memories of Blondie? We can turn this argument around. If Blondie is good, what kind of world is he living in? I guess, we all must be grateful to live in an orderly society and not in a free for all.

Wagner developed the concept of Gesamtkunst, something like Total Art, for opera. He meant, that every element of the project should cooperate in harmony to achieve the final result. Leone has realised this concept with his GBU. Read the other reviews: every single detail contributes to the movie. The close ups already have been mentioned many times. They demand superb underacting, as we must read the emotions of the characters by small changes in their facial expressions.

Luigi Pistilli as the monk and Tuco's brother deserves to be mentioned especially. He is the voice of religious morals and gives us a ray of hope in a very dark world. Pistilli is excellent, like in For a few dollars more and Death rides a horse.

Still GBU is not the best movie ever imo. I'd like to mention Seven Samurai (Kurosawa), Le clan des Siciliens (Verneuil), Le samourai (Melville), A clockwork orange (Kubrick), Monsieur Klein (Losey), Autumn Sonata (Bergmann) and La dentilliere (Goretta). Note that three of these see Alain Delon; I think there are several similarities with Clint Eastwood. You will probably ask: how can you compare? You are right, it's just my personal taste. GBU still falls in the categorie extra-ordinaire, with the aforementioned movies and titles like Lola (Fassbinder), Vertigo (Hitchcock), Smiles of a Summer night (Bergmann)and For a few dollars more (Leone). As Leone has directed another few very good ones, he is one of the directors, who have proved that a movie can be a piece of art.",10
23 July 2020,"Silly characters, stupid plot, terrible pacing","I think the high rating must be the result of groupthink, I think. Other than the iconic theme song and a couple of good scenes, this is a laughably bad three-hour movie. Don't waste your time

Also, could somebody please shoot Eli Wallach's character?

8 July 2004,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly...","No words can explain this film's brilliance and supremacy. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. The performances of the good, the bad, and the ugly characters. Clint Eastwood shines in this classic western as he and Sergio Leone have done it again! The most impressive Man with No Name western, without a doubt. There is plenty of action going on in this western, be it gunfights or Civil War battles. Three gunslingers go on a hunt for $200,000, and let me tell you: this expedition for money has been the most entertaining journey I've seen. Twists and turns everywhere, anybody would love this classic. Unfortunately, this is the conclusion of the adventures of Clint Eastwood's character, the Man with No Name. But the conclusion has been his greatest adventure of the trilogy. I give this film a score of 10/10. Classic western beauty as Eastwood travels through the western frontier in search of priceless cash. There is also a bit of humor in this film, for those who seek mirth in western films. This movie has been a very inspiring film to me and I'm positive that it will inspire many other audiences in the future. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is an immortal classic that will stay as a classic for generations to come. Bravo, once again, Eastwood and Leone. Bravo.",10

My buddy was a projectionist and I can still remember him saying, ""Hey, There's a new Eastwood movie showing that's 3 hours long and it's so good you want it to go 6 hours!"" I had to see it. This is the greatest western ever made and quite possibly the greatest film ever. It flows beautifully. No wasted scenes, movements, actors, lines. It's like watching a beautiful symphony. I was disappointed with the anniversary dvd. Whoever did the voiceover track didn't know very much about scenes or actors. I thought they coulda done a better job. But buy it anyway.

5 February 2022,Arguably Greatest Western Ever - However...,"There are a couple of reasons why I only rated this film an 8. The dubbed-in voices and some of the super close-up shots by Leone make the movie seem cheezy and unprofessional. I realize it's a dated 1960's movie, but I don't recall any of John Wayne's movies having dubbed voices. Some may view these as being classic and charming. I however, do not. Nevertheless, it is still an epic western masterpiece.

18 November 2020,Favorite film of Quentin Tarantino,"If you liked: The Mandalorian The Magnificent Seven For A Fistful of Dollars

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is one of the best movies of all time. It's an epic story of adventure, war, murder and betrayal set in the wild west, with a score by Ennio Morricone that became literally legendary over the years. It follows three cowboys in Civil War Era America all looking for buried treasure worth an estimated $17 million in today's currency. This is one of these movies which I had in my watchlist for about 5 years, you just keep postponing it because from what you've heard it should be incredibly good, and that brings certain pressure for a person like me, who tries to analyze films. I have seen a couple of classical Westerns before (The Magnificent Seven; OUATI the West), so I had certain expectations for this film. I was happy that the film turned out to be not at all what I expected, in all the good ways. I don't want to say that this is the only Western you ever have to watch in your life; but from what I can tell this is like Michelangelo's ""David"" in the world of Westerns; if you do end up seeing only the one, you will get a good idea of what the whole genre has to offer, because that there - is the finest of the finest. People often say that the director Sergio Leone (OIATI the West; OUATI America) redefined the Western genre with this film. The so-called ""spaghetti Westerns"" (cowboy movies produced and directed by Italians in the 60-70s) were so profitable and popular at the time, that they soon became virtually the same story copy-pasted over and over again (kinda like some Marvel films nowadays). If the recipe works, why change it, right? That led to the inevitable decline and foreseeable death of Westerns as a genre, but Sergio Leone had one last word to fit into this story. What differentiates ""The Good..."" from other Westerns of it's era is the accurate representations of it's characters and War. The three rogue characters, apart from being traditionally ""cool and extremely skilled loners"", a reoccurring image we still see in today's Mandalorian and Witcher, are insanely well-developed. Each has short but extremely impactful scenes that show the essence of the character, explaining their motivation and, sometimes, background. They are brutal, murdering for the sake of murder and betraying for the sake of personal gain; but they are also lovable and unforgettable, and after all, this is the Wild West. The other thing about War is a reoccurring theme in all of my reviews on war films. You can't call this one a war film, but Leone makes his characters go through the battlefields of the ongoing warfare on their quest for a hidden treasure, and that gives the film a life-contemplating dramatic twist. War is not shown as cool, it is shown for what it really is: ""a daily slaughter"" and a terrible, unnecessary waist of good men. The first time I've seen War viewed like this in an old movie, it was a pleasant surprise. The film is also widely considered cinematically perfect, and although it didn't occur to me first, I must agree on that. Leone embraces the cinematic elements of filmmaking; he carefully composes each widescreen like he's painting a great landscape; and the extreme eye-level close-ups have become his trademark. Just like with most of other great ""top-rated"" movies, ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" had an undeniably profound effect on cinema and our collective thinking. Antiheroes is a common trait in modern films, and the final Mexican standoff scene has become deeply ingrained in our culture and became one of the most parodied scenes in motion picture history. The film's legacy continues to last long after it's release.",10
21 April 2008,The Ultimate Movie Classic,"Clint Eastwood is truly the man. This takes place in 1862, out west where men would carry guns everywhere and no one screwed around. This is back when men were men, bitches were bitches, and the fags were eliminated. Today if you were out there, half the population would be killed for not being manly enough HAHA. But anyway, this film depicts life back in those days and it is very exciting to watch. What could be more entertaining than seeing a real man like Clint Eastwood shoot up some dirty Mexicans?? Lee Van Cleef is also in this movie - great actor. This movie to this day still astounds me. The only flaw I have with this movie is that it is longer than it should be, and does tend to get boring. I remember back when I saw it in the movies when I was a little kid, my dad came in drunk stood up and yelled ""THERE Ain't ENOUGH GODDAMN KILLIN IN THIS MOVIE!"" But I look back now at this movie, and I still enjoy just as much as I did when I was a kid. Clint Eastwood was and always will be a true American hero.

24 January 2001,Maybe the best film in the world!,"Before i saw this film i had seen a few Clint Eastwoods films and they were very good, but when i saw it i was in heaven. All stuff in the film was perfect, the director, the actors and the music of Ennio Morricone. I´ve seen it many times, but it´s still a very good movie and i´m going to watch it many times more.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters.

13 April 2022,This is the best western movie ever created.,"I don think it will ever be topped. This is a MUST WATCH.

The whole trilogy is great, but this one arfgghhhdfddff. It just hits different.

I suggest also listening to the soundtrack.

Which is another great part of the movie.

Ennio morricone is a magnificent composer, RIP to a real legend for real.

9 March 2003,Greatest western ever made,"There is a reason this movie is rated the number one Western on imdb and that's because it is. Movie reviewers often misuse the word epic when describing films, but this movie defines epic. Three distinctly diverse characters (as the title implies), all amazing gunfighters, trek across the West with the Civil War in the backdrop heading for a huge stash of gold. Angel Eyes keeps us rooting for the good guys. Tuco keeps us entertained throughout the movie. And Clint Eastwood...well...it's Clint Eastwood (What else is there to say?).

I'm not a huge fan of Westerns at all, but this movie is still one of the grandest stories ever told.

12 April 2001,There are two kinds of people in this world..,"Those that love this movie, and those that don't recognize a masterpiece. Well, its difficult to say anything that detracts from a movie you have loved since childhood. And the number of times I've seen this film probably approaches tripe-digit territory.

Eli Wallach's Tuco represented the best performance by far in this movie, outdistancing the other two actors combined. The ""Ecstasy of Gold"" scene is almost my favorite in any movie. It seems as though Tuco will never stop running, and just when you believe the scene has ended it hasn't. Amazing how Leone could get so much mileage from one simple concept.

Personally this film is tied with ""The Wild Bunch"" as my top western.

5 July 2002,Draw!!!,"I absolutely love a good western. I""m also a Clint Eastwood fan. This western is a great shoot-em'-up type film with great acting. Somtimes I think that the director drags out the duels, but he does it for effect. I like the look of a good ol' western like this film brings. This film is really long, but it has a pretty darn good story. I really like the music and Clint Eastwood is the perfect cowboy. Watch this film and it will make your day.

2 March 2002,"""If you're going to shoot someone, shoot. Don't talk.""","One of my most favorite lines in the movie, this has got it all: action, humanity, the good and bad in people, and the greed. I saw this movie when I was only eight years old. Back then, it was purely for the cool gun battles and how funny Tuco acted at times. Now, I see it as a flawless piece of work and one of the best westerns I've ever seen.

Lets' start off with Tuco, aka. The Ugly. Tuco is an outlaw. He steals, he manipulates, and he can be bloody stupid at times. Yet, he is not all bad. This character is the most interesting one in the movie, for his greed always gets the best of him instead of controlled decisions. He was my most favorite character in this movie.

Angel Eyes, aka. The Bad, is one of the best villians ever in film. He rules others with an iron fist and shows no mercy to his victims. Just look at his eyes when you watch the movie. There's always this glint of evil just watching and waiting for innocent people to mess up with their lives so he can take advantage of them. I wish there was some more background on this character. I would have liked to see a movie about Angel Eyes's life.

And then, The Man With No Name, aka Blondie, aka The Good. Yet he is not all good. He works with outlaws, turning them in, and then saving them so he can turn them in again for the reward money. Pure brilliance, because it shows that even heros have bad sides to them. This was his. Yet, Blondie's character also showed compassion. Watch the scene near the end of the movie with the soldier. That's an excellent example of Blondie's good side. I loved Clint Eastwood's character. He played it flawlessly.

Each of these characters put together in a movie equal pure entertainment, and a look at the good, bad, and the ugly in everyone. Besides the characters, it gives great background into the American Civil War. This is my most favorite western in all time, and to pass it by is a serious mistake. Rent this movie today, and get ready to be amazed by the brilliance of this picture. Enjoy!

27 May 2020,Leone's Endlessly Rewatchable Masterpiece,"What's so delightfully enduring about this epic adventure is that every single sequence is so endlessly entertaining and carefully choreographed. It's hard to pick a favorite scene, for every rewatch there's a different one. Of course, the film's climax with the immortal 'Ecstasy of Gold' and the unbearable suspense of the last standoff are its most celebrated moments, and the two-and-a-half-hour journey to get there could easily be a drag. Only, it isn't.

The character introductions. Blondie and Tuco's chemistry and scheming. Angel Eyes' pursue for the cash box. A half-soldier. Tuco assembling his own gun. The desert sequence. Tuco and brother Ramirez. The POW camp. Digestive music. Wallace beating the crap out of Tuco. Blondie and Angel Eyes teaming up. Six men, six bullets. Bathtub scene. ""When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk."" The street shootout. The drunk Union Captain and the bridge. Sad Hill cemetery.

Those are some of the treats this classic has to offer, and I think it makes it one of the most rewatchable movies ever made. But what else is there to enjoy?

The soundtrack: Thinking of Sergio Leone is to think of Ennio Morricone, and this may be is magnum opus if you had to choose one. From the iconic whistling theme to the epic final standoff and the aforementioned 'The Ecstasy of Gold' (which if you've ever been to a Metallica concert, they always opens their shows with). But there are also the small bits between - trumpets, acoustic guitar and harmonica tunes breaths life to the backdrop that is the American Civil War (at least Leone's vision of it).

The cinematography: Shot in Spain, posing as the American Southwest, Italian cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli fills every frame with gorgeous composition and gritty detail. There are so many iconic shots that are burned into cinema history and for this rewatch I finally got to enjoy it on Blu-ray in hi-def.

Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo: As the title suggests, this story revolves around its characters. Lee Van Cleef as the villainous Angel Eyes is both cold and charismatic. Clint Eastwood as Blondie is the definition of cool. He always keeps his calm and doesn't speak unless he's got something badass to say. He also smokes cigar, has superhuman aim and he blows hats off people's heads. And there's Eli Wallach as Tuco - the unsung hero of this whole story. He's the shifty bandit you can't trust for a second. He's also got superhuman aim and I just love his swagger. He always makes me laugh, even when he's not talking, just his facial expressions cracks me up. He's also the character we get most backstory on, besides being the clown of the company, and you just can't help to feel sorry for him in the end. Perhaps my favorite character of all time. Those are the three mains which the story revolves around, but Leone had a talent for creating memorable minor roles as well - the alcoholic Union Captain in particular, who appears more than two hours into the film, heavily drunk and heavily dubbed, is downright hilarious.

The charm: It's about America, made by Italians, shot mainly in Spain. Apart from the three American leads, most of the dialogue is dubbed, as the rest of the cast were either Italian or Spanish. But it doesn't mean the performances are bad or that it feels out of place - no, it just further enriches the everlasting charm of the spaghetti western and Leone's cinematic world. It's also a very unrealistic film - with comedically accurate gunslingers, revolvers sounding like cannons and the whole 'historical' setting. I've always regarded it as a borderline fantasy film, and I love it for it. It is plain and simple movie magic.

Love it or hate it, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is undoubtably one of the most iconic films of all time and a big part of cinema history. For me, it's three hours of pure escapism and one of the most enduring adventures ever made for the big screen.",10

19 May 2018,No Best Picture nomination??!,"As a person ""of a certain age"", and a true movie buff, it is now startling to me that I managed to miss experiencing this gem until 2018. It is truly a masterpiece. And, as said ""movie buff"", am somewhat embarrassed to admit this ignorance. Stunning is not a cliché when applied to TGTBTU. And omg that classic, iconic score.

So, expecting to see a plethora of Oscar nominations/wins, was stunned to learn on IMDB that there was not even one of either! This compelled me to search Wikipedia to understand how this omission occurred. It became clear quickly. Simply put, 1967 was a big year for Hollywood. And the oscars were at that time limited to only 5 nominees per category. Best Pictures: ""In the Heat of the Night"", ""The Graduate"", ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" (all truly worthy of the honor), and ""Dr. Doolittle"".

Excuse me? ""Dr. Doolittle""??? Over THIS? Well, it was indeed the psychedelic 60's.

30 December 2011,The best most perfect movie there will be,"This movie is perfection... from the first frame to the fade out as Morricone's score plays it is art at its best.

The score is beautiful. The sets are incredible. The story is engaging. The cinematography is magnificent. The performances are incredible. All the characters are so simple, the audience make them complex by adding their own backgrounds/concepts to Angel Eyes, Tuco and Blondie. Eli Whallac steals the movie! In reality the movie is about Tuco, not about the villain or the good guy, this makes the movie feel fresh and unpredictable which adds to the amazing nerve wrecking climax.

This movie has been an inspiration to me. Sergio Leone is amazing! He directs with his soul.

21 May 2009,"So may attempts, but none is better than this.","I don't think there's any better western movie than this. The epic, magnificent ending for the Dollars trilogy by Sergio Leone is also the best film. You can find everything you can expect from a western movie: gun challenges, tricks, frauds, deserts, the hunt for treasure, bandits, all brilliantly directed by Leone. Action, irony, thrilling. Clint Eastwood is, as always, perfect as the ""man with no name"": mysterious, no past, no emotions, the only thing we know is that he wants money. Lee van Cleef is also great for his ""bad guy"" role, it fits him so very well that now I can't imagine him in a different role than Angel Eyes. But the best of the three is maybe Eli Wallach: his acting performance is simply impressive. This film gave us so many famous phrases that we keep using them even now. The scenes have a perfect synchronicity. And the music is a masterpiece by Ennio Morricone. If you want to make a culture about western movies, be sure to watch ""The good, the bad, the ugly"" for last, or else it would spoil the fun for the other movies.

25 December 2019,"Good Movie, but it's not perfect","I have to admit this is a good movie but since everyone is saying this is the best western ever made I feel obligated to point out why this is not.

1. It's way too long, 3 hours for crying out loud. The actual plot description only starts about 1 hour into the movie, so we spend one hour building the story, way too long.

2. The action scenes are here and there but I didn't feel immersed in the action until 2 hours into the movie, and even then there were unnecessary long shots.

3. I must admit that I haven't seen that many westerns (maybe 30 or so) but the best western I have ever seen is 3:10 to Yuma, by far better than this one.

20 February 2010,The Best Western movie. And the best acting crew.,"This is the my first western movie I have ever seen. This is also my first Clint Eastwood movie. It created such an impact on me that I started comparing every western movie with it. I did not watch any John Wayne movie. But for me Clint is the best Western actor for ever. After this movie I collected remaining of his Westerns and watched. I have watched nine of his Westerns. Every one of them is good. Then I could not stop of watching his other genres. skills. He just acts what the character needs in particular frame, not more than that nor less than that. I think this is the reason he did not get the Oscar even he nominated. Now he is proving his directions kills. The background music in this is a trademark. Many of our Indian directors still use this music as reference or directly into movies. I think Sergio Leone is one of the top directors from Italy.

26 May 2004,The high-water mark for Westerns...,"A fascinating saga of greed and revenge. Eastwood's Blondie isn't exactly heroic, or even redeemable, but he's the closest thing we get to a hero in a saga populated by wicked characters. I found it interesting how fortune and advantage keeps interchanging between the three title characters, until that legendary show-down at the film's climax. Also interesting is just how many great films came to be influenced by this so-called ""spaghetti"" western. Tarantino's KILL BILL films are one of the most recent and obvious examples. I also love how this film serves as a sort of prequel to Eastwood's haunted, retired gunslinger character in UNFORGIVEN.

23 January 2005,"Three guys,lots of gun fight, and we get the gold...............","This is what we call a movie !!!!!!! First time I saw it I couldn't get too much of it(a good 12 years back). But my uncle bought a set of western classics and it had this master piece,so thought of giving it another chance.This movie was made for one guy,TUCO a role of a life time and he did it to perfection. Nobody complains when Clint Eastwood is there in a movie.This movies shows why.Then Lee Van Cleef a legend in this genre proves why he needs to be in a western classic. The story is so complex with a civil war background, that it has to be seen to believed. DVD version promising the xtra scenes dint have anything new to offer but still its always a good purchase when you have a western with Eastwood.

11 May 2003,Disappointing end to a fine trilogy,"""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" is a curiously unsatisfying conclusion to Leone's memorable ""Man With No Name"" trilogy. For starters, it is hideously overlong. The sheer number of fights and battles puts it in the mold of a stinker like ""Star Trek: Nemesis."" The tedious Civil War subplot keeps resurfacing like an unwelcome guest; it is entirely unnecessary except as heavy-handed anti-war commentary. Even Morricone's musical score is greatly inferior to his earlier efforts: it's more like parody Morricone, with that irritating bird-call repeated so many times as to be almost unbearable.

For those who consider ""non-stop action"" to be an asset rather than a liability, please ignore everything I've said here; you'll join the millions who love this movie. But for anyone who started the trilogy with this bloated, gaudy fight-fest: Don't give up! The earlier films -- ""A Fistful of Dollars"" (""Yojimbo"" remake) and the very fine ""For a Few Dollars More"" -- are well worth seeing. Each movie stands alone; the only constant is The Man With No Name himself.

7 March 2019,it is a great western classic,"I enjoyed the tale of the three characters trying to catch each other by vengeance the entire movie. Since it is a movie from the 1960s, it is long and a bit slow paced for modern standards.

I recommend that you watch it 1.25x or 1.5x its speed to avoid being bored, but it is an awesome movie.

12 November 2016,"Quentin Tarantino's favorite movie, a masterpiece, describing the civil war in the U.S.","Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

21 September 2010,Deserved to appreciate,"Well to start off i'm not a vivid supporter of western movies. But after watching this movies i do believe that this is the kind of movie that is worth to watch. When i started to watch the movie, it was completely silence. I thought that i will feel bore after some time. But as time goes i got more and more interest.Once you start watching this movie you wont care about the length of this movie

All three characters played by lead roles are superb. The music in the background is class.

All the characters - good, bad, and ugly reveals that the way you behave, you will get the same in return.

19 November 2022,outstanding,"I usually do not watch westerns and when I do, I search for the so-called spaghetti westerns. But I have to say that this one is actually good. The word ""epic"" hardly ever describes the kind of thing that I like to watch, but this movie is epic, bearing in mind not only it's lengh and plot twists, but also the war scenario. This plot could easily be turned into a 10 chapter season of a western series. It seems that the ""dollar trilogy"" got better in the sequels, while me, as a viewer, believe that usually the prequels are better. Not here, indeed, the quality of the stuff seemed to get higher as time gone by.

25 January 2022,"There are two types of people, my friend - those who have a rope around their neck and those who shoot at it.","Of course, the picture of the master painting is done. It captures and engages in the action taking place on the screen. The film is interesting to revisit, discovering new moments. Of course, the final scene in the cemetery deserves special attention - the tension in which, thanks to the excellent combination of music and editing, reaches its maximum throughout the film.

The film was made in 1966 and after 43 years has not lost its relevance and probably will never lose it. After all, three types of people will never disappear in the world: good, bad and evil.

23 December 2003,There is nothing bad nor ugly about this gem!,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966/Sergio Leone) **** out of ****

There I was, sitting in this filthy theater, looking at my watch, waiting.... Then the lights dim, and that familiar theme song started. Everyone knows it, and has hummed it at least once. I'm talking about the classic theme to ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"". You might not remember it off hand, but you'd know it if you heard it. The screen lights up, and the movie has started. To me, this was the chance of a life time to see such a classic film on the big screen.

""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" is about three men searching for gold during the final days of the Civil War. The three men are of course the Good (Clint Eastwood as 'Blondie'), the Bad (Lee Van Cleef as 'Angel Eyes'), and the Ugly (Eli Wallach as 'Tuco'). Blondie and Tuco are two criminals who work together. When they have a falling out, Tuco tries to take revenge on Blondie, but instead, both men accidently find out where $200,000 in gold is buried. At the same time, Angel Eyes is also looking for the gold. Eventually, their paths meet at a POW camp, and that is where the real fun begins. ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" is a prequel to a ""A Fistfull of Dollars"" and ""For a Few Dollars More"". I have seen neither of them, so I can not judge which is the best of the trilogy.

""The Good..."" is probably one of the most entertaining films of all time. From beginning to end, I was glued to the screen, and it being on the big screen helped me enjoy it even more. Unlike Leone's later work, such as ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", this film isn't as slowly paced, and less poetic, but more enjoyable. Although, the Leone trademarks can be found throughout, such as the extreme close-ups, the amazing and famous score, and enough flies to feed a colony of frogs. The performances are amazing. Eastwood is ultra cool, Van Cleef makes a great bad guy, and Wallach is so funny, he steals the show! In fact, I was surprised by the sense of humor the film had. The funniest scene, in my opinion, was when Tuco is trying to read a letter left by Angel Eyes, and he reads it saying, "" 'See you soon, id..."" ""id..."" ""ids...' "", and Eastwood takes the letter and says, "" 'Idiots.' It's for you."" Maybe it's not as funny written down, but on the big screen, it is laugh-out-loud funny.

Another thing about this film that makes it different from Leone's other westerns, is that it just as much a war film as it is a western. It shows the hardships of war from both point of views, which is hard to find in a lot of conventional and mainstream war films.

The music is probably my favorite thing about the movie. It plays a powerful role in it. Take for instance the scene in which Tuco finds the graveyard that they have been looking for the whole time. He runs through it, looking for that certain grave containing the gold. If it weren't for the music, and Leone's amazing style, then this scene would be pretty standard. But the music sets the pacing of the film like a train that is slowly accelerating. As the music speeds up, Tuco speeds up. As the music becomes for powerful, Tuco becomes more eager and greedy. This is one of the great scenes of this great movie.

In the end, ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" isn't as artful or as operatic as Leone's later ""Once Upon a Time..."" films. Instead, it is much more enjoyable and humorous.

6 March 2002,A visual and aural feast,"""The good, the bad and the ugly"" was the third and final in the so called ""dollar"" trilogy, the others being ""A fistful of dollars"" and ""For a few dollars more"". Another Leone western ""Once upon a time in the west"" is often lumped together with these making up as fine a quartet of westerns as you'll ever see.

Ironically, I saw the trilogy in reverse order and, as good as they are, the first two could simply not live up to the expectations created by this sprawling, over the top masterpiece. No amount of thesaurus abuse could quite do justice to it. It's the ""Blood, sugar, sex, magik"" of film westerns, a massive work of art shattering any preconceptions you may have had of what and what does not constitute a western. It takes the genre by the scruff of the neck, shakes out all the cliches, and then adds layers and textures of pure style.

The storyline is not unfamiliar; three disparate characters, Blondie (this time Eastwood does have a nickname), Tuco and Angel Eyes are all after the same prize: $200,000 in gold. Tuco, played by Eli Wallach knows the place (a cemetery) while Blondie knows the name on the grave. Their epic search takes place during the American civil war. Leone takes the this simple story and creates a visual feast. There are many unforgettable scenes; my favourite being Wallach's frantic run through the cemetery. This ranks with the mimed tennis match in ""Blow up"" as amongst the most memorable I've seen. As stunning as they are this is not merely a succession of creatively photographed scenes. Leone has given his actors room for character development. Lee van Cleef is the personification of evil, a cold bloodied killer who briefly allies himself with Eastwood as a matter of expediency. Blondie is hardly your stereotypical hero. He is a fraudster, running a scam in which he pretends to capture wanted criminals, claims the bounty and then frees them. And yet he shows compassion; blowing up a bridge in order to grant a dying commander his final wish, offering a cigar to a dying soldier. And, finally there is Tuco, the ugly. As efficient a killer as any of the other protagonists he also injects a dose of humour into the film. Already responsible for the standout scene in the film, his confrontation with his brother, a priest, is a moment of sadness and power. In a way that is not explained this unholy trio are already inextricably linked before we first meet them and, as it turns out, are bound together in death as well.

Finally, as if Leone's direction is not enough there is the music of Ennio Morricone. It is unlike anything you will have heard in a western and adds a deft and unique aural touch.

A brilliant film which gets better with each viewing.",
28 November 2011,Excenllent!,"I saw this movie on Amazon Instant Video. This movie is excellent and its story has a lot of ups and downs, the movie also has the famous western movie star Clint Eastwood. So I was mesmerized by the movie and recommend others to appreciate it.

The movie has three leading roles which has different characters. The good person is called Blondie. The bad person is called Angel Eyes. The ugly person is called Tuco. The story happened during American Civil War, and developed gradually among the three western cowboys.

Along with the story developing, a man tells the ugly man that there has a huge government wealth worth $200,000. The man tells the region of secret wealth, and the region named Sad Hill Cemetery has thousands of graves. However, the man does not tell the ugly man what the name of the grave which conceals the wealth, but tells the good man. Thus, the good man and the ugly decide to find the wealth jointly. Meanwhile, the bad man who disguises as a Union soldier also begins to find the huge wealth, and the three people meet in battle coincidentally. Then, they against each other by fist and gun fight intensely. Finally, after a lot of fights, the good man and the ugly man find the way to Sad Hill Cemetery.

However, the way is blocked by the war between Union and Confederate, and the two forces fight constantly in order to occupy a bridge. Finally, the good man and the ugly man destroy the bridge by bombs. In the end, the bad man arrives in the region of secret wealth at the same time. The three cowboys decide to gun duel and the winner can get the wealth. Finally, the good man kills the bad man in the duel and releases the ugly man. The good man separate the wealth with the ugly man, and the good man leaves the ugly man in the desert. The final scene is that the good man rides his horse and disappears in the distance.

The movie uses third person view to describe the fantastic story. The story depicts three different people deeply. They have different dispositions and distinguish each other brightly. The movie has a strong western atmosphere. For example, the whole story develops in the desert, and this is the typical character of the west of America. The three people have classic cowboy's appearance and trait. They have cowboy wear, especially the classic hat. They have a cool handgun and good gun skill. So they can hit a thin rope from a long distance. They judge other people with narrow eyes.

This movie is different with former western movies. People do not divide to good or bad clearly. There is no a totally good person or a totally bad person. The good man also wants to gain the wealth and more money by fighting with others. The ugly man can be touched by some sorrowful things and help others by his own way. All people have two sides, good and bad. This idea in the movie causes big change in future western stories and movies. This movie also uses huge scenes to describe the most destructive of wars. Hundred thousand people die in the war and their bodies fall apart on the desert. This is a big satire of three people shuttle between two armies just in order to find the secret wealth. The movie also uses fierce gun fight to make the story ups and downs. For example, in the end, three people duel each other. They stare each other last 5 minutes and no one open the fire without careful thought. This scene makes audiences feel nervous and exciting.

Personally, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is a very legendary movie and shakes me a lot. Thus, I saw the movie 3 times and think it is very wonderful. This movie not only is a lot of intense gun fight, but also reflects people's inner thoughts vividly. The three people have the same purpose but have different characters, so there are a lot of conflicts in the story. In the whole story, many scenes impress me a lot. For example, a command of Union is wounded in the war and will die soon. After the good man and the ugly man destroy the bridge between two armies, the command smiles and dies in happy. This sorrowful fragment reveals that people do not want to battle in war and they want to pursue peace. Another scene is that before the good man and the ugly man arrive in the destination, the good man meets a nearly dead soldier of Confederate. The good man puts his clothes on the soldier's body and gives his cigar to the soldier. The soldier smokes the final cigar and dies. This story tells us how the cruel is in the war.

The movie also reflects the spirit of the Wild West. Like in the course book, the three cowboys are strong and do things without the law. They kill people cold and unconcerned. They are individual in most of time and there is no woman to accomplish them. They solve problems by dangerous fight or duel and do things what they want to. They are uncontrolled and use unscrupulous divisive tactics. They pursue the material wealth and have can-do spirit.

I love this movie is also because of its wonderful music. In intense gun fight, the music is strong and curse. In sorrowful environment, the music is slow and emotionally. Especially before the end of movie, the ugly man run between thousands of graves to find the right name of the grave which conceals the wealth. The music describe the situation coordinately and becomes classic until today.

You cannot miss this excellent movie, despite the language in the movie is Italian, but this does not block you to understand the story.",10
1 June 2006,HolyTrinity,"Legendar cult movie!Best of Sergio Leone and probably best Western ever! Idealy drawing triangle of three main characters with Gold-or-Death in the center of those composition.All long-form scenes of duels photographed like vision of mysterious devotion.But war is shown in that movie like nonsensical meat grinder .Very dramatic music of Ennio Morricone.Perfect acting of Eli Wallach,Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef .Vivid scenario twists and incredible dialog.Cinematography is good as its possible.Edition with surgical accuracy.If you like Westerns and don't look this film - find it immediately - Dead or Alive!

12 March 2013,"Can you say, boring?","I decided to watch this movie based on the great reviews it received. Unfortunate for me, it was a complete waste of time. I came into the movie knowing it was long, but was told it was worth it. That statement caused me to waste 3 hours of my life. Anyway, on to the reasons why it was a waste. The movie itself had a decent storyline. The problem with this movie, however, was that it is the longest, drawn out movie known to mankind. This movie could have been played out in literally 20 minutes based on what all happened in the movie. Instead, viewers get to wait 30 minutes while it shows Clint Eastwood crawl 20 feet through the sand not saying a word. Against my better judgment, I continue watching, waiting for something spectacular to happen in the end. As the end approaches, viewers get to wait through yet another drawn out scene, of 3 men standing in a triangle pointing guns at each other. After, 10 minutes of watching that, I lost interest of who was going to die anyway. It literally switches cameras more times than I can count. Then, the finale comes. That is when I comprehend just how much time had been lost in this movie. I am writing this review as a friendly favor to warn you of this lame excuse of a movie, because no one was there to warn me.",1
19 October 2001,Like Unearthing King Tut's Tomb,"This is one lowbrow film. It has a strong air of tight budgets, underpaid extras, and general disorder a la your typical B movie.

Yet, this production ends up a masterpiece whose cracks enhance it, a classic painting whose poor condition makes it more appreciated.

Wallach, the lone ""known"" actor at the time, has no airs. He just comes across as your typical self-centered individual who learns something from his fellow humans.

Eastwood is Eastwood. Quiet, unassuming, intense beyond human limits. An amazing performance.

Van Cleef is evil and debonair.

Perhaps the most chilling presentation comes from Mario Brega. This Italian character actor makes you really think that he's about to gouge a man's eyes out. The difference between this cinematic triumph being made then and now is that now, they'd probably show him doing so in gory detail. Implication is everything.

Forget the jet trail, the pickup, and the other low budget goofs. Just lose yourself in a great movie.",9

28 May 2003,"Good, Bad, Ugly but too long","No doubt, visually, every shot Sergio Leone uses in this film is like a portrait. Pause this movie anywhere and you'll see for yourself.

Eastwood is supercool, as well as Lee Van Cleef. Eli Wallach is a dustball bandit, but no less evil than the other two.

Visually this film works. The score is great, and eventhough it's repeated ad-nauseum, it still doesn't get annoying because of it's purpose, which is to punctuate the tremendous characters and their actions.

The best is the way that Leone tells the story almost completely through visuals. The dialogue is fresh and badass. All these seedy characters need each other, yet they don't realize it until the end.

Unnecessary Civil War subplot that drags this one out way past what it should be. Personal opinion. Well worth the hype however. A must see for anyone who takes films seriously and still likes to have fun watching them",
7 February 2005,One of the greatest westerns of all time!,"Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly elevates the ""western"" to a level of art that I don't think John Ford could have even predicted. Not to take anything away from John Ford, but Leone brought a style to audiences in his ""spaghetti westerns"" that no one else could have thought possible. He stays true to the rugged, gritty feel of American westerns, but his obvious inspiration from Kurosawa's samurai films, and Leone's own personal style come together in a fascinating way that I feel is too individualistic for anyone else to have created. The characters in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly seem so alive, so rich and developed. It all seems so real that watching this can make you feel like you have stumbled upon another world, and certainly, another way of life, that has been going on forever, and will continue on long after you have left. Clint Eastwood's iconic performance as Blondie is brilliant. His unflinching confidence in every move he makes tells you right away that this is not a man to be trifled with. He never cracks under pressure, and he seems to have such a tight grasp of every situation that one would be a fool NOT to side with him. Blondie is every bit as cool, calm, and collected as Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon, and also every bit as rewarding to watch! Lee Van Cleef is menacing as Angel Eyes, a bounty hunter who gives the impression that he never met a man who could come close to making him feel threatened. Then, there is Tuco, played by Eli Wallach. Tuco, as dastardly as he is, serves as the comic relief, which is important in a film like this that is filled with tension (the montage in the cemetery is classic!). This movie has action, suspense, drama, and humor, all of which are flavored with Ennio Morricone's famous score and the brilliant cinematography of Tonino Delli Colli. I have not seen enough of Leone's films to say that this is his best, but I can say that this is an excellent film, worthy of all of the praise it has received since its release!",9
14 September 2015,"The Good, The Savage, and the Ugly","I'm not going to add much to the very long list of reviews on this one, except to point out that I've never seen anyone critique the title. ""Bruto"" is not ""bad"". It's more ""animalistic"", literally ""brute"". So, I think ""savage"" is the best match. It's MUCH better than ""bad"". I know this genre has many titles and they seldom translate directly, but Sergio Leone's were always literally translated, so I think it's an issue.

I'll also add that for purists of the ""every Marxist on the block in Rome in the mid '60s wanted to make a Western""- particularly the Zapatista sub-genre of this filone, this is not the best. It's solidly in the top 10 and most of our top 5, but those that put it at #1 usually don't rate the political content as highly as the style.

I rated it a 9- it has plenty of political content and true pasta western themes. I have nothing against it, and do really enjoy it. But not as much as Companeros. It's a statement, but not like The Great Silence. Good character development, but not like The Big Gundown.

The trilogy is, without doubt, though, about the most important movies ever made. That's history, not opinion. When people diss the hundreds that came in the following years they seldom note that at least 50 of those are pretty good, not ones you'd want to live without seeing, and none of them would exist without these three.

So, could we at least refer to it accurately?",9

16 January 2005,A Classic That is The Greatest Spaghetti Western of All Time,"""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" not only is a classic, the greatest spaghetti Western of all time (edging out Sergio Leone's own ""For a Few Dollars More"" (1965), but is remains a remarkable cultural artifact, one of the watershed films of the 1960s. The combination of violence, amorality and black humor set the tone for a generation of films to come, a pedigree shared with the Sean Connery James Bond films.

Eli Wallach is outstanding ""in the role of Tuco."" In fact, it could be argued that this is really his film, as he is on screen longer than Clint Eastwood. Wallach's Tuco is one of the great screen performances, in all its vital, overblown vulgarity (and as we can see with the best performances of Laurence Olivier and Marlon Brando, genius in acting often skirts the boundaries of vulgarity). A brilliant performance in a brilliant film. Aside from Leone's outstanding direction, Wallach is the engine that drives this masterpiece down the rails into cinematic immortality!

Eastwood is Eastwood The Icon, the great star of the post-John Wayne era. Clint's interactions with Wallach's Tuco are wonderful. Lee Van Cleef makes an outstanding villain as Angel Eyes.

Not to be missed by any student of the cinema! Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography is a text book example of how to shoot a widescreen film, equal to the great Academy Award-winning work of Jack Hildyard and Freddie Young in David Lean's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957) and ""Lawrence of Arabia (1962), respectively.",10
15 January 1999,you have to see it,"After a fistful of dollars and a few dollars more Sergio Leone made a great movie (again).The music by Ennio Morricone is better than every music I know. Short - if you like westerns you will love this movie.

28 December 2021,for,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

29 November 2000,Clint Eastwood's Signature Movie!!,"This film deserves four stars. Not because it is the quintessential ""guy"" movie, with lots of action and shooting. Nor because it is the greatest western ever made. There have been better.

The reason this film deserves the highest praise is because of the in- vention of a character that has defined Clint Eastwood's career. That character is The Man with No Name. In fact, it really isn't true to say

that this movie invented the character. The Man with No Name can

be found in every good western tale. His influence transcends even

the western genre. There is something metaphysical about his

presence, as though he were God or the devil incarnate. This is the

reason for the character's sublime power to command our attention. Clint Eastwood is perfect for this role and he has played it again and again.

The Man with No Name is everything any man could want to be. In this liberated age, he is quite possibly everything any woman could want

to be, either. He is a flawless or virtually flawless character by virtue

of the divine mission with which he's been entrusted. He is an agent

of metaphysical justice. He has superhuman power: precise, pene- trating judgement, nerves of steel and an iron will. He is calm, cool and always in control under pressure. He is never frightened and he

can endure anything. If an ordinary man had these strengths, he would never be disappointed in life.

Fans of the ""Dirty Harry"" movies as well as nearly all of Eastwood's

other work will recognize that those characters simply reprise The Man with No Name which made him famous. He has built his career on it!

The musical score of this movie only adds to the metaphysical exact- ness of the characterization. To this day, I cannot hear the music from

""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" without thinking of the carnage of

the U.S. Civil War. Conversely, when I see still photographs of battles from that war, the music and cinematography from this movie come to mind.

""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" is a superlative achievement. Like

""Star Wars"" and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" it has an atmosphere

about it which could not be equalled in a thousand meticulous sequels. It stands on its own as an enduring, defining mark in the history of

motion pictures.",

28 November 2020,Wildly entertaining,"This is a film that was made with 5 dollars and a piece of toast. Low budget and seemingly on the tail end of the genre, it's a miracle that this film was even finished. But more than that - it's great. The plot is well paced and generally easy to follow. The performances by the leads are very solid. The score is absolutely magical. And most of all, the writing is surprisingly very smart. The characters are very believable, and even the 'good' character is not all that good considering he is a bandit. The film takes you all over the american south west and it's full of tension and excitement. Big kudos for a well done plot.

However, there are pretty large issues with the film. Firstly. you will notice from the start the horrible dubbing on dialogue. This is a relic of the time and a result of the non existent budget on the film. The mixing on the film isn't great. There are some plot...problems. They aren't quite plot holes, but there are issues with shot selection and plot points that make the entire film a bit less believable. Beyond these, I'm not sure it can get much better than it is.

At the top of its genre, The good, the bad, and the ugly stands as the model of a true western",8
26 June 2021,This Movie made me Love the Westerns.,"I can't understand why this movie has zero Oscar nomination. This movie simply threw away the Oscars.

Westerns are more likely dead in this era. When I saw this movie, the action, Iconic characters, the time period of the story and Director Sergio Leone's ground-breaking direction makes this movie Unforgettable and 'The Man with No Name' makes this movie an absolute cinematic landmark.

Surely the best western of All Time.

21 March 2022,Dollars trilogy,"A fistful of dollars, for a few dollars more & finally the good, the bad & the ugly portrays the story of a lone bounty hunter (clint eastwood) who kills the convicts for the declared rewards... Inspite of his rough outlook & cynical eyes it's quite difficult to assume that he has a heart of gold. Which makes the movie series quite distinguished from other texas films. And moreover the comical sequences makes the film more palatable.

17 April 2018,One of the all-time best.,"The first thing that you note is the exceptional audio. It instantly draws you in. Let aside everything else that is remarkable about this film, the distinctive and powerful soundtrack that is repeated throughout the movie has survived the test of time and has become a signature of the western and the stand-off.

The plot is simple enough, the characters are strong and molded by the times they live in. The action at times feel a bit exaggerated. The standoff at the end is truly one of a kind. Also, now i know from where 'the hero rides into the sunset' concept comes from. Roger Ebert has brilliantly put into words the greatness of this film. The performances of all three actors are unique and help you to instantly build a person out of it.

One of the all-time best.

23 February 2000,No one will ever be as cool as Clint!,"What can I say. This is my favorite movie of all time. There is no contest. I still remember the first time I saw this masterpiece. I was about 15 years old, and it was on TV one night. I sat down ready to watch, and then there where a technical problem, and a 10 minute delay. But I stayed up and waited, and that was my luck. Because the music, the pictures, the slow pace, the Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Sergio Leone's direction and the fantastic story just swept my of my feet.

I usually say that the Shawshank Redemption is the best movie made in the last 20 years. There are several people who will agree with me on that. Luckily that doesn't conflict with my firm belief, that there will never come a movie that can compete with this one. I know many will agree on this, but certainly not as many as with the Redemption.

There is nothing wrong with this movie. Everyone is cool, Snake Eyes is evil, and the whole thing is wound perfectly together under Leone's direction with the fantastic music by Ennio Morricone.

The only reason that I haven't written a comment before, is that I was sure that I would never be able to write good enough to express the way I feel for this fantastic movie. I'm still sure that I can't, but now I gave it a try.

I hope that they one day will show it in a cinema close by, so I can get the ultimate experience. Because this movie was supposed to be watched at the big screen, and I long for once again to hear the Ugly's final scream turn into the first tone of the main theme, and just let the music take me away...

(And I actually did get that chance some years later, which is by now some years ago! It was everybit as great as I could have hoped :-)",10
20 January 2002,The greatest Western ever!,"I have been watching this movie ever since I can remember. I grew up watching Clint Eastwood Westerns on local UHF channels back in the early 80s. This movie, though, is a masterpiece. All of the characters are great, the music is outstanding, and the cinematography is great. The showdown at the end of the movie was great. And when Tuco is running around the cemetery looking for Arch Stanton's grave. Three ruthless characters in race to find a buried treasure. Buy this movie and buy the sound track! I managed to find the sound track at a local record store and it's on vinyl!!

28 March 2003,The greatest Western every made,"The good the bad and the ugly is in my opinion the greatest Western ever made and is the third part of the greatest trilogy ever made. That being ""The Man with No Name"" trilogy.

Here we have three strong characters surviving for themselves and for survival sakes. They go through a common search for confederate gold. While they are doing this, all around them the world is going insane in one of the most brutal and bloodiest wars every. We are talking about the Civil War of course. Who are the Characters. They are the characters of the title of course;

The Good - Clint Eastwood. A hired mercenary, who is tired of playing by the rules, because there are none. He kills other mercenaries, for the express intent of stealing their human bounty. He, like the other two goes through the film trying to get his hands on stolen confederate gold for the express purpose of personnel wealth. Yet he is good, because, like in the previous two films of the trilogy he has a conscience, and at times cares about his victims and at times makes decisions to have mercy. To me he represents God. He is silent and gives out vengeance like god. He is also merciful.

The Bad - Lee Van Cleef. In a role completely cut off from his role in #2 of the series (For a few dollars more). He has the same purpose as the Good, but he has no morals at all. He has no pity, and enjoys his acts of giving pain to others. He represents the Devil. He is even called angel eyes. Remember the Satan is a fallen angel?

The ugly - Eli Wallach. In his greatest role. Also goes through the film with the same purpose as the others. He is a thief and cold blooded killer. He has little pity and even less conscience. But he does not play out his actions out of joy, but rather for plain survival. Killing and stealing is all he knows, and he is played with and used in turn by both The Good (god) and the Bad (Satan). He represents the common man. This is also the reason that he is the most compelling character in the film.

It is true that what I have said up to know sounds allegoric and surreal. But the beauty and greatness of this film, is that it is all done in the telling of a wonderful adventure full of action, humor and music. The great Marcone has composed his greatest score. Leone has directed a masterpiece. There are so many great and wonderful scenes here.

The arrival of the white chariot like angels from heaven in the desert, which come to save our hero. The singing of the hymn while the ugly gets tortured. (Here there is a parable to the Holocaust. The moving through the bombed out town in a gunfight duel of hidden beauty. The blowing of the bridge while the army captain dies in bliss. The giving of the Cigar (symbol of friendship and god), to the dying soldier child. The running through the cemetery in blurred frenzy that gives the feelings of the sadness of all the young deaths of war (The Vietnam war was going on at the time and greatly influenced Leone).

This movie is serious art film disguised as an action adventure.

It is pure delight and one of the very greatest films ever made.",
29 November 1999,Fabulous,"Some films must be seen on the big screen to be appreciated. THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY is a big film, maybe best left to big-screen viewing. Nevertheless, there is much to be said in a video rental. The characters might seem to be cardboard cutouts on the surface, but upon close inspection, the viewer sees amazing subtlety. The cinematography is every bit as good as anything produced out of Hollywood, and the Italian locations sure look a lot like the American southwest. Morricone's music may be the finest of the entire western genre. Leone's debt to Kurosawa is obvious here, but his inventive use of close-up and cut-away to build tension in this film may be unparalleled in the history of cinema.

3 January 2000,Epic western at its best,"I have no doubt that purists would rank The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (GB&U) quite a way down in their list of the greatest westerns, but I consider this film easily to be in the top five, if not the top three. I don't know the genre well enough to say if GB&U was genuinely ground-breaking in its approach to the tried-and-true classic, but I am always impressed by its panache, its bravado, its earthy atmosphere, its interesting camera shots, its top-notch soundtrack, and the chemistry of its stars.

One of the things that distinguishes GB&U from other westerns for me is the quest model that the film follows. After developing the characters played by Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach, the film brings them together into a series of adventures (mostly misadventures) that tie together into a larger quest. The result makes the viewer feel that the he has been pulled into a larger-than-life tale of epic proportions, and yet the less glorified reality of GB&U is that of three men of varying levels of disreputability vying against one another for a fortune in gold coins.

Although I'm sure that GB&U didn't introduce moral ambiguity into the western, it does so both successfully and memorably. The central characters are all anti-heroes, the plot revolves around a fairly base motivation (i.e., greed), and the backdrop of the Civil War provides director Sergio Leone with an opportunity to expose the inhumanity and hypocrisy of war. Truth, justice, and glory are not held up as eternal values in this film, yet GB&U nevertheless shows how even morally ambiguous characters set within an amoral environment can still carve out an occasional bit of humanity or simple decency in spite of themselves.

I've seen GB&U probably at least a dozen times, and each time I'm pulled in as completely as I was the last. Simply put, it is a very good western--well worth the three hours of viewing time.",10
2 February 2007,"The Good, the Bad the Ugly","This is certainly one of the most over rated movies of all time- I just saw it again-not lousy, but pretty boring How many hours can you spend looking at close ups of faces-eyes squinting? It just drags- No plot development, just a bunch of gimmicks Hey- How does Lee VanC suddenly become a Sargent in the Union Army? ETC !!! The music is a bit better than a 30's John Wayne epic but certainly not great- Leone did some good stuff later-but he used the faults of this thing to learn and correct himself- Clint E was in a interview about the movie before it was shown(on TMC) He was a older than in the movie, but a lot younger than we know him now He said Leone taught & showed him many skills-it shows!

So see it, but don't expect that much

17 October 2010,"The Good, The Bad, and the Overrated","I have no problem with saying that The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is the most overrated western of all time. I'm not trying to say the movie is bad but it ultimately fails in comparison to Fistfull of Dollars. First of all this movie is way too long. About 3 hours long which is way too long for a movie such as this. The story is basically about three guys who are seeking confederate gold hidden in a cemetery. The story is simple but also effective. But for such a simple story why would the movie be so long and drawn out? Scenes seem to take forever to progress forward. Another thing is that Lee Van Cleef is scarcely shown on screen which just leaves Eli and Eastwood on screen most of the time. The music is spectacular. Ennio Morricone has some of the greatest western scores ever composed on the silver screen. Honestly the themes are too epic for the movie to handle. The final duel in the cemetery is nothing short of amazing but the battle ends poorly. I was waiting for Leone to pull a trick out of his sleeve for this final duel like in Fistfull of Dollars but instead he just decided to make it standard. If you have three hours to blow then definitely check it out or just skip to the end of the movie because the build up in the duel is so effin' epic!!",10
23 August 2020,Best Movies,"Well of course this movie wasn't a masterpiece Because somewhere I losed my interest due to it's length . But this movie is one time watch . Yes this movie is boring because of it's extra 1 hour lots of twist and turns were also there in the movie. No nudity , No sexual scene is there in the movie except some violence and strong language.

19 October 2018,terrific film,"I would rate this film higher, but I found the pacing in the first half to be very slow. But the second half is terrific, making the wait more than worthwhile.

It is outrageous that Ennio Morricone was not nominated for an Oscar for his musical score. His scoring for this film is brilliant. This film is the best I have ever seen for its use of music to communicate a mood.

10 May 2021,The Best Western,"While this movie may be a marathon the journey is worth it, just as the characters go on this journey as well. In my opinion this is by far the best western out there and is that a surprise since this a masterpiece from the great spaghetti western director Sergio Leone. This adventure movie is able to address so many different conflicts throughout its run time. These conflicts include; family struggles, friendship, and the struggle of soldiers during the war. This movie also has my favorite soundtrack in it, composed by Ennio Morricone. The songs in this movie add to the beauty of some scenes and are definitely recognizable. With plenty of twists and turns along the way, synonymous with the directing style of Sergio Leone, you will be interested through out. This is another must watch for me as it is truly one of the classics.

To cut it to the quick, since I was a child watching this film on TV with my dad I have been engrossed in what I consider the ultimate example of cinema. My enjoyment as a child has turned to rapture as an adult. Never again will a movie capture so much, so well. I get the willies every time I boot-up my DVD and hear that beautiful music by Morricone. A classic that transcends all film before, or since. 11/10!

5 March 2004,A truly classic and amazing western.,"This one was the first movie I saw by my now favorite director Sergio Leone. It's one of those films you'll remember forever.

Eli Wallach is simply astounding as Tuco, a character which you both love and hate. Eastwood is in his prime as the avenger and Van Cleef gives one of the chilliest performances in western movies as Sentenza.

Morricone did some of his finest work on this very movie. The main tune is one that sticks in your brain like a tar-drenched dart. It's almost impossible not to whistle it after seeing the movie.

The camera work by Tonino Delli Colli is a treat for the eye. From the high mountains to the railways. Everything oozes hot, sweaty western atmosphere (though it's filmed in Spain.

The gunfights are really impressive. And there's lots of them too. The moment which I rate as number one in any movie, is the grande finale of this one, I'm not going to spoil for you unlucky few who have yet to see this movie but I can promise you all that it won't let you down.

You might think that this must be impossible to better, but Leone actually topped it with the even greater ""Once upon a time in the west"", which, by the way, is my favorite movie. I may not rate this movie as high as ""...West"" but this is more entertaining while ""...West"" is more slowpaced and dramatic. So if you want action, then this is a better choice.

Basically; you can't call yourself a western fan if you haven't seen this one.

30 April 2014,Epic Western,"I loved this movie from the opening credits on. The plot was captivating, the characters larger than life, and the music was stunning.I wasn't aware of the term ""spaghetti western"" when I first saw it, but I did notice certain things that stood out, such as the use of wine instead of liquor in a certain scene, and the not quite sync of the actors lips as they spoke. I was touched by the horror of war and the emotion displayed by the characters. I too, felt like shedding a tear at a certain point. It brought home the grittiness, bloodiness and tragedy of the Civil War, not to mention a wry sense of humor timed perfectly, yet maturely. I felt a sense of shifting gears between this style of western and the westerns my parents grew up on, such as the John Wayne, or Audie Murphy styles. This was a great film.

15 March 2020,Eli Wallach,"This is Eli Wallach's film all the way. His portrayal of Tuco is perfect, and drives the entire film. Lee van Cleef does an excellent job, too, though in his case it's as much thanks to physiognomy as acting. Of the three title characters, Clint Eastwood's is by far the least interesting. Eastwood is also the weakest actor by a mile. The first half of the film is really very good. The dubbing is a tad distracting, but you get used to it after a bit. The second half, from the moment the kitsch, totally anachronistic and overly sentimental music comes on -- made even worse by the fact that we're supposed to believe it's a bunch of ragged POWs playing it -- the entire thing starts to derail. The story begins to drag slightly, and the film feels bloated.

7 April 2014,Seen it countless time...never grows old,"What can I say about this magnificent epic film that hasn't already been written or spoken? Saw this first as a teenager in the 1970s and was glued to the TV along with my two brothers. Great story, acting, scenery, and the score is fantastic. Clint Eastwood plays the Man with No Name who along with Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach hunt for a stolen cash box filled with gold coins buried in a cemetery during the American Civil War. They each know only one part of where the gold is buried so they have to keep each other alive despite the fact they want to kill each other. This 3 hour movie moves along gracefully and never gets boring. The final cemetery scene and standoff between the three main characters is riveting. Once again the score is unforgettable. Yes I have seen this film countless times and love every minute of it. Not only a great western but one of the best films ever made!! Bravo Sergio Leone!

1 June 2004,Genius,"There's not much that I can say about The Good, the Bad and the Ugly that hasn't already been said. It's simply one of the best films ever made.

I caught this all-time classic in a real theater for the first time ever earlier tonight. Ironically, the previous movie I've seen was Costner's poor Open Range, which compared to GBU shrinks to total and absolute irrelevance.

GBU has no weaknesses. It has everything: action, humor, a great (if simple) story, some very sharp social commentary, an absolutely fantastic musical score and brilliant acting.

There are extremely few films that are better than this. It's a must see, not just for western fans, but for everyone who's serious about cinema.

Sergio is an underrated director...He is up there with the best. See the scene with the baddies that sneak up on Clint in the motel...Hitch had to be jealous when he saw this.

Eli Wallach is terrific in a career best performance.

The shoot out is certainly one of the best scenes ever...It deserves as much praise as Sergei Eisensteins ""stair""sequence...

15 September 2002,Speechless,"The Good

I just saw this film yesterday on DVD. Bought it from a store while looking for Django. I wasn't disappointed. From the promising begining, to Ennio Morriconne's powrerful score, to the brilliant climax, this film will always be one of my favorites.

The Bad

There are some things in the plot I don't quite understand. Have Blondie, Tuco and Angel Eyes met before? In the scene just before where Tuco was about to be hanged, Angel Eyes sort of knew about Tuco's guardian angel. That point was made clear in the prisoner camp where Tuco and Blondie recognize Angel Eyes in the Blue. Of course in the interrogation scene, one could surmise that Tuco and Angel eyes went way back. If they've met before, how? And how did angel eyes get to be a Union sergeant all of a sudden? Is it possible that the 161 min version that I saw wasn't complete?

The Ugly

That being said, all of you must know by now that this movie is not for everybody. There are two kinds of people in this world: those that love ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, and those who hate it. I love it for what it is. But not for what it was trying to be. It's obvious that Sergio Leonne wanted to make a statement by turning the last part of his trilogy into a civil war epic. I can't help but find that a little forced.

BTW,

I recognized the one-armed-gunfighter as the guy we see at the VERY BEGINNING of the movie. It seems he lost his arm in his encounter with Tuco. At the bathtub scene, one-arm says he's been looking for Tuco for 8 MONTHS! Now I get it! I've heard that the original version went longer than 161 mins.....now if we can only figure out what happened to the remaining 345,439 mins left at the cutting room floor, we would finally figure out how angel eyes became a Union sergeant!",
15 February 2001,"""Blondie! You know what you are?...""","This is a very entertaining movie. I enjoyed it in a theatre and at various times on TV over the past 30 years.

Eli Wallach should have received some kind of reward for his part.

This movie established Clint Eastwood as a big time star and even bolstered Lee Van Cleef's career for a few more years.

23 May 2001,The best western ever made,"I would say that this along with 'Once upon a time in the west' are all you could ask for in a Western film. I could honestly watch this film every day for the rest of my days and not get tired of it. The last sequence when Tuco is running through the graveyard is near enough perfection. The desperation, the greed and the impatience all backed up with a spine tingling score by Morricone. Superb. Leone and Morricone were the film industries equivalent of Lennon and McCartney.......genius's in their own right, but together..........awesome!!!

4 September 2003,It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This,"The greatest Western of all time, and most enjoyable movie I've ever seen. Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach are such a great duo. Eastwood is aloof and laid back while Wallach is emotional and over-the-top. This led to so many classic scenes and one-liners. For example, in the graveyard Tuco is frantically digging with his hands to get to the gold. Then Eastwood appears, tosses a shovel at Tuco, and calmly says ""It'll be a lot easier with that.""

Lee Van Cleef plays the villian as well as it can be played. His introduction with the three murders and his ""When I'm paid, I always see the job through"" line was classic.

The use of the civil war was brilliant. The Civil War was by far the most disastrous and devastating time in American history, but to Tuco, Blondie, and Angel Eyes it's just something to exploit and use to their advantage in pursuit of gold. The movie also made a nice anti-war statement without going overboard.

The soundtrack is the best in cinema history. The opening theme immediately established that the movie was going to be something special. The theme and variations of it greatly added to the movie. Ecstasy of Gold is an absolute masterpiece, perfectly capturing Tuco's manic exhilaration at finally getting to the graveyard. The sad and laidback music during the war perfectly fit the scenes. The climatic gunfight could have never been pulled off without it's dramatic and perfected arranged music.

There were hardly any women and no romance in the movie. That greatly added to the toughness and grittiness of the film. Blondie, Tuco, and Angel Eyes had no emotional dependacy on anyone, which is one of the main reasons why all three characters were so fantastic. 10/10",10
17 January 2022,"The Good, The Bad, And the Ugly - The Greatest Western","An all time classic Western that holds up fantastically all these years later. Amazing direction, scale and shear badassery make this one of, if not the best ever made. Strong Recommend.

There is no doubt that this movie was way ahead of its time and the direction and acting of this movie is great. But for a 21st century viewer who watches Netflix and other streaming sites regularly, the movie is not that great.

3 December 2018,The Best Western ever,"Sergio Leone's masterpiece does not age, probably one of the best films ever, I never tire of it and any of Leone's work. Third outing with Clint Eastwood joined again by Lee Van Cleef, and this time by Eli Walach as Tuco. Three bandits, search for hidden cache of coins in a cemetery in the middle of the Civil war, but the story has greater depth, with cinamatography that still looks fresh.

10 May 2014,pure cinema,"As an eleven year old I recognized that GBU was or is unique. However, I wasn't quite sure why. The movie certainly seemed too brawny, too epic for NBC's Saturday Night at the Movies. At the time I didn't realize this was my first exposure to the fabled Italian cinema(with the actor's lips not always in sync to the dialog!) The first chance I got I sought this out on the big screen. It doesn't take long to realize that it's a masterwork and some of the purist cinema ever produced. It's the perfect blend of widescreen mise-en-scene, sight gags and genre ""revisioning."" Is that even a word? Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cliff, their faces never looked so menacing and beautiful.

28 January 1999,THE BEST WESTERN...EVER!,"It is impossible to explain just how good this movie is without having you see it. On the face of things this movie should have been a disaster. Made by Italians, filmed in Spain and with only two of the cast members speaking English. In addition this movie has more historical and geographical errors than a Monty Python film. The plot is meant to take place in the South but the landscape is sheer desert (with sand dunes and all) and the weapons are completely from another era. But, despite all this, this is by far the best Western ever as well as having the best opening and closing scenes of any movie I have ever seen in my life. Absolutely brilliant!

18 December 2005,A gem in any genre,"This movie is flawless. I mean if you ignore the unsynchronized audio because half the people are speaking Italian and the English was overdubbed. And if you listen to it in Italian it still sounds overdubbed. what can you do? Other than that, this is a brilliant piece of work. The technique used here is called DIRECTING. it is a lost art that has been replaced by EDITING. The difference can be seen by comparing the two minutes uncut scenes in this film with the three second splice-o-rama flicks seen today. Guess what, to be a good director you might have to think ahead thirty seconds. imagine that! I watched this today and it put to shame every movie I've seen in the last ten years. when you have a movie where no one speaks and the camera angle doesn't change for 90 seconds yet you are completely riveted to the screen, then you have made something worth watching. I'm glad they don't make movies like this anymore because that makes ""the good the bad and the ugly"" utterly priceless. the directing is perfect.

17 February 1999,"The Good, The Very Good and The Excellent","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is without doubt one of the finest films ever made. No matter what your taste in films is you will love this one. This is the only film that you can watch at any time without becoming bored or tired. I myself at one stage watched this film once every night for a week, still hooked on it on the seventh night. No other film has that attraction. I don't know much about camera angles, etc., but I always admire the end scenes from where Tuco rolls over and hits the headstone to where Blondie rides off with the music playing, (especially the dramatic scene where Tuco runs desparately around in circles trying to find Arch Stanton's grave; the music is perfect). All of the characters play their parts and really do convince as the Good, the Bad and the Ugly. One hell of a film.

First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest.

17 December 2004,"Highly enjoyable, great fun and an all round great film","My dad, an acclaimed John Wayne fan has been preaching to me for many years on the magic of John Wayne films. Personally I have never really gotten into the 'Westerns' finding them all a bit boring.

However, upon watched the good the bad and the ugly, my opinions have been changed forever. While in the 21st century, some of the camera work and sound dubbing might be a bit dated, it cannot change the true magic of this film.

The general gist of the film is 3 people, surprisingly the good (Eastwood) the bad (Van cleef) and the Ugly (Eli wallace) on the search for gold. All three go down a path of betrayal and greed, all trying to get one over on the other.

A great aspect of this film is the Ennio Morricone score which accompanies the film. The score beautifully accompanies the film by producing some memorable scenes.

I won't ruin the plot of the film for those who have yet to see it; but the final show down will have you on the edge of your seat.

Even if you are not a fan of Westerns, I would personally say that even this film may appeal to you from its sheer amount to entertain audiences from 1966 to present.

16 November 2005,all time classic,"If there is anybody out there who has not yet seen this magnificent movie, then get to your local store and rent or buy it NOW! I first saw this film when I was a kid about eight or nine years old, and even though it is three hours long, I was transfixed to the screen for the duration. Now I am not a big western fan. In fact I hate those corny John Wayne and Ronald Reagan movies where cowboys are either good or bad and the women are even more obedient than the horses. Nobody in this film has any morals and they all inhabit a dog-eat-dog vision of the west that not even the civil war can civilize. And that's the other great thing about this movie. It weaves in the U.S. civil war as effortlessly as other westerns introduce the Stetson hat. Lee van Cleef,Eli Wallach and Clint Eastwood are the men who personify the good,bad and ugly of the title. As the movie rumbles on however, we soon see that those descriptions are interchangeable.

To offset the bitter and often violent tone of the movie, there are also some touching scenes. Particularly when Tuco (Wallach) visits his brother in a monastery. Humour also, riddles the fresh and coarse dialog. Wallach has the best one-liners. All this is of course brilliantly set to Ennio Moriconne's outstanding score. A soundtrack which, over the years, has come to be as famous as the movie. I have probably seen ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly a dozen times now, but I'll never tire of it. Don't say you don't like westerns till you've watched this movie.",9

22 November 2020,Masterpiece,"This is one of those movies you can watch over and over and over.

The plot builds around the individual stories of the three main characters, Blonde (the good), Tuco (the ugly) and Angel face (the bad).

As the story unfolds, we can grasp the different inner values of each character by looking at the way they act; at the same time, we can also see the many similarities they have (e.g. they are all selfish and opportunistic people). The result is that each character is textured and has a lot of depth.

Acting is superb, each one of the actors could have been the main character in this movie. Dialogues are also brilliant, I bet every movie enthusiast remembers at least on passage from this movie (my favourite- '...there's two kinds of people, my friend: Those with loaded guns and those who dig. You dig.')

The footprint of Sergio Leone is also impressive as the movie still manages to entertain us after 50+ years.

Soundtrack is also absolutely amazing.

The movie was slow in some parts and I would have like to see some more fast pace in this flick. But overall it was a great film. The soundtrack was perfect and added a nice touch to the film.

From the excellent actors to the epic music and plot this movie is a pleasure to watch from start to finish. Clint Eastwood definitely gives one of the best performances in his career. It doesn't matter what kind of movies you like , you have to watch it because while watching it you witness greatness , quality and top notch filmography. I don't think there are many people who would not stand and watch in awe , since this masterpiece of a film delivers and goes the western film genre to another level. Ennio Morricone also composes the best ost in his career and that's saying a lot. There is violence,there is brilliance,there is everything you need to categorize a film as a landmark of the times it was created.

25 April 2011,Notably the best spaghetti western ever made.,"""It's not a joke, it's a rope, Tuco. Now I want you to get up there and put you head in that noose"".-'Blondie' Clint Eastwood

Spaghetti westerns aren't easy films to make. The cinematography, acting, direction, and lines ALL have to be perfected. There has to be some kind of a 'spark' towards this kind of western. People either hate it or love it. I love this film!

'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' was a forging masterpiece, that bought me to the conclusion that Sergio Leone was one of the great directors of the decade. His other works were great and highly praise, but this film was him at his very best. It's too bad we don't get these kind of films anymore.

This unforgettable masterpiece is a piece of delusional art. Its weighed by masterful performances, outstanding direction, and the best soundtrack of all-time (in my opinion). The exaggerated storyline may be heavy, but again, its weighed.

Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef give adorable performances in this film, but Wallach is the 'show-stealer'. He demonstrates a great understanding towards his character and is full of heart. He also carries the film very well, because of this. Eastwood is slick, causing unbelievable chemistry between his and Wallach's character. Lee Van Cleef is amazing in his brief, yet undeniable role.

Sergio Leone's direction is sophisticated and full of depth. The kind of camera angles used are beautiful. Cinematography is staggering, just at the right speed.

I haven't a heard a better soundtrack from any film. The laughable and hilarious skills used to put them in this film are shady. The main theme is one of my most favorite parts of this film.

Storyline is at time silly, but its so hilarious that its hard not to see this film. There also isn't much dialogue in this, but there are so many memorable quotes, that you almost forget that.

Overall, nobody should miss this film. If you like Western Movies, you will be stupid not to have seen this. No surprised to hear that this is 4th on the 'IMDB 250'. It's third on my top favorites.",10

30 January 2023,"The Odd, The Brat and Dirty Harry","8 + 1 stars (1 ontop for one of the best scores of all time)

As the title implies, there are three main characters. One of them is BAD (aka Angel Eyes), which is an understatement due to his cruel behavior. He should better be called WORSE.

Then we have a sleazy villain who introduces himself as Tuco (UGLY). Please note that Tuco is pronounced Tooco not Tucco. He isn't very smart, but like the BAD is he good at shooting of all kinds of westerners. The UGLY is well versed in slipping into a dead man's uniform without showing telltale bloodstains on the fabric. And that thing you can call a task. Especially when the selection of too-short-but-stout Southerners is manageable.

And we have a handsome ""business founder"" (GOOD, aka Blondie), played by Dirty Harry (sorry for the joke). This man doesn't have it quite as tough. He is a marksman who shoots that all the ends of any ropes meet and meet and meet. But at times with ulterior motives. Why he is not on a ""Most Wanted"" list remains an unsolvable mystery.

I'd say the story unfolds a little bit too randomly. Nonetheless the ""el desenlace final"" and the score are absolutely stunning. Especially the score! Ennio Morricone's masterpiece will stand the test of time for sure.

PS: Does it only look like that? Or is it always the same black horse carrying around all kinds of heavy stuff all the time? Holy crap, the poor animal!",9
3 November 2001,The West as it never was,"It took an Italian to revolutionize the American Western. Everything was strange and new about the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Perhaps the strangest was that it was not a contest between good and evil -- the white hats and the black hats -- as was the typical western, but instead had a plot driven by the greed of the three characters -- one of whom is charitably called good, the other two certifiably bad and ugly.

The music is extraordinary -- one of the best and most original soundtracks ever. The photography is weird -- no one had ever focused so close-up on people's eyes or the pores in their skin. The violence is brutal and surreal. The three-cornered gunfight is one of the great scenes from cinema. The scenery is off. It doesn't look like the American west -- and in fact it isn't. The movie was made in Spain. The characters are incredibly seedy. Most of them look like they took a bath about a decade ago and haven't changed their clothes since. And nobody gets the girl -- because there isn't any girl.

I love this movie! It makes my all-time top ten list. Clint Eastwood is cool beyond belief; Eli Wallach is a hoot; and Lee Van Cleef is really, really bad.",10

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

13 May 2003,The restored version a lot less choppy,"As broadcast it was a real surprise. The Civil War isn't just tacked on for effect, characters don't just materialize, there is some more continuity (about fifteen minutes got added back in). Technically the color's cleaned up and the sound moderated.

Ending's the same, story's the same, but a better-told story.

It's always a pleasure to see it and see it again. Eli Wallach is excellent and funny, Clint Eastwood a unique actor.

15 December 2020,Greatest western ever,"This is by far one of the best westerns ever. It's really a simple story at it's core. Three men all after a buried treasure. But it's not really about getting the money. Truly the story of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is about, well, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. The three central characters try the story and are the main focus.

I'll start with the best actor and one of my favorite characters, Tuco. When I first saw the film Clint Eastwood was my drawing point but as the movie progressed I fell in love with Tuco. He is conflicted in life as he lives a life of crime and greed and yet you can tell there is some part of him deep inside that actually might care for people. He's also one of the few characters who truly changes through the film and learns a lesson. The second is Blondie or The man with no name or Clint Eastwood. Whatever you call him there's no doubt that Clint nails it. When you think of a gunslinger you think of Blondie. I can never get that imagine of him in his Pancho, standing in the cemetery out of my head. It's just iconic. Angel eyes. He looks like a bad guy. He talks like a bad guy. Everything about him is perfect for a true western bad guy. There is no one else in the world who could have played this character.

Now the directing. It's probably what's best is the directing. It's just a beautifully shot film with it's amazing landscapes and how it creates a very realistic view of the western world. I could keep typing about it but the only way to truly see what I mean is to watch the film for yourself. I should also talk about the soundtrack. The music is perfect and shows the tones and feels of the movie. Every time I feel down I can just turn on the music to this song and all my problems go away. Of course when you have Ennio Morricone doing the music your on the right track to make something iconic.",10
12 December 1999,Most compelling western EVER,"This has to be the greatest Western ever made. The plot is classic, with all the appropriate twists; the (American) actors are excellent, particularly Eli Wallach as Tuco. He gives depth to what could otherwise be a stock bandit character. Lee Van Cleef gives probably his best performance as Angel Eyes, simply the most chilling villain to ever appear on film.

Even the music is top-notch, especially the score heard as Tuco searches the graveyard and at the final shootout. Director Sergio Leone is at his best here, with his trademark extreme closeups intercut with sweeping panoramic landscapes. Don't miss the huge Civil War battle or the three-way(!) shootout.

The action is great, the dialogue is great, and there are some really memorable quotes to be found here (""Whoever double-crosses me and leaves me alive, he understands nothing about Tuco""). This is a five-out-of-five winner that every fan of film must see again and again.",10
5 June 2018,Revolutionary,"It's like an opera set in wild west, flawless performances by the trio, Eli Wallach being the best. Film is full of Leone's trademark techniques and it has one of the best scores ever by Enrio Morricone.

2 July 2004,A good soundtrack is underrated,"What can I say? I've never been a fan of Westerns but this one hits the bullseye big time, one of my all time favourite and thats saying something. An engaging story wrapped with a memorable script, inspired first class directing, convincing acting and a classic soundtrack. Yes, soundtracks are underrated. The music in this film is timeless and it's the icing on a legendary cake.

If you haven't seen The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, go rent it out right now. It's a masterpiece without question and a must watch no matter who you are. Eastwoods best ever film, he's been in plenty of gems but this film is the one he'll be remembered for. If you've never seen this film make it the next video you rent, and if you have seen it before you one of the lucky ones. Simply brilliant.

28 June 2018,Spaghetti Westerns,"One of my top 10 favorite movies, I love watching the old spaghetti westerns and especially the Clint Eastwood westerns. I watched this for the first time when I was 10 and probably have watched it over 100 times since then. The westerns of today come no where close to these old westerns. People will be watching them 1000 years from now.

13 March 2005,Sergio Leone's Evocative Spaghetti Western,"Sergio Leone's 1966 sprawling western epic The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is, to me, undeniably epic. People define epic in all sorts of ways: it can mean it's ambitious, it can mean its running length is long, it can mean it's a visual spectacle, it can mean its anticlimactic, etc. And although I think The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly are all those things, that's not why it's epic to me. For a movie to be epic to me, it has to not only be ambitious, but pay off greatly; so great that after the film, I wish I could've been in the mind of that filmmaker when they thought up that film. And imperfect as it can be, The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is certainly that.

The Good is Clint Eastwood, a nameless drifter who goes by the name Blondie. I like him because he's certainly cool, but no to the point of ridiculousness. The Good is pursued by The Ugly (Eli Wallach), a greedy bandit who seeks revenge on Blondie for leaving him out to hang dry. However, his motives eventually change when Blondie tells him he has been told by a man the graveyard that holds enough gold to last someone for the rest of their lives. Eli Wallach does a superlative job in disgusting us with his character, only letting his human side spill out in a confrontation with his priest brother. The Bad (Lee Van Cleef) is also aware of the money, but only Blondie supposedly knows where the gold is hiding. Lee Van Cleef doesn't get much time to be more than the ""bad guy"", but he's ably menacing.

""The Man with No Name"" trilogy to which The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly belongs is considered the seeds of the spaghetti western genre, and it also marks a beginning of less admirable Western heroes. While the Good is still likable and we root for him, his motive, like the Bad and the Ugly, is the gold. He isn't the old western hero who stands up for the woman and throws material possessions away. Clint Eastwood will not go to the lengths of greed the Bad and Ugly sink to, but it's not like he doesn't want the gold.

Sergio Leone often takes the western out of its conventional definition over the nearly three-hour length of the film by often going in new places. Although the first half-hour or so is slow (the biggest flaw of the film), it quickly picks up after that, with The Ugly dragging Blondie across the desert, visits to a church and a Civil War prison camp, and on the front lines of a Civil War battle. It all leads up to the final three-way shootout, which manages to still stay tense by some well-handled editing that cuts rapidly to suspicious eyes and hands nearing pistols. It's a great ending, and certainly one of the coolest of all time.

Also worth noting is Ennio Morricone's score. The opening theme is still classic even after thirty-eight years have gone by, and ""Ecstasy of Gold"" (the song playing as The Ugly runs across the cemetery searching frantically for the grave) is nothing short of swelling. The whole score plays like a tumbleweed rolling across a sandy town.",9
13 May 2022,Pure cinema masterpiece.,"This film is what cinema is about, an absolute masterpiece of film making, nothing else to say really. If you've watched it you'll know, if not, what are you waiting for!

2 May 2020,BLONDEY!!,"Not only a near perfect western but a near perfect movie. An amazing soundtrack and outstanding long shots and close-ups. Eli Wallach steals the movie. He is hilarious and selfish to the point of being evil. Clint Eastwood communicates so much with his body that he doesn't need much dialog. Angel Eyes is in between. Great plot and intriguing. I've seen this movie 8-10 times and always seems fresh.

14 April 2013,A Magnificent Spectacle,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is the kind of movie that when it is over, you walk away from the screen, pump your fist into the air and shout ""It was awesome!"" I haven't seen a movie that I walk away from with my blood racing in quite a while. This movie has an awesome level on par with Inception and The Matrix.

Awesomeness aside, this movie was incredibly well done. The directing was magnificent. Sergio Leone builds suspense and excitement through gradually faster cuts and by showing characters' faces and hands closer and closer. The casting and acting is excellent also. Eli Wallach was excellent as Tuco and Clint Eastwood was calm and in control as always.

The score, also, is impeccable. It really sets the tone of the movie, contributing to whatever the mood at the moment is, whether that be sadness or excitement. You will be humming the score for days! This movie also has additional music to the standard western sounding scores that are in this series of movies, showing the talent and versatility of the makers of this film.

Another thing that impressed me about this film was its accuracy about the Civil War. Never before have I seen a movie that accurately portrayed the North for who they were during the war. This movie is the first and so far the only movie that I have seen that is accurate in this respect.

I just can't seem to find anything wrong with this movie. It was that good!",10

The makers of this film, I am sure, would never have thought that their creation will remain best in next 50, 100 years. While Blondie is too good, Tuco steals the show and pulls the movie to his credit. Script, photography are all good. Music, looks like came directly from heaven. Heynnas voice for Tuco just fits wonderfully well. I saw this movie some 10 times in last 5 years. Still I have not come out of its impact. God bless all those who have been associated with this epic. I recommend this film to everybody who loves art, stories, creativity, music. This is the finest creation from film world of any country, language.

22 December 2018,Solid classic,"This movie stars Clint Eastwood (Gran Torino, Million Dollar Baby). This movie is a classic western and is part of a trilogy alongside âA Fistful of Dollarsâ? and âFor a Few Dollars more.â? Western movies have held a special place in my heart ever since my father and I used to dress up as Cowboys on Halloween when I was a young boy. The soundtrack for this film is great as well, I love the song at the end of the film during the standoff in the graveyard, I know my brother used to play it often. Metallica uses that song at their concerts before their shows start.

14 July 2007,Good film but too long. Sound quality problems.,"Well-done shootout Western that stays on plot almost the whole way through. I did find it to be an endurance test to sit through all of it in one sitting. The entire section with the army at the river could be removed completely and that would make the film better. Only a tiny bit of dialog would have to be replaced somewhere else. Other than the excessive length, this was a good film, with plenty of action and terrific acting. Eli Wallach is the true star of this film, not Clint Eastwood. Wallach is in almost every scene and is brilliant all the way through. The music is good, but for some reason there were major sound problems on the DVD I rented. It was not the Collector's edition that came out in 2005 - it was a single disc that had the movie only, from MGM-UA Home Video. Some of the music had a tinny, low-fidelity, transistor-radio quality. There was also a lack of sync between the soundtrack and the video for the entire movie. The actors' lips were not in sync with the words on the soundtrack. Better rent the Collector's edition instead.

Nothing more to be said, just sit and watch this masterpiece.

3 January 2010,Superb. Could possibly be the perfect movie.,"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is one of the most famous and well known movie titles ever, and for good reason: The movie that it titles could just be perfect. When i say perfect i mean to say that it's narrative and plot, the way it develops and unfolds, and the way it concludes itself is probably the ideal way any movie should be shaped. For half of the film we don't even know what the plot is; things simply happen and build up, and then in the second half the goal of the characters comes into being. The filmmakers do this in such a way that the film, plot less at first, could go any direction, and we are taken happily along for the ride. And when it does go into a direction, we are ready to set out on it. It isn't plot less in a bad way, actually the best way possible, because we are entertained and engrossed, and at the same time have a sense of possibility. The famous score is incredible and actually sounds pretty modern, so there isn't that feeling of dated music. The acting is excellent, Clint is as always very cool, and there is even a good anti-war message that materializes in the last act, one that is very touching. If you want to see a perfectly made movie, then you should see this. and soon.",10

4 February 2010,"200,000 dollars that's a lot of money, We're going to have to earn it","That's just one of the great lines in this movie that is full of great lines. This simply put is one of if not the greatest westerns of all time. I'd put it up there with True Grit, The Searchers and Man Without a Star. Directed by Leone starring the king of cool Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and the highly underrated Eli Wallach(who steals every scene he his is in) I won't go into the plot as just about every review here will tell you that. Running at about 3 hrs depending on which cut you see this movie is never boring. It's exciting and funny full of pathos and a great anti war message. You don't have to like this genre to like this movie.

31 December 1998,Leone proves his superiority in this movie.,"""The Good, the Bad, & the Ugly"" is the best Western ever. The only one comparable is ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" which is also directed by Leone. If you don't like traditional Westerns, that doesn't mean you will dislike either one of these classics. Leone's style is definitely superior to the tired cowboy and Indian movies starring the likes of the slovenly John Wayne.

24 March 2001,classic 'Spaghetti' Western,"Dismissed by Hollywood as 'spaghetti westerns', Sergio Leone's three Clint Eastwood-led features stand as tall as anything Hollywood has ever put out; well acted, beautifully photographed, superbly edited, and featuring the unforgettable music of Ennio M. And how often does the movie industry give us a combo like Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach? Lee smirks, Clint squints and Eli blusters, and we can't look away, from the opening six+ dialogue-free minutes (not counting the semi-comic credits) to the final shootout. Van Cleef is the epitomy of amoral viciousness--a different character than in the 2nd movie, 'For a Few Dollars More', and Wallach is unforgettable as the blustery, violent, frantic Tuco; but Eastwood, with sparse scratches of dialogue, is the soul of the movie. The (Civil) war scenes are big-budget, in contrast with the usual desert-and-small-towns in the other two parts of the trilogy. Turn everything else off and watch and enjoy.

Everything about it from the introduction of our three protagonists to the climactic gunfight and blackly hilarious ending, from the music to the cinematography is just pure genius. Maybe Leone made more critically acclaimed films, technically better films, but this one has the chemistry between the leads and the utter conviction of what it's trying to do to propel it beyond that.

Awesome. If you don't like this, go and see a doctor.

11 January 2002,The Best Western ever!,"It is very hard picking out a best list for Leone's films as the auteur that he was, redefined the western genre and quite honestly action movies as a whole. The references to his films are so evident in todays culture and films that they have become a dogma. His influence is so widespread that it is virtually impossible to do a believable action film without drawing from some of his codes.

This film is the absolute best of the lot. It is vulgar, vicious, funny and deliciously entertaining and epic by scale and content. It tackles the thin line between greed and friendship so effortlessly that it does deserve to be rated as one of the best films of all time!

31 July 2022,Amazingly good,"I decided to watch this movie after seeing the positive reviews of it. I had very high hopes for it and it didn't dissapoint. I loved it.

The cinematography, the acting, the main characters, the music, the plot. Everything is great. And that final scene is pure gold. It's peak cinema.

The movie is pretty long, but I assure you it's worth to watch the whole movie just for that final scene alone. It's that good. And it's not even boring, in fact, it's very entertaining the whole way through.

Definitely more than just a worth-to-watch movie even if you are not a fan of westerns.

26 March 2001,Possibly the best western ever made,"It's more than 30 years old and still The Good the Bad and the Ugly still managed to get a 10/10 on my list. It was awesome and funny from beginning to end. It's a rip roaring adventure you must see at least once in your life.

26 January 2002,Wow!,"This is my favourite, best, number 1 film of all time!

I can't find any faults with this stunning piece of work.

Best bits - Eli Wallach as Tuco ('The Bad'), Mario Brega (now he IS bad!), the fantastic photography from Tonino Delli Colli, and, best of all, the soundtrack by my hero Ennio Morricone. Nothing he has done before or since comes close to this.

Why no Oscar nominations?!? Possibly because Italy had refreshed and re-juvenated the Western, which was looking old and jaded in Hollywood? That can't have gone down too well in the big American studios.

Some people have said that this film is too long. Poop to them! Every time I watch it, I see something new. Surely that is the hallmark of a great film?",10
6 October 2000,Superb!!!,"I've seen this movie 62 times and I can only say this is the greatest western movie in the world \that`s my opinion, of course\. The plot is wonderful, the actors give a flamboyant performance and the powerful music score of Moricone makes unforgettable impression!

5 April 2020,BEST WESTERN EVER !,"THIS IS MY SECOND FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME. WHEN IT'S ON TV, NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I'VE SEEN AGAIN . I WILL WATCH IT AGAIN. HOW CAN U NOT LIKE ENNIO MORRICONE'S SCORE. ONE OF THE BEST EVER. I GIVE IT 10 STARS EASILY. JUST CLINT EASTWOOD'S EXPRESSIONS IS WORTH WATCHING IT FOR. AND THE CLOSE-UPS ON THEIR EYES IS A SERGIO LEONE STAPLE. ELI WALLACH ALMOST STEALS THE MOVIE FROM CLINT, BECAUSE HE IS IN IT LONGER. CLINT'S ONE -LINERS ARE FUNNY AS USUAL .IT'S NEVER BORING EITHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S 3 HOURS LONG. I DON'T SEE HOW A GUY WOULDN'T LIKE IT. IT CAME OUT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS MY FAVORITE MOVIE "" THE SAND PEBBLES "" . AND THE ENDING IS ONE OF THE BEST OF ANY MOVIE.WHEN I GET A CELL PHONE, MY RING TONE WILL BE THE THEME FROM THIS MOVIE . GUYS, WATCH IT !

3 August 2017,3 hours of magnificence that is exquisite and unsurpassed,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

5 August 2003,Greatest Western Ever!,"Like many who have posted here, TGTB&TU is one of my favourite films ever.

However, something I'm curious about; my DVD version of the film states that Eli Wallach is ""the bad"" and Lee Van Cleef ""the ugly""; also the original theatrical trailer says the same. The film though has them the other way around as does this site.

I've always thought of Eli Wallach as ""the ugly"" and Lee Van Cleef as ""the bad"", so what gives......?

By the way, Eli Wallach not getting an Academy Award is one of the all time great Oscar injustices.......

3 January 2009,The Ecstasy Of Gold,"I wish I could give 11 stars because this truly is the ultimate movie. A lot has been written about it already, so I'll just make it very short: Leone wanted to make a cool, gritty, badass drama, so he casted Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, respectively. Brilliant choices, brilliant concept, brilliant finale. Greed has led three men into a deadly scramble for a chest of gold. The standoff takes place at Sad Hill Cemetery, and it is the most memorable standoff in movie history, with 'The Ecstasy of Gold' the icing on this cake of perfection. Gives me goosebumps every time just thinking about Tuco running over that cemetery. 10/10

26 January 2003,The Greatest Thing Ever To Be Seen On The Face Of The Planet,"The day I first watched the good the bad and the ugly was a day I will never forget. It gave me all the emotions of every single genre in 1 movie. The ending especially I think will go down in history as the greatest ending to a movie ever seen on the face of this planet. Whoever doubted Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallace's acting capability's for this movie are definitly wrong in there assumptions. The good the bad and the ugly will go down in my books as the greatest thing I have ever seen and I have seen it many times and have seen other great movies also but none of them measure up to the great standard that the good the bad and the ugly set.

13 August 2000,The good the Bad and the Brilliant,"This is probably one the finest westerns ever made. From beginning to the end it is simply brilliant. The story of the man with no name continues in the third installment of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. Clint Eastwood is at his best Lee Van Cleef is always impressive but Eli Walach's portrayal of Tuco was the best. What I like most about the film is that it is 2 and half hours long and does not have a single wasted scene. It stays intense throughout the entire film right from the opening scene with to the very last. This is of cause partly to do with Ennio Morrocone's haunting musical score.

26 October 2003,A real tribute to the world of CINEMA,"I saw this movie first time when I was may be 15. I enjoyed it that time. And I really don't know how many times I have seen this movie again and again. A perfect movie. Each shot is without any mistake. I love each shot of this movie. Sergio has taken 200% of all the characters in movie. Unforgettable close-ups, sets, music, acting and direction is nothing but the core of this movie. Try to recall demolition of bridge! My all time favorite character is Tuco, what a greedy character, I haven't seen such a character in any movie. Tuco gargles his mouth with water in desert, spitts in his hand and then puts his wet hand on his face, just to protect himself from sun, I have never seen such acting or imagination in any movie. The way he says ""Blondie dont die blondie"" when he realized that blondie knows the name of grave. The way he eats with Angle eye when he gets caught. He doesn't eat until Angel eye eats from his plate, just to make sure that nothing is mixed (poison may be) in his food. And his expression "" I know I know (food is clean) when Angel eye eats from his plate. The way he tries to convince Blondie in his priest brother's place. ""Blondie we both are alone, you have me and I have you...... the way Tuco tries to get name of grave, it is unforgettable. And the way he joins Blondie again and kills Angel Eye's five men, he doesnt care about his own death when it comes to $200,000 gold coins. And finally he runs runs and runs in circle in semetary, that kind of scene is never seen before, again what an imagination of sergio and what an acting of Tuco. And in last shot 3 men with guns and gold coins, unbelievable. And finally Tuco with half gold, or half gold with Tuco. I have never seen characters like Blondie( a real hero) and Angel Eye( the greatest villain of all the time). Just recall your memory and see the way Angel eye looks at everybody, sharp look with sharp direction. This movie is a real tribute to cinema. You can learn so many things from it.

God bless your soul Sergio",10

21 August 2022,One of the best if not the best westerns,"I saw this when it came out, yes I'm that old!

Decided to watch it again after all these years and everything about this film has already been said.

One thing that leapt out at me this time around was how perfect their teeth were, surely something could have been done to make them look more authentic for the nature of the film, I'm being pedantic though I suppose.

12 April 2015,This film is Top Class.,"Currently, I am trying to make my way through the IMDb Top 250 and the only one in the Top 10 I hadn't seen was this film. I was sceptical to watch this film at first mainly because it is a 'spaghetti western' which isn't my favourite genre. As soon as the film started, I was captivated and engrossed in this, quite simply, timeless classic. The acting from Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef is truly sublime for it's time. The way the actors used their characters to appeal to the viewer and to allow the viewer to explore the characteristics of each character is a very intelligent decision made by Sergio Leone in this third installment of these 'Spaghetti Westerns'. In truth, I was incredibly impressed and enamoured by the cinematography and the story-line and given that it was at least 30-45 minutes longer than it should have been, it did not bother me in the slightest. This is truly an epic film and unsurprising that it is considered the 8th best film of all time.

27 September 2002,A classic.,"This is one of my favourite films off all time. Sergio Leone manages to keep the film up through the entire 2h 36m of it, I was never once bored. The final scene in the graveyard was perfect, the score was excellent, Clint was as always great. The whole idea of the film was fantastic. I selected the graveyard scene as one of my favourite scenes in any film, ever. I've even stole the theme tune for the final credits of my film. The problem is there is so many take-offs and spoofs of this that when watched today it seems like a charicature of itself. However you have to remind yourself before you start to watch, that it's the original, not a rip-off or anything. Just pure Leone, Eastwood, Van Cleef, Wallach. I've been writing this comment for some time now and it was one of my favourite films when I started and it still is.

22 February 2003,Best western ever made,"This is the best western ever made only rivaling Sam Peckinpahs ""Wild Bunch"". Sergio Leone one the most influential directors made a timeless unforgettable man with no name trilogy. With two before this ""Fisful of Dollars"" and ""For a Few Dollars More"" This was the cherry on top. Actually forget the cherry this was the whole banana split. With the greatest ever story ever put on film this is the Best of the Best and better. I would go into details but no need to repeat whats already been said. Clint Eastwood is the man.

9 May 2014,"An influential masterpiece from a once deemed ""trash"" genre","What can be said about a film that already has over 694 reviews (both professional and personal) on this site alone? Should I talk about the unbelievable set-pieces; the great cast; the criminally-ignored Oscar- worthy performances from all 3 leads (Eastwood, Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef); the 3-dimensional characterizations; the great performances from the supporting cast (those with and without dialog); the multi-layered storytelling; Leone's satire on paint-by-numbers Westerns; the breath- taking cinematography; the tight script; the brilliant direction; the classic music; the eternal thought-provoking themes of war, violence, compassion, and humanity; the intense action; the quiet atmospheric moments; the great action scenes; the violence; the timeless humor; the legendary climax; the behind-the-scenes moments? What can be said about a film now widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time? What about when it was first released?

When Sergio Leone's ""The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly"" first premiered to US audiences in 1967 (1966 in Italy) it was a time when many critics looked down on the Spaghetti Western genre as a whole. The Western genre itself was starting to wear off its appeal for many critics and said audience viewed the Spaghetti Western as an excuse to depict senseless violence which is exactly what they criticized about Leone's film. Critics at TIME, Variety, The New York Times, and the L.A. Times are a few examples of the major US publications that gave negative reviews to Leone's film. I write all this neither to mock the critics' opinions nor their reviews of the film at the time because from a historian's perspective these reviews provide insight into the US' critical movie culture towards a genre deemed then as violent trash. Yet history has shown a different opinion since its release.

Upon the film's release it became a hit (both national and international) and more importantly was influential beyond film becoming iconic in countless forms of art. The film breathed new life into the Western; the main theme topped 1968 charts for a year and now is one of the most recognized movie themes ever; ""A Fistful of Dollars"" introduced Eastwood's ""Man With No Name"" character but this film cemented him as an icon in the public mind. Many filmmakers, musicians, writers, painters, designers (clothing, video games, etc) point this film out as influential in their careers. Again I will not spoil anything and anyone curious about the film should definitely check it out. Personally speaking I can't say enough about the film and I always notice something new every time I watch it whether in the background or a character's mannerisms. I have watched it countless times and have yet to tire of it. Not only is ""The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly"" one of the all-time greatest films ever made it's my all-time favorite film. Shalom.",10

9 January 2006,40 years later it still fascinates,"I may have seen this movie more times than any other, and it still holds it's power every single time. I first saw it in theaters as a kid and remember sitting mesmerized by this story on screen. I think i saw it at least 2 or 3 more times in theaters over time and countless TV viewings before the home video age made it possible to view any time i wanted. It was my first DVD purchase after getting a player a few years back. It is interesting how it has become a critical favorite over that time. On its initial release critics(those that paid attention) sloughed it off as just another spaghetti western albeit with a bigger budget. Clint was not taken seriously as an actor, now of course he is an icon. Leone's stock has risen in that time as well, to the point that he is now often named as one of the all-time great directors, amazing for a man with such a small directing portfolio.

This movie had(has) everything. Wide vistas beautifully shot,Leone's amazing close-ups,wonderful black humour, artfully staged 'violence', pathos, all set to that memorable Morricone score. Eli Wallach chewed scenery better than anyone before or since. A truly memorable performance. And that long gunfight at the end must rank as one of the greatest scenes in ANY film ever made.

Anyone who has the newly remastered DVD should watch the movie with film critic Richard Schickel's commentary turned on for some interesting insights and behind the scenes info. Highly recommended.

On my all-time list, this sits at #1.",10
23 August 2022,"quite an interesting movie,","During school holidays, I watched this film, I thought this film was quite interesting when I first saw it, but some scenes did not agree.

6 January 2015,"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly","This movie is just as good as it gets. Sergio Leone's masterpiece is fun, exciting and packed with action. This epic tale of 3 men in search for a treasure is just fantastic! Great performances by Clint Eastwood as Blondie, a mysterious gunslinger and bountyhunter, Lee van Cleef as Angel Eyes, a ruthless, unfeeling and sociopathic mercenary and Tuco, An Outlaw wanted in 14 counties. The chemistry between the actors is perfect. Also a fantastic score by EnnioMorricone with the epic ''the ecstasy of gold'' as its highlight.

Probably my favorite movie of all time! If you haven't seen it yet why are you still reading? Go and watch this masterpiece!

6 November 2022,"Iconic movie, flawed film.","The film's premise is simple and the characters are pretty one sided, although it's interesting that even the supposed 'Good', kills without thought and is driven by greed just as much as the other two; displaying that there was no real 'good' in the time of the Wild West. 'The Ugly' has the most screen time and we even see some of his backstory which makes you somewhat sympathetic towards the character, who is only there for comedic effect.

The dubbing on this film is so horrendous I almost feel like they did it on purpose for comedic value; it distracted me for the first hour until I slowly just accepted it. There are scenes in this film that don't add much to the actual story and just act as filler to fulfil the film's narrative arc, but are nether the less entertaining.

On the other hand, Ennio Morricone's score is breathtaking and a strong contender for the best film score ever. The cinematography is generally smooth and beautiful despite a few close shots that are an inch or so out of focus. Clint Eastwood's 'Good', despite being a completely one dimensional character, is effortlessly cool and perfectly cast, and Lee Van Cleef's 'The Bad' sends a shiver down your spine. The film has a iconic conclusion with a 5 minute stare down, allowing Morricone's score to build in a crescendo. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly deserves it's place as a classic, I just wish the dubbing wasn't so awful.",8

15 August 2001,Absolutely the best western ever made!,"And it's the truth. This is the western that broke the mold. Clint Eastwood IS The Good, Lee Van Cleef IS the bad, and Eli Wallach IS the Ugly. Good guys and bad guys were no longer separated by wearing white hats and black hats. One can certainly question just how ""Good"" Eastwood's character is. Set during the civil war, it follows the title trio (comprised of Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach) on their quest for 200 thousand dollars in gold. The question is, who will get it first?

As ""The Good"" Clint Eastwood leaves nothing to be desired, giving the role just enough of the quiet cockiness that it needs. Eastwood had the two previous films to build the character on, and it shows.

""The Bad"" Is definitely my favorite role in the film. I do some community theater acting and if there's a bad guy in the play I usually play it! That's why I like the role. The bad guys have all the fun! Lee Van Cleef is exceptional. no one else could have given the role what he did. This is the first movie I saw Lee Van Cleef in, and it put him at the top of my list of favorite actors. What really is amazing is that he plays the exact opposite of this role in the previous film, ""For a Few Dollars More."" Since I saw the films out of order(I still haven't had a chance to see the first) When I saw Van Cleef in ""For a Few Dollars More, I kept expecting the other shoe to fall with his Colonel Douglas Mortimer character. To my Delight, it never did. If you are going to watch ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, You have to get ""For a Few Dollars More and watch them both. Van Cleef Really is amazing to watch. And I Think he was a hell of an actor!

And as ""The Ugly"" Eli Wallach Physically embodies greed. That is the only way to describe it. Wallach definitely has the most developed character. One minute, he's the best friend you've ever had, and the next minute he's stabbing you in the back for your money. When he and Eastwood find The man who knows where the money is, Tuco tells the dying man not to die until after he's told Tuco where the money is! He also has a great line in a scene towards the end involving him and a gunslinger that lost his arm because of him. I would describe it, but I don't want to give it away. Wallach gives on hell of a performance. I actually thought he was Spanish, until someone told me that he was Jewish!

Sergio Leone certainly Gives us one hell of a movie. There is not a second of film wasted. While the whole movie is great, there are two scenes that really stand out in my mind. The first is the scene where Tuco(""The Ugly"") runs through a graveyard searching for one name on the hundreds of grave markers. The total scene is about three and a half minutes of him searching, and blended with a superior song from Ennio Morricone, and it is part of film history. No one will ever be able to duplicate what Leone, Wallach and Morricone did with it. That's another thing I have to mention. While all the soundtrack music Morricone composed is terrific, He outdid himself with this Soundtrack. Every song fits every scene perfectly. The only soundtrack I can compare it to is the shark theme from ""Jaws"".

The second scene is the final showdown between the Three main characters. Leone took his time with this one. It has dozens of different camera shots, and terrific song to underscore it. Leone builds up the suspense until it's almost unbearable, and trust me, the climax is worth the wait. To give any of it away would be criminal.

If you want to see the perfect western, you have to see this movie. There truly are none that can match it. if I could give it higher than ten I would!

I loved the way the story was developed slowly, the fact that hardly a word was said for the first 5-10 minutes. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where the music and the pace of the movie work so well together, almost as one, and it helps build the story and create an amazing atmosphere. Clint Eastwood look absolutely beautiful, he is a stunning man to look at on screen, his character has some real complexity and rough edges.

I loved the sense of humour and the moral ambiguity. The way the movie was shot and especially the final scene at the graveyard with the close ups, genuinely pulled me into the tension of the story to a point where I totally forgot about all the followers that have used this technique and turned it into a cliche.

The actually story itself, with the three characters, was complex and showed depth. So the storyline, cinematography, development of plot, combination of music and movie make for an absolutely riveting film.",10
21 April 2013,Very good western movie,"Exellend piece of art. Sergio Leone made a really great job, and I really enjoyed the movie. It's probably the best movie with Mr. Clint Eastwood aka Blonde. Sergio Leone's magnificent and ingenious direction in synergy with Ennio Morricone's surreal music, Tonino Delli Colli's breathtaking cinematography and Joe D'Augustine's punctilious editing makes the movie, a treat to watch and ineffably unforgettable. Initially aimed to be a tongue-in-cheek satire on run-of-the-mill westerns, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, continues to stand the test of time in its endeavor to attain apotheosis (if it hasn't attained it yet). It will always be remembered as European cinema's greatest lagniappe, not only to the Western genre, but to the world of cinema.

It's a must watch for any movie lover. 10/10

21 February 2005,Definitely in the best western ever made.,"I grew up watching westerns and war movies. In our book there are cowboy movies and there are westerns. In cowboy movies the star is always neat, well bathed, and every hair in place even after a bar room brawl. In comparison, the western characters are rugged, dirty, dusty, tattered hat, and generally reflect the rugged outdoor, saddle bound life that tough guys endured in those days (consider a Terrence Hill movie where he takes off his hat and one can see where the dirt stops and his real skin starts.) The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is definitely a western and has everything one would want in a movie: a solid and interesting story plot, excellent acting, a ground-breaking director with wide sweeping shots and interesting close-ups, and one of the best music scores one would hear in a movie by the master Enio Morricone. The only western coming anywhere close to GBU is Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. And a race between these two would would still result with GBU ahead for best picture prize because of the fantastic Morricone music score. See the revised version now out on DVD which includes scenes previously cut from the cinema version in the Western World. Some complained this movie is too long. Even with the added scenes it's still too short for me. I wish this movie would be granted a belated Oscar for best western ever made.",10
14 October 2001,"Of the best 5 westerns ever made, this one is on everyone's list.","The ""Good, Bad, and the Ugly"" is one of the best westerns ever made (contending for top dog position only by ""Unforgiven"" and ""Once Upon A Time in the West""). This movie is a Western (as opposed to ""cowboy movies made by John Wayne where the men are always clean and hair well combed even after a fistfight). It focuses on three characters, none of whom is really good. It's characters are real and the scenery stark and harsh as is the style of Sergio Leone. What takes this movie over the top is the superb music score by Ennio Mirricone whose theme song for this movie was whistled for decades. Westerns don't get better than this. A must see.

11 July 2002,"The movie that defined the spaghetti western, well-told and full of juice.","The last of the three `spaghetti westerns' - and the movie that defined the genre - `The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' is a genius blend of five items: a visionary director Sergio Leone, heart-stopping music by Ennio Morricone, and three marvelous actors: Clint Eastwood (the `Good'), Lee van Cleef (the `Bad') and Eli Wallach (the `Ugly'). I have seen it again and again over the years.

Set against the backdrop of the American Civil War, circumstance throws the title characters onto the canvas as competitors in a race to find a dead man's gold, where each of the three exhibits the traits of his character suggested by the title. To be sure, the plot is a good story, and (egad!) many viewers will dwell on the obvious allegory on human nature suggested by the title. However, while mildly interesting, these are only useful as a yarn with which to weave the story, for it is in its thoughtful telling that this movie rivets us, finds its greatness, and which raises it far beyond not only all other westerns, but also most movies of any kind.

It has an extraordinary knack of moving its principal characters around in a little and self-centred stage while surrounding cataclysmic events - heralding the noisy and violent birth of no less than the most powerful nation on earth - are noticed more or less as a nuisance! At one point the audience and the characters are compellingly called to a momentary sense of the bigger picture in a gorgeous pull-back from a camera close-up to a wide-angle pan of an vast makeshift graveyard - a kind of `hey, you lot, look at what has been going on in the meantime'!

You can virtually smell the dust, heat and sweat that permeates this movie, and the cunning use of wind effects and lighting are much combined with solo-subject, no-dialogue cinematography to intensify the mood, or to show the wild loneliness, the potential, and raw immensity of this new country! And when The Ugly is afraid, the movie forces you to feel the stink of his fear over his ever-present treachery!

The movie has many moments that set it apart from the mundane, but, steeped in the film's extraordinary theme, the drawn-out ocular bi-play between our three protagonists near the end is surely a film masterpiece.

Do not expect often to see the match of this wonderful movie, for I'm afraid the consummate skill required is not available in abundance!",
29 July 2005,Another 10 review,"First: When this came out I was just a teenager who loved movies including westerns and greatly admired John Wayne. This movie put me off because it was SO DIFFERENT the guns didn't sound right, it didn't look right, and where was the good guy? But even then the film came to an end quickly despite it's length. Well years later and seen again this movie has gotten better. It keeps getting better as one matures. How many movies do that? Have ever done that? Even the critics matured to worship this wonderful film. Anything else I say is merely repeating what others have said. If somehow you have not seen this movie which would be hard to believe go see it tonight. It's one of the greatest movies/westerns of all time at least that's what the world at large says.

22 August 2011,Maybe the greatest movie ever made,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

2 July 2012,The mark for all Western's to follow.,"TGTBTU sets the standard of Westerns. The movie is fun to watch, has the classic bad guys, good guys, plenty of gun-slinging as well as an actual plot woven into it. The acting is very good by the primary actors; Eastwood, Wallach and Cleef. The directing is typical of Leone with lot's of close-ups to get the facial expressions, adding to the 'feel' of the moment. TGTBTU does contain some minor historical gaffs, but to the untrained eye, they are mostly subtle enough to not distract from the movie. TGTBTU never slows down enough to let a viewer become lost or distracted by other things; if viewing in-home, keep the 'pause button' handy. Another feature that I enjoyed is the loose connection between TGTBTU and the two previous films: Fist Full of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More.

28 June 2004,Worthy of all the praise and then some,"Very few films have earned a 10 from me. This is one that I didn't even have to think about. I watched this film and instantly went looking for other work of Sergio Leone's. He is arguably the greatest director that has graced the big screen.

The team of Leone and Morricone may not ever be topped. I can watch this movie for the score alone. The climactic showdown is perfectly scored and filmed. The Ecstacy Of Gold has become one of my favorite songs, now that I've finally seen it in its intended context.

Of all the great things of this movie, I love its historic backdrop. The civil war battle that Blondie and Tuco get mixed up in has to be my favorite scene. The dejected colonel and his bridge fantasy was absolutely beautiful.

27 January 2005,Unsurpasable Western,"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is the movie that can justifiably be called the greatest western ever made, and with that is also one of the greatest movies ever made. I just recently saw it, because i saw Kill Bill vol. 1 and someone recommended this 1 to me since i LOOVED KBV1. This movie is outstanding and should never be a remake(i heard there would be, sigh) because it needs to be preserved like other rop movies that have had sequels that do not live up to it(The Manchurian Candidiate). But anyone could love this, i see no way on earth some1 would give this a 1/10, it just makes no sense, whereas some movies that are great like A CLOCKWORK ORANGE can get a 1 due to controversy, though i would give it a 10. The Good the Bad The Ugly is instantly one of my favorite films ever and it never gets old. Brilliant 10/10

2 May 2003,undoubtedly the best western ever made,"Clint Eastwood, in his spaghetti-western period, has to be the sexiest man alive. With his coolness, his arrogance and charisma , he is by far the best western actor ever. In this film he is perfectly casted as well as Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. The duel-scene at the end of the movie is legendary, but my favorite scene of the movie is Tuco's Run for Gold, the music is absolutely haunting. The movie has epical scenes countered by a fantastic musical score by Morricone. Ik know the movie by heart just waiting for every scene that has become legendary in movie history. One of my all time favorites!!!!!!

25 July 2002,Just... So... GREAT,"This movie is so great that I can hardly find the words to describe

it. It's really that good. It's definitely long, but I found myself not

caring, wanting more when it was over. The dusty feel it gives is

not only seen in the locations, but also in the type of film used

itself.

All the characters are dead on, but Eli Wallach (The Ugly) is

especially believable as the rough outlaw who's malicious and

terrible one minute, but as soon as he needs something from

blondie, acts like his best friend. The scene with his brother at the

church also shows he's more than a two dimensional character.

I've made it a goal of mine to see every movie on the imdb's top

250 list (I'm halfway done) and I can honestly say that so far this is

one of the best. While not my favorite movie (Nothing beats

Trainspotting), it belongs in the top ten as it is an absorbing and

well done piece of work.

P.S. What an amazing soundtrack!",10
21 May 2022,"If you are going to watch, watch. Don't talk!","An amazing western with one of the most intense ending sequences, all the main characters are likable and all of them have their own unique ideals, flaws and bonds. They are also smart and intelligent, they make good decisions and there is no ""plot armor"" (even for ""The Good""). There is also some amazing comedy moments and it is a very artistic movie overall.

21 June 2013,The Good The Bad And The Ugly = The Masterpiece of The Western Movies!,"The brilliancy of The photography and direction by Sergio Leone mix with the great taste of music by Ennio Morricone's in this movie making it an experience you will not forget. Not only the main theme, but any piece of music played is a symphony of its own for example ""The Ecstacy of Gold"", ""La Storia di un Soldato"" and ""Il Triello"", Not forget the great acting by Lee Van Cleef, Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is my all-time favorite Western. Any other movie in the genre will always be measured by its standards.

This movie is just so great on so many different levels. It should be in the top of your list regardless of what kinds of movies you are into. Even if you hate western. I'm sure you are going to enjoy it.

30 November 2017,"The Waiting, the Patience and the Rewards","This movie is about details, the story builds up slowly but if you have patience, you will get unparalleled rewards. The main three characters and their motivations are well portrayed. The music is considered one of the greatest of all time. The plot is linear, no twists. But instead you get fantastic surprising plot points. The story moves steadily, without any boredom. Again, every scene gets you closer to the characters. This is a an adventure of three different characters going to a common destination, but each in his own way. To recap: wait for it, and you will experience one of the greatest cinematic achievements. The Remastered (Restored) version is a miracle. The picture is crystal clear, and the colors are vivid. Happy watching.

6 February 2006,"A classic, an icon, and loads of fun!","I am not particularly into westerns, and I thought this was an all around absolutely wonderful gem of film! The acting is incredible, the sets, props, and costumes are absolutely perfect, the design, composition, and colors are superb, the directing, the pacing, the editing, and the writing are all perfect too! The soundtrack is just out of this world and over the top wonderful, and the story is just so classic ""western"" mythology. This film has so obviously influenced so many creations since, from ""Star Wars"" to ""Cowboy Beebop."" The main characters are such archetypes of the classic American male, but none of them is truly a stereotype; they all have crystal clear dimension and personality. They definitely do not make films like this any more! The only reason I give it a 9 rather than a 10 (sorry to be such a snob!) is that unfortunately, for my taste, as psychological as it is, it just is not as deep and revealing of human mysteries as I really prefer my films. Sorry!) Otherwise, friggin awesome!

3 February 2014,Brilliant Piece of Cinema,"This film, cinematically speaking is, in my opinion one of the greatest ever movies to come out of the 1960's, it tells the story with very little dialogue, but still the intensity between the characters is brilliantly portrayed. If you haven't seen this classic Western with Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood starring, because its ""old"" you're missing out. Get it in Blu Ray right now and enjoy. I was 4 when it came out, now I'm 51 and I still love it as much as I did when I first saw it age 14.

27 September 2014,great story in this era,"In the last and the best installment of his so-called ""Dollars"" trilogy of Sergio Leone-directed ""spaghetti westerns,"" Clint Eastwood re-prised the role of a taciturn, enigmatic loner. Here he searches for a cache of stolen gold against rivals the Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless bounty hunter, and the Ugly (Eli Wallach), a Mexican bandit. Though dubbed ""the Good,"" Eastwood's character is not much better than his opponents -- he is just smarter and shoots faster. The film's title reveals its ironic attitude toward the canonized heroes of the classical western. ""The real West was the world of violence, fear, and brutal instincts,"" claimed Leone. ""In pursuit of profit there is no such thing as good and evil, generosity or deviousness; everything depends on chance, and not the best wins but the luckiest."" Immensely entertaining and beautifully shot in Techniscope by Tonino Delli Colli, the movie is a virtually definitive ""spaghetti western,"" rivaled only by Leone's own Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). The main musical theme by Ennio Morricone hit #1 on the British pop charts. Originally released in Italy at 177 minutes, the movie was later cut for its international release. ~ Yuri German, Rovi",10
13 October 1999,"good movie, but come on, not the best","As much as I love Eastwood and his westerns, this movie is not his best western. Though it may be highly viewed as such, for that era or even now perhaps, I still believe Hang em High is the best western ever made. Westerns to me are action packed adventures not experiments for dramatic directing. The character Eastwood played Hang em High was a God compared to the easily subdued and capturable Blondie in TGTB&TU, and made HEH an adventure. Most of these praises for TGTB&TU stem from a childhood experience of this portrayal of the west so perhaps that explains the accolades from the hypnosis of novel directing. My suggestion to them is that they forget the fact that TGTB&TU reminds them of the dillydally days of youth and watch it for the film that it truly quite isn't. You'll probably wish IMDB had a comment removing feature

3 May 2004,Film making perfection,"""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" was Sergio Leone's third film in the Dollar trilogy and is easily the best. Taking place around the Civil War, the film revolves around three men, The Good in Blondie (Clint Eastwood), The Bad in Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) and The Ugly in Tuco (Eli Wallach). All three men have knowledge about a grave of gold and the uneasy alliances formed to achieve their goal in retrieving the cash is what the film is about. ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is sometimes touted as the pinacle in Leone's career but this film is where he will be remembered. Nearly every scene in this film is a classic and defines everything about Leone's skills, talents and his style of directing and story telling. Cinematography is excellent with gritty locations and vast green landscapes capturing the screen. Performances are perfect with Wallach leading the way, playing a character who is not just the film's comic point but a complete character and not just someone to laugh at to loosen tension. Eastwood's Man With No Name (he adopts Blondie) shows new depth to his acting and his delivery never falters, playing a character now iconic. Lastly Van Cleef plays Angel Eyes in one of the best villain turns in history. Memorable, slick and chilling he is a person you struggle to hold your nerve around, Cleef holds the character together and with little screen time shows what an effect he can have on an audience. Characters in a Leone film are people you will never forget, lines, stances, the eyes. Characters very core are not left exposed and stay with you. Morricone is genius in music and his most memorable score is here, I think ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is his best score but this is his most unforgettable and has the greatest theme in any picture. Morricone is a man on par with Leone for excellence and does the film credit. Now onto the greatest achievment, the directing. Sergio Leone made in total about seven films, this stands as his best in his field. Some directors take in favour style over substance or vice versa, Leone takes both into maximum consideration and is why his films are unique. What you see is as important as what you hear, this applies to viewers who dislike his observing technique. Leone respects the viewer and entices them in every scene to be a part of the action on screen. ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" has that great quality, the acting is perfect, the writing is perfect, the cinematography, sets, sound, editing and directing I can honestly say this film does not lack and is cinimatically perfect.",10
12 December 2012,How did Eastwood ever make it?,"This movie is obviously for immature and uneducated males. I could only watch about 20 minutes of it before becoming thoroughly disgusted. I suppose the creators of this film were aiming for that audience, since the dialogue is sparse and what there is of it is very juvenile. I've not seen many things with Eastwood that varied from this however. If you are into gratuitous violence and bloodshed, then this film certainly has that. There were so many non-continuities and unbelievable twists in the short portion of the film I watched that the entire film must contain a record number. I noted that there were more than two hours left of this thing when I switched to something more enjoyable.

2 December 2021,very good except...,"Sergio went all out, well almost, in this movie. The flaws are in the auxiliary characters and weak copy cat scenes.

In the unedited cut you see more of them.

The director spent a lot of money on extras and wonderful scenes, some farcical, stolen from Lawrence of Arabia in the desert.

The director probably spent some real money getting the only top established actor Eli Wallach but skimped BIG time on the odd characters met on the journey. Weak pitiful dubbed acting where these scenes could have, should have been great too. For the gun shop, the brother, the military commander, did he just pick someone off the streets?

22 June 2003,Interesting visuals,"Leone's third work in his man-with-no-name trilogy (although Eastwood's character did in fact have a name-- and no I'm not talking about ""Blonde"") and probably his most interesting visually. There are enormous battle scenes intermixed with the more usual operatic shootouts and epic shots of blank, desert expanses. There are tons of anachronisms in the film, but this isn't really any fault. Leone is not trying to come anywhere close to any form of realism and instead is working with melodrama and stylized acting that creates a well-conceived and detailed western fantasy world that is purely a joy to immerse yourself in.

17 August 1999,The best western ever,"This is the best western movie ever been made.

The ending is a classic: 3-men-duel, superb music by Ennio Morricone, Clint Eastwood as the man with no name and Sergio Leone behind the camera. The result can only be superb.

6 April 1999,A Perfect Western.,"Eli Wallach is impeccable as the ne'er do well villain you just love rooting for. Lee Van Cleef's ONLY good performance, to date. (He's dead, so we might see some better material coming from him soon.) And Ennio Morricone's music is the most recognizable sound known to man. (Star Wars might give it a run for its money.)

2 June 1999,The best western ever made,"I can't remember when I first saw this film but I knew right away that it would take a lot to top it. I nearly have it memorized, I've seen it so many times. I was equally enthralled with the score. The Montenegro version of the title song was a favorite of mine long before I was old enough to see the movie.I think it is what drew me to see the movie in the first place, though it was at a tough time. I wasn't old enough to see the movie, then it wasn't showing anymore when I ""matured"" to Jr. High age AND vcr's were yet to be household items. When the music & opening credits first rolled for me I remember thinking, ""What is THIS music?"", being only exposed to the 'refined' Hugo version. As the film ran I soon found myself totally absorbed, so much so, that I as aware of how unusual it felt. When I found myself wiping my chin, cheeks & eyes during 'Story of a Soldier' I knew this score and movie were something exceptional. I've never heard a soundtrack since that works so well with a film! The music during Tuco's search for Arch Stanton's grave and the 3-way gunfight are perfect!! My mine was racing...do you shoot the guy who's gonna shoot you? you DON'T want to shoot the guy who's gonna shoot the guy who's gonna shoot you BEFORE he shoots....Whew!! I've adopted ""There's two kinds of people"" as my own...seems to fit nearly any occasion. Ya see, there's two kinds of people in this world; those who love this film, and those that haven't seen it. Be sure to buy the soundtrack when you buy the movie...saves a trip later.",
3 June 1999,One of the best of all time,"This is really a great movie in all ways. The music is unforgettable. It really helps build suspense. The acting is great- especially Clint Eastwood in the role of The Man with no Name. It's one of those movies I could watch again and again. And the showdown at the end? Simply the best.

First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

6 January 2002,The ultimate western!,"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a classic for the ages. It follows three men, Blondie, Tuco, and Angel Eyes, as they violently move through the U.S. during the Civil War. What motivates these men? $200,000 in stolen gold that is buried in a grave at a cemetery. This movie is a non-stop action ride with one of the greatest and most memorable soundtracks in movie history. This film was also years ahead of it's time, with much more swearing and violence than was acceptable in 1967. Made in Italy, it pretty much beats the crap out of many American westerns out there. There isn't one boring or lagging scene in this movie. If you like westerns, watch it. If you like action movies, watch it. Hell, if you just like movies, watch it. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly does not disappoint. 9/10

26 November 2020,"The good, the bad and the ugly","The good,the bad and the ugly (1966)

Author/director: sergio leone

Main actors: Clint eastwood , lee van cleef

A western thriller

A bounty hunting scam joins two men in an uneasy alliance against a third in a race to find a fortune in gold buried in a remote cemetery.

Similar to this film : once upon a Time in the West , Once upon a time in America

My opinion : this is my all time favorite movie everything about it is amazing the story was interesting the acting was top notch and the music was stunning this movie is a part of a trilogy called (the spaghetti westerns) made by the Italians that's why they called it spaghetti western , this is the third movie in the trilogy and the best but the other two a fistful of dollars and for a few dollars more are great movies to watch. The movie is 3 hours long but it's so entertaining that you don't feel like it's 3 hours. This is my review I didn't want to spoil anything but if you haven't watched this movie what you doing ho watch it!",
4 July 2016,A film to stand the test of time as one of the best.,"I first saw this when i was 5 years old. 13 years later and many viewings later, it still blows me away. Let's just give you the numbers and letters that you want.

10/10

A+

5 stars

Two thumbs up etc. etc.

This is a masterpiece. A film so brilliantly epic focusing on insignificant characters of the West. Not only is it the greatest Western film of all time, it could easily be regarded as THE best film of all time by some. But let's get into it.

The story and characters. Both are simple. Very simple. And that's not a problem. From this movie we get the three typical characters; the bad guy, the funny man and the bad-ass ""good guy"". Each are unique in their simplistic way and have great chemistry between each other. The interactions between Blondie and Tuco on their adventure always sparks dark humour and Angel Eyes always has a sinister presence on screen. Their introductions to the audience are amazing, especially that of Angel Eyes, and they continue to be be lasting, memorable characters long after the film is finished. The story is a simple ""three men going after the same gold"" plot, but quickly grows into a Western epic as they travel around the open deserts, through towns, pulled into the bloody civil war and appropriately finishes in a graveyard. This entire epic adventure all occurred because of a simple treasure hunt plot. The movie therefore exceeds in providing great, memorable characters, and a simple plot that creates an epic adventure through the wild west.

The acting is great. Eastwood pulls off his best bad-ass role as Blondie, whenever appearing on screen. His presence within the film gives off this almost demigod-like character that roams the west - truly awesome. Eli Wallach is also great as the rude, dirty and humorous Tuco, who provides the bulk of the comedy in the film, especially when interacting with Eastwood. Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes is also superb, truly pulling off a great villain. He's calm, ruthless and brutal and always has a presence when he's in the shot, standing out with his piercingly calm eyes. Each character has great dialogue, with memorable phrases and one-liners and each have their moment in the film to shine. Their personalities, dialogue and looks, portrayed by a great cast, provides some of the coolest, most unique characters ever put to film.

The cinematography in this movie is astounding. Leone as a director is exceptional, always favouring the extreme long shots to get a feel for the location. The film is continuously breathtaking with its large, epic shots that capture the beauty of the west. Every frame of this film, is indeed a painting. Not only is the cinematography exceptional in the travelling and dialogue sequences of the film, it also excels in its action segments. A variety of long sweeping shots and precise close ups to eyes and guns brilliantly conveys tension in these scenes. Nothing is boring, everything is riveting. The quick cuts are never done during the action, but only leading up to it to effectively build the atmosphere of the showdowns, which are shot in a way in which doesn't confuse the audience and prominently displays the violence of the film. It feels gritty and real mixed with the myth-like invincibility of the main characters that lead them through showdowns and war-scale battles to a final showdown of epic proportions. It really gives the film an epic scale and never shies away from the drama and violence within the film, effectively capturing action and character emotions to portray a brilliant visual story.

And how can I not talk about the score. Ennio Morricone, my favourite composer and easily one of the best, provides an astounding western score to solidify this film into history. It's epic and atmospheric and fits the movie so well. The movie's theme is brilliant and iconic, unique and memorable earning its place with the likes of Jaws, Star Wars and Terminator. Morricone's score fits in beautifully with the excellent cinematography, which really helps to further add to the atmosphere of the setting. It's an iconic and brilliant score, suitable for the greatest western film of all time.

Overall, everything in this film just comes together perfectly. Everything. Sure, it's 3 hour run time isn't everybody's cup of tea but you should at least treat yourself to this epic at least once before you die. It's characters, cinematography, music, etc is all perfect. It is a perfect film. It has stood the test of time and will continue to do so for many more decades. A cinematic masterpiece. The western to rule all westerns.

And not a bad pick for the greatest film of all time if I do say so myself.",10

27 November 2015,Nothing less than the finest western ever created!,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a classic 'spaghetti' western, with unforgettable characters and, in my opinion, the greatest ending to a movie ever. Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef give 3 iconic performances. There is no good, there is only bad. Although film is named 'The good', none of the characters are heroic. Eastwood is a backstabbing fraud. Wallach is a dirty rebel. And Van Cleef is a lying bounty hunter. The story is the first of its kind, an undeniably iconic story in fact. The soundtrack is one of the best ever made, Ennio Morricone has made countless other iconic tunes, but absolutely none of them can beat his incredible 'Ecstasy of gold'. The film has loads of quotable dialogue such as ""There are 2 kinds of people in this world... Those with loaded pistols... And those who dig... You dig."" Its 3 hour run time flies by, it has a fantastic 3 act structure and a truly unforgettable ending. Strongly recommend this one.

25 September 2003,"Simply put, the Best Western ever filmed...","Growing up, there are certain things that you identify with, perhaps sounds, images, or smells; things that make you smile. For me, the one thing that does it all the time, is the musical score for ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"". Every time I hear it, all I can think about is Eli Wallach's great grin, Clint Eastwood's stoic gaze, and Lee Van Cleef's evil eyes. All in great fun, Director Sergio Leone's western epic marked the high point for this genre, and showed that you could do a classy movie in which the leading characters do awful things such as: 1) Double-cross each other constantly; 2) Kill more than their share of men; 3) Condone greed at its fullest form.

The movie has the three main characters, Eastwood, a.k.a. ""Blondie"", as The Good (if you can consider him the good guy in this role), Wallach, a.k.a. ""Tuco"", as The Ugly, and Van Cleef, a.k.a. ""Angel Eyes"", as The Bad. All three of them are going after the gold, as Blondie and Tuco, while they were settling some scores between them, happened to have a casual meeting with a moribund soldier, who told them about it, and head in one of the most entertaining journeys in cinematic history. The fact that Leone chose the Civil War as the backdrop for his story, only created a sort of ""irony"", as there they were, young American men dying for something that they believed in, and here we have our three main characters weaseling their way through one of the battles, in order to get the gold. Truly classic!!!!

The score by Ennio Morricone is in itself a main character of the movie, and it really creates that familiarity that every movie needs to have, in order to make a connection with its audience. The showdown at the end of the movie, has got to be one of the best climax moments ever shot, and ever seen on film (I only wonder how it never makes it into any of Clint Eastwood's highlight reels, during the ceremonies where they salute him). And the ending of the movie, only glorifies it more for its fans.

I have to say, having watched more movies than I count in my lifestyle, that ""The Good, The Bad & The Ugly"" is one of the Top 5 films that I have ever seen. The movie runs over two and a half hours, and I have seen it over 20 times, yet, it never gets old. This is a true gem, and one movie that is worth watching, if only because it carries the tag of ""THE BEST WESTERN EVER FILMED"". I know that it is somewhat contradictory to admit that an Italian director produced the best film of this very American genre, but you gotta give Leone his due, because he managed to create a true masterpiece. I LOVE THIS FILM.",10
5 December 2022,Best stylised western,"A truely wonderful viewing experience, if you get to see it at a retrospective on a cinema screen then you are lucky.

While the acting of the Italian actors is a little hit and miss, and the dubbing can be a little strange, the three lead actors are brilliant in their stylised portrayals. Eli Wallach is, for me, the most enjoyable as the ugly rogue.

There is at least two different cuts out there, the European or French version has a few more scenes than the one I'm used to seeing here in Australia. And while those scenes aren't intégral to the story they do setup some dialogue in later scenes for a more appreciated pay off.

2 August 2005,A western for those who think they don't like westerns,"This is the one western that everyone should see whether you like westerns or not. The pathos, character studies, separate story lines and acting draw the viewers in to such a degree that one forgets the genre and gets immersed in the richness of the script and its diversity. Clint Eastwood's portrayal of the Man With No Name is his signature role. Eli Wallach makes Tuco the man you love to hate, and Lee Van Cleef is simply evil (and ""ugly""). The score of Ennio Morricone has become iconic and the core and side show to film festivals featuring director Sergio Leone's other films. The quest for greed and the twist at the end are enough for anyone to identify with who has bought a lottery ticket. The grittiness of the Civil War battle scene and the actions of ""Blondie"" and Tuco to both end the bloodshed and clear the way for their treasure are effective to convey the sense of agony of the Civil War. The prisoner scene and the music played during the torture scene is macabre and surreal.

So in other words there is something to trigger a variety of emotions and thoughts. The camaraderie created between Blondie and Tuco through their reward escapades to the march across the desert forced on Blondie by Tuco to their ultimate decisions at the climax (no spoiler here!), is twisted but understandable.

The brief interlude at the mission fully explains Tuco's choices and makes us understand clearly the relationship between Tuco and his brother. We get a glimpse of Tuco' mentality and why he's where he is ( a practical choice in life!). Lee Van Cleef's scenes show what motivates him and that there is no morality that stands in his way........... All in all a movie not to be missed.",10
17 April 2018,Probably the greatest and coolest Western ever made,"If you have only one western to watch for your life, then this is the one. Sergio made spaghetti westerns very original, life realistic detailed oriented. Soundtrack of his friend legendary music composer: Ennio Morricone is just out of this world. I always say - ""If there is heaven somewhere upstairs, and it is not playing Ennio Morricone music in the background. It is not heaven for me."" And the cast: The Clint, The Van and The Eli are just amazing to watch.

17 December 2007,"The old, gritty West and life in general","A great many people of our current iPod generation have missed out on some of the most brilliant, daring and artistic endeavours in film during the sixties and seventies. That was a period when film still held onto its artistic impulse, when the modern day blockbuster, complete with stunning visual effects, mind-bogglingly fast action sequences, and miraculously thin story lines and characterisations was still in its infancy. Over time, as some nostalgic folk of the 'then' would say, 'the world has become too fast, and kids today don't give a damn about deeper stuff'. Indeed it has; through the development of film over the decades, we see - at least a glimpse of - this seemingly reductive summarisation of the vast social and cultural changes in the world. The legendary final scene of this film, where the three principal characters face, is roughly about five minutes long, from the time they implicitly agree to this 'solution' to the first 'bang' of Eastwood's pistol. In these five minutes, Leone uses music and recurring shots of the men to create the tension, engineering a sense of finality and fatality in the situation that could quite possibly take all their lives. At that critical moment, greater importance is given to this all-encompassing tension, where the entire film's plot and the journey must culminate in a decisive end, than to the eventual outcome, which would be revealed in all eventuality. As audience, Leone wants us to participate in this tension, to completely transport ourselves into the simmering, immoral West, and feel the presence of death as the characters do, and therefore to achieve a cinematic orgasm that involves both the intellectual and visceral, in turn immortalising it. This painstaking attention to detail, the need to go beyond the bare plot and action, and the urge to create a cinematic environment that transcends, is something that we see too little of today. Indeed, we are privy to this intellectual desire from the very start.

The first shot in the film, of the brusque, brutally masculine face of a minor character (who returns later) that somehow eerily seems directly born out of the harshness of the desert is wonderful example of heightened realism that epitomised films of that time. We can almost smell and feel the sweat on the man's face; we can delve into his eyes, into his soul, and through it, witness the moral degradation that Leone wants us to observe. This film could easily have been given a title, with something to the effect of earning some 'dollars', as are the other two in the trilogy, but Leone decides to punctuate it with an exposition on morality with the title he gives it. As any discerning viewer would infer, it is dichotomous to the nature of the pertinent characters. All three are 'ugly', and Leone tries of remind us with his concluding piece that morality is a vague, invariably overlapping concept that is too often oversimplified. Using the west as a setting, we realise that people are too complex, too evil to start with, and any attempt to glorify one is to shun this gruesome reality. This perfectly explains the unique collection of faces in the film, with are all polished with the desert's sweat that makes them impenetrable to scrutiny of any kind.

The three adjectives that form the title function almost completely on one side of the moral boundary. And yet, no one can call the film entirely immoral or fatalistic, for we witness traces of humanity in the most absurd of circumstances. Blondie offering a cigar to a dying soldier and providing him warmth is once example of this. Understanding this moral equation, we can then justify the labels given to the three protagonists. Unlike the other two, Blondie keeps his sadistic impulses to a minimum. Also, he tellingly suggests the method of resolution to decide the recipient of the money which leads to the final confrontation scene. Most notably though, he underlines his seeming sense of fairness by taking his rightful share of the money, albeit making it impossible for Tuco to collect his. Unlike him, Angel Eyes shows no pretence of such selflessness, and is perfectly willing to brutalise Tuco (another chilling scene) to get the secret out of him. However, even he believes in simply completing his job, and would not resort to perfidy that Tuco is culpable of, making him the 'ugly' version of humanity. As we see, all three differ from one another only in degree, unlike the ironic suggestion of the title.

Overall, this is a complete auteur's film, where Leone underscores memorable action sequences with great atmospheric detail and an underlying message that is so finely sewed beneath the more palpable layers that most of us tend to overlook it completely. This may not be the pinnacle of artistic cinema of 'that' time, but it reflects the sophistication a film can manifest beneath the superficial layers. Its slowly unraveling scenes and attention to detail is reminder to all of us to stop, and sometimes look at life with a keener eye, instead of being constantly pre-occupied with our daily, routine existence.",8
7 April 2001,Nothing ugly about this film,"Third film in Sergio Leone's 'Dollars' trilogy is probably the most visually beautiful of the three. The actors play their parts to perfection, Van Cleef does a complete 180 from his 'For a Few Dollars More' role and even though he has the least developed part he plays it superbly, Wallach is amazing, and Eastwood is as coolly gruff as usual.

I do feel that has a weaker plot than 'For a Few Dollars More'. There are also a few too many plotholes (how did Angel Eyes get a job as a Union Camp officer so quickly, and how does Tuco know him when they meet there?).

The Ecstacy of Gold sequences near the end with Tuco is among the greatest moments in movie history. As usual Morricone and Leone make one the greatest tandems in film, ever.

9/10 in my book.",9
11 February 2000,Greatest Spaghetti Western ever!,"From the opening sequence to the final shootout, The Good, The Bad and the Ugly doesn't cease to surprise and provoke unrestrained guffaws and laughs as Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach emerge as three foes searching to get the better of each other, while at the same time making as much money as possible. Ennio Morricone's music twangs with delight at the perfect moments, emphasizing the most startling twists in the plot's development.

After developing the characters with a few minor sketches, the film switches to the main plot: finding a treasure buried inside a grave only Eastwood's character can identify. The way in which Van Cleef, Wallach, and Eastwood exchange the upper hand in their objective is done brilliantly, as Director Leone completely disregards all previous norms of Westerns and anti-Westerns. People shoot each other at will (no classic shootouts), shootouts are bloody, and an element of dark comedy pervades the entire film.

The Civil War looms in the background of the story. It doesn't take away from the film, but it adds an element of the reality of war. Lots of people die (thus the existence of the huge graveyard for the final scene), but the main characters remain indifferent. Their indifference emphasizes the point that this film is outside the realm of normal - and thus takes the classic format of a spaghetti western.

The ending is not to be missed. This trilogy, and especially the last few minutes of this film, is what made Eastwood a star.",10
15 May 2003,An outstanding movie that transcends time.,"Since we already know what this film is all about so I won't bore you with the details when all I really want to say is that having just seen the English Extended version, the movie finally makes sense and proves it's self to me as being one of the best (if not the best) western ever made. Clint, Eli, and Lee all give Oscar level performances; the added scenes glue the movie together and make it the movie it was meant to be. This version of the movie transcends time, 1966 or 2003, this movie works in both time periods and it's to bad that Oscar will never recognize it's brilliance and give it the awards it deserves.

1 February 2000,The Greatest Film Ever,"This is a virtually flawless film. Stylish and artistic, it balances a violent storyline with spells of humour (""If you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk!""), and pathos, with three actors born for the roles the play here. If the distinction between who is good and who is bad is a little blurred, so much the better. This is a damn fine movie, and anyone who hasn't seen it is missing out big-time!

26 December 2022,Now I know to what that movie owes its reputation,"I don't know any kind of person who has never heard the name of this movie. Finally, after years of its release I watched the movie while the sun was rising. Even the soundtrack is enough to give 10 stars to that masterpiece. Everything in the movie is a total awesomeness. The last scene and the camera angles, scenes it is almost impossible to believe the fact that this movie was filmed almost 60 years ago. I am not much into wild western movies but this movie is in my top 5 right know regardless of genre that's it! I am really sad that I will never be able to watch the movie from the very beginning with the same feelings again. I will never get thrilled as much as the first time watching in the last scene but I am also happy and regret that I waited for years to watch it.

29 September 2014,"Sergio Leone created the best western movie, if not the best movie ever..","Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

30 July 2021,Western without equal,"Many words have been spoken and written about this film to which I can add but a few as a descriptor: Marvellous, peerless and magnificent Suffice to say this is one of my three favourite films of all time, the other being The Deer Hunter and 2001: A Space Odyssey TG, TB, ATU has elements of both of those films, from a sweeping storyline to sweeping vistas, and it is almost justified to call this an opera set to a western genre.

Draw your own conclusions from my final comment: This film was so good that in one way it nearly killed the western genre, after all how could any western that followed be anywhere near as complete and fulfilling...

8 February 2004,A good spaghetti western,"The Good, the Bad and The Ugly really was appealing. I watched the director's cut version and although it was quite long in time, it didn't feel like very long film. Shortly, I liked the film, because I liked the spaghetti western features in it: like long scenes where the camera just shows the faces of people. Spaghetti westerns really have something that westerns which are made, for example, in Hollywood lack.

The movie had everything in order. The plot was interesting, scenery fit the atmosphere perfectly and of course the cast was great. The main characters, including Clint Eastwood as the good, were credible. Unfortunately I have not much experiment in other westerns, so I have no proper film to compare it to. But I think it was a really good film.

5 May 2004,what may I say that hasn't already been said.....,"I first saw this film in 1968 in Sydney, I was 18. I had seen many westerns before and I had seen the first two Leone's in New Zealand the year before. I had also been a fan of CE and LvC for a very long time. The version I saw was cut and many key scenes were truncated or left out completely(I had read the paperback in NZ-great paperback!!!!). Still, I was inspired enough to write a musical composition based on CE's character. This piece was recorded in 1970 and featured on a hit LP I had with my band Blackfeather - it was called Manco's Theme. I recommended the film to everybody I knew at the time. The point to all this, this movie, although wearing 'western' clothes, is the closest thing I've seen to real art in the cinema. Like all great art , it has a life of its own. A++++++ (highest rating I can give)

18 July 2002,The Ecstasy Of Gold...,"I've read ALL of the posts. Took a while. Some eloquently summed up exactly what I thought of this truly great film. Others seemed to dwell upon minor points that intrigued the writers.

All are worthy of their place.

No summing up of the film.

No point in that.

All I can try to do is place my feelings upon a page...

The musical score - NEVER has there been a soundtrack which has set my emotions aflame such as this one. From the 3 individual themes which seem to sum up all there is about the characters in question to the lament over the death of a soldier to the greedy excitement of the discovery of the cemetary & finally the brooding menace of the final showdown. The master @ work. The direction - close-ups, pan-backs, no talking for first 10 mins, the vistas, the scope, the grandeur...no, I could go on & on... The cast - all were perfectly cast - in fact I read in the biog by Patrick Agan that this was written to be the vehicle for Clint to true stardom. It is a pity that Eli did not have that boost as much. And as for Lee Van Cleef - never have I seen death so close up!

For me there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with this film save perhaps that it ends (in true & fitting style - off into the sunset - or at least the distance).",
6 January 2014,Not good movie,"I was battling weather to give this movie a 4 Â½ or 5, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt. Once you get that high in my books, itâ??s pretty much the same. The movie was amazing and was one of the best western movies I have seen. It runs three hours and although it did feel long, it wasnâ??t a bad thing. I kept on wanting to follow the characterâ??s journey to the end and find out what was going to happen, regardless of how long it took. The acting was great and the soundtrack was phenomenal. It added to the films mood immensely.

This film obviously has inspired many modern filmmakers today (Rodriguez, Tarantino, among others) and I had to keep on reminding myself that this film was made in 1966. I either thought it was made with todayâ??s film techniques or some scenes were actually shot during the civil war time period. It really took me back and followed it up with a great story.

The actors gave dialog in their native tongues and as a result there is a poor voice over synchronization throughout the movie. I found this slightly distracting at times, but it did not deter me from enjoying the film and Sergio Leoneâ??s great filmmaking brilliance shone through. The sweeping panoramic shots were incredible and appealing throughout the film as well.

Although I loved the characters Blondie - The Good, played by Clint Eastwood and Angel Eyes - The Bad, played by Lee Van Cleef; Tuco - The Ugly, played by Eli Wallach had an absolutely great performance and pushed the film to a greater level.",3
25 January 2003,It's the only movie I will never get sick of.,"Ok so Maybe I've seen a few movies in my time..... But this work of art is just genius. I have seen this Sergio Leone masterpiece more times than you can imagine. It's quite simply one of the best movie's EVER made. Sergio's direction is so brilliant, Clint as always astounds. Eli and Lee Van Cleef are simply joyous to the screen. I wish a time machine were invented that could place me in this wonderful world. I wonder where all the dreamers have gone? Let us still have the option to make good our escape and disappear into the fantasies of modern escapism................

25 February 2005,Better than what you may think,"Sergio Leone is obviously a talented director and he has produced many memorable films in his career. His westerns include the 'spaghetti' trilogy and the very impressive 'Once upon a time in the West'. He also orchestrated a fascinating and enjoyable film later on in the 80's with 'Once upon a time in America'. These are a few of his films and all were very entertaining with their complex and intricate story lines. The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is no exception, as we venture into the dry and sandy landscape (filmed in Spain), the characters each find themselves caught in the firing line of the Civil War. Leone has focused on this as he clearly opposed and disliked the war (he felt it was wrong and unjust)and he makes an effort to portray the Civil War as meaningless and conflicting with what should be progression for America. Aside from the political aspect of the film we find a superb story that tells a tale of how three rogue individuals cross paths while searching for a prize more than any 'Wanted' poster could bore. The sum of $200,000 requires all three to form some kind of co - operation and, despite the tense conflict, we are led along their paths to the breathtaking finale where we see the last dance of death between the three gunslingers. Hugely entertaining with its slick dialogue and vast yet intriguing surroundings, we find ourselves in the mist of ferocious gun fights between enemies and old foes. The marvellous score composed by Ennio Morricone is one of the most recognised in film history and it certainly delivers a special added bonus to an already superb film.",9

9 June 2016,One of (if not) the greatest films of all time.,"When I hear ""3hr run time"" I sigh. Few movies that clock in at 3 hours please me. Apocalypse Now Redux had me bored two hours in, King Kong (2005 version) was too stretched out, and while I love them, the Lord of the Rings films could've been shorter.

But Sergio Leone's The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is an exception. Never will there be a movie as classic or timeless as this. It's gritty, brutal, realistic, and unpredictable. The acting and cinematography are put to great use, and thank gosh, it knows when to shut up and let the score do the talking.

The film has a simple plot, which I feel makes it better. It's about three gunslingers who race to find $20,000 in gold. It's simple enough that a moron could enjoy it as equally as a genius would.

And the writing isn't even the best part. Ennio Morricone's classic score is one of the best in cinema history, and Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach's acting is superb. Place that in with intense gunfights, a smooth Civil War battle scene, and one of the best movie endings of all time, and you've got one of the greatest movies ever.

""There are two kinds of people, my friend. Those who love this movie and those who dig... You dig"".",10
29 September 2005,A Masterpiece,"Really, there's nothing more to say. The characters in this movie are the best I've ever seen, the music is some of the best I've ever heard, the acting is some of the best I've ever seen, everything is amazing.

Historical inaccuracies really don't matter. This is a work of art. Its kind of a shame that technology wasn't as good in the 60's as it is now, because there are noticeable parts where the music recording suffers because of it.

There is so much good about this movie. Characters that appear only briefly are genuinely human and realistic; you are immediately convinced that they are real people with histories. Not to mention, every character in this movie is likable. Tuco, Angeleyes, Blondie, the Union captains; anybody that shows up for any length of time is a great character. Memorable lines drop left and right because of the great dialog.

Buy the DVD. Right now. Seriously. This is an incredible movie, and the picture quality on the DVD is simply amazing.",10

12 October 2015,Still unsurpassed,"This movie was so far ahead of it's time. It is not your average western. It's an epic cinematic masterpiece. And it was filmed without a multimillion dollar budget, expensive CGI effects, etc... Just an incredible musical score, good screenplay and an unbelievably talented cast.

Ironically, it turns out that one of the greatest Westerns was produced in Italy, (filmed in Spain) a terrific triumph of film-making and musical composition there.  That is the most evocative music and symbolism the Western genre ever had... --and remains unsurpassed.

The graveyard scene shows that the film is not about what appears to be about. This is a film about the US civil(or any) war. And the cemetery: the outcome of the war. The three main characters are only side characters in the whole story.

I really miss this kind of movies. Good story, great directing and incredible music. Not like the junk we get nowadays.",10

5 December 2018,A grand closure to a fantastic saga.,"The final of the trilogy is considered the best also and with The Good The Bad and the Ugly Sergio Leone's ""The man with no name"" series comes to a grand closure featuring a stand off that has since become legendary not just among cinema fans but in the general populace the world over. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are fantastic in their respective, iconic roles and the Mediterranean country-side has seldom looked better. Fantastic pacing, witty dialogues and grand cinematography make this film a must watch for anyone- not just fans of the Western genre.

Sergio leone never seizes to amaze you and he does the same in this epic sphagetti western whuch provided the base to numerous movie refrences and an epic soundtrack by ennio morricone which remains in your head till this day.

3 June 2003,"The Good, the Better and the Best.","I have, like most film buffs, my own top ten favourite films. No comment is necessary here on the story of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly--we all know it and admire it by now. Occasionally, a film comes along which makes it into the 'top ten', e.g Saving Private Ryan, Dave, Schindler's List, Life is Beautiful etc. However The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is, was and I reckon always will be my numero uno. I enjoy the film as much today as when I first saw it in 1967. In 1968 I WALKED eleven miles to a local town to see it and walked home again! Some thirty five years ago! No Videos, or DVD's in those days! I also, when I got my first car, drove to whichever local cinema the GBU was showing on the night. When I eventually got a video version I thought all my birthdays had arrived at once. What's more, I was lucky enough to get the version which I had never seen before and is seldom seen since on TV, where the captions to each character appear in English, i.e ""THE GOOD"", ""THE BAD"", and ""THE UGLY"", instead of ""IL BUONO"", ""IL BRUTTO,"" ""IL CATTIVO"", and a version which contain extra unseen (at that time)footage, eg. when Angel eyes gives Maria (Bill Carson's girl)a bigger hiding than we usually saw on the cinema version and when Wallace gives Tuco the severe beating in the POW camp, it goes on much longer than I had seen in other versions. Only recently I obtained the DVD, showing some scenes which were shot in Italian, but never in English and never incorporated in the final English spoken version. (They were in a ""Director's Cut"" version on a German channel some time back, but I suppose it was easy to incorporate them in a German version, which was dubbed anyway into German). I look forward to some method of ""digitally"" adding them to the English speaking version. These scenes were and would be still important to the continuity and understanding of the scenes. One is were Lee van Cleef, during his quest for Bill Carson, visits a military hospital. He sees the absolute horror of war and this is the only time that his character becomes almost human. He shakes his head in disbelief at the futility of the war. (Eastwood echos this belief in the futility of the war in a later scene at the bridge.) Another scene shows more of the torture that Tuco put's Eastwood's character through in the desert. A quite funny scene too! and two scenes, one before the arrival at the monastry and one after leaving, which helps the viewer to understand the whole ""Pablo Ramirez and Monastry"" scenes better. However the DVD did not show one scene which I saw on the German version. One typical Eastwood scene, where he outdraws and shoots three of van Cleef's henchmen. It is also my all time favourite soundtrack. Favourite scene- Blondie and Tuco carrying the stretcher through the wounded and dead soldiers, two soldiers pass by, Blondie and Tuco lift an arm and a leg of a body, the two soldiers pass on, Blondie and Tuco drop the limbs like two lumps of meat. Favourite script - Tuco-(while reading paper message) ""It's for you, iidd, idii, ii--"" Blondie- (reaching for paper) ""idiot !"" Tuco- (Glancing up) ""Huh?"" Blondie-(handing him the paper) ""It's for you !"". Priceless !",

7 May 2013,coolest movie I've ever seen,"first of all I had thought the movie would be awful and I don't want to see it as it is 1966 movie.the only reason i have seen it is because my dad insisted me to see.he said that he's so crazy about the movie in his youth. But as i started watching the movie no feeling like 'movie of my dad's time' came into my mind.

i watched the whole movie 3 hour long without any other ounce of thought but only thinking about the 3 characters which were shown by the director so effectively that the 3 of them will never leave your mind even after completion of the movie. Inspite of the variation of the characters we equally love 3 of them .and the cool music act like catalyst to the visually stunning cinematography. Clint Eastwood is so cool that he may remain as an idol for so many generations for that kind of roles.

I previously had a feeling that Tarantino is best for the cool movies but after seeing this i felt he is so far away from this so called 'best'.I finally understood why my dad is so crazy about his movie .and i also insist all others to see this first who admire Tarantino as legend.",10

29 April 2003,Glam bang action!!,"The Good The Bad and the Ugly is comes across like the scorching sun in the middle of a desert. Its high octane action together with breathtaking cinematography and powerful characterization are a treat to watch.

The film is about three outlaws: each peculiar in himself. Blundy is the good. Although he is an outlaw, at heart he nurtures a good spirit. (consider the scene where he lets a dying soldier smoke a puff off his cherhoot.). This role catapulted Clint Eastwood to the height of stardom. Eastwood's flat intensity, the terse emotions and that faintest smile ever imagined suited the requirements of this role perfectly. 'Angel Eyes' is the bad, crooked guy. I couldn't have imagined any other actor than Lee Van Cleef essaying this role to the hilt.

Perhaps the most happening and interesting character is of Tuco, the ugly. Eli Wallach provides the much needed comical interludes through this character in this gunslinging action packed potboiler.

On the whole, the film is a landmark in the western genre and is liked by fans even today, 35 years after it was made.",

22 May 2011,My favorite movie,"Well, this is my first review, so I thought it might as well be for my favorite film. I just love everything about this film, the writing, the cinematography, the cast, Ennio Morricone's score, everything.

Even the title gives the film more depth as the film has to prove to you that Blondie is the good, Tuco is the ugly and Angel Eyes is the bad. Each is proved in a different way. With Blondie, we have serious doubts when we first see the title ""The Good"" under his picture right after he leaves Tuco in the desert. As the movie goes on we slowly come to realize that though he may not be a saint, he is certainly better than his two counterparts, this is proved at the very end when he allows Tuco to keep his share of the gold, even though he could have easily taken it all for himself. This is something we cannot imagine Angel Eyes or Tuco doing. With Tuco, it's different, we first see ""The Ugly"" title when we first see him and we are not even sure what it means, the best conclusion we can come to perhaps is that he certainly doesn't look very attractive in the scene. But we later see that 'ugly' is meant to mean pitiful in this situation, because although Tuco is a vile character, we pity him because we find out about his past. Finally there's Angel Eyes, with him we have no doubts about the text ""The Bad"" which appears after he murders his employer, this certitude of his evil nature is reaffirmed throughout the film. So the character development in this film seems not so much to be with the characters but with our own perception of them.

Opinions vary about what the film really is. Is it a satire of westerns? Is it a an antiwar film? Is it camp? Is it art? Is it all of these things maybe? I think perhaps Leone left the film to the viewers own interpretation, and that, I suppose, is the way art is.

This films does have a few small flaws: 1.The Ecstasy of Gold scene is a little unbelievable, could a person like Tuco, who seems to struggle with reading, find the name on a grave while running through a graveyard in circles? This scene is also a little hard to watch because the camera follows Tuco very fast, causing the screen to blur. This does work artistically however as it seems to have present a ""blinded with greed"" metaphor. 2. There are a few other unrealistic scenes, such as the one where Tuco and Blondie walk through an abandoned town and kill Angel eyes men , conveniently placed cannon shots aid them and they kill men shooting from the hip, while the Angel Eyes men carefully aim and miss. The flaws in this film are easily outweighed by it's strengths however: 1. The characters are very well written and portrayed. 2. The pacing is superb (it seemed no longer then A Fistful of Dollars really). 3. The story, while not one of the films stronger aspects, is still very good. 4. The dialog is brilliant. 5. It has one of the greatest scores of all time. 6. The cinematography is stunning.

Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo is truly a great piece of cinema.",10

6 June 2022,"Classic, but not my favorite","The 3rd in the ""Spaghetti Western"" series. Definitely has the best title. For my tastes, the storyline wanders all over the place. It's difficult to keep track of who is with who and where the plot is heading. Fist Full of Dollars and Few Dollars More were tighter plots with just as much action. FDM is my favorite of the yree.

27 August 2011,See you later. idiots.......it's for you,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

2 June 2012,The Fourth Greatest Film of All Time,"This is what a perfect film is, I admit it dose not have the best plot ever nevertheless that is made up for in every other aspect of the film. The camera shot when Angel Eyes is holding the candle holds amazing likeness to the shot that introduces Frank (Fonda) in Once Upon a Time in The West. Sergio Leone really takes his time to make the characters three dimensional, the amount of character he gives to Blondie, Angel Eyes and Tuco Ramirez is astounding. This film is about two things, the civil war and the three mens search for gold. The weird humour in it is absolutely brilliant. You can tell Leone put some real elbow grease into this movie. The charisma he gives Tuco is just perfect. And I can't believe I have not mentioned the music, it perfectly fits the movie.

12 October 2022,Excelent western movie,"The Bad, the Good and the Ugly is a great movie. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good western. The acting is top notch and the story is very engaging. However, there are some negative aspects to the film. First of all, it is very violent. There is a lot of gun fighting and people getting killed. If you are not a fan of violence, then this might not be the movie for you. Secondly, the movie is quite long. It is over three hours long, so make sure you have plenty of time to watch it. Lastly, the ending is a bit abrupt and unsatisfying. Despite these negatives, The Bad, the Good and the Ugly is still a great movie that I would recommend to any fans of the western genre.

5 May 2012,This movie is Insane,"There's a lot reviews out there - without summing up the obviousness of this movie's awesomeness I just felt compelled to add that i've seen hundreds of westerns let alone thousands of movies and yet I continue to watch this movie over and over - there is so much magic in this movie's score and its corresponding leitmotifs. At times the dialogue may seem funny and the movie seems slow but the weird thing about this movie vs. other movies (where this would be boring) this music plays a key element and the cinematography is so distinct that you can easily overlook it.

As the film buffs/majors on this site will tell you, the frame of the camera shot is what dictates who can see who, which is amazing in that people suddenly pop into view with some badass line or two... Again, the score is not to be underestimated. Alongside the cinematography, you get lost in this quest for $200k of gold...

The ridiculous scenes re: cinematography and music make this so different & memorable from other westerns that are classics too (wild bunch, OK Corral, Winchester, etc) - the foreigness is apparent and adds to its allure. This is a great movie! I can't stop playing the parts i love in it!!!!",10
25 August 2014,The Classic Spaghetti Western,"This movie is so good I have to watch it every 5 years. It tells an epic spaghetti western tale of the lone rider and his battle for good against absolute evil and the general pollution of the ugly. As a western with civil war background there is no lack of action. Just see it because you can't simply describe this movie.

From the first scene where you are introduced to the depravity of the ugly, this movie grips your attention. Then, there is the roller coaster of evil characters to wade through. Finally, there is the ultimate cowboy shootout with Leone's great use of eyes to convey the battle to come.

The best Western ever filmed, and my personal choice for the best film ever made. Spectacular.

14 March 2006,Great movie!,"This is the best western movies ever for me. You have real baditos and pistolero in movie. Eli Wallach role of Tuco is bigger than life and one of the best in film history. Only Henry Fonda maybe can beat Van Cleef for best bad guy in westerns. Great directing from Sergio Leone and his best movie ever... Excellent music by El MAestro Ennio Morricone. And in the end living legend Clint ""Man without name"" Eastwood play his second best role in his wester movies (first one is role for William Munny)... I like the move when I was 5 years old and I like that same move when I now 27 (I will never forget Morricone music and gunfight Tuco vs. three pistolera on the beginning of the movie..)

It captures the whole essence of the Civil War era Wild West. There is enough plot to make 3 or 4 films. I consider the graveyard standoff to be the best scene ever in a film. What a classic!

And to think Lee Marvin was too busy to play the Bad ( Like Man Who Shot Liberty Valance wasn't enough Bad Guy) Still Lee and Sergio Would have made great pairing. On last thought I wished Sergio could've enticed Clint to Once Upon a Time In West If for no other reason to see Clint play Harmonica

4 May 2023,The pinnacle of Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name trilogy,"Blazed new trails in cynicism, dark humor and cussed violence for the genre. Co-starring Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef, if a Spaghetti Western was ever shot, scored or edited better, it would only be Leone's follow-up ""Once Upon a Time in the West.

Both epic and intimate, the sun-baked panoramas of the West (actually Spain) and the gigantic battles of North against South have a counterpoint in the dramas that play out between the three men.

The movie that solidified Eastwood's iconography. Leone's dazzling Techniscope cinematics far surpass the familiar plot. And well, Ennio Morricone. His soundtrack is one the most powerful in the history cinema and it alone is the reason why this film should be so highly appreciated.

""There are two kinds of people my friend, those who love Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and those who resist the machismo and gallows humor of what is arguably the definitive spaghetti western.""",9
27 May 2001,The western to end all westerns,"Without a doubt, the greatest western ever made. Clint Eastwood's crown jewel of the ""man with no name"" series, in perfect synchronization with the brilliant portrayals of evil personified by Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach (who is eminently more diabolical here than in ""The Magnificent Seven""). Add a hauntingly beautiful and powerful musical score combined with some of the most spectacular panoramas ever captured on film, and you have a classic in the truest sense of the word.

Forget john wayne and his poncing about, and watch this instead. clint gives what would for him become a typical performance (brooding loner) with good support from lee van cleef (subtly evil) and a twisting performance from eli wallach as tuco (greed above all else, even his own morals, although the part where he visits his brother is interesting) excellent over all.

30 May 2003,Transcends all westerns - the epitome of an all-time great film,"Not only is this film by far the greatest western ever made (Shane, et.al. don't even come close), it is one of the greatest films ever made. The larger-than-life characters fill the screens endless, gorgeous panorama. The movie is brilliant. Sublime. Exquisitely surreal. The entire civil war sequence comes out of nowhere and raises the movie to another level. The script is filled with memorable lines. Each one perfect for the time and place and the person delivering it. And what can you say about Clint, Lee, and Eli? Perfection, that's all.

To Sergio Leone: Thank You for this masterpiece!

Tuco: ""When you're hanging at the end of that rope, you can feel the devil bite your ass! I want a bigger share of the reward money!""

Blondie: ""Well, my friend, you may be at the end of the rope, but I do the cutting. And if we cut down on my percentage, it's liable to effect my aim.""",10
24 December 2004,Good movie,"Okay, so yeah I'm a girl. But this movie rocked! It had a really good action, some good camera work, and a lot of really dirty disgusting guys running around shooting each other! And I must admit, Clint Eastwood is one of my favorite actors of all time...

The interaction between the good, the bad, and the ugly is amazing. I mean none of them really like each other, but they all need each other to get the gold. Tuco and ""Blondie"" are really good in the scenes in which they're together. The one thing that kept bugging me though was the dubbing. I mean, I know they had too, but there was SOO much dubbing! It kept getting to me. But, it might not to other people.

All in all, I think this movie is really good.

5 January 2019,Italian Western at it's peak!,"This movie, in my opinion Sergio Leones best work of all time, is arguably also the greatest Western of all time. Lee Van Cleefs acting performance as Antagonist is remarkable and the great acting all around is perfectly rounded up with incredible cinematic western shots, including the most iconic mexican stand-off and of course Ennio Morricones iconic soundtrack.

Whether you like Western or not, If you love film, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly should be on your Watchlist.

3 March 2014,One of my all time favs!,"I know what I'm about to write is nothing new but I figured I would write a review on one of my favorite movies.

This movie kicks ass, Eastwood is the man, I dig Van Cleef but my favorite character has to be Tuco played by the still kicking at almost 100 Eli Wallach!

Great cinematography, minimal dialogue, and kick ass violence is what this film is all about. Yes it is a bit overlong, but with repeated viewing I have learned to appreciate it.

As an actor I only can wish that I was in this, preferably TUCo, but at least I get to appreciate this on Widescreen Blu-Ray! If you have never seen this flick, by all means check it out on Youtube or just go out and Buy It! I promise it's worth it!

I also like the two other movies from the Dollar trilogy but this movie of course take the price. We have Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef who are incredible good actors and they do a really good job in this movie. Its really hard to explain how good this movie are, as i said before, its take my breath away and after all these years i still considering this movie as one of the best of all time.

7 January 2006,Greatest Western of all time maybe the Greatest of all time!,"Some movies are legendary. In the arena of Westerns, Sergio Leone's works are unmatched in their strikingly visual approach, namely, the extensive use of dramatic widescreen shots interleaved with moments of extreme close-ups. Apart from creating a complete sub-genre of Westerns, lovingly called ""Spaghetti Westerns"" - mostly because of the Italian origins of the filmmaker and the fact that his movies were shot in Europe instead of Hollywood - Sergio Leone built the foundation of Clint Eastwood's super-stardom. ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is one such ageless piece of work, beautiful to behold. After ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" and ""For A Few Dollars More"", it is the third part in a series of movies featuring Eastwood as ""The Man With No Name"".

The basic story of ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is actually a simple treasure hunt, but still Leone allows himself almost three hours to develop all its details. It is a plot with endless, unexpected twists and turns, making this movie a highly entertaining experience. Clint Eastwood became an Western icon through those movies and we still tend to remember him as ""The Man With No Name"", even though he left this role behind over thirty years ago. His charismatic, enigmatic, dry portrayal of the laid-back ""Blondie"" is stunning and it carries the movie. It is Eli Wallach, however, who makes the biggest impression as the somewhat dense Tuco. He puts so much character in this personality that, no matter how bad he is, we always care and sympathize for him. Crowning it with the right amount of humor, slyness, and humanity, Wallach puts in one of the most memorable performances in this movie Probably everyone has heard Ennio Morricone's brilliant musical score to ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" at some point or another. Its ferocious, war-cry-style main theme is as memorable as it is effective. Beside ""Once Upon A Time In The West"", this score is probably his best work ever and helped to stylize the unique image and appeal of Italian Westerns. It is a magnificent score that perfectly accompanies the movie's many twists, always finds the right note, and helps the audience experience every single scene more fully. The disc has a monaural Dolby Digital soundtrack, and comes fully dubbed in English, French, and Spanish. Subtitles are also supplied in English, French, and Spanish.

""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" is an exceptional movie for its richness and the peculiarity of being a Western set against the violent background of the American Civil War. The picture are fantastic and its a real cinema art to the eyes. The way Leone timed the music and the pictures are perfection. It is a serious, infectiously humorous movie with striking images and a clever plot. The quality of the DVD is remarkable and makes this movie an all-time favorite of mine. You have to own this.

29 July 2013,A Unique experience,"Watched this movie after 6 years of existence in my Watchlist :)

Instead of talking in detail about this movie, all I can say that it is a unique experience watching this movie.

This movie gives me confidence to watch other classics like Godfather Series.

I heard that this was a trend setter in Cowboy movies & I can't agree more!

Definitely a not to miss one!!

Movie was definitely ahead of its age! Gives a nostalgic feel too!

Go ahead & enjoy watching it!",8
11 December 2016,Straordinario,"Eli Wallach and his ironic, nimrod, and raw physical and psychological aspect, with the aftertaste of sadness, abandonment and pride enclosing in his head making one Unbreakable shield that makes him a strong, fast, indestructible, of which few have interest, but among the three, is the most extraordinary.

Clint Eastwood and his icy stare, as if watching from above all, shy about showing his humanity but eager to show his empathy hidden in his cynicism, a character also indestructible and charismatic.

Eli Wallach and his angular face behind a pointed smile hides a taste of fun in destroying the people and to see him do, hide his demon just in front of the larger demons about him, such as the destruction of the war, forgetting to be a son of whore and fast thinking the other thing that interests him most, wealth, a character almost animal, a predator.

9 April 2009,RU Kidding me?,"I've just viewed for the second time. Aside from some excellent cinematography, the plot is still lame, the dialog even more stilted and the score clearly could have been written by a chimp ""lalalalala-lalaala"". The reviewers claiming this to be the best movie ever (Western or otherwise)clearly live a narrow existence. This film isn't even on the level of ""Butch Kassidy and the Sundance Kid"". This movie is drier than its' desert scenes. The technical flaws previously mentioned are by themselves enough to disqualify this ""epic"" from consideration. Also, I can't understand the comments of those who, after watching it a second time, declare what was once a certain piece of dog-do, a ""Masterpiece"". What are you thinking???? And ""pasta picture""? Come on. This film has a long way to go to measure up against Ford's ""Treasure"". I won't even mention the clear all time great. You guys need to broaden your horizon!

The actors were really great that you think they are like that in real, I have watched this movie a countless times, and I am sure i will keep watching it a countless time to come.

Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, Lee Van Cleef are really the best actors of all time, and Sergio Leone prove himself as one of the best directors in the history of cinema, my parents witnessed this movie when it was released, and they love it, and I found out about it later after i was born, and I love it too, I hope the cinema can produce something in this level or higher since they have better resources now, that will enrich the future of cinema.

29 January 2006,the genius of tonino delli colli.,"well now, GBU has reached the IMDb top 5. this is a genuine card carrying work of art. up there with the likes of davinci's mona lisa, beethoven's 5th, and michealangelo's David. it will reach number one here i'm sure of that. the saddest thing is most of the crew are now dead. and the living are very old. soon we will loose these as well. no matter what happen's in my life i've just got to remember Tuco and the way he would say ""Blondie!?"" to Eastwood's character, and a big smile comes to my old face. Wallach is a wonderful actor - he WAS/IS Tuco. i knew when i saw this on the big screen in 1969 it was something very special. very, very special indeed. for those who have seen this masterpiece as many times as i, any further praise would be redundant. but let's, now spotlight cinematographer delli colli for a moment. in terms of composition, this man must have just about the best eye in the business. color balance and perspective taken into account, here are some of my picks for the top shots in GBU. shot of the deserted town's main street as the gunmen ride up to kill tuco. shot of angel eyes in the doorway of ranch house where he kills the family. zoom shot of blondie shooting the rope and missing. shot as the trio move out into the circle for the final showdown. they are on the right third of the screen and at one point, form a triangle for a moment. flattened into 2D, this has almost perfect geometry.(a triangle in an ellipse). i could go on but, i'll leave to all you other fans to find your own classic shots. as i've said before, this is not a movie so much as a work of true art.

15 November 2018,The prefect example of great filmmaking,"The good the bad and the ugly is everything a great film should be it has great tension and build up, suspenseful scenes, great acting, fantastic cinematography, and an incredible understanding of how to use the time period in witch it takes place in. Combine all of that with some of the most memorable music to be ever but on screen. What can I say I just see this as a perfect film I would go into more detail about the film but I really don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who loves film it's an iconic masterpiece that deserves to be viewed by anyone.

16 September 2013,Please watch this movie !!!,"I have been a fan of Cow Boy's since childhood. But it is only now after close to 20 years i really understood the level of quality this movie has.

This is one of the best Movie's made in regards to me !!

You ask and it has everything a great movie needs in it, The ever typical Cow boy's and the bandits in west can be a stereotype from this movie and none .

Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach with Lee Wan Cliff are the best cast and as the title "" The Good The Bad and The Ugly ""

Cheers ..

1 June 2004,Greatest...western...ever.,"Without a doubt, this film is a masterpiece. In storytelling, in cinematography, in scope, all in all a great great work. Eastwood, Cleef and Wallach are absolutely superb in their respective roles, and each plays their character to the max. Sergio Leone is simply a genius at work here, and from the moment the film begins to the moment it ends, you will be mesmerized and captivated. This definitely ranks just above Eastwoods' ""Unforgiven"" in the all-time great western film category, as well as the character ""Blondie"" is definitely one of the great characters of all time. Once you've seen this film (hopefully on DVD), you will compare every western movie you've seen and every one you will see to it, and chances are they will fail the test. A must-have for serious DVD collectors.

27 June 2013,Best Western Ever . . .,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

11 March 2013,"Wow, just a masterpiece..","If you actually get in depth of this epic story, it is amazing to watch. Seeing the story unveil upon your eyes and the characters develop...just astonishing. Anyone that has about 3 hours to spare, I highly recommend this to anyone. I am not a big fan of westerns, but this definitely makes exceptions. Clint Eastwood is one of my favorite actors now because of this movie. He portrayed excellent actor qualities. Props to this director for the excellent story line and spectacular character development. Like I said, I HIGHLY recommend this to any person of any genre professions. Some scenes do drag out, but it will never lose your interest. I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie, it was such a wonderful experience. 10/10 would watch this again.

27 April 1999,"Come on, best movie ever??","I fell asleep twice. Yes, it was a pretty good movie. Yes, the music was, um, great. No, this was not the best movie ever. Why? Because the story is still just ho hum, western.

The most redeeming part of the story is the way the Civil War gets in the way of the three main characters. But Eastwood's famous line about ""So many lives wasted for so little"" or whatever it was, sounded pretty meaningless, not to mention unreal, coming from a killer for money. Was that ""The Good"" talking to us, or just the movie maker?

I'll call it a Great Western, but too long. ""Unforgiven"" is much more appealing to my tastes.

3 May 2013,words to describe this fantastic movie,"I think this movie was really good for back in its day. I like how they have a good, bad, and ugly guy in there, kind of made me laugh. What really sets it off is that Clint Eastwood is the good guy. the characters playing the bad and the ugly fit right into what they are suppose to be like. They couldn't of picked a better actor for that part. I like how the movie starts off and easily progress up to the end. towards the end when they find all that money and its a stand off, it made the main character look good in winning. But in all in 1966, i would say this is the number one movie of its time starring with Clint Eastwood. This is also one of the best movie Clint Eastwood played in.

15 June 2022,Well Written!,"I really liked the script that this whole production follows, certainly this movie deserves all this fame. Of course, because it's a movie of almost three hours (in the extended version in English), there are some scenes that seem tiring.

However, I would recommend, some things I feel I will never forget, because it felt so new, yet so old. The filming is good and the dialogues are sensational. The performances are really good and everything seems well planned.

I enjoyed watching it.

16 December 2004,Panache - redefined,"This movie has style - in a very elemental way - so to speak. You get an idea of the deadly, dreary desert, the deadlier bounty hunters and the deadliest of 'em all - Clint Eastwood - the man with no name! The story is a simple one to follow and is brilliantly executed by Sergio Leone using just the right landscapes along with some pretty good sets too (like the one featuring the Civil War sequence). Some of the scenes were meant to be symbolic (especially the Civil War scenes) and they did their job well.

Eli Wallach is simply superb with his ""Blondieeee!!!"" screams and curses. Lee Van Cleef seems as deadly as the great Eastwood himself as ""The Bad"" guy.

Cinematography - not as continuous as one would like - but manages to convey the tension in the dueling scenes very effectively.

Also, the music - Ennio Morricone at his best! He has dished out some very innovative and brilliant stuff for all the three ""great"" westerns and this along with ""For a Few Dollars More"" seems to be his best.

Finally, the style! Sergio Leone can certainly teach a thing or two to Quentin Tarantino or The Wachowski Brothers - in fact Tarantino acknowledges Leone's great style. And then the epitome of style himself - Clint Eastwood - with a half-burnt cigar in his lips, unshaven face, tilted hat, ragged jeans, a worn out poncho and the sharpest scowl ever which can rub out any ""Neo-with-million-dollar-goggles"" off the face of the Earth.

Not genre-defining, surely - it was invented by Hollywood. But somebody from Europe really showed the world how to make westerns.",10

12 July 2002,How much are you worth now? 2000 Dollars!,"The best western film that I have ever seen. Only 1 film comes very close and that is Once Upon A Time In The West. Sergio Leone is showing everyone that he made the best western films ever. His way of making it is unforgettable, a simple plot, low ranking actors, a slow-motion film and the best soundtrack ever. That is his thing in this film. Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef never got the same high status as Clint Eastwood did, and that is a big shame because they are both fantastic, especially Eli Wallach. He got the main role in this film and he is doing it so great, that your starting to like him a lot, although he is a villain, but in the end all the three man are villains. Everyone knows the soundtrack of this movie, some people never saw the movie but they know the music. And it fits perfectly in every scene. The shootout in the end of the movie is a classic scene, and the music makes it even higher then that.

I will not say that you must look this movie and all that kind of things. But let me warn you for one thing: ""Once you have seen this movie, it will never leave you alone"" A masterpiece made by a master: Sergio Leone.",10
17 September 2003,Third in my top 10 movies list of all time.,"I am a big movie fan and i have seen over 10,000 movies. When i made the list of my top ten favorite movies of all time i found this classic western Sergio Leone fame movie on third position, the other two movies (1 ""Gone with wind"" ) and (2 ""Lawrence of Arabia""). I first saw this movie in 1989 when i was just 15 years old and recommended this to my favorites. So why this movie so impressed me, because of the direction, extra ordinary camera work, accurate sets and the magnificent music of the movie. The story is about the three different types of characters. Only one thing which is the common between these three character is seeking to find the buried treasure. Other then these main characters the other co actors also Performed wary well Specially the Storekeeper ""Enzo Petito"" is in so Laughable seen when tuco ""Eli Wallach"" demand him to open the mouth and then put the close sign in to his mid open mouth. this movie is the last epic of the Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood combination and its our bad luck that they never made another movie together.

Please ignore my english mistakes.

6 December 2002,Perfect Western,"The late Italian director Sergoi Leone shot through this film a mix of myth and realism which truly adds a new dimension to the style of classic western. All three actors played the role in a perfect way showing a professional and beautiful acting of western action unbeatable till now. The unholy pursuit of these three desperados of the $200'000 in the time of the great civil war makes the story more interesting and not like any other western where all they do is shoot each other. The movie may seem long (2 hours and 42 min) but is worth every minute of it. The music on the other hand is found on a higher level and is worth the Oscar it got. The suspense with the music was integrated together perfectly. A good example of the suspension is at the end when all three players stand facing each other in a trio showdown. I say that if somebody likes westerns then this is the best movie to start with. There are similar movies such as 'A Fistful of Dollars' and 'For a few Dollars more'.

5 January 2010,A rare jewel from Cinema,"There are a lot of things to judge in a movie, however there are few that really indicates if it is really good or not. I used to evaluate the plot, the cast, the direction, the sound (music and effects) and the image (not quality, but realistic). This masterpiece gets 5 stars in each of these points. But there is a very peculiar thing that this movie brings: It is even enjoyable to the people that does not appreciate western genre.

The main plot shows us the ecstasy of gold and how 3 very different and peculiar man can be affected by it. The background is the American civil war, which makes the movie much more exciting. The soundtrack is one of the best in cinema history and not just because it has a lot of quality, but also because it fits 100% on each moment when it is played. Seogio Leone built an epic, giving us a lesson in how to mix a set of good ideas with a great story and how to transform it in a cinematographic jewel.

19 January 2015,My Favorite Movie!,"This movie cemented my love for movies the first time I saw it when I was young. It inspired me to start making movies on iMovie. I ended up studying film in school and now I am a documentary filmmaker traveling the world making documentaries. If you like westerns this is obviously a must see. The music is nothing short of amazing. Everything about this movie is great, the settings, the music (its worth repeating), and the acting. Clint Eastwood is the man and so is the supporting cast. Sergio Leone's masterpiece is slow in the best possible way. No squint or glance is forgotten. Each scene is built to perfection through music and editing. Check it out!

27 February 2012,Great western,"This is without a doubt my all-time favorite western.

The beginning of the film is so memorable, with the young, rough good-looks of Eastwood being labeled ""The Good"", the absolutely evil look of Lee Van Cleef being labeled ""The Bad"", and a dirty, unkempt, desperado Eli Wallach with booze and food flying being labeled ""The Ugly"". The ending fight scene with its 3-way showdown is one of the most memorable pieces of film I have ever watched.

Leone did a great job with the camera direction in this movie and the acting is impressive. Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach are absolutely fantastic.

The only thing that might scare some viewers off is the length of the film. It is long, but you just don't seem to notice it when you are watching the film - you are just too damn busy watching the best classic western of all time.

Do yourself a favor and rent this movie if you haven't seen it. If there was ever a perfect western, this is it.",7

22 October 2004,Excellent in many ways,"I saw this film for the first time just recently, and wished I had seen it earlier. I have seen other Clint Eastwood westerns, which are usually good entertainment, but I think this is the best Eastwood western that I've seen. The cinematography was great, and the soundtrack was well suited to the scenery. Clint was strong and silent in this movie. Also worth noting is Eli Wallach's performance as ""the ugly"", which I felt was very good. I suppose having a European director is what made it a different movie from most of the western. The Movie looked at times like a European movie that should have subtitles, of course that could be because I already knew that it was filmed by an Italian director in Spain. Mix that with the fact that the theme is American (cowboy western) theme, and it comes out superbly. Bottom line is, it's definitely a movie worth seeing.

Sergio Leone was ahead of his time, and this film reflex it.

This is the pinnacule of the Spaghetti Westerns.

4 August 2014,The best Western of all times on so many levels,"""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"" is one of the earliest films I can remember and is probably the only film I would never get sick of watching over and over. IMO, it's not only the best 'Western' ever made, but one of the best films of all time. Not for the picture quality... as it can be a little rough and grainy. Not for the dialog over-dubbing, which is often out of sync due to the range of languages spoken when it was shot. And not for the historical inaccuracies or feasibility of the physical burdens endured by the characters (it's way more realistic than James Bond anyway). Those are what give the film its charm and retro appeal! Personally, I think this film is great because of the overall 'mood' it creates, both visually and audibly. It has, by far, one of the most unusual and recognizable music scores in movie history, blending the traditionally-used orchestral brass section with human whistles, cackles, grunts, and an electric guitar, to create a tapestry of sound that strangely fits perfectly (even though the time period depicted predates the electric guitar by more than half a century). Then, in the spaces, the wind-blown desolation in the sound track really gives you the sense of being there with the characters in that barren desert. It's the dynamic range in both the soundtrack and the pacing of the story that sets such a great undercurrent for the talented trio to do their magic. All three seasoned actors with impressive credits both before and after this film seemed to cross paths at just the right time in their careers to face off in their most memorable performances to date. And rather than a typical Western--one wronged man against a whole town; a masked hero and his trusty sidekick; or a rag-tag posse banding together only to get killed off one by one by bandits--this is three distinct personalities going head to head to head, each with a little good, a little bad, and a little ugly in them to varying degrees. On the script side, it's really more of a human interest story than an action film. And it poignantly bullet-points (no pun intended) that often the ""good guy"" really only needs to be the ""least bad"" of the bunch to obtain that moniker, which has all sorts of parallels in all walks of life. To fully rave about all the intricacies of this masterpiece would take a novel. But these are just a few aspects that make it a timeless classic and well worth watching.",10
26 May 2022,The Best Of Western Film,"This is the Best of Western film from my opinion, as also know i related to Clint Eastwood.

Actually Clint is the king of the western movies, i watched him many times, until older, he still making film like Cry Macho for us. Thanks Clint Mr. Eastwood.

6 July 2022,A Great Spaghetti Western - But you Might want to Start Earlier,"This really is a great representative of this genre and if you are only going to see one this might be the one you want to see. But I think earlier in this trilogy might be the best place to start. They do grow and both the director and composer get better over time.

And I have never been so sure why they are called the Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

Tuko is really not that ugly.

The colonel is bad but not terrible bad and not much worse than others.

And the man with no-name really is not that good. Watch the movie and see.

15 April 2017,the three villains?,"In general it is a great film, especially as the end of the trilogy. I won't mention how good it is since there's already a lot. What I failed to get out of my expectation is the sense of morality. Surely, in the west you don't expect anyone behave like a citizen. But there was something in the protagonists of the previous two films that makes them respectable and distinguished from the ""just villains"" - they live by a code, which I have not seen too much in this film. With the heroic macho melodies, the thing you are supposed to appreciate is not the noble soul, but purely power, physical, skilly or cunningly speaking. Seeing men who have been through life and death together now betraying, lying and setting up each other, you cannot really relate them to macho or ""cool"". Sure you can say Sergio has made his moral judgment by building the character ""the good"" (and even he betrayed Tuco the ugly at first). But the lack of creed in each figure has generally made the film less enjoyable.

What I would say is that once upon a time in the west also directed by Sergio is better especially to a film buff. But this like all of Sergio's spaghetti westerns (called so because they were made by Italians yet often filmed in Spain) is fantastic, quite often the guns used maybe historically inaccurate but Sergio did this on purpose, and was more interested in the western films that influenced him and payed tribute to them in some way which is now called intertextuality or post modern directing on Sergio's behalf. Even though these are all great films I have to watch them without my wife, she won't touch them with a barge pole. Ideal for a night in.

13 December 2018,"I am not one for Westerns, but I consider this movie Pure Art!","This movie truly captured my attention by the landscape, the one liners, camera angles and use of sound. It's a long movie (almost three hours), but the plot development and dynamics between the characters will certainly keep you intrigued (as it did me). This truly is a timeless piece and a movie I will enjoy watching time and time again.

26 August 2005,exceptional wild wild west movie,"To all Clint Eastwood's fans, there is no comment. To all who did not view yet, should consider it as a movie of the day to plan for.

The story outlines Clint as a perfect gunslinger and accurate shooter who arrests wanted hooligans and hands over to the respective civil courts. This is the third sequel of the trilogy marked by ""The man with no name"". The viewers should also see ""A fistful of dollars"" and ""For a few dollars more"". Though none of them are linked by stories but the time-line in America and the lifestyle in wild wild west. In this movie, Clint partners with Tuco who is already an infamous outlaw under search by many counties. Clint hands Tuco over to the courts, gets the declared money and during the time of punishment (to be hanged) he shoots the hanging rope to separate Tuco and escape. This is a business to him.

Soon Tuco demands lion's share what Clint denies to do and he punishes Tuco by leaving in a deserted land alone. Tuco just survives and seeks for Clint to revenge. He finds him at the point of his gun, forces Clint to walk long over the sandy desert almost ruined and suddenly meets a horse-cart running unmanned but carrying dead bodies.

One of the passengers in that cart was dying, Bill Carson, gave Tuco a route to a cemetery where huge amount of dollars is buried under a grave. When asked about the name of the grave, the man was listing and Tuco ran to collect some water for him. Returning, he saw him dead, Clint faintly sat beside him and Bill Carson told him the name of the grave before dying.

Another man was in hunt for that treasury, Sentenza. He already killed a family and few other men to find Bill Carson. Suddenly he found Tuco and Clint. Tuco had to speak the name of the cemetery under extreme torture. Yet Clint had been untouched and Sentenza took him with. Tuco managed to escape from Sentenza's guards cleverly. En route Tuco and Clint met again to form the partnership and they flew from the grip of Sentenza. Then they took part to a battle between American armies of different belief. Ultimately they found the cemetery.

The rest of the story is unique and to be seen in screen only.

The cameraman has taken very close shots of the faces full with expression. The dresses of the actors are very authentic to the time of the story. The acting of Clint, Tuco and Sentenza is superb! The spot selection is excellent! The surrounding environment and respective city dwellers are really as per the best of it. Above all, the background guitar tune of this movie is worth to hear, this alone represents the fearlessness of those freemen in the wild wild west.",10
31 August 2017,Best Western Movie Ever.,"A must watch movie for everyone. It is a quite long film but still it never ever gets boring. The slow pace works just perfect for the films tone and style. An impressive combination of great humor and hard violence that works just perfect, impressive because it never feels awkward like one might fear it would get. The style of the action is perfectly done and like stated it is quite violent maybe more than one might suspect if you don't know anything about the movie. The characters are superb, Clint Eastwood is of course the best and the coolest. The bad is a really brilliant villain and the ugly is great comic relief. Even though this might seem like a light weight no depth movie with stereotype characters, it's not because they are so well done and brilliantly acted that the viewer gets a stronger feeling for them than any other film like this. I highly recommend this film to everyone.

20 June 2021,Those were movies,"From the times when movies could be made without fear, far from being politically correct. Fun, artistic, dynamic, with actors with enormous personality. To see it again after so many years, and now with my children who discover art cinema. Nowadays the artificial predominates most of the times, It is refreshing to see these movies of yesteryear.

3 October 2017,The best western,"First of all, there is a wonderful cast of characters. Clint Eastwood is at his best as the Good, Lee van Cleef is so truly evil that you'll long for his downfall with a passion, and Eli Wallach steals the show as the Ugly, turning him into a character that you'll root for even though he's quite clearly the least trustworthy character you'll ever meet. Even though this might seem like a light weight no depth movie with stereotype characters, it's not because they are so well done and brilliantly acted that the viewer gets a stronger feeling for them than any other film like this.

The tension built up in the early parts of the film is punctuated by brief flashes of action, but it is the waiting before the action sequences that grabs you by the insides and slowly squeezes. The story is tremendously set in the background of the American Civil war, with its twists and turns, comedic touches between Blondie and Tuco, powerful images and great shoot-outs.

21 June 2006,Absolutely Brilliant,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

30 March 2014,Italians make the best westerns!,"What more can you say about this? It's regarded as one of the best westerns out there and I completely agree. It has interesting characters that you either love or love to hate.

The story is a basic treasure hunt and while the concept is simple , it's very well made and has you on the edge of your seat for the whole time.

While Clint Eastwood is well Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach as Tuco and especially Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes stole the show for me. Amazing performances.

The tension in this movie is so thick it even makes me sweat just by looking at it. And to top it off is the amazing as always score by Ennio Morricone.

A must see for every western fan!

24 April 2015,Work of Art!,"Simply genius movie, i wish they could do movies like this again*. Really a must watch for anyone not just hardcore western fans and but people who enjoys good film should watch this one. It is truly one of the great movies.

Much to say about it but this is the short list: the acting, the action, the characters, the production values, and the originality.

Clint Eastwood does a very good job in this movie but the real star is Lee Van Cleef, man he did a really good job.

The score by Ennio Morricone's score is one of the very best ever committed to film, if you want to make a list of outstanding scores this has to be in top two.

28 June 2017,nice movie,"The movie is long, but there's not a wasted scene in the film. Each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more about each character and what's going on. The pacing is incredible, as is the direction - Sergio Leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film, keeping the film from ever getting predictable. Any typical Western cliché that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling. Of special mention is Ennio Morricone's score, which is absolutely perfect. Two scenes - one in a Union prison camp, one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film - are amazing on their own, but they become absolutely astonishing with combined with Morricone's powerful score.

15 October 2006,note on bad English dubbing for the DVD collector's set,"I've just seen this movie in it's complete form and I have mixed feelings about it. Here are the good points and bad points (no ugly points cause it's still a great picture and no pun intended.)

The bad: The major problem with the English track is the additional dubbing for the new scenes; they stand out like sore thumb. Sure it's the voices of Eastwood and Wallach, but (the movie being forty years old)there voices have changed, Eastwood's voice has a lower pitch while wallach's is higher; I don't even want to go into Van Cleef's dubbing(he passed on so they brought in an impersonator to do his dialog). the dubbing quality for these new scenes are also not as good.

I assume the original English dub was done in Italy. Even though the sync in audio and image was not perfect it's still one the best English dub tracks I've ever heard for motion picture.

The Good: All hope is not lost however since MGM decided to include the original Italian mono track. Watching the film with this track makes the viewing experience a whole lot better.the restored scenes are better with this track as well since the Italian version was shown in its entirety when it opened in 1966. It does take some time to get used to watching it in this way (eg reading subtitles).

Until we see a new edition that gives us a US and Italian cut of the film I would give this DVD marginal recommendation (or rent it just to see what it's like). The original DVD edition, with the cut US version, should still be for sale in some places so if you are a purist (or a nostalgic) you can still get that one at least.",6
17 October 2001,The Only Western You'll Ever Need.,"An epic, violent drama set just after the civil war. The ultimate spaghetti-western, ironically better made than any ""real"", American western. Clint Eastwood doesn't say or do much, apart from being on the screen, and he is fabulous!

4 December 2021,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly was shot in Italy and Spain","Like many Western films to come, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly was shot in Italy and Spain (a practice which led to the subgenre, ""Spaghetti Westerns""), and much of the cast and crew were from these regions (via IMDb). This led to a new portrayal of the Old West, free of many American romanticisms, that left a large impact on the genre. In fact, many people read Leone's movies as satire. After a running time of nearly three hours, what does the movie's ending mean,

27 June 2021,A Cinematic Masterpiece,"Genre' aside this is one of the greatest films ever made. The cinematography in this film is among the best you will ever see. Leone's knack for gritty close-ups is stellar as is his propensity to draw you into every scene. I saw the Italian directors cut which had much more dialogue that simply did not work. Leone's decision to edit this movie and cut out half the original script gave us the masterpiece we enjoy today. The soundtrack is brilliant as is the costume design. I put TGBU right up there with The Godfather in terms of flawlessness.

26 January 2002,"""Were you going to die alone?""","That line starts my favourite 20-odd seconds of any movie. But, those twenty seconds aside, this is Sergio Leone's masterpiece. Better than Once Upon a Time in the West or Once Upon a Time in America. The whole dollars trilogy was magnificent, but this finishes it on a high note.

Clint Eastwood is great in the role of a man who doesn't follow any rules, but makes his own (when isn't he great in that particular type of role?), with great support from Eli Wallach as Tuco. The movie doesn't seem to move like any other, moving left, right and back again in the space of five minutes, but still being easy to understand.

There is a great turn from Lee Van Cleef, who serves as little more than a sub-plot until the above mentioned scene. The film isn't exactly over-flowing with dialogue (Leone relied more on huge, engrossing images) but the inter-play is sharp and witty.

""'See you... soo-soon... idi-idi-idi...'""

""'See you soon, idiots'. It's for you.""

In short, a fantastic film that is a must-see for all Western and movie fans.",10
7 March 2022,What a classic!,"Just whats it again and it surprises me every time.

I also think the acting on this movie is very very good considering the fact how old of an movie this is. Usually the acting isnt that good in movies made in the 60s but this is a great example of the good acting there was back then.

The acting, pretense,writing,and action is amazing. I love Clint Eastwood so much and this is by far my favorite movie of his. I normally hate all western but this is one of the only western movies I've ever liked. It definitely deserves its very high reviews and I don't expect them to go down any time soon. It's really easy to get a hold of because its free on amazon prime so you can watch it. Een though it is incredibly long it is definitely worth watching. You should watch it. Its amazing. Nuff said

29 January 2017,"The king of one-liners, phenomenal soundtrack, and intense close ups of squinty eyes!","This is the type of movie that has a lot of great one-liners. For example, ""there are two types of people in this world, those with loaded guns and those that dig. You dig"". This movie is full of lines like that, and when there are no lines there are intense staring scenes and close ups of people's eyes. Can't go wrong with a close up of those squinty Client Eastwood eyes! Interesting fact, Eastwood almost died during the filming of this movie, there is a scene where a bridge explodes and a piece of shrapnel flies within a meter of Eastwood. They left that scene in the movie, see for yourself.

The soundtrack is phenomenal! I've been watching this movie since I was kid, when I did not even understand English, it was just as enjoyable.

29 April 2002,"Three great actors, one great western","Serve yourself a bowl of chilli, open a beer, light up a cheroot and sit back in front of one of the great pieces of cinema. Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach shoot it out for a dead man's loot against perhaps the most distinctive soundtrack of its day (and I don't just mean the ah-ee-ah-ee-ahhhhhh main theme).

What is most impressive is the variety of emotional strings that the film pulls. As well as rollicking action and tense drama, 'buono, brutto, cattivo' is also a deliberately funny movie. Wallach, as the buffoon Tuco, gets most of the slapstick, but Clint, as the man with no name, holds the upper hand in sarcastic put downs.

The final showdown is worth waiting nearly three hours for. Three men with three guns stage a face-off for the final clue to the location of the buried treasure. Who will draw first? And who will aim at whom? As the bugles and guitar build up the tension, the camera closes in gradually on each of the combatants' eyes, cutting occasionally to their hands at their holsters. Even those who know the outcome can't resist being drawn towards the edge of their seats. There are very few films that merit a straight 10 out of 10. This one gets it.",10

10 November 2003,Truly belongs on the Top 50 list,"Checking up on the reviews of this film, I was horrified to see the sample review criticize the film for being too long! This film is just as long as it should be. There are no dragging points. Every moment in this film serves its purpose beautifully.

As for someone else's assertion that they saw 25 films superior to this in one year, I won't say it is impossible, but they must have really crowded in the masterpieces over this period of time.

This is the quintessential western. It reaches beyond its genre to any audience. I have never met anyone who felt that the film was less than a work of genius. And you just can't say that about most films.

28 April 2004,John Wayne and Gene Autrey can go lasso themselves!,"Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone OWN the ""American"" Western. Call them Spaghetti Westerns, call them what you want. It is a little strange that the country that birthed the legends of the ""old West' should get bested so profoundly in it's own back yard by an Italian. But The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly was indeed the final nail in that particular coffin. This was a movie that proved that a limited budget cannot limit the creative power of a visionary director and writer(s) and it cannot conceal good actors.

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly was by far the best Western ever committed to film. It was gritty, it was suspenseful, it was well written, directed, and brought to the screen a great plot and characters. It was also far enough away from ""the good guys wear white hats and shoot last and the bad guys wear black hats, don't shave, smoke, and shoot first"" westerns and the ilk that JW and GA stared in that it drew you in enough to make the story come alive.

I love all of Sergio's films, but I have to rank this as his masterpiece.

Bravo!

4 September 2016,"The Good, The Great, and The Best","One of the best films I've ever seen, and one of the best westerns I've ever seen. This movie's appeal is all in the characters, motivations and their journey; than it is about the action that a western film is normally known for. This movie fills itself with so many interesting plot points and never overstays it's welcome across it's near 3-hour span of time. This film simply feels like a collection of great ideas that not only work with, but compliment each other.

The only downside to this film is the sound design. Beyond the iconic soundtrack and extremely immersive sound effects you'll find the action scenes re-use the same gunshot sound effect's way too often to ignore. Although gunfights make up a small portion of the film, their importance is no less than any other moment and this can kind of kill the immersion.

The questionable sound design doesn't deteriorate the film's overall quality. This film is well worth the time it demands.",10

22 December 2004,I've seen that movie more than ten times probably,"When we think how to represent movie we are focusing usually on four things. the first is plot. the second acting and actors. third is operator work and fourth is music. when i saw Sergio's masterpiece i found everything in it. Interesting plot with a lot of twisted,as road in Poland, situations that were used not only in other movies but in some cult computer games too ( for example in Fallout ). Actors that do they best. I like each of them but for some reasons I like tuco most. maybe because he is more ""human"" than other two? The operator work... I love these moments when he is showing only eyes. Suspense is almost as big as in Hitchcock films... and music made by gorgeous Morricone. I remember the time when it was main position on parties,except girls of course... That why I gave it ten points. For memories and really fantastic work.

I remember the first time I saw this movie. Back in the '70s, one night there was 2 things on TV to choose from, this movie or a baseball game. How do I remember a baseball game, it was the night Hank Aaron was going after Babe Ruth's homerun record. Baseball or a movie. Tuned into the the baseball game, flipped to the movie -a western, cool. 'Uh, what is this no one is talking it makes no sense'. After what seemed like an eternity somebody finally spoke, Lee van Cleef. The rest is Movie History. Since then I have seen this movie well over 25 times. Numerous lines that have been etched into my memory. Forget whatever minor flaws this movie has. Put yourself in the movie. Sergio Leon, John Ford these are the people that defined ""The Western"". On a scale of 1-10, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is nothing less than a 10. Plop the tape into the VCR, sit back and experience a classic.

16 August 2013,Clint Eastwood-the best spaghetti western actor,"This film's one of my all time favorites featuring Clint Eastwood*hums the theme song*..You can enjoy what he brought to ""Fistful Of Dollars"" or later on ""Unforgiven"" (you may even appreciate him more for his series of Dirty Harry movies) but Eastwood knew how to deliver his lines and even better he understood the true West as an underbelly of lies, deception, and ultimately money for power..This film, in my opinion, was a social statement meant to make people aware that history authors like to glorify Western folk heroes because of their good deeds, yet also make us aware that every hero had a dark side that showed itself during the course of their lives out West..

11 December 2004,It's All Good,"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is arguably the best Western Movie every realized. When I first saw it, I was drawn in by the imaginative camrea angles, the massive battle scene, the quest for gold, and the character of Blondie himself, a man of mythical proportions. The music perfectly compliments this sprawling atmosphere with one of the most memorable tunes ever. To put it simply this movie has everything, a great plot, great characters, eerily beautiful landscapes, wonderful music, and fantastic scenes. Even though their is come geographical errors in this movie( Its set in the Western U.S., but there are battles between the Union and the Confederates?), they don't bring it down. In fact i think they fuel its mythological feel, like this is a legend that isn't bound to historical accuracy. A geat movie that i highly recommend to everyone

23 December 2004,An absolute must see. A movie full of Ironic twists of fate that reaches the dimensions of an ancient drama,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

3 August 2013,Historic Cinema.,"I have never seen better Cinema since i saw this movie in the early 80s. I was blowing away as a teener. The story, the music, the actors, the camera-work, the landscapes, movie graphics. Did i forgot something? Its cinema at his best. A lot of camera shots and music have been copied over and over again in other various movies, even if film-directors didn't know it. Cinema has been strongly influenced by Leone. Many reviews are very well written about the good the bad a the ugly here and elsewhere. Even people who don't like westerns should, no must see this movie because of the complete cinema picture. Once upon and Leones Dollar movies underscored his great talent as one of the greatest directors of cinema. There a 2 kind of movies.....bad and good.....the good is really really bad ;o)

27 June 2005,"Excellent, a classic","I just saw this film for the 1st time and i must say that it is excellent. The Slow suspenseful moments mixed with the lightining quick action scenes are a good mix. Every single feature about the movie is remembered, i mean just look on the top 250. It's the highest rated western on there.

The action although quick is sastisfying and hilarious with Joe and Tuco piping off One liners.

The musical score is still used today in parodies of cartoons and such.

The Camera tricks in the film were very nice, with the constant zooming close ups on the The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly's face. They use this as a trick to reveal their emotions including: Fear, Happiness, and sadness.

All in all, an excellent film that deserves it place high in the top 250, and is a classic.",10

4 June 2006,Nothing Can Compare To This !,"Presented here is a visual masterpiece without peer.

Leone created the ultimate western film in The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly.

You feel the heat, you taste the dust, you see every bug, skin pore, and intense staring eyeballs, in this film.

You witness the most savage beating a man has ever taken on the film screen. After a wonderful meal, his digestion almost certainly ruined, Tuco actually survives the ordeal.

Excellent acting by all, including extras hired on location.

Best western ever, followed closely by Peckinpah's "" The Wild Bunch"".

10 August 2005,Without doubt the best of the genre and one of the best of all time,"I was 13 years old when i first watched this one and ever since then i watch it at least once a month, now i am 19 years and haven't lost any pleasure in watching it.Sergio leone's The good, The bad and The ugly is a true masterpiece, the third in ""man with no name"" trilogy and the best, though the other two are also not lacking behind and considered classic westerns. usually the length of the movies bother moviegoers but believe me you will never feel the length botherig in this case and will hope it to get even more extended somehow.

The musical score scores above all which is a trademark of Sergio leone's westerns and adds more epic value to the movie. there can't be a better soundtrack than what ""the good, the bad and the ugly has.the storyline is simple and brilliant, three characters finding their own ways to some great fortune and conflicting each other in the backdrop of civil war.

The movie does have a comedic sense to it in some good ways and thus amuses the watcher throughout.characterization really did play an important role in making this movie what it is.Each lead character is developed so well that you even feel thinking what any character may be thinking or about to do.The action scenes can't just be described in some sentences because they are so immensely powerful that they will completely draw any movie-watcher to them.The final showdown is may favorite of all and the the perfect mix of music with tension of what will happen.So many years after knowing and watching the final showdown i still watch it the way i watched it the first time, for me it has the same tension and delivers the same way.This movie is getting even better with every day passing, it has hardly aged which definitely is another of it's excellent features.

Movies like this are not made anymore and that is very sad thing but those who know and can feel the greatness of this may live their lives watching it again and again.",10
23 June 2015,My Favorite Western,"Three different men of three different tempers and tastes get involved in a long and full-of-adventure battle in order to find a fortune in gold.... While the first man who is an ex-bounty hunter and a forgiving person knows the name of the cemetery which the gold is buried in, the second who is a fast-tempered greedy man knows the name on the grave. But the third person, a cruel cold-blooded murderer, knows none; so he has to reach the gold in his own way of finding something.....

10 April 2016,Amazing western with the most awesome soundtrack,"The best western ever made - in my opinion. The story is amazing, and there is not a dull moment at all throughout the movie. All the characters are interesting and challenging, with amazing costume design - making me want to get a poncho, like the one Clint Eastwood wears on some of the poster designs. The posters are amazing as well. The whole design of the film is fantastic, and the music is amazing and haunting. Clint Eastwood is brilliant, and I wish I could see him in a western like this one again in the near future - that would be awesome. I love the this film and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. It's a classic, and after watching it you will know why. It's a movie that will never go out of style - like the toothpick in Clint Eastwoods mouth.

22 January 2017,One of the BEST Movies That Ever Will Be,"This movie has become as Iconic as the Colt Peacemaker/sixgun to the Old West. While the Old West is full of mystique, nostalgia, and exaggerations, we know this and still love it. This movie exemplifies what our imaginations are capable of. A hypothetical adventure is the best way to describe the plot. Imagine a setting of the west during the civil war. Imagine three characters that embody man's natural inhibitions allowed to roam free without restrain. Even the Good would have to be a little bad just to keep up. Or in this case, the Good better be real ""good"". These men are searching for a treasure, and anyone that gets in their way is in danger. The characters are masterfully cast. Adding to this, their portrayal makes them some of the most memorable ever. Tuco, Blondie and Angel Eyes are unforgettable. Even Tuco, a man who is disgusting, murderous, and untrustworthy becomes a character you can't help but root for.

On top of all this, the scenery is fantastic. The film was shot entirely in Italy. Although, you would never assume it wasn't New Mexico. At the same time, all actors aside from the main three speak Italian and are simply dubbed over. This adds to the nostalgia of the movie to me and is noticeable with a close eye. The guns used in the movie are all historically/technically inaccurate/wrong. But all this is forgivable as soon as you hear the opening notes of the soundtrack. Ennio Morricone has composed one of the best soundtracks of all time. Few movies have made such an impact on American/world culture than this movie. I hope that at least until my dying days people remember this movie, and it inspires an adventurous spirit. It is truly that good and is easily of my top two films of all time.",10

23 February 2015,Perfect example of cinematography,"This movie is truly a masterpiece in ever sense of the word, with regards to the cinema arts. The sound, the music, the editing, the context of the movie within the trilogy. The actors, the perfect use of timing and building the suspense and still leave just enough undetermined, but still giving the viewer enough satisfaction. I went into the movie knowing it was pretty amazing, but just truly didn't grasp just how amazing it would be. Yes, its a bit slow for modern times and there is very little talking, but if you go into the movie with the context of when it was made, along with the context and understanding of how other movies in this time frame and genre, you will find that this movie truly is the pinnacle in not just western films, but in all cinematic movies in general. This movie is truly worth the time, and I do think you should try to watch the movies that came before it in the trilogy, before watching this one. Overall an A+ movie.

25 February 2006,Clint at his best but outshone by Eli Wallach,"Probably the best of the Sergeo Leone films (although Once Upon A Time In The West is also a very good film, with solid performances), the director takes a sensible pace to plot out the search for gold bullion, during the American Civil War, by 3 gunmen acting for themselves. Clint Eastwood is as cool as ever, as the man with no name, Lee Van Cleef is sinister as the evil gunslinger, but it is Eli Wallach who steals the film with his portrayal of the street fighter, willing to try any ruse to get his hands on the gold. The action takes place amid the carnage being caused by the 2 sides in the American Civil War, with all 3 gunmen using the situation to best further their own goals. The final 3 way shoot out is probably the most famous in western films, with the music of Morricone at its best.

It captivates interest yet, even though it is a trinity with these 2 armies involved trying to duel each other in the midst. A good one,

2 February 2006,Excellent Storytelling,"I may have seen a few movies equal to The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly but i have never seen a movie that i would claim was better. Commenting first on the story. Intricate plot connections with character and human nature pushing the story along with a war playing a significant supporting character make this one of the greatest stories ever shown on film. Leone does an excellent job of not jumping right into the treasure hunt aspect of he film but instead lets the characters develop and interact and then fall upon the main story line. It is often said that Leone was special due to the fact that he realized the face as a landscape. This is ever evident in the opening shot of the film in which we see one of Tuco's many enemies, but only the very front of his face at first showing a worn, torn, mean side of the previously over glorified American West. The character appears mean and tough and as though anyone who crosses him is sure to meet a hasty end. This is not the case however when ""the Ugly"" Tuco Ramirez bests him and his comrades even when matched against he element of surprise. Here is evident part of the humor of the film, the unassuming Tuco, however flawed he may be, is never the less a master of armed combat. It is his character, made lovable with such contradictions, that pushes the plot along. Many people look to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid as the father of all buddy movies but this was released earlier and while Tuco and Eastwood's characters aren't exactly friends(it seems that Blondie just favorites Tuco as a partner due to the fact that he can easily be out witted) they have some very entertaining interaction and really start the whole unwanted partnership theme so oft copied by the movies that would follow. This them has developed to the point of being the almost exclusive relationship appearing in todays animated films such as Shrek and Ice Age. This film does so much with story yet doesn't compromise an ounce of style. The camera work is phenomenal and creates a mood so strong that even if you don't care for a specific character you can still be fearful for the situation he is in. The music is unforgettable and has remained in pop culture to this day. This movie has something for everyone, it is epic, has comedy, has action, drama, character driven plot, and just plain looks stunning.",10

The first first time i watched the movie i was 16 years old, I watched it with my father he sit me down and told me that were going to watch the best movie ever, when i thought his going to an old sh#t movie, but from the moment the movie start from the first scene i watched with my full Concentration, And i was pleased with one of the most amazing end scenes of all time.

I am 22 now, i watched it over 10 times now, every time like the first time i watched it.",10
23 August 1999,It was really something different,"I could easily say that this is the best western of all the times, but I could be wrong. There's no clue between this kind of western and, for example, the one of John Wayne. However this is a masterpiece: Clint Eastwood is clever as usual, but the best is Eli Wallach; Lee Van Cliff was too much marginalized, especially in the American version. Morricone's music is at its highs and perfectly follow the images. The screenplay is complex but, as it interweaves humor and drama, it is not boring. The director is Sergio Leone, probably the best Italian director after Fellini. Naturally the overall score is 10/10.

11 June 2015,A lesson for actors,"When you know every line and every action and every note of the score, THAT'S a film you love.

Eli was one of the few actors that I longed to meet. His work from ""A Cold Night's Death"", to ""The Deep"", to an episode of my favorite TV series Kojak, Eli was always the consummate professional.

Age was never a factor in his career.

Clint Eastwood even had a place for him in ""Mystic River.""

And his sense of timing and improvisation was second to none.

I miss him terribly and encourage all aspiring actors to watch his work and view his moments that move me deeply.",10
19 February 2000,Best western ever...,"Not much to add. Fantastic cast, superb music by Ennio Morricone, Sergio Leone as a director -- what more can you ask from a movie. There is no other western like this. Strongest movie in the trilogy, created both spaghetti-western and modern western.

Ennio rips up the soundtrack with the most memorable movie score... ever! And Sergio, oh Sergio, a style that makes me tingle with excitement. And it's so damn fun.

You know those moments in movies that bring a genuine smile to your face, make you slap your knee and yelp ""YES!!!""? This movie has many of them. Tuco in the bath. Blondie missing the shot. The list of Tuco's crimes. Angel Eyes sitting down for a meal. Angel Eye's code. And of course, the final shootout. Pristine, visceral, knock-you-down moments. And they go on and on... and on... All make you want to stand and cheer.

8 July 2015,An excellent tribute to the spaghetti western,"This is easily the best of the dollars trilogy and one of Sergio Leone's finest works in cinematography during this era. The plot is captivating and the quality of the film is very good even for a film dated back in a year when England won its only World Cup. It's hard to believe that so much has changed since then but yet this classic gem is a shining reminder of an age of westerns that has yet to see its like again. I don't even think ""django unchained"" could successfully mimic a milestone of this caliber as much as it tried. This is the genuine cinematic treasure for western fans from all walks of life. The cast is loaded with classic stars like Lee Van Cleef and the legend himself, Clint Eastwood, and it's worth its value for the price you pay when purchasing the restored DVD with all of the extras, this is one film any western fan wouldn't want to miss in their collection.

13 June 2000,a visual feast,"Only one other western can challenge this film as the greatest representative of the genre, and that's Once Upon A Time In The West, another one of Sergio Leone's cinematic operas. Creating mythology right in front of our eyes, Leone chooses to put us in a world much the same as the one created by the German writer Karl May - among , mythic figures who just happen to live in the West, but they could easily exist in Rome or Ancient Greece. Unmatchable fun. The audience leaves the movie with the utmost sense of complete satisfaction.

1 June 2000,TCM letterbox version superior,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is one of my all-time favorite movies. I've seen all or part of it dozens of times since I was a kid, usually chopped up by commercials on TNT or a local independent station. Last night, in honor of Clint Eastwood's birthday, TCM showed GBU uninterrupted and in letterbox format. As good as this movie is, the letterbox version is even better. This movie can not be fully appreciated in standard TV format. Being able to see all three protagonists at once in the final shootout scene is a treat in itself. The picture and sound quality also seem improved in the TCM version versus the one shown on TNT. I very much look forward to someday soon seeing the DVD version with the edited scenes restored.

29 September 2000,"The epitome of a gun-action packed, ""shoot-em up"", good(?)verses evil, western.","One of the top westerns of all time. Eastwood plays the tough, ""semi""-good guy to perfection. His supporting cast does an excellent job of portraying his adversaries, ""il brutto"" (the bad) and ""il cattivo"" (the ugly). Set during the American Civil War, the plot takes you through the ugliness of death and nonsense of the battlefield, the atrocities committed against war prisoners and a memorable portrayal of a near-death, dehydrated soldier, played by Eastwood. As with any good western, there is a lot of action, the plot holds your attention throughout and the ending is worth many times the price of admission.

1 April 2006,You can't miss the masterpiece,"In my mind the movie is awesome. The combination of the music and ""picture"" was something new at the time, and still it is. Composer Mr. Morricone was very talented man, in my mind he understood what the music and ""sounds"" can really do the movie. In the beginning of the film, where you can hear the coyotes howling, and next you can hear human's and orchestral voice of the same theme.

The camera shootings are also great. The silence of dialogs at the first ten minutes was me unbelievable. As a spectator i have to concentrate very carefully what is happening next and why is nobody talking??! And next was history. Atmosphere of this film is huge and the actors co-operation are incredible. Even if the movie is quite long, the time still run fast. And i have this feeling that is it already ends.

9 May 2019,An epic Sergio Leone's masterpiece the best spaghetti gold Western film in the Dollars Trilogy!,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

15 August 2015,Great film,"This is my favorite movie of all time when it is on TV i can not help but watch it. Sergio Leone is a great film maker. This film is better every time I watch it. I remember seeing this film when I was a child and loving it even then. The camera work the acting the score are all elements that make this film so memorable. Who can forget the big climax at the end. It is so intense. This film will never get old and i think every young film maker should watch it. I must have bought a copy of it on every platform. VHS, Laserdisk, DVD, Blu Ray, Digital Download. I think I will get a copy in future platforms as well. This film is not just a great western it is a great film.

7 March 2018,awasome,"There is a moment, for example, when men do not notice a vast encampment of the Union Army until they stumble upon it. And a moment in a cemetery when a man materializes out of thin air even though he should have been visible for a mile. And the way men walk down a street in full view and nobody is able to shoot them, maybe because they are not in the same frame with them.

Leone cares not at all about the practical or the plausible, and builds his great film on the rubbish of Western movie cliches, using style to elevate dreck into art. When the movie opened in America in late 1967, not long after its predecessors ""A Fistful of Dollars"" (1964) and ""For a Few Dollars More"" (1965), audiences knew they liked it, but did they know why?

I saw it sitting in the front row of the balcony of the Oriental Theatre, whose vast wide screen was ideal for Leone's operatic compositions. I responded strongly, but had been a movie critic less than a year, and did not always have the wisdom to value instinct over prudence. Looking up my old review, I see I described a four-star movie but only gave it three stars, perhaps because it was a ""spaghetti Western"" and so could not be art.

But art it is, summoned out of the imagination of Leone and painted on the wide screen so vividly that we forget what marginal productions these films were--that Clint Eastwood was a Hollywood reject, that budgetary restraints ($200,000 for ""Fistful"") caused gaping continuity errors, that there wasn't a lot of dialogue because it was easier to shoot silent and fill the soundtrack with music and effects. There was even a pathetic attempt to make the films seem more American; I learn from the critic Glenn Erickson that Leone was credited as ""Bob Robertson"" in the early prints of ""Fistful,"" and composer Ennio Morricone, whose lonely, mournful scores are inseparable from the films, was ""Dan Savio."" Even Eastwood's character, the famous Man With No Name, was an invention of the publicists; he was called Joe in the first movie, Manco in the second, and Blondie in the third.

Perhaps it is the subtly foreign flavor of the spaghetti trilogy, and especially the masterpiece ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" that suggests the films come from a different universe than traditional Westerns. Instead of tame Hollywood extras from central casting, we get locals who must have been hired near the Spanish locations--men who look long-weathered by work and the sun. Consider the legless beggar who uses his arms to propel himself into a saloon, shouting, ""Hand me down a whiskey!""

John Ford made Monument Valley the home turf of his Western characters, and he made great films there, but there is something new and strange about Leone's menacing Spanish vistas. We haven't seen these deserts before. John Wayne has never been here. Leone's stories are a heightened dream in which everything is bigger, starker, more brutal, more dramatic, than life.",10

11 July 2016,The definition of the Western genre,"Sergio Leone delivers a masterpiece in which everything is memorable: the music (by legend Ennio Morricone), the acting, the dialogues, the photography and, above all, one of the best movie endings in history. Clint Eastwood may be terrific again as the Man with no name, but is Eli Wallach, as the fast-talking Mexican bandit Tuco, who steals the show. The portrayal of American Civil War is also extremely realistic, with awesome battle scenarios. If the western genre could be represented by one film, this is the one.

If you haven't seen it yet, go ahead as soon as possible.

Thanks for reading.

23 March 2015,Greatest Movie of all Time,"This movie has grown from becoming a small low budget Spaghetti Western to one of he most beloved movies of all time. From the haunting score to the amazing scenery shots, this movie is incredible. Quentin Tarantino, an amazing director, has named this his personal favorite and called it ""the greatest achievement in the history of cinema"". This is easily Clint Eastwood best film and one of his most famous. The Man With no Name has gone on to become a cultural icon, from his poncho down to the stubby cigars he smokes. If you truly want to be entertained look no further because nothing has ever come close to the awesomeness of this movie.

22 July 2006,"Action, Fun, A Sense Of Adventure And A Skillfully Guided Work of Art","Clint Eastwood portrays and embodies the true meaning and the nature of ""tough"". A action film that is more than just mindless action, and that manages to avoid cheesiness. A entertaining film first and foremost. Yet it also has other qualities such as a memorable soundtrack, cinematography that one can appreciate, and three main characters that almost warrant their own films. The story is weaved together well and has some legendary moments, especially the finale.

Cool. Fun. Memorable.

Yet it doesn't sacrifice itself for entertainment purposes. A quality film that personally I enjoyed because it managed to incorporate a little bit of everything.

Keep your mind open. Grab some popcorn. Enjoy it.

22 August 2015,Great Western,"I watched a lot of westerns growing up, Parents hey. But I have always Liked the good the bad and the ugly. It is a timeless classic and is still a very good watch to this day. Same as a few dollars more. Made at a time when cinema was at it's peak and new avenues of filming was coming about. This film and many others should never be touched or re made. (True Grit aside). It spawned a fascination of the time with me the Music the settings, All added in t a masterpiece of a film. For those that have not seen this or are in 2 minds if to or not, Trust me you will not be disappointed, I say again it is a great Western with great Characters. Clint Eastwood is fantastic in it. The rest of the cast are also very good inc Lee Van Cleef who in my opinion was never a great actor.

I remember as a kid my father used to quote this film a lot, i finally i understood why. It made a huge impact on, films like this is not being produced anymore. Of course my favourite is Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Ramirez (""known as the rat""), he is my hero - a real ""drifter"" and as we say in danish ""a luck-seeker""... Eli's performance is impressive and the way he and Blondie's ""friendship"" develop through the film is very memorable. The only thing that irritates me, i am sorry to say, is in the beginning when Blondie shoots peoples hats of.... thats seem a little foolish...

Love it BIG TIME!

9 December 2006,Top of the line,"Great movie. The music, the scenery, the story. I have watched this movie many times. It is my all time favorite movie. Clint Eastwood is at his best. Eli Wallach plays a great role and often had me laughing. Lee Van Cleef is perfect for the part as the ugly, making you dislike him from the start. Three bounty hunters in search of the same treasure. The tension builds as the movie continues. I can actually feel the heat and the thirst in the desert scene. The close up photography is second to none. The movie is interesting from the beginning. It is a Civil War movie and a western all rolled into one. There is plenty of action. The music for the final gun battle keeps you on the edge of your seat. The ending catches you by surprise. I did not want this movie to end. The movie theme song is hard to top. You will find yourself whistling the first five notes over and over.

2 December 2021,Sergio Leone,"In 1964 Sergio Leone gave us the raw but impressive ""A Fistful of Dollars"", the next year he built on that with ""For a Few Dollars More"" giving us a glimpse of what was to come. And what was to come came in 1966 with what is widely claimed to be the greatest western ever made ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" or ""Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo."" to give it its original Italian title. A western of epic proportions and of epic length despite being shot on a very low budget. Not only is ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" such a great western but the directional style of Sergio Leone, used in all these three spaghetti westerns, have since influenced other directors most notably Quentin Tarrantino who you could say paid homage to Leone with his ""Kill Bill"" movies.

19 January 2022,Good,"Good, Bad Evil"" is my favorite movie about cowboys.

Most of all I like the hero called ""Bad"", he was played by the incomparable Lee Van Cleef! A stunningly handsome artist, with almond-shaped eyes, a cheekboned face and a gorgeous smile. What is only one of his looks worth... and what a figure. But Lee Van Cleef fought and served in the Navy.

All the other actors are also, quite, harmonious in their role.

And now it seems the end, they are being killed, but the slightest movement from the outside and they are saved.

It shows the deserts of the Wild West, cheap pubs and hotels... And of course cowboys who drink whiskey and eat beans. They also wear flared trousers and shoot well, even with their eyes closed. They shoot mainly from a colt and a rifle.

There are, of course, disadvantages in the film. Some events are delayed. It's not boring, but it could have been shown faster.

Some bloody scenes. Swearing... and heavy scenes of war.

Yes, and the directors showed the Yankee and Inca war.",9

In fact you make sure seem like a balanced stable individual if you dislike this movie at all. These couple reviews who were obviously raised at the Manson Ranch are out of their kids if they think this movie was lacking one single moment of perfection. Seek help immediately.

25 August 2014,"Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo","You see, there are two types of people in this world; those who make Spaghetti Westerns, and Sergio Leone. Leone, the king of the Spaghetti Western, and one of the all time greatest filmmakers truly outdoes himself with his classic, 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly'. With this installment of the ""Dollars"" trilogy, during the Civil War, we find Blondie (Clint Eastwood), ""the man with no name"", in a not so morally sound partnership with an outlaw/bandit, Tuco (Eli Wallach). The two characters go from town to town performing a genius scheme that is Blondie catching Tuco and turning him in for money, and then setting him free the day of the execution. They split the reward and prosper, until one day Blondie ends the partnership, causing Tuco to begin a hunt for Blondie, until they cross paths with deadly bounty killer, Angel Eyes. Now its a three man witch hunt, and to make matters worse, they all get word of buried Union gold. Now a race for buried gold, and vengeance, is underway as the three men will do anything to prosper. With classic Leone intense close-ups, shootouts, and unique dialogue. 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' is one for the ages, and will forever go down as one of the most phenomenal films in history.",10
12 December 2022,A classic,"This is classic.

This movie is a big masterpiece with some very good and talented actor like Clint (we all know who he is and what his name is) Eastwood.

The music is epic and so gooood!! There is some classical western soundtrack in this movie, known by everyone even if you never see this movie. Giving some good feels during the movie.

There is everything, the hat, the ""good guy"", the revolver, with some horses, and the saloon.

If you have never seen it, go, it's one of the best western of all time! (Yes it's a bit long, some scene are very slow, but it's 1966.) SO even it's old, give it a try.",8
27 September 2023,It could be better,"The title of the movie is actually graceful inside it.

It is higher than the spaghetti westerns, but it does not reach the classic western movies.

The plot was good but it took too long.

I watched the movie on a working day when I was alone! I started at 10:00 and finished at 17:00.

The actors were good, only 3 of them.

Pure music.

The work of the old western actors is incomparable I have seen a John Wayne western many times with my 7 year old daughter and she likes the movie Seeker more than I do The war scenes did not turn out well, although the reference to the war and that it is destructive and destructive was great.",5
4 April 2002,Slow and Great,"I was neither a western film fan nor a long films fan. But this film really changed my view. Casting was excellently done without any doubt.

Clint Eastwood is brilliant as the man with no name(Good,Blondie) with right personality and appearance for the character. Lee Van cleef too with his sharp eyes and evil look really does the justice for his villain character here. I think it is his best performance ever. But none tops the work of Eli Wallach as Tuco. I really liked him in a character like this than his character in Magnificent Seven. Other factor that makes this film so bright is that the stylish slow approach of the film in developing the story. I think Sergio Leone is a master craftsman there. Considering his great directing skills shown here I would give 10 out of 10 without a second thought.

First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

25 June 2014,I could give 11 if I could !!!!!!!,"Yes that's right , it is one of the greatest action movies I 've ever seen.And it stands between the years and decades from it's realize ,as a classic cult movie , a legend of the Spaghetti Western era, or I should say ""the Legend"".I 've seen it about 5 times and I could watch it again. Sergio Leone has a cynic way to describe life in the Wild West ,between real people ,not just heroes who save their country from the Indians, but people who fight for their own lives. And also I must mention the composer Ennio Morricone whose brilliant music matches perfectly( like a piece of a puzzle ) in Leone's scenes and make the whole movie ""A Great Piece Of Art"".Old school though , but I would say that word again : - ""Perfect!!"" - ""Cut!!""

13 June 2002,the best,"Maybe the best western movie ever. Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone was the perfect combination. Their result was this magnificent movie. And of course only these actors could make the film much perfect. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach will remain in history. The best western movie ever!!!

26 July 2015,The essence of true film making,"I may have seen this film about twenty times, but somehow this film never bores. For me this film encompasses the true art of film making, with simplistic scenes, sets, intriguing conversations and great music. From the opening scene where hit men gather in a deserted town, saying nothing, but express determination in fulfilling their objective, to the last duel where every tiny detail is filmed from eyes to fingertips. This in combination with greatly build sets (without CGI at the time) like a POW camp, a mysterious cemetery in the middle of nowhere, but above all the real naturalistic recordings at deserts and desert mountain areas. It really gives you the feeling of the real deal, outside Hollywood studies and that's what makes a spaghetti western great. You almost wish to be a cowboy yourself. Last (but not least) to mention the music, which perfectly fits the scenes and creates the extra dimension that makes this film a western masterpiece.

28 October 2008,Amazing,"This is my favorite movie of all time. I'm not even a big fan of Westerns, either, but this movie somehow goes beyond that. Everything about this movie is amazing, the cameras, sound, some people might say it's too long, but the ending is great every time I watch it.

Lee Van Cleef is an awesome bad guy too.. it doesn't get any better than that. Tuco is the ugliest of The Ugly, 100% immoral, a true criminal.. you just don't see many characters like that nowadays. Clint Eastwood hardly says a word, but still his best role ever, I think.

This movie has been shown on TV, which completely ruins the whole point of it.. This is probably the only movie i will refuse to watch, unless it's widescreen & uncut. I love it that much

1 January 2003,"I've seen it more than any other, must be my favorite!","Best line from any movie delivered by Tuco, ""If you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk!"" Best repeating line, ""There are two kinds of people in the world....."" Best casting director ever. Those faces! But it's the music that makes the whole damn thing go. And when it stops, crows and buzzing flies! Did Lee Van Cleef really have a missing finger tip, or was that just genius from directors?

7 February 2003,Hysterical!,"No wonder Eli Wallach keeps laughing maniacally throughout this movie. The parts intended to be trenchant turn out campy, the parts intended to be sardonic turn out campy, the parts intended to be suspenseful turn out campy, and the parts intended to be campy turn out campy. Leone indulged his taste for satire so much on this one that he accidentally satirized himself.

13 February 2003,"in this world my friend, there are two different kinds of people","......those who enjoy, as they would aging wine, this battle of good vs, evil ( with a little ugly thrown in for some outrageously funny tounge in cheek), and those who just don't have 169m to spare. in order to reach a climax we witness at sadhill cemetary we must remember leone is capping off two prior tales. and he must in the 3rd. of the trilogy, outdo the 1st. two to the hilt. he pulls out all stops using bits and peices of tricks learned from numbers first two. the musical pocket watch theme from a few dollars more can be heard once again during that incredible score as tention mounts at sadhill cemetary.

ENNIO MORRICONE the legendary italian westerns vol. two, a section of the liner notes reads: their first meeting yeilded more than it's share of surprises: ""when he open the door, morricone looked at me and exclaimed ""don't you know me ? we went to school together!"" riminised leone ""at first,i thought he was joking, but he proceeded to go into another room and returned with an old picture. sure enough: there we were, the two of us, seated next to each other in grammer school. i had forgoten all about it but he was right...""(the cosmic joker ?)

in american movies the score is always put in after the shoot. leone wouldn't dream of any shooting of a scene untill he first heard what morocone had composed first, which gave the director the vision needed to produce what should happen in the next scene. so it's this ultra-violent western captured by a dreamer(leone). the stuff revolutions are made of. meanwhile during fist full of dollars eastwood has whittled his dialogue to as few words as possible, thus helping create the man with no name image. the talking is done by tuco, benidicto, pacifico, ....juan, remerez/walach. every trick. cenimatic & musically, of first 2 pictures comes together. the musical pocket watch theme from for a ""few dollars more"" is inserted once more to increase the tension @ sadhill sequence. everytime i know this movie will be shown on t.v. MY hands are tied. w that noose is around MY neck, standing on that rickety grave marker. i ain't goin' nowhere for the next 161 mins. and so, in this world, my freind, there are two diffenent kinds of people. those who dig it. and those who plow through it. i dug. 38 years latter i'm still digging. no other movie with ending such as this, is even in the same building as bruno,ilbrutto, il cattio.",

21 February 2019,The single greatest movie ever made.,"I don't know what happened on imdb, but when I joined, this was the #3 ranked movie of all-time. Which is too low. It was only behind Godfather 1 & 2, and this makes them seem like a soap opera compared to a Best Picture Oscar nominee. Speaking of which, this is the best movie ever made to have never recieved a single oscar nomination. Nowadays, Clint Eastwood would've gotten Best Actor. Eli Wallach would've gotten Best Supporting Actor. Lee Van Cleef would've gotten a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Sergio Leone, Best Director. Screenplay, cinematography, musical score, the list goes on. It's not only the definitive western, but it has several other elements and plot lines. It's also a drama, a suspense film, a war film, an action flick, and a treasure hunt movie. With no details, it also has the greatest ending to a film ever put on screen. But everything about this movie is what makes it an all-time classic. Especially the reason it could never be successfully remade. The acting, screenwriting, directing, camera work, and brilliant musical score by Ennio Morricone are what make it unique to the point it can never be duplicated or improved. It isn't my favorite movie, but I tell everyone and anyone that this is the best movie ever made. I only believe that because everything in the movie holds its own and backs it up, and I hope anyone who watches it believes the same.",10
2 January 2012,If you never watched this film because you thought it looked boring...,"Then, respectively, You Sir or Madam are a fool. Badly dubbed, sillily cast and horribly underloved, this is possibly the greatest caper of its time and ever since. In a time of Hollywood heroes, horrifying villains and not many people in between, Leone submits one of his many masterpieces to exhibition, at a time when America had given up on the western because it had nowhere else to go. This film offers no heroes, gives you a villain and places a slimy little dog like tuco into the midst of the most realistic portrayal of the west the way it was. Sad, lonely and most certainly devoid of John Ford colour. Ironic really that one of the most loved westerns of all time was made in Europe. Good job really, though. The Americans never could get their history right. Clint has never been so squinty, Wallach so perfectly cast and Leone so frankly plain. Film fans, this is a must see. But if you are a casual viewer you may want to steer clear, for only a tide of angry rebuttal awaits your confusion and refutation on the web.

3 May 2003,Tuco..........,"I agree with most of the Universe that this is simply a wonderful movie. The one thing I just can't understand is how Eli Wallach was denied the supporting actor Oscar for his performance. The other two guys were outstanding - well, Clint was Clint........ but Tuco stole the movie.

Leone and Morricone, it just don't get any better than that!

23 January 2018,Beautifully shot with amazing music,"Has to be one of the best westerns of all time.

It has a simple story with uncomplicated characters who seek what they need to survive in their own way.

An amazing music score and incredibly well shot and put together scenes allow the plot to unfold with little dialogue.

Great casting means when the characters play well together, or not depending on who is supposedly on who's side the chemistry is outstanding.

21 October 2003,Morricone's Music,"I have long been a fan of this movie and although I think the compelling nature of the story might suffer after multiple viewings, I think the artistic aspect endures. Leone ""paints"" his scenes in some sense. And that amazing scenery - the desert and the clear blue sky. And Leone must have been such a civil war buff to be talking about Andersonville and all that. But I have one question for this movie's fans with which they might be able to help me - that tune the confederate orchestra is playing while Tuco is having the stuffing beaten out of him by the big thug working for Angel Eyes - is that a creation of Morricone or is it an adaptation of some civil war ballad that dates from the historical time of the action? I find it a very haunting melody. In some ways the music, plus the cinematography makes this film. And before I go, what about Eli Wallach? Clint has always been Clint at some level but Eli's versatility is evident if one compares his role as Tuco to the many other things he has done over the years. So there are two kinds of people in this world - those who dig the best elements of Leone and those who just say ""It's another Western."" - Yours Truly, Blondie Ramirez.

IT was magnificant with everybody reacting the same way you do when Clint, Lee and Eli do there magic on Screen. It was very exciting and refreshing to see my favorite movie of all time in such a way. DVD, Surround sound, and Plasma tv's are nice and all, but nothing can beat such a Cult Classic they way it was meant to be seen on the Big Screen.

4 December 2003,You Guys Suck,"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is one of my favorite westerns. I watched your airing of this movie, and was extremely disapointed. You must have cut an hours worth of material out of the movie. Some of the best lines, and scenes were gone. Then, to jump from the gunfight in the bombed out town straight to the Sad Hill graveyard scene was the worst. I had my teen aged son with me watching. I played the movie up to him telling him how great I thought it was. It was impossible to follow for someone who has never seen the movie because so much was missing. He though it was lame. If this is what you do to the movies you show every evening, Im sure I'll find something else to watch.

My two cents.

17 July 2014,One Of The Most Intitally Underrated Movies,"Upon its' release in the United States, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, was marred by film critics and their reviews of the film. I believe the Wikipedia page on the film, if you would like proof of its reception when it was released, it is under Contemporaneous reception. But since it's' release and contemporaneous reception, several well-known film critics like the great Rodger Ebert, have given it the rating it deserved and recognition as the film we know and love. I had known about it for a while and never watched it until my father showed it to me back in 2009. I will never forget watching with my dad and then learning how all great classic films are meant to be watched, with the people that you love. That next day my father passed away suddenly, but the memory of watching this movie lives on. From now until I die, I will cherish The Good, the Bad and the Ugly for all that is!

31 January 2012,"In this review, I discuss the film's music.","The Effects of the Music in the Film The Good the Bad and the Ugly by Brian Coatney

The Good the Bad and the Ugly made its indelible imprint in 1966 as the third of the Spaghetti Western trilogy, and it remains a piece of cultural lore even today for its inimitable synchronization of music and acting that produce dramatic tension neither the music or acting alone could generate. With a script that violently veers from traditional Western themes, Sergio Leone's artistic classic changed American culture as much as Woodstock did. Only a book could detail all the interesting aspects of the film, but here, I will comment on the music. Music is universal and sometimes music strikes us in a way we're not even conscious of, and it draws us with a power and mystique we can't yet identify and probably don't give that much thought to at first. Don't we often respond first by liking or disliking something before we know how to analyze why? So it was with the music in the Good the Bad and the Ugly. All I knew was that the music created an alluring mood in a mysterious and enticing way, giving the sense of what film critic Bill Warren calls an ""astonishing score."" The music is, in fact, exceedingly more than mere background or accompaniment to the film's action; its ""lonely, mournful scores are inseparable from the film"" (Ebert). Critic Vince Leo says that Morricone's score enabled the film to go from ""good film to masterpiece."" Not only that, ""Unlike most films, where the composer would create the music based on what happens on the screen, it is said that Leone worked the opposite way, constructing scenes to fit the pieces of music"" (Leo). One might say that with The Good the Bad and the Ugly, we enjoy a film made for its soundtrack rather than a soundtrack made for a film. If asked to describe the music of the film without reference to research, I would have described it like this: full of melody, a whistle pipe sound, rattle snake clicking at times, escalating tension on some kind of stringed instrument, slightly orchestral sounds, choral–like chanting voices, dramatic and paced buildup of tension—all of which was not overpowered with bass, rhythm, and vocals, meaning therefore not a band trying to create a full sound at high amperage. Somehow the music linked to the action, or shall I say non-action; for the music came into presence most it seemed when the characters stopped, spoke little, and hovered on the verge of a new twist in the drama: someone was about to draw, see an ominous presence, or experience an encounter of deep pathos and random violence—violence random to the victim but part of the consuming scheme of getting the gold buried in the graveyard somewhere. The famous signature score for the film came to signify in popular culture, a dramatic moment with peril in the air, a kind of pop icon score tied to antiheroes and subjugation of one person's dreams to those of another. A look at the critics fills in the detail that clarifies exactly what Morricone did. Max Garrone calls the film ""balletic violence,"" with its ""grand arias of whoops, whistles, Jew's-harps, gunshots and other errata."" Also, we learn that the sound comes from a ""blend of guitars, drums, and hyena-like cries from the singers"" (Leo). Getting more precise, Warren points out that Morrricone, ""blends elements of Mexican mariachi music with contemporary jazz, sweeping orchestral passages, choral voices, and an overall vividly distinctive approach."" The music so much penetrates the film that it ""incorporates the howl of a coyote—the first thing we hear in the movie itself—into the themes he creates for each title character, though the wail is orchestrated very differently each time"" (Warren). Director, Serge Leone, then must mean for us to hear the coyote's pathos in each character, whether good, bad, or ugly—a wail that gives us the prime musical elixir that penetrates and binds together the film's tone of deep pathos.

25 December 2004,Heading for Number One !,"Hi, all you commentators !

It's great to know that there are many many people around the world who look at this film as I do, -Numero Uno.

Since my last Comment (June 2003), I have now got the full Directors cut, complete with the deleted scenes back in. At the time, I commented that it should be technically fairly easy to ""splice"" these back in and have people to voice over the original Italian dialogue.

But then hey, what happens, ! They've gone and done the best possible thing, hired Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach to voice over their own original dialogue (plus another to double on Lee Van Cleef)- Almost forty years later !.

This totally revamped film with its replaced scenes makes it a whole new thrill to watch. If you haven't got it, then get it pronto!

I have no doubt that with the passage of time, The Good, The Bad and the Ugly will become certainly the greatest western ever made and possibly one of the top films of all time.

See you soon, idiots !",10
14 November 2018,The reason why I started working in film.,"I don't want to lose too many words to this movie, as it speaks for itself. Although being one of the most influential and important Western films of all time, I have a very special connection to this film.

Back when I was a child of 10 years, ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" was one of the first rated movie my father ever showed to me - although not being anywhere near the advised age. It didn't matter anyway, as I was deeply touched by the movie back then. It was its visuals, the incredibly well shaped characters (main and support) and the unforgettable and everlasting mega-score of the old master, Ennio Morricone. Grown up to a father, both Italian and a producer, film and especially Italian film was always a topic and a passion that made up a huge part in our family life. Still, I've never seen my father more emotional and feverishly romanticising about a movie as he did it with that one.

Nowadays, having seen this beauty for so many times that I lost count, I honestly recognise something new with every new session. It doesn't really matter if you focus on the unbeliveably well visualised portrayal of social contrasts in the past US, or the break with the glorification of classical American Western movies - this film was and still is revolutionary for its time and a predecessor for all the great Western, and other films in other genres, you can watch and enjoy today.

I fell in love with this movie when I was 10 and I still get the same feeling every time I rewatch this beauty.

10 out of 10 (and not just because of the age...)",10
2 May 2012,This was an interesting and exciting movie that tells an interesting story.,"When I sat down with my family to watch this movie I thought oh no anther western. I was about ready to leave the room because of the annoying music, until the movie finely started. When it did it started with action which you don't see very often in movies. For a movie made in 1966 it was really good except for the sound was off a little and they would say something and there lips were talking before the sound of there voice came on, but after about a half hour in I didn't notice it. In the summary I said that it told a good story because the story filliped around a few times, I think that is why I liked the movie so much. This movie does not get boring if you watch it over a couple of times ether. Over all the movie was interesting and Clint Eastwood played his part really well.

2 July 2014,Excellent Story and Excellent Direction,"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Eli Wallach, Lee Van Cleef, Clint Eastwood are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful direction from legend Sergio Leone as well. This film probably had the largest impact on my life. It set the tone for everything I then got interested in. American Civil War. Film Music. Clint Eastwood. Real Westerns. This is the best of the Dollars Trilogy and by far one of the best Westerns of all time. It has drama, comedy, cracking dialog, some of the most brutal battle scenes - especially around the bridge - that I'd seen up to then, music to die for and set pieces that just ooze atmosphere and tension. I have never forgotten the end shoot-out. It was just simply incredible.",9
2 October 2004,Timeless Classic,"Having watched this film originally in the early 70's it was easy to distinguish this as a serious attempt at a spaghetti Western unlike the comical Trinity movies with Henry Fonda. There are so many scenes that are interwoven masterfully with one of the best musical scores from legend Morricone. The cassette tape of the score made excellent driving music in its time. I did see this in Italy in the 80's where it has always been intermittently screened since its original release but was a tad disappointed at the condition of the print. The new double disc DVD finally does this film justice as it blows up well in a big screen HT. They added stereo to the mono soundtrack and even managed to tune up the picture quality a bit from the previous anamorphic DVD. (If only they would enhance the other 2 films in Sergio's trilogy).

If you have never seen this but have seen Fistful of Dollars or For a Few Dollars More, you will realize that Eli Wallach is a key reason for the added enjoyment Leone's fans realize with this film. Tuco is what makes this movie. He is the semi-bad guy you grow a soft spot for, especially in repeat viewings. His acting and facial expressions throughout and especially through the tense final moments of the film are almost without equal. I applaud Wallach who to this day is an active actor working in films (Mystic River) as he enters into his 90's.

For some of today's youth who may be used to fast pace plots filled with endless stunts in a 100 min movie, all I can say is be patient sit back and enjoy.",10
21 January 2005,Cinematic Genius,"I love this film. Every aspect; the characters, the story, the music. My favorite movie. The Trio is the greatest scene in the history of movies. Some fools scoff that it's boring. Boring? Have you never heard of suspense. Morricone's score gave me goosebumps.

Leone is a genius of a director, RIP. Clint Eastwood is good in anything he does. This is his best western, and certainly my favorite. It almost transcends being a movie, it's so fantastic. Leone's spirit still lives on. Enough cannot be said about this film and it's greatness.

11 stars A masterpiece.

22 November 2004,The other West,"I first watched Leone's trilogy when i was 12 years old. For the past 10 years, i have remained faithful and watched them at least once a month. One word could sum up this director's work: masterpiece. The very simplicity of the sceneries and the scenario, the chasteness of the characters, the alternative view on the West, even the minor faults in the shootings represent the reasons why Leone's movies are still the benchmark of all westerns. In this last film of the trilogy, the masterpiece concludes by portraying an image of the Far West that American western directors could've never even dreamt of. The pursuit for gold, the atrocities of the Civil War, human vices, all brilliantly presented by Leone. And all the above come in a movie that has no room for fresh, clean, crispy shirts that characters in various other westerns wear; And no, the sheriff is not a brave hero that shoots the bad Indians but only a man trying to make a living, the cities in Far West are not full of posh-ladies and righteous people, and above all when people get shot at surprisingly they get hurt! The picture of the West althoug not a rosy, happy one still is as real as it gets. And by featuring one of the coolest picture characters (Eastwood), a bad character whose just the voice gives u the creeps (Cliff), and one of the funniest characters ever to appear on a western (Tuco), this movie resembles perfection in its kind.",10

11 December 2004,this movie is under rated,"This movie is terribly under rated. This movie seems to have almost everything. Leone makes it so that we feel such compassion for his characters. One of the best parts of the films may be when Tuco is talking to his brother and when he's talking to Blondie about the great relationship he has with his brother, the priest. This movie is set on an epic scale and Leone steps up to the challenge of directing what Tarantino calls the 'best movie ever directed.' The opening sequence of credits may be the best I've ever seen. Setting the characters' faces in a monochromatic style while playing Ennio's main theme song for the movie was great. Perhaps this movie is under rated because Westerns haven't enjoyed the same prestige as other genres. It is true that most Westerns are usually drawn out, but Leone is able to keep with that sluggish pace and long running time, while keeping the audience excited and anxious for more. This movie is more than the greatest Western of all time, it is THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!! 'If only I had time to tell you.'

19 January 2016,masterpiece,"the good, the bad and the ugly is a film directed in 1966 by Sergio Leone. the film belongs to the spaghetti wester current, a current that inspired a lot of director of today. the film has renewed the icon of the hero, in fact Clint Eastwood in not interested in justice or peace, but he acts only for money compensation. the film starts with a introduction of the main protagonists, and the story became more intricate because all of the protagonists want a treasure but only the blonde know it position. the title is very important because it's like a parody, in fact the good (blonde) isn't very good but he's similar to the other people of the film. the good, the bad and the ugly in the third film of the dollar trilogy composed by ""for a fistful of dollars"" and ""for a few dollars more""

25 June 2013,Classic Spaghetti Western!,"Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

29 January 2005,My opinion about this film,"As long this is my first comment about a movie here in IMDb website, why not doing it in big style? The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is on top of my very best film list, even knowing that ""Terminator 2 : Judgement Day"" was my favorite film for at least 4 years. The actors, the history, the last duel..... words for what? This movie is a must, even people whom aren't western fans, will love this movie for sure. After this movie, I started to collect old movies, specially Clint Eastwood's old movies, like ""For a few dollars more"" , ""Fistfull of dollars"" , ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" .... and I may mention the '92 ""Unforgiven"" as well.

My vote: 10 , because 100 is impossible.

22 April 2017,Amazingly Magnificent Picture,"This is a amazingly magnificent film, every scene tells a story by itself with no need for a word. And I think Sergio Leaone has delivered it smoothly.

Even if you are not a fan of Western movies I think you will be not able to turn your head while watching this film, it has a magic attraction that only few films have.

On of the best movie that produced and will be produced. Truly unforgettable and great one.

26 October 2005,magical,"i first saw this masterpiece when i was 8, and didn't fully comprehend what i was witnessing. a true masterpiece by leone, with a score unsurpassed to this day. the genius of ennino morricone comes through in every painful note. eli wallach makes this the most wonderful viewing, why he didn't receive more recognition for the most complex character in the film is a mystery. leone, the genius behind spaghetti westerns couldn't have directed this piece with more passion and a combination of beautifully shot scenes that truly reflect the tragedy and misery of the American civil war. eli finds the balance between villain and unintentional humour irrepressible. the lovable rouge was truly born in 1965.

27 December 2005,Brilliant.,"This is the last in the ""Man With No Name"" trilogy, directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood, and is, without a doubt in my mind, the very best. This includes not only in the trilogy itself, but also every Western I've seen thus far. Both a commentary on war and an adventure story, The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is about a hit-man called ""Angel Eyes""(Lee Van Cleef), a bandit named Tuco(Eli Wallach), and the Man With No Name(Clint Eastwood), who go to find gold hidden by a soldier during the American Civil War. The movie has some of the best directing I've seen in a movie and has some great music to go along with it.

Bottom line: If you are a fan of Westerns(or hey, even if you aren't), see this film.

The acting (Eastwood is at his best and the supporting actors deliver as well) The directing ( flawless, Leone is at the peak of his powers in this film) The soundtrack (Well who hasn't heard the theme for this film? Its pure genius)

The landscapes are terrific The story and script are brilliant.

The landscapes also help carry and tell the story and are used to the utmost of their possibilities!

It doesn't matter if you like westerns or not, this is just the definition of a perfect film! For people who loves movies this is a must see. Watch it! 10 out of 10!!!

Carry on the spirit

That is the power of art.

To carry on the story and to convey

It is necessary to live more and keep alive

17 September 2005,"Too good, and not bad at all","Superb!! I don't know why I hadn't seen this movie until today, knowing that its superb. But when I finally sat down to see the movie, i was just stuck to my seat for 2 hrs and 45 minutes. These movie, which happens to be a bit long, doesn't seem so at all when you watch it. The camera-work, the direction and the descriptions of the three main characters is just remarkable. The young and strong-looking Clint Eastwood, the lousy-looking Eli Wallach and the selfish Lee Van Cleef fit their roles too well. Undoubtedly the best classic western movie ever made. A movie like this in that period is not an easy task at all. Kudos to Sergio Leone!

14 August 2005,Best Movie of All-Time,"I absolutely LOVE this movie. In my opinion, it is the best movie of all-time by far. I love all the 3 main characters. Eastwood is such a PIMP in this movie. I loved the format and I love the theme. Best theme in movie history in my opinion as well. It is by far my favorite movie right next to Shawshank Redemption. It is a tad lengthy but worth it. The mix of western, action, adventure, and even a little comedy mixed in is fabulous! The revamped version on DVD (in color) is wonderful. The way that the movie is put together in general is wonderful. The catch to the movie is simply spectacular. The cast is perfect. Clint Eastwood as ""The Good"" is perfect. His changing relationship with Tuco (The Ugly) throughout the entire movie is well thought out and can be quite humorous at times. And ""The Bad"" is your prototypical bad guy. He'll do anything to get the money...as will everyone else in the movie. Hands-down awesome movie. 10/10

27 October 2016,Excellent,"This one is one of my all time favorite movie. And I should say that the characters in the movie are quite unusual and with that the background music is an another suitable thing in order to achieve perfection. And on more most important thing I'd like to add is that the characters in the movies are the epitome of so called GOOD, BAD AND THE UGLY. And in this epic the good, bad and ugly side of human life is perfectly depicted without and err. And there are certainly some dialogues from the movie that would intrigue you while enjoying the movie. And one of them I'd like to share in order to grasp you a better understand of the context in which I'm talking about. The dialogue of the ugly guy- ""There are two type of man in this world...."" And at last the good guy used it on the ugly that was one of my favorite scene in the movie. And there are definitely a lot of thing about the movie that I like. Which is why it is one of my favorite movie.

25 August 2016,Greta Movie!!,"Literally loved this movie!! In a film that runs 180 minutes in its current restored version, that is not enough plot, but Leone has no shortage of other ideas. There is the opening shootout, involving unrelated characters. There is the con game in which Wallach plays a wanted man, Eastwood turns him in for the reward, and then Eastwood waits until he is about to be hanged and severs the rope with a well-aimed shot. There is the magnificent desert sequence, after Eastwood abandons Wallach in the desert, and then Wallach does the same to Eastwood, and the sun burns down like a scene from ""Greed."" There is the haunting runaway wagon, filled with dead and dying men.

14 October 2005,"Where life has no value, death, sometimes has its price","The wild untamed west, the quickness of the draw, the thundering of hooves, the stylish lighting of the cigar, the ruggedness of the landscape, the matching intensity of the characters...all captured beautifully in this gripping trilogy of ""Fistful of dollars"", ""For a few dollars more"" and ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"".

Based on the life of a bounty hunter, ""the man with no name"", played superbly by Clint Eastwood, the series takes us through his eventful journey, one that is in search of lucre, and one, which, alike all such journeys, has no end. The character of mwnm (short) leaves one in amazement at the beautiful shades of grey that Hollywood paints its characters in. On one end, the hard, ruthless killer, the fastest hand in the west, stopping at nothing to get his bounty and on the other, the tender caring humanitarian, uniting a mother forced into prostitution, with her husband and child, saving a man who stood by him, giving a dying soldier his last smoke. Eastwood excels in an underplayed role, mixing quiet aggression with an angelic demeanor; a potent combination, which any hit-man today would kill for.

Ably supported by an array of Mexican acting talent and the likes of Lee Van Cliff and Eli Wallah, this trilogy, transports you to a world, where people wore their heart on their sleeves, had a contempt for their own lives and for that of others, a world where surviving each passing day was as challenging as moving from one dusty town to another, as though one were moving from one battlefield to the next. The savagery of the wild west is given a sublime touch by the hauntingly soulful soundtrack; the musical mastery of Enrico Morricone. Kudos Amigo! And to borrow a line from Tuco, ""The Ugly"" one, ""There are two kinds of people in this world my friend, those who have seen this masterpiece and those who have not"".",9

4 December 2005,"Great cinematography, even better acting...","This film inspires me as a film-maker and actor. Ever since I first watched it, Mr. Wallach has made an impression on me. I absolutely love his acting and his character is oddly fun to watch. The three actors really make the movie. It is an honor still to see Wallach acting. His performance in an E.R. episode and his theatrical background show his true ability to be flexible and his talents are first rate. What an honor to be even able to talk to him once! His characters are always memorable. His expressions in this film go beyond what seems to be a minimum called for by that day's directors. With a score by the famous Ennio Morricone, supporting actors that have a real-life grittiness to them, really compliment one another. His best role is this one of ""Tuco"" as he really gets carried away. I HIGHLY recommend this must-see movie for it's raw performances and breathtaking landscape, epic shots. This, as well, compliments the pauses of thought as well as the never-ending feel to this one of a three part trilogy. Also recommend ""Aces High."" He seems to have done better in supporting roles, but it, as well, is better then Lee Van Cleefs brief stint in solo western acts.",10

5 September 2018,A Masterclass in Filmmaking,"My favorite movie of all time is The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Most critics and audiences tend to agree that this movie is exceptional. It's had a continued impact on the way films are made. And even over 50 years after its release, it has been able to entertain and influence a Gen-Z kid like me. What makes this amazing? There are so many things. I love treasure hunting, I love westerns, and I love the civil war, and the plot manages to seamlessly create a perfect story. The three titular characters are all interesting and beg for your attention from beginning to end. Blondie is a mysterious hero with a cowboy's charisma. He's just so cool that you have to root for him. Tuco delivers comic relief perfectly and his constant change of allegiance keeps me guessing. And finally, Angel Eyes is an impeccable antagonist; a dark, enigmatic hitman who's willing to do anything to get his prize. The three are portrayed perfectly by Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef. These are all dynamite performances, and it behooves any actor to study them. The gritty and violent western vibe is heightened in intensity by the backdrop of the civil war, giving it historical significance and a great background for the main characters to interact with. And let's not forget the music. This movie also has my favorite film score of all time. Ennio Morricone delivers impeccable music. It's soft and reflective when it needs to be, and it's epic and dramatic when the action builds up. Overall, I could go on and on about why The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly takes the crown for my favorite movie, but I think the movie speaks for itself. When I first saw it in 2014, I was struck. I was in awe. I was completely satisfied. There's absolutely no problem with it that I can name. There are a lot of great westerns, but Sergio Leone's masterpiece stands out because it uses so many interesting elements, and converts them into a realistic and impeccable story that I could never forget. A remarkable achievement in film history and art history, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is rightfully my favorite movie of all time.",10
2 November 2017,A Classic Movie,"With a lack of good western movies over the last few decades. It was good re watching this legendary movie. With 1 of the best line ups, it was destined to be a timeless classic.

The story has you captivated from the beginning to the end as there is always a twist and turn with these gunslingers.

13 December 2005,You dig.,"I'm almost ashamed to admit that I had not yet seen this gem until recently. I tend to scoff at supposed 'great' movies as they often don't live up, but ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"" is a tremendous exception. Leone is a massively underrated genius and his work is timeless. From the ever-punned soundtrack to the over-quoted quotes this movie is one of the classics that will open your eyes to the redone, over processed, plagiarized drivel that steals $10 from your pocket every visit to the local cinema. Every new movie is nothing more than a cheap version of something else. I guess that's how it is with everything...music, cars, etc. What a sad time to be alive...unless you're a classic film fan! Attention: LOTR fans...keep your light sabers at bay...your films are original, just not the kind of originality that should add to anybody's life.

RIP Leone RIP Film Industry

4 August 2018,"good , bad ugly","Gosh, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I finally saw this film! Who hasn't heard of it? First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.

Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic. Let's give it up for Sergio!

16 October 2018,The classic spaghetti western.,"Client Eastwood and the rest of the cast do an amazing job on these lower budget films that have you on the edge of your seat. Do yourself a favor and watch this instant classic film that would still hold up if it were released today. Amazing.

8 November 2018,"Stolid, gripping, Masterful and realistic Western","Directed by the legendary Sergio Leone and music by the Masterful Ennio Morricone, Good Bad Ugly is bound to be a classic. On top of that, Clint Eastwood's charisma, Eli Wallach's ruthlessness and Lee Van Cleef's cold bloodedness pack quite a punch. Set in the civil war era, in some unnamed frontier town in California (a guess), it's a story of 3 gunmen. How they fight through a bounty huntings, sheriffs, war torn towns and seedy bars to get their ultimate prize, a bag worth 200,000$ gold belonging to a former Confederate General. Contains realistic shooting scenes, emotional wallops and a gritty display of frontier life. A Must watch for people who like all male, slow paced westerns. A warning, it's quite long, so pack 3 hrs well before hand.

20 March 2006,I don't know why.,"I don't know why I love this movie, but it is one of my favorites. I think it's the actors. I truly believe that this story actually took place some where in the old West. I know it was filmed in Italy, but it still seems American to me. Does anyone else feel the same way about this movie? When will another movie of this caliber come to the big screen. I know that Clint Eastwood directed ""Unforgiven,"" and did a good job, but it wasn't as believable as ""Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo"" Maybe it was the age of the film itself, the dustiness, the yellowish hues, the darkness of camera. All the faces look real, dirty, leathery, and overall toughened by life. Where did Sergio Leon find Tuco? Did he use a time machine? All in all, if you haven't seen it, find some way to immerse yourself in the old West. You'll be glad you did.

27 March 2006,There's no name on this rock either...,"In a movie that consists of only quotable quotes, Eli Wallach's character Tuco has the best lines. Clint Eastwood rarely talks and Lee Van Cleef is menacing but honorable at the same time.

Why is this movie so good? Frankly, I have no clue. From a technical standpoint, the pacing is awful. The movie runs for 3 hours, which is much too long for what its plot is. Much of the screen time is dedicated to a staring contest between participants in a gunfight.

My best guess as to why this movie resonates so deeply with all of us is because of the lack of a good guy. All three of the characters are not very nice. There is no sheriff to dull the action. But they all have a good side. Lee Van Cleef's is the hardest to see. In fact the only good one can even see in him is the fact that he doesn't kill certain characters when he has a chance to such as Bill Carson's whore or Blondie. But somehow Leone extends this (or maybe its just me)... I just don't see Angel Eyes as completely bad.

Blondie and Tuco have a strange love/hate relationship. We can all relate to their friendship. They're only friends when it benefits them... or are they? Blondie's actions at the end suggest that maybe the Man with No Name actually cares.

And the famous final gunfight. Its been emulated so many times, but never matched. God its perfect cinema. Never have I seen such a tense moment in the history of film. I will never forget the first time I saw the film and the gunfight. I was drawn in instantly.

But my favorite parts of the film are the little touching side stories and add-ins that Leone gives. The legless desperado who receives money for the information he provides and then wastes his money on liquor; the scene in the monastery with Tuco and his brother; the drunken general; and the dying Confederate soldier at the end... these scenes are what give The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly the kind of beauty that lacks in so many other western copycats.

Sure Blondie is one cool guy who pretends that he doesn't have a heart. But when he finally reaches his catharsis... when he finally admits how much the war is ""a waste of men""... we realize that Blondie does have a heart -- he just hides it.

Why? Maybe because it hurts too much to show it. A Fistful of Dollars suggests that (Although Leone never intended for the dollars movies to be connected). If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing out on a landmark Italian movie. After watching this, I was hooked on Italian film. I started watching all of Leone, Fellini, Argento... Italian films are full of life that American films lack-- there's some sort of strange mystical wonderful culture in them that I just love. Watch this.",10
