7 January 2006,Justice or Vengeance?,"Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's ""Munich"" seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. ""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, ""When does it ever end?""

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention.

14 July 2006,"Spielberg may be out-of-touch with the masses in terms of entertainment today (WOTW)  but when he sticks to serious topics, he carves out sensational fares like this one","Munich may just be Spielberg's greatest accomplishment ever and it isn't a sweeping epic like you'd expect, but a patient psychological thriller that sneaks up on you and takes you and shakes you. It not shy away from blood, politics or nudity in its portrayal of events and this makes it extremely intense, absorbing and occasionally very violent.

The first half of Münich is not altogether different from a heist drama; a group of diverse men with different skills team up to accomplish a mission. They get to travel across Europe, make deals, infiltrate suspect facilities and manufacture explosive devices. Unlike heist films, however, their mission is not for personal gain, but for the government. They are to assassinate eleven Arabs who were alleged to be behind terrorist attacks like Münich 1972. So the more accessible part of the film sees Bana and his men botch their way through a hit-list as inexperienced hit-men, fumbling and trembling with the weight of this somber new task.

This part is so extraordinarily well-handled and engaging with a tone so tense and shadowed by politics and ethical dilemmas that every slight pause is mistaken for humour. It is also an excellent portrayal of an era - the 1970s - with great eye for detail, all carefully sewn together by a master tailor (Spielberg). It is a fantastic piece of film-making.

While Munich keeps you interested throughout, it gradually loses its fresh thriller edge by opting for more typical scenarios. Eric Bana's character goes through emotional struggles because he finds it too hard to kill people. He thinks about his family--his wife has just had a baby girl. He wonders if he is doing the right thing. He starts sympathizing with the Arabs. He wonders if they killings will stop once he has completed his mission. Everything is classic and you saw it coming. It needs to be present in the film for a balanced portrayal but the hackneyed formula with which it is expressed is disappointing. It started so promising, after all.

Sadly, the culmination of this slightly hackneyed recipe manifests itself in the final scene of the film and it is absolutely dreadful and drags the whole film down by at least one star - but overall this is superb quality that is carried by a strong ensemble cast (Geoffrey Rush, Daniel Craig) although it is ultimately Bana's show. He captures the inner turmoil and hesitation of his character in the most believable way, making Munich into a worthwhile adventure for its performances alone. But most importantly, it dares to asks questions.

10 January 2006,An Outstanding Thriller,"'Munich' is, on the whole, a straight forward hit-man movie. The assignments are handed out; the team is assembled, each with their own specialty; and they travel about Europe plotting and carrying out their hits. We have the inevitable paranoia, the double agents and suspicious loyalties. So far, so familiar. Only 'Munich' is wrapped in the thin veneer of 'history' and 'fact', and mob bosses and corporate espionage is replaced with Middle Eastern politics and Israeli-Arab relations. I mention this because the politics of 'Munich' are really nothing more than a topical plot devise, used the same way as cold-war relations and soviet villainy was used thirty years ago.

What prevents 'Munich' becoming just a generic updated-cold-war thriller, is the sheer quality of the production. From the flawless recreation of European capitals in the early seventies to the impeccable costume design to the beautiful cinematography  'Munich' is a visually fascinating movie. The performances are universally outstanding, with Bana in particular bringing a sense of tough nobility that seems to be his forte. The script is intelligent and thought-provoking, and it is Kushner's focus on the emotional and psychological landscape of his characters rather than the details of political contract killing, that ultimately lifts the movie above the generic. The kind of self-consciously poetic prose for which he is known, so often seeming unrealistically erudite, is kept to a minimum, and when it does appear, is so beautifully written and performed that all reservations are forgotten.

Ultimately, the greatest praise must be reserved for Spielberg, who has, with 'Munich', created perhaps the first truly adult movie of his career. We see no signs of his trademark sentimentality, his descents into fantasy, his childish simplification of motivation. With 'Munich', he embraces ambiguity and complexity, and as a result, has invited criticism from those who prefer their drama simplistically black and white. Above all, one can't help but wonder what the Spielberg oeuvre would look had he not dedicated his career to kid's movies, fantasies and feel-good sci-fi.

'Munich' is an intelligent and gripping thriller that is a major contender for award recognition, and deservedly so. An outstanding achievement.",9
23 December 2005,A Half Cooked Masterpiece,"Steven Spielberg has absolutely everything at his disposal, he can make an epic in no time at all. But, even he must know that films, most films have a soul and that can't be rushed. Why the need to rush this film into screens? For Oscar consideration? If there was a film that needed nurturing and thought was this one. The length is a flaw in itself. It makes it appear self indulgent and, quite frankly,annoying. If one could, and one should, put that aside, ""Munich"" is a remarkable experience. Tony Kushner and Eric Roth deal with people in all its complexity - a welcome new detail in a Spielberg film - and that gives ""Munich"" its most powerful aspect. Eric Bana is extraordinary and the humanity of his gaze is confusing and recognizable at the same time. His crying at hearing his child's voice over the phone is as real as his hardness when he massacres his targets. The controversy raising after the first public screenings seems pre-fabricated by a marketing machine. The questioning of Bana's character and the appalling nature of revenge can't be controversial it's at the base of human nature. To call Spielberg ""no friend of Israel"" is as absurd as it is suspicious. No, this movie is a thriller, based on actual events, directed by the greatest craftsman of the last 30 years in a record amount of time. Go see it.",8

9 January 2006,"""It's strange, to think of oneself as an assassin."" - Carl","If you ask me who was the most talented director working in film today, I'd hesitate for a while. Then I'd look at you and say, ""Probably Steven Spielberg'. A lot of film directors in Hollywoodwho are well-known are overrated (Oliver Stone, Sofia Coppola, Anthony Minghella, etc), but one that is not overrated at all is Spielberg. The man is obviously a cinematic genius who thrilled and enthralled us with his grim but unimaginably powerful WWII epic 'Saving Private Ryan', his still-frightening 'Jaws', his severely underrated 'Amistad' and of course, his heart-breaking masterpiece that still remains one of the twenty best films of all time 'Schindler's List'. I can't even begin to describe to you how jazzed I was about the controversial vengeance drama 'Munich', which was Spielberg's first Oscar-contending movie in seven years. After viewing it I have to say I was a bit let down, but I still got what I predicted I'd get going into the theater -- the best film of 2005. Spielberg challenges our beliefs on justice with his intense but painfully realistic bone-chilling masterpiece. You have to see this movie.

Almost around the age of 45-50 remembers the 1972 Olympics incident that happened in Munich. On a gloom September day, eleven innocent Israeli athletes were abducted and taken prisoner by a mob of Palestinian terrorists. The terrorists held them hostage at the Munich airport, then based on a mistake by the Munich police department many terrorists were killed and took all of the unfortunate hostages with them. The film starts after these events when Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen), secretly decides to start a small mission to find the Palestinian's responsible and murder them. She hands the case down to case officer Ephraim (Academy Award Winner Geoffrey Rush - Shine) who hands it over to Meir's ex-bodyguard Avner (Eric Bana - Troy). Avner must leave his family to undergo this mission and form a team to help him complete it. The team is; Steve (Daniel Craig - Layer Cake), the trigger-man, Carl (Ciarin Hinds - HBO's Rome) the clean-up man, Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz - Birthday Girl), an ex-toy maker turned explosives expert, and the elderly Hans (Hanns Zischler - Undercover) who is a forging expert. They five go on a mission of vengeance, but are soon faced with unexpected problems in the process and feelings of guilt which lead some to believe maybe what they are doing isn't righteous.

When creating 'Munich' Steven Spielberg could have sided one way or the other on issue 'revenge killing', but he doesn't, and I strongly admire that. Instead, Spielberg does what any intellectual would do, he presents situations and historical truths and makes you decide for yourself. That's something you can't expect nasty politically-slanted morons like Michael Moore to do. Spielberg provides us with the best film directing in two years with his quiet stroke of genius that is Munich. Spielberg's directing is both electrifying during the action sequences and beautiful during the poignant and thought- provoking scenes like when Kassovitz's Robert questions Bana's Avner about the good of what they are doing in a subway station on the way to assassinate another target. Munich's film editing and cinematography both should win Oscars, while the acting (which isn't getting much acclaim from award mediums) is frightfully close to perfect. Eric Bana gives the performance of his career as Avner that will no doubt impress you, while Kassovitz, Zischler and Craig exceptional also. Rome's Ciarin Hinds turns in an outstanding performance as the ultra-cool clean-up guy Carl that should also win an Oscar nomination, while Geoffrey Rush does wonders with a small role as Avner's case officer (so does Lynn Cohen as Golda Meir).

If Spielberg's 'Munich' doesn't tug at your chest at the end, I would question your humanity. Spielberg doesn't butter this up so it goes down easier, he aims straight for the gut with his razor sharp realism and rubs salt in the wound. 'Munich' isn't a fun film, but there is no question it is a riveting and nearly flawless one. You will have a lot to talk about after the film has ended. With 'Munich', Steven Spielberg gives us one hell of a history lesson. Grade: A (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 1/7/05)",10

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. ""Munich"" could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul. ""When does it ever end?"" Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",10
15 May 2006,"Great Film, Exceeded Expectations","It helps when you aren't overly-hyped on a movie before seeing it. I wasn't that interested in seeing this, for some reason, but did....and, wow! This is a fine movie, one of the Steven Spielberg's best efforts. Yes, he gets a little preachy in the end but overall, this is enjoyable and top-notch film-making.

Even though this had some violent moments, what impressed me was the restraint not to overdo the violence. I thought there was just the right amount. Being a long movie at two hours, 45 minutes, too much action would have worn out the viewer and too little would bore he/she. It also was fascinating to me as almost a travelogue, seeing a lot of different cities around the world, following this team of Israelis as they track down and kill many of the men responsible for murdering hostages in the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.

That's the story of this film: not what happened at the Olympics, but how the Israelis tracked down the killers/terrorists afterward.

Some of the violence is room-shaking if you have good speakers as a few of the explosions felt like it made my room shake when they went off! However much of the film deals not with that but with the men involved and how this mission affected them. In the end, Spielberg gives us a chance to reflect on a big question: how do you respond to terrorist attacks? Hopefully, the film can lead to some intelligent discussions. I have read where the Israelis were not happy with Spielberg's position on the matter. Since they have dealt with that issue for many years, I would listen to them carefully but be open for any viewpoint on this crucial issue. See the movie yourself and see what you think. Overall, Spielberg went out of his way to present both sides, so kudos to him for doing that.

The bottom line, as far as the film goes, is that it is simply good entertainment. The movie is well-acted and has a story that will keep most people very involved while watching it. We plunk our dollars down to get entertained....and this movie delivers. Highly recommended.",10
26 January 2006,Depth and detail - with no sides taken,"This movie relates more than just a story of ""Vengeance"". Besides proving that killing begets killing - it consists of numerous fine details that reveal the hard work done at getting to the depth of things:

For instance, only characters that get shot in the head slump to the ground. The rest take time to die - they walk a few steps, spurt blood and express a look of helplessness and inevitability before going out. Yes its horrifying to look at, which is the point, but it is also real.

Every character is different, and though common in their desire for vengeance, their temperaments are clearly distinguishable in the way the hit men approach their task. Even the terrorists are not stereotyped into hysterical, screaming lunatics. They range from the visibly nervous to the cool Abu Salameh with the movie star style. They are poets, intellectuals and guerrillas each with his story of the conflict. They speak passionately about home - a recurring theme, along with ""family"". Moreover, Spielberg does not attempt to mitigate the grotesque manner of their deaths, for the blood of the targeted men flows as freely as that of their victims - and when they are blown up, their body parts dangle from ceiling fans. You are not here to feel satisfaction over anyone's death, Spielberg says to the audience. Or as Caine would say in Kung Fu: ""The taking of a life does no one honour.""

There are no easy ""shoot-em-dead"" eliminations. There are neighbors, bystanders and obstacles that must be avoided and protected - with variable success. Innocent people may be harmed - and one has to live with that.

There are no mathematical certainties about the potential damage a bomb will cause.

Perspectives and convictions can change, sometimes regrettably. ""Don't think about it - just do it"" says Avner at one stage when a member of the team expresses doubts about a target's guilt. But at the end he wants evidence that the men he despatched were justifiably killed. Implausible? No; it is only when he has been reunited with his family and experiences the affection of wife and child that he allows himself to reflect from a different perspective - their targets had families too - what if he had killed the wrong men?

The paranoia that permeates the world of spies and assassins is built up gradually - to the point where every survivor mistrusts everybody else. One is doomed all one's life to walk with ears strained for following footsteps. The length of the movie creates the right atmosphere for this idea.

The end dissatisfies many because they would like a reassurance, a note of optimistic finality - but Spielberg rightly offers none. It would be dishonest of him to offer a false but comforting illusion.

It is interesting to contrast this movie with ""Paradise Now"" that has no violence, a modest budget, and views the conflict from the Palestinian camp. Both narrate completely different stories - yet, in their respective ways, both humanize their subjects, defuse myths about glory, and arrive at the same conclusion: ""There's no peace at the end of this.""",9
23 January 2006,"An extraordinary filmriveting, involving, challenging","I am not a big Spielberg fan, and find he often goes for cheap emotional manipulation in his films, especially his endings. I was there fore amazed at the unflinching control he exercised in Munich, his utter unwillingness to flinch at complexities, his ability to dissect the ideological and moral sureties of all sides within the natural rhythms of the thriller genre. There is so much to praise in this film, because it is utterly seamless film-making with a keen eye for every little detail that never reveals the intense precision behind its construction.

While some have found the film ""disengaged,"" I found that it pulled at the viewer's conscience through the central characters, not only Bana's Israeli agent Avner and his cohorts, most of who slowly find themselves gnawed by doubts of their mission's morality and effectiveness, but also smaller characters as well, drawn with indelible deftnessthe weary ex-French Resistance fighter now a trader in deadly information to stateless agents because of his cynicism about recurrent corrupt regimes replacing each other, or the PLO operative who debates Palestinian strategy and justification with Avner, who he wrongly believes to be a German left-wing terrorist who is ""soft"" on Jews because of the Holocaust. The economy of Spielberg's film-making is breathtaking in hindsight, so that what at first seems a relatively flat and emotionless exercise in historical recreation slowly seeps into one's subconscious and then moves upward, in quick bursts of sudden bursts of emotional and intellectual recognition by the viewer. These are real human beings, these are fighters in a war they believe in desperately and whose people have suffered terribly yet can find no real peace.

For this Kushner and Roth's screenplay must get much credit, the crisp narrative development intertwined with intellectually rigorous set pieces and flat-out armrest-clutching actions sequences. John Williams, who has managed to be understated in the past, is equally adept at building (or feinting) tension and subtly commenting on character development. Check out the slightly dissonant piano in the last scene to see what I mean. Longtime Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski creates some amazing framing devices, especially as the action sequences are about to unfold and during moments of intimate conversations imbued with tension. Michael Kahn's editing is crisp and occasionally startling, as in the way the conclusion of the horrifically bungled Munich ""rescue"" is related. The retelling of the entire event from break-in to conclusion is doled out in bits and pieces in what seems at first an attempt to soften its impact but in the end, entwined as it is with all of the complicated issues, is finally revealed as a masterful means of achieving the fully deserved emotional impact within a complexly rendered ideological, moral and strategic matrix. There is not a false note in any of the acting, and the casting is uniformly spot-on.

About the politics. The radicals on either side will reject the film out of hand because it dares to render both sides as human and worthy of understanding. But attempting to understand choices of violence and vengeance as strategies does not in any way mean condoning them. Certainly, anyone who feels that the film somehow allows a viewer to walk away thinking that Black September was justified in its attack is probably projecting his or her fears about how some imagined uninformed viewer might react. Instead, the film demonstrates that whether one feels either or both sides justified it doesn't mannerneither side can win through violence at this point. This was Yitzhak Rabin's great insightyou don't make peace with your friends, you make peace with your enemies. His Israeli Jewish murderers wanted violence to continue, believing that only a continued state of war would keep Israel from giving back land they saw as bound up with their faith but which international law, historical study and the basic ""facts on the ground"" reveal to be bound to be returned to the Palestinians. Ariel Sharon, of all people, came to understand this, though without the larger vision and magnanimity of spirit that his fellow warrior Rabin discovered. Spielberg's message is clearthe extremists will choose war over peace, but must so many of us side with the extremists because of our fear of appearing weak or ""giving in""? A last note on politicsthere is clear relevance to the United States' current predicament post-9/11. One can almost here Cheney or Bush making the speech made by Israeli premier Golda Meir in the film (an extraordinary piece of recreation that transcends mere imitation), only probably with more moral surety and less sense of resignation. Anyone paying attention to world reaction to Guantanimo, Abu Gharib, the bombing of Afghan and Iraqi villages and the spiriting away of suspected terrorists through ""rendition"" for torture in ""friendly"" nations must be aware that whether one leans hard or soft on such matters, there is going to be a price to be paid. The hardliners believe we will just keep punching and slugging and eventually the bad guys will go down; that they will not reproduce themselves like the many-headed Hydra or germinate and reproduce by the thousands in the fetid waters of our perceived hypocrisywhether you think it justified or not it doesn't matter. As Spielberg makes clear in this film, all that matters in the end is peace or violence, and whoever ultimately desires the former had better be damn sure that their use of the latter is measured by the awareness that it use will create debts that will need to be repaid in the end, and the debtors will most likely be the generations to come on all sides.",10
15 January 2006,A fine effort indeed,"Just because this film has been attacked by pols and shills, here's my 2 cents. Spielberg manages to set the agenda, and sets it correctly. It is indeed about the antecedents to 9/11, and bravo to Spielberg for taking it on, but not somewhere in Afghanistan, but at its genesis, the squalor of Palestine.

Spielberg's film is an essay on revenge and how hopeless and self-defeating that ancient temptation is. It's brave of Spielberg to say it to us now; brave, too, to paint the avenging Israelis as somewhere below the Angels. Let's be candid: There are harsh sentiments expressed here, by some Israeli characters, that the Evangelical Lobby simply doesn't want aired.

Spielberg's handling of the Bana character is masterful. Noteworthy is how uncompromising it is: this is a man whose identity has collapsed. It's entirely right that his Israeli handler should refuse the Sabbath-meal invitation at the end, realizing that the bonds of the older religion (and pre-Zionist identity) are shattered and meaningless.

Spielberg might have improved this product (some of the dialogues are horribly wooden). But that's not important. That a mainstream US film should go where this film goes is significant. This is a major-minor event in Spielberg's long and luminous career.",8
3 February 2006,I never checked my watch more often,"Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's ""Munich"" seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. ""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul.

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg.

A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission.

2 January 2006,I don't exist and you don't know me!,"****SPOILERS**** Planning to put the Israeli/Palestinian dispute on the front pages of the world's major newspapers the shadowy Black September group storms the Israeli dorm, in the Olympic village, where it's Olympic athlete's are housed in Munich Germany. Within 24 hours, September 5/6, 1972, during a tense and nail-biting stand-off all eleven Israeli captives and their eight Palestinian captors are killed in a shootout and grenade assault between the German police and Black September terrorists.

Back in Israel Prime Minister Golda Meir,Lynn Cohen, gets the heads of the Mossad and IDF, Israeli Defense Forces,to plan what to do in the aftermath of the murdered 11 Israeli athletes. Even more important Premier Meir wants to show that actions like that in Munich will not go unavenged and unpunished.

Trying to distance herself and her government Premier Meir has a secret group of Israelis assassins lead by her former bodyguard Avner, Eric Bana, get all the money and assistance that they need in finding the Munich 11, the Black September members who planned the Munich attack, and bring them to justice; instant justice with Avner and his men being judge jury & executioner.

The movie ""Munich"" has Avner and his fellow covert Israeli Government assassins track down most of the Black September killers terminating seven of them including scores of accomplices by the time Avner's group was finally disbanded by Prime Minister Meir in June 1973. Still the Israeli hit team was unable to find and terminate the Big Salami and leader of the bunch who's name ironically is Ali Hassan Salameh, Mehdi Nebbon; were told at the end of he movie ""Munich"" that Ali Hassan Salameh was indeed killed by the Israeli Mossad in 1979.

Penetrating and thought provoking real life thriller that shows the fine line between the Israeli hunters and Palestinian hunted. We also see how they suddenly switch later in the movie when the Black September terrorists start to turn the tables on the Israelis by tricking and trapping three of their agents, with the help of a beautiful but deadly Dutch femme fatal Jeanette(Marie Josee-Croze),leading to their deaths.

Avner who was so eager and determined to do his job later started to get sick of killing and even felt a bit of sympathy for the hated Palestinians seeing that they, like himself an Israeli Jew, have a right to live in a land of their own. There's a very emotional exchange between Avner and Black September member Ali, Omar Metwally, who didn't know that he, Avnar, was Jewish and a Israeli covert agent out to kill him, which he did. This talk with Ali seemed to open Avnar up to seeing things beyond what he'd been exposed to as an Israeli, or native born Sabra, all his life.

The movie ends with Avner together with his wife Daphna, Ayelet Zorner,and new born daughter living in Brooklyn New York unable or not wanting to return back to his native Israel and having nightmares over what he did and went through as a Israeli assassin. Avner now feels that he may well be terminated himself by the very people, the Israeli Mossad who he so secretly and effectively worked for. The reason Avner felt that way may have been because he couldn't keep what he did locked up within the four corners of his troubled mind.",8
7 February 2006,Spielberg's Journey,"Ever since he has journeyed into serious films (starting with ""Empire of the Sun"" and then ""Schindler's List""), Steven Spielberg has been searching for a method of making violence unattractive to moviegoers. ""Schindler's List"" was, of course, shocking, but this first attempt at strong violence did not quite have the intended effect. I know that a lot of people (including me) feel saddened by the film, but SL's violence could seem distant at times, like the audience was merely an observer. ""Saving Private Ryan"" was the second great attempt at making moviegoers detest violence, but this seemed easily dismissed as a war film, showing events that would probably never happen again, like showing violence in a distant universe. Munich is his latest effort, and it shows Spielberg's feeling that his previous films, although progressive, had not quite 'hit the mark'.

The violence shown in Munich is, perhaps, the most brutal realistically intentioned violence ever shown on film. I say 'realistically intentioned' because, like the average moviegoer, I have not witnessed people getting shot or blown up, so I don't know what those events would actually look like. There are many signs in the film that Spieberg is trying to improve on his earlier efforts. The guns in the film are REALLY loud when fired. This has the effect of putting you in the fight, making it more intimate when someone IS shot. The bullet wounds and remains after explosions are quite gruesome. When someone dies in this film, no matter what side they are on, you feel no happiness, no relief or awe. You feel a sense of death, nothing dramatic, just blank and empty. For this reason, Munich is one of the most important films to have come out, and perhaps it is Spielberg's best ('Raiders' is too superhuman to be included on that list). Spielberg deserves the best director for this one.",8
6 January 2006,"Intense, worth every minute","Another dip in the Spielberg pool and I come away drenched in emotion. I was a freshman in high school in Texas during the Munich games. I was stunned by the events and understood little.

Today, I am still stunned by Munich and every terrorist act that followed, but I understand so much more and grieve. Spielberg gives us a powerful glimpse into the meaning of home, family, honor, history, ethics, and faith. The movie is not about the Jews and Arabs. It's about human beings. It's about us.

The narrative is driven by our connection to Avner. We watch as Eric Bana opens himself up in a way that the likes of a George Clooney in Syriana only dreams of.

This is a must see.

14 February 2006,Simple thriller dressed up in impressive technical details,"It's been eight years now since Steven Spielberg picked up a 'Best Director' Oscar for Saving Private Ryan, and a massive thirteen since he snagged 'Best Picture' with Schindler's List. I'm sure that Spielberg had these things in mind when he decided to take on Munich; as it becomes obvious while viewing this film that so much time has been spent on trying to ensure that everything is professionally done, that Spielberg has forgotten to actually make a film. Munich is about the tragedy at the Munich Olympics, which saw eleven Israeli athletes lose their lives to Arab terrorists. This plot, obviously, is very relevant these days with all the hype surrounding terrorism; and Spielberg has made a film with the central idea being that 'violence breeds violence'. This is an admirable base for any film, especially given the fact that this film follows a plot that is grounded in real events; but in order for the story to carry any weight, the audience really needs to be involved in it. And this is where Munich falls flat on its face.

By making the central character a terrorist, Spielberg puts us at the centre of the action. The director tries to make us believe that the lead is a complete character, by showing us scenes where he's blowing people up, as well as sequences with his wife and new born child; but this is far too black and white. Thrillers have got by with far less characterisation, but if you're going to make us believe that your lead is more than a cardboard cut-out, you're going to need to do a better job that that. At its base, the film is a list of assignments that need to be carried out by the Mossad agent at the centre; but these are caught up in far too much waffle, and while the murder sequences themselves are beautifully stylised - tension is stripped from the film by the way that the plot goes from exciting to achingly boring. As mentioned, technically the film has no problems at all. The cinematography is great, as is the direction and Eric Bana, as ever, does an excellent job of leading the film; but like Schindler's List before it, Munich just feels like nothing more than an attempt to win an Oscar. Personally, I'd rather see the award go to 'War of the Worlds'. It might not be as critically friendly, but at least it sees Spielberg doing what he does best.",5
3 January 2006,Okay but not great retelling of the aftermath of the Munich Olympic tragedy,"This is a movie that looks and feels unlike any other Steven Spielberg film. Its a well made and mostly well acted story about the Israeli hit squad sent out to kill the plotters of the terrorist attack at the 1972 Olympics. The problem for me was that I was never emotionally engaged except when we see the recreation of the attack. I never really felt any connection to any of the Israeli agents taking revenge. A large part of the problem is that Eric Bana seems completely out of place in the film. He's much taller and much too good looking not to stand out in a crowd, which struck me as odd since he was chosen to lead the team in part because he didn't look Jewish. Bana also seemed to have only one expression through most of the movie and I wondered whether he was actually Buster Keaton in disguise. This isn't to say the film is a bad movie, its not, Its just not a particularly engaging one. For my money I would rather see the 1986 version of the same story The Sword of Gideon, or better yet the excellent documentary One Day in September again since at least I would actually feel some connection to the events rather than just an admiration for the film making skill.",6
8 July 2008,Close Encounters of the Spielberg Kind,"I like to swim more deeply in film than Spielberg. So although he makes somewhat effective films, they leave me wondering why they were made.

Well, we know why this, ""Schindler"" and ""Ryan"" were made. Its because after skimming a gazillion dollars by amusing us, this man wants to be seen as a weighty, ""real"" filmmaker. A Kubrick that likes to occasionally have fun. We all know these films to be made on ostentatiously weighty material, so they must be deep.

I had the highest hope for this one, because I know he was stung by how poorly the others were received by people he trusts. So here, he goes back to his method of ""Close Encounters"" which was supposed to use New Wave techniques and to circumnavigate what was then new ideas about noir. I liked it. It took chances and where it failed it did so interestingly, even in the more ambitious later cut.

This uses standard (meaning later) Spielberg techniques. Despite his vaunted cinematic storyboarding technique, all the emotional content here is spoken. All the emotional reference is off screen. There are violent acts, but these seen deliberately bloodless, like an Indiana Jones movie would have then, something abstract to talk about. The intended effect was to haunt by the reality that punches through the rationalization. The reality here never gets a chance because its all so movieworld.

That's the problem. He wants to make a film that resonates because it hurts, because it ties knots in us. He just cannot. Its still just a script. Consider the last scenes. These are powerfully written. There are a dozen other filmmakers who could have made them work.

We've been through an entire story to set up the haunting ambivalence in our hero. He is finally able to be with his wife and as he makes love to her, the only think he can see are the hostage deaths not fully shown until this moment, charmed into their horror by human touch. This is followed by her gently caressing the face of her man, accepting all that has come before. If I read this by a good writer, I would be crippled for weeks.

But see how Steven has rendered it. All the pieces are there but the cinematic machine isn't assembled. We have gone all this time, and been set up so well for nothing. I am reminded of ""Monster's Ball,"" which is constructed the same way. Its value is all in the very end, where we have Berre sitting on a stoop in a state of bewildered acquiescence. This could have been more. It was far less, a remote poster.

Good script. I intend to read it and imagine the film that could have been.

23 December 2005,"Not your typical 'revenge/action' movie, but an absorbing, potent look at the cost of taking lives","Steven Spielberg has here his best film- or at least the best in his 'gritty' sort of tradition that was hinted at in the Indiana Jones films, went full bloom in Schindler's List, and matured further with Saving Private Ryan and Minority Report- in many a moon. He uses his perfected skills at maneuvering the mis en scene, using some manipulation, but dealing as seriously as possible with a tense, haunting subject. I've seen many reviewers say the film is haunting, has a haunting quality. Indeed this is true, and it is certainly a running theme in many of Spielberg's best films. And much as it was as well with his two films which he won best director Oscars for, here he deals with not so much the difficult, intensely emotional, and seemingly un-ending power struggle between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but about the increasingly horrifying existential crisis for a man who to the government that hired him does not exist.

This man is Avner, played with the utmost conviction by Eric Bana. Spielberg must have seen something in his eyes that could make him work in this role, and he does- when one looks at him, one can see the conflict that only grows deeper and darker as the film reaches its third act. He's been hired to track down and kill, with his team (which includes great character actors like Matthieu Kassovitz and Daniel Craig), the eleven Palestinian terrorists who killed the hostages in the 1972 Olympics massacre. Things go well, at first, at least under the circumstances, as Avner also gets a little close with his 'source' giving him the names of targets for hefty sums. But as they close in closer, and as the tension is consciously squeezed tighter into paranoia, things aren't going quite as planned.

What makes a film like this work so brilliantly really is not what could be turned by another director into something more routine, and, indeed, condescending. Spielberg, when working with his rare R-rating to the maximum, doesn't shy away from giving us the full lot of what goes on in these raids, these bombings, shootings, plans of killing and striking back. But along the way he also gives some food for thought, so to speak, like an intriguing scene of dialog between Avner and a man in Athens (not to say too much about it, though Al Green is playing in the background). And certain scenes rank with Schindler's List showing Spielberg with a full grasp of what he MUST show the audience, however some might find it to be eye-widening or cringe-worthy (as it was for me). With his usually intuitive cameraman Janusz Kaminski, he creates this world as hellishly vivid as possible with a hand-held camera, and different color saturations for scenes (plus the lighting, which has now become Spielberg/Kaminski's trademark for the past decade).

And, in the end, it comes back down to what we care about with the character(s), and the protagonist's story. Avner knows he has a job to do, getting paid immensely for something (much like the Kurtz job in Apocalypse Now) that does not 'exist'. But the questions raised about what may or may not come of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict of course cannot be answered in the course of the film, only raised to a certain extent. If there is any message to the film- and I'm sure being it a Spielberg one there is (and perhaps I didn't fully comprehend it on the first viewing, being wrapped up in the pure film-making aspect of it all)- it may be that killing, taking life, even if it is OK'd by certain interested parties, will affect the soul, and the souls of those around you. That the message coincides with a taut precision with the characters, and the impeccable storytelling, makes it all the more worthwhile. The controversy around the film may be more from people who haven't see the film than those who have. Once seen, and the initial ideas of what the film might be about are gone, the story can be watched on its own terms.",10
21 July 2010,shameful,"Having been instructed to sit down and view this film by one of its admirers I prepared myself to be told a good story about an historical event. As the movie unreeled, however, I found I was treated to a shameful falsification of history and what looked more like a propaganda tool for the Israeli government than a true story.

Mr Spielberg began his tale by eliminating a rather telling point: the reason why these militants decided to do what they did at Munich. That reason being the continued unrelenting bombing of innocent civilians in refugee camps by the Israeli military. When people see their innocent loved ones blown to bits they tend to get a little upset and want to have vengeance.

The dehumanizing way the Palestinians are depicted in this film, as if they are nothing but dirt under the fingernails, is sharply contrasted by the hilariously ""noble"" depictions of the Israeli assassins, even showing their concerned wives and children (do not the Palestinians have wives and children?). After awhile it was simply too much to bear and I felt sullied by having to sit through such rubbish, complete with sex and violence, made by a director who has never been known for taste, subtlety, story-telling ability or good judgment.

I cannot recommend this movie to anyone at all, certainly not to anyone who is interested in the truth of this matter.",1

It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",1
17 January 2014,One of Spielberg's best,"A reminder that Spielberg can make strong, mature films for adult viewers when he knuckles down to it, in comparison to the usually sentimental and twee offerings he makes for kiddie audiences. MUNICH is an often gripping world-hopping thriller that outdoes the likes of Ridley Scott's SPY GAME in terms of international espionage.

It helps that the central narrative is strong and ever-moving: a team of assassins are set up by the Israeli government to kill the Palestinian terrorists responsible for the murder of Israeli athletes during the Munich Olympics. Violent death, condemnation and retribution are the central themes here, dealt with a more subtle approach than you might have expected.

Spielberg's cinematography is impressive, as it avoids flashiness and super-fast editing to instead provide an old-fashioned, '70s-style piece of tense filmmaking. The script is strong and the cast stronger; Eric Bana gives a reminder of why he was once leading man material back in the day, Daniel Craig shines in a supporting role, Ciaran Hind is splendid, as ever, and Mathieu Amalric steals all of his scenes. MUNICH is a great film and clearly one of the director's best.",9
28 January 2008,A disingenuous film made 30 years too late,"MUNICH is a film that was made and released 30 years too late. Back in the 1970s, gritty spy/police dramas were all the rage. Films like THE FRENCH CONNECTION, 3 DAYS OF THE CONDOR, THE YAKUZA or ""Black Sunday"" were popular, with moviegoers and critics. Those film were just like standard spy or police dramas of previous decades but reflected the times they were made which is really what them memorable: they were very violent, realistic and the no-nonsense use of foul language. Films became realistic in the 1970s because of shocking real life events like the Vietnam war or tragedies like what happened in Munich, or the Speck or Manson massacres. Movies had no choice but to become more violent and gritty in order to compete/reflect the then mores . Spy/police thrillers are still being made today but the style is completely different than from those in the '70s: they're not very realistic and are more flashy.

Now here comes MUNICH, directed by none other than Steven Spielberg, who, in the 1970s, was busy doing harmless blockbusters like JAWS, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS or 1941. As you know, the state of movie-making and movie-going forever changed when JAWS or STAR WARS, made by Spielberg buddy, George Lucas, became massive hits. People weren't looking for gritty violent dramas anymore but wanted escape from the cruel world out there. Fast forward 3 decades and practically every movie today is escapist in nature. Realism is far gone from movie screens. And we have Spielberg and Lucas to thank for that. Which is why I find MUNICH so bizarre and ironic. The film is well made (though typically over-directed) but it feels completely out of place in our current state of cinema. MUNICH would have made more sense if it had been made and released in the '70s not now. The whole project is a contradiction in itself. The gritty movies of the '70s became virtually extinct because of Spielberg's ""sense of wonder"" style of film-making, which has now become the norm, and yet 30 years later, Spielberg (who's clearly channeling John Frankenheimer or William Friedkin here) dabbles in the same type of film he helped eliminate? There's something truly disingenuous about all of it. Spielberg is either completely out of touch or this is a genuine heartfelt mea culpa of sorts.

MUNICH is not really a story or even a movie but a slavish recreation of what Spielberg thinks the 1970s were. Every shot (excellent cinematography btw) wants us to notice every little detail about the production values or about the story. For example, sex scenes. Sex scenes or nudity in movies from the 1970s were pretty common. Today, they are mostly gone because most films are rated PG-13 (nevermind those unrated version made available on DVD). So seeing those sex scenes or even the nudity in MUNICH was surprising, mainly because of what I just wrote but also because I don't think Spielberg has ever included nudity or sex scenes in ANY of his previous films. So why now? To buck the PG-13 trend he directly created? Is Spielberg finally admitting that he helped to create a stiffling monster that's taken over creativity in Hollywood? I doubt it. Just look at all the numerous cutesy projects he has line up on his IMDb profile.

Suffice it to say, aside from a few standout scenes and Daniel Craig actually giving a good performance, MUNICH should be viewed as an Oscar-bait oddity.",4
6 May 2006,Ouch!,"I wish I could use my wife's one-word description of this dreadful film: Boring. But since I can't, MUNICH is about the killing of the Israeli athletes during the 1972 Olympics, and the deadly aftermath as the ""eye for an eye"" Israel government sends out a hit squad to kill those involved in the massacre. All too quickly, the squad starts killing people not on its list. Then the squad itself is decimated. And in the end the squad leader starts having second thoughts about killing anybody else and even those he has killed. Each time he successfully kills a terrorist, the terrorists undertake much larger-scale retaliations. And to top it off, some terrorists are portrayed sympathetically! The movie ends on a very sour, open-ended note. Jews everywhere must have loved this one -- that is, assuming they or anyone else saw it. MUNICH is very long, very boring and confusing. And in his attempt to make the film ultra-realistic, Spielberg manages to make us not care about anybody. There are no good guys, no bad guys. I have no idea what he thought he was doing when he undertook this project. Certainly, it was not to entertain or enlighten the masses, which are the things a good movie does. I suspect Spielberg made MUNICH for his own private purposes, the audience be damned. As for the actors, I would have preferred someone like Viggo Mortensen in the lead, but then we would have had a distinctive, charismatic character with whom to identify, and Spielberg apparently did not wish this. He instead gives us the very bland, nondescript Eric Bana. The very detailed early 1970s look is wasted on a movie that never should have been made. You know how bizarre Hollywood has become when it nominated MUNICH for five Oscars and a best director nom for Spielberg. Unbelievable. Skip this one, big-time.",1

7 May 2007,"I did not like it, because ....","1) The execrable opening musical soundtrack goes aaaaahyahyahyaaaa...oooohyohyo - indicating I am a dumb-ass and am not aware that something dramatic and meaningful is going to happen.

2) The whole, already well documented hostage tragedy in Munic is painfully reenacted - a pseudo reality complemented with an execrable musical soundtrack that goes aaaa...

3) The viewers are addressed on an emotional level where they should use their minds. In my opinion that's dangerous.

4) A lot of screen time is used on a shady French character, a tradesman in assassination targets and other stuff, who is just plainly disgusting. I mean why show him surrounded by children as a kind of Santa Claus?

5) The characters don't talk, they make statements - often it's just hollow meaningless blather, not least in the case of the disgusting French character.

These are all questions of style (you like it or you don't), the movie in itself is not uninteresting - a kind of a mixture of The Ladykillers, Chinatown and Donnie Brasco and spy thrillers of the 1970ies. But it's all fairly overblown.",4
12 January 2006,too bad,"too long, too boring, too gory, too slow, too little character development, too self serving, too ugly sex, too stupid dialog, too many locations unknown to the audience, too much fiction posing as history, too false as to Intifada vs 9/11 terrorists, too little of the reason for the Olympic assassinations, too bad Spielberg is washed up.

I thought the remake of ""War of the Worlds"" was bad, but this took the cake. Why fill in the details of a historical event with a lot of dumb fiction? Just because someone has made tons of money catering to the elementary school mentality, they think they know something about philosophy, religion, morals, ethics, etc. They just show themselves to not have grown any more depth than the puppet shark in ""Jaws.""

29 December 2005,Means even more if you watched the tragedy of Munich 1972,"I don't think the ""perfect"" movie has been made yet. I don't know that a masterpiece is necessarily perfect, so, viewers will undoubtedly find faults in this movie, some of which have already been expressed in the comment section. But masterpiece or not, I really liked this movie. It told a particular side of the story and told it well. And if you witnessed any of the tragedy of Munich in the summer of 1972, you feel a connection to the events portrayed in this movie. We, the audience, become a member of the hit squad able to empathize with the angst in becoming assassins with consciences, as collateral damage does matter. But the trouble with trying to maintain a conscience is that each notch on the belt is another slash of your humanity ripped from your soul. You squirm from living in the uncertainty of trusting people you are suspicious of in order to fulfill your mission. You nervously plan the pathway to the next target. You seethe with the frenzy of the kill. You perpetually twitch in the paranoia of becoming the hunted, ""sleeping"" with one eye open and a finger on the trigger. In the beginning you are swept away by your sense of duty to God and country above all else. In the end you are cynical, angry and afraid about what you have done and what you have become.

There are many other sides of this story. It is left to other movies or media to tell those versions. I won't take this one as a definitive history lesson on the subject. Instead I'll take it as a captivating tale of a struggle of life and death played on a complex stage of geopolitics.",10
20 January 2017,One of Spielberg's best since 'Schindler's List',"Having grown up with the likes of 'ET', the first three 'Indiana Jones' films (of which 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is still one of his best) and 'Jurassic Park'(also 'Hook', though it's much less good through adult eyes, don't dislike it though), it's safe to say that Steven Spielberg was part of my childhood.

Am still shocked and moved by 'Schindler's List', enthralled by 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind', moved by 'Empire of the Sun' and 'The Color Purple' and thrilled but often scared senseless by 'Jaws', and consider all of these plus 'ET', 'Raiders' and 'Jurassic Park' among his best films. For me his weakest are 'The Lost World' and '1941', and also had mixed feelings on 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' and 'The BFG'.

'Munich' is not quite up there with his very best, but it's from personal opinion one of his best since 'Schindler's List'. There is a sense at times of hasty production about it, not visually or directorially (on both counts the film's top-notch) but more to do with occasional parts in the storytelling that feel a little muddled and not as well developed as they could have been in how some things are resolved.

On the other hand 'Munich' does look absolutely great, love the very gritty and somewhat stark look to how everything's shot and lit (the restless camera proves to be atmosphere-enhancing) which felt evocative to the mood and the subject matter. Spielberg's direction is some of his best of his later films, under him pacing is deliberate but tight and he gives plenty of unnerving intensity without resorting to the schmaltz that he can be criticised for.

John Williams' score is understated but also haunting, even if not having themes as unforgettable as the likes of those for 'Jaws', 'ET', 'Schindler's List', 'Raiders' and 'Jurassic Park', adding a good deal to the atmosphere while not making the mistake of over-emphasising (like in 'Amistad'). The script is thought-provoking and with the right amount of nuances and avoiding the traps of cheese and schmaltz, while boasting many genuinely powerful and poignant moments. The story is continually compelling, with it being particularly strong when the doubts appear with the urgency and emotional power being maximised. The action scenes are pretty electrifying also.

Not ending 'Munich' with a pat and too conveniently wrapped up conclusion was a brave choice, and honestly can't imagine the film ending as effectively if it had done. The characters are interesting, having strengths but also flaws and conflicts and to me the film didn't feel at all one-sided.

The acting is terrific, Eric Bana heads the cast in one of his better performances, here he's charismatic but stoic. Even better are the support, with both sides of Bana's Avner's troubled conscience being superbly played by Daniel Craig and Ciaran Hinds. Mathieu Kassivitz, Michael Lonsdale and Geoffrey Rush register strongly also.

Overall, a great film and one of Spielberg's better later efforts (since 'Schindler's List'). 9/10 Bethany Cox",9
6 July 2015,One of the most important films from Spielberg,"This Steven Spielberg movie tells a haunting and compelling story, based on a terrorist attack during the Olympic Games in Munich. Spielberg manages to tell a story about violence, who eventually takes a brutal turn of those who gets involved. You don't have to be interested in politics to watch this movie, but it can be an advantage. The casting is good, but I have to say, that this is Eric Banas movie.What a performance! He portraits the main character with wisdom, depth and is really convincing. This is also a film you may recommend to friends who like a real compelling story in films,and like films with a important message. I highly recommend it. But don't watch it with people who likes to chat, and interfere during showing. This film deserves to be watched carefully and without interruptions of any kind.

10 January 2006,Beware! You are entering a cinematic mine field.,"Did Steven Spielberg personally direct this movie? I hope not because if he did then maybe it's time for him to move on to something else. Munich has to be one of the worst, if not THE worst movie ever made. Now, Hollywood makes a lot of clunkers, which are pretty bad, but nobody is trying to peddle them off as being anything but what they are - crumby, stupid, poorly made movies. Well, Munich is all that, but what makes it particularly atrocious is its overbearing pretentiousness. This is a three-hour exercise in gratuitous violence, poor acting, unbelievably inane scenes and a muddled political message. For instance, the scene where Israeli commandos attack a terrorist stronghold - dressed in pantyhose! Or the laughable portrayal of Golda Meir as a Jewish grandmother-type surrounded by all her ""boys"" (it may be of interest to know that Golda Meir led Israel through two wars and was one of two women to have signed the Israeli Declaration of Independence); or the premeditated and cold-blooded assassination of a beautiful young sexy woman, dressed only in a negligee, by three heavily armed Israeli men on the PRESUMPTION that she was responsible for someone's death; or the idea that an Israeli agent could pass himself off as a German; or ... well by now you should get the point. This movie is one of those Hollywood clunkers that belong with all those other pretentious pieces of claptrap that strive to convey an ""important"" message, but instead inspire the warning: ""Beware - you are entering a cinematic mine field. Watch this movie at your own risk. And if you fall asleep in the middle of the movie or leave the theater before the movie is over and feel like you wasted your hard-earned money, don't say we didn't warn you.""",1

25 December 2005,The Mice in Your Head,"Greetings again from the darkness. We never really know which Steven Spielberg is going to show up. Will it be the incredible storyteller of ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan""? Or will it be the fun loving, mushy, sometimes too-cute-for-his-own-good director off ""AI"" and ""Catch Me if You Can""? No question, the famed storyteller and master technician brought is A game for ""Munich"".

We get the sickening story after the tragic story of in the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. SS crafts a dramatic reenactment amidst the the real-life newsreels featuring sportscaster Jim McKay and Howard Cosell thrust into unfamiliar territory. For those of us old enough to remember, this became a moment like Kennedy's assassination and the walk on the moon ... we recall where we were at when McKay informs ""They're all gone"".

What Spielberg has done is concentrate on the aftermath. The story of the original terrorists is almost secondary. Watching actress Lynn Cohen reincarnate Prime Minister Golda Meir is very creepy. She really captures the spirit and power of the woman. As the Israeli government organizes an assassination team to take care of the terrorists involved, we realize the goal of revenge is pretty hopeless and that bloodshed could go on forever with these tactics.

The leader of the team is Avner, played excruciatingly well by Eric Bana. Bana has come along way from ""Hulk""! We feel his pain and moral conflict throughout. This process leads him to the brink of losing touch with reality. What a sad result of a bad idea. Although, Bana is the main actor, it is interesting to note that Daniel Craig offers up another performance making it all but impossible to imagine him as a wise-cracking international spy known as Bond.

Is there any hope that these two lands can reconcile and live peaceably? Spielberg does not really answer. The real sadness is that this clash of ethnic, cultural and religious differences offer no real hope for change in the present or future. This is stunning visual storytelling and remarkable film-making that will touch you and frustrate you.",8
29 December 2005,Touching Wires.,"A Mossad agent (Eric Bana) and his team of assassins (Daniel Craig, Ciaran Hinds, Mathieu Kassovitz and Hanns Zischler) are hired by Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) and the Israeli government to seek out and kill 11 Palestinian terrorist syndicates who directly and sometimes indirectly had a hand in the tragic killings of Israel's Olympic Team in the summer of 1972. ""Munich"" is an unyielding political thriller that becomes more psychological as it advances. Bana and his partners have bouts of conscience, total fits of despair and constant motivational dilemmas. Shady characters galore (Michael Lonsdale and Mathieu Amalric) and Bana's female connections back home (wife Ayelet Zorer and mother Gila Almagor) add to the film's depth and wide-reaching personal network. Geoffrey Rush nearly steals the show in limited screen time as the Israeli liaison and seductress Marie-Josee Croze tantalizes and torments. Steven Spielberg does his best work since ""Saving Private Ryan"" and does arguably his most complex work since ""Schindler's List"". While not his best film by a mile, it is still probably his most interesting and intriguing. Though a bit long and at times difficult to follow, ""Munich"" definitely takes a place with the better films of 2005. 4.5 out of 5 stars.

26 February 2006,A Nutshell Review: Munich,"The Munich 1972 Olympic games will forever go down in infamy for the killing of Israeli sportsmen by a terrorist group known as Black September. If you wish to know more about the motives and happenings on that fateful day, including the ineptness of the Germans to manage the entire situation, resulting in the deaths of almost all the perpetrator and the victims, do check out the documentary One Day In September. But not to say that Steven Spielberg's Munich fares any less. My recommendation is to watch the documentary first if you wish to understand more of what happened before, then to follow up with Spielberg's movie for the tale of what happened after when the Mossad went after the mastermind planners. So that you'll not be as irritating as the bimbo sitting behind me asking her equally clueless boyfriend ""what happened? Why like that?"" Spielberg's movie is as every bit, Spielberg. It grips you from the beginning and never lets go until the end. For those who did not heed my advice above, don't worry, there's a re-enactment of the terrible event from the point where they entered into the Olympic Village, and various scenes thereafter en route to the airport are edited in between the movie. As mentioned, the movie places focus on the Mossad's attempt to wipe out the terrorist masterminds, and we follow the journey of their appointed leader, Avner, played admirably by Eric Bana, who now probably has cornered roles for the tough yet sensitive guy, like Hector in Troy, or Bruce Banner in Hulk.

And it's this spy-versus-spy game, that this movie excels in. We take the usual peek into government organizations sponsoring clandestine operations, and assembles Avner with a team that looked straight out of Mission: Impossible's IMF. We follow them through the missions so carefully planned ala Ocean's Eleven, aimed at sending signals to the Israeli oppositions that force will be met with force, and violence with violence. Indeed violence begets violence, and what goes around comes around, but at what cost? Information brokers are all set to profit from violence, and in the world of secret agents, so long as the price is right, you get your information, regardless of what you want to do with it.

But the movie also takes a more personal look into the life of Avner, who started off with gusto and with a deep sense of patriotism in their missions, before we slowly see the toil being taken on a family man who can't be with his family, or his home and country, and the degeneration of Avner into paranoia. When you're playing hunter for so long, and you find yourself one day being the prey, that's the effect it'll have on you, of over suspicion on the pretext of playing it safe.

John Williams is at his element here in providing a soundtrack that is intense and fits the movie perfectly. During mission scenes, you'll feel just as tense as the characters planning and executing (pardon the pun) their hits. Avner's team comprises of folks who are not exactly field experts, but their camaraderie on screen is at its finest. I was paying attention to Daniel Craig's highly volatile character Steve, and I'd still think he doesn't have what it takes to become Blond, I mean, Bond. And besides Craig, the only other peculiarly minor letdown I have was the final bed scene between Avner and wife. I thought the editing was done in a very distasteful manner, though I understand what it was trying to get at with the inter-splicing of the Munich massacre. Somehow it could have been done better.

It's a controversial film, but only for the controversy surrounding the subject matter, and of Spielberg's roots. It doesn't glorify either side, or try to make a statement which side is right. Two wrongs never made a right, and the movie's narrative plays it that way.

On a normal year, this film would be a strong contender for Best Picture, given all the predictable ingredients required for a win. However, Brokeback Mountain would probably snag the trophy for its more intimate feel as compared to standard fare of a crowd pleasing film. But the message in Munich is nonetheless clear, as hinted so subtly at a small scene of tuning a radio.",9

3 January 2006,Surprisingly good,"I went to see Munich last week. This movie is about one of the teams in the the Israeli secret operation now known as Wrath of God"". Originally their mission was to kill 11 men who were involved in the terrorist group Black September's murder of the athletes during the Olympics. However, as time goes on, and they remain isolated from society the men begin to stray from their original mission.

I was surprised I liked this film. I've been following it since last year. When I first discovered Eric Bana was cast as Anver I was concerned. I am a fan of his but did not think he would pull off this role. How quickly I had forgotten his performance in Black Hawk Down! Another concern I had going into the theater was the fact this was a Spielberg film. I hate Spielberg films. I hate them with a passion. They are preachy and dumbed down. They are as sweet as saccharine. At best, they are artsy-fartsy and play with the truth like toys. However, Munich was none of these. It was a hell of a film.

Although the movie is political, and I can't think of one person who comes into the theater looking for flaws will be happy with it, this movie was great entertainment. It isn't pretty entertainment, but it is entertainment all the same.

It was a great way to pass a couple hours. The only problem is, I can't shake the final hour.

That is what makes a good film a great film.",9
6 February 2007,Exceptional treatment about the Munich Olympics massacre 1972 by Arab terrorists and the vengeance inspired by real events,"This is the story of a mission that wasn't acknowledge initially when it happened in 1972,Golda Meier(Lynn Cohen) pulled together a number of government officials and members of the Mossad(Geoffrey Rush) and they decided to put together a list of people that they felt were responsible for what had happened in Munich.And they made the decision to try to go after those people.It's told there was a committee of 10 people decided to,sort of,try and sentence to death as many as 11,possible more,possible less but it was probably around 11 Palestian men .Some of the people that were targeted were definitely part of a terror network and some of the people that were targeted were political leaders,intellectual leaders.The idea was to call attention to the world that Israel would no allow this to happen again.And the mission Golda send them on,it's almost an eye for an eye.Golda Meier took the responsibility on her own shoulders.The main dramatic agents are five guys who are assassinating people,the guys are working for intelligence agency and they weren't sociopaths,they were doing their job.The guys are vulnerable,doubtful with no falling into all the obvious clichés of the hit-man with the doubt.The 5 guys(Bana,Daniel Craig,Matthew Kassovitz,Cirian Hinds,Hans Zischler) are all very different,age,background,upbringing,some have been bringing up in Europe,some have been in Israel,they have been selected for their different qualities.We might say it's like a quintet,a musical quintet,they are very sharply defined characters in themselves and sometimes their hesitations look like.They have different ways of speaking ,of behaving ,but they know they are are forged together.They are committed to the cause of Israel and they are ready to fight for his land.Avner(Eric Bana) doesn't really know why he's chose but for some reason he was chosen as the leader though we really know why the others were chosen.

It's a totally intelligent movie about hatred and revenge,there is no glory or outcome but pure destruction.It was really no the story of the massacre itself but the aftermath.And this very murky,problematic,complicated story about the policy of targeted assassination.The picture is produced by Barry Mendel using actual locations,he was working on the movie for eight years and he assembled every book and documentary on the subject that he could find including all news footage and then he along with Spilberg who gives his own point of view on the story ,they went to work on the script for the next year and a half and eventually writer Tony Kushner came on at the end of the last year.Tony gave to Spielberg a total immersion into the politics and policies with a point of view coming from both sides,not just one side.When Steven Spielberg first got involved in this project and it was called ¨Vengeance¨,then he hired to Eric Bana when he saw ¨Incredible Hulk ¨,but he saw a warmth and a strength and even a little tickle of fear behind his eyes which humanises people,no matter what their jobs and he was very determined to humanise the characters.In the film intervene the usual and excellent technicians Spielberg as Rick Carter(production design),Michael Kahn(edition),Joanna Johnson(costume designer),and of course the cameraman Janusz Kaminski and the master John Williams with an evocative score musical.",8

28 December 2014,Coldly efficient,"In 1972, nine Israelis are killed at the Munich Olympics. Prime Minister Golda Meir approves a covert operation to assassinate the eleven deemed responsible for the act. Avner (Eric Bana) is low level Mossad tasked to lead the secret mission. He was Golda Meir's bodyguard some two years ago, and he must leave his pregnant wife for an unknown length of time. Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) is his case handler. The four men on his team are Steve (Daniel Craig), Carl (Ciarán Hinds) the cleaner, Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz) the bomb maker and Hans (Hanns Zischler) the documents guy. They are expendable and must deal with questionable people like Louis (Mathieu Amalric) who tracks down their targets and provide them with material.

There is a calculated coldness to the movie and Eric Bana contributes to that. I think Spielberg should have made this more emotional. The audience is detached from the characters. The action is coldly efficient without being exciting. This is not a thriller like a Bond movie. Neither is it a psychological study since Bana can't portray a tortured soul. It is very well made but I feel nothing watching it.",6

7 February 2006,An Unqualified Disaster Of A Movie,"The movie can really be summed up in one line that the wife of the main protagonist, Azner, says after just one of the movies excruciatingly painful clichés.

""You're my home"", says Azner.

""Stop it, that's corny"" she replies and the whole movie is a cliché-ridden, corny abomination. After struggling to prevent myself leaving the cinema within the first ten minutes I found myself repeating just that line in my head as I struggled through the unwieldy and overblown three hours that make up the ""Munich"" ""epic"".

The length is pretty incomprehensible and completely unjustifiable as Spielberg goes in for innumerate lengthy pans on the characters faces which reveal precisely nothing (the worst scene being a completely comical flashback scene as Azner has sex with his wife whilst being ""haunted"" by the events in Munich he didn't actually see) and includes gratuitous panoramic views of nearly every city in the world.

With a terrible script to work from (speaking other languages I wasn't spared from the awfulness of the dialogue in German or French) the actors managed to match it with their delivery. Identification with any of the characters was completely impossible as Spielberg regularly and cringe-worthily tried to dip into the ""buddy movie"" genre with dialogues between the ""crack team"" of Israeli operators (about as crack as a WI reunion).

The dinner they enjoyed together with awful banter flowing across the table about being toy-makers or furniture dealers sat very awkwardly with feeble jokes about receipts and the role of the South African (I don't look forward to the next James Bond film if that performance is anything to go by) was a mystery to everyone including the actor himself.

Well, I can't even begin to emphasise how boring, how much of a waste of time and how completely unengaging this film was, but if you liked Troy (also starring Azner as Hector) and other abominations of movies of a similar ilk then run to the cinemas, throw over your money and take in yet another slice of Hollywood tripe masquerading as an artistic and thought provoking work.",1

18 December 2007,Dark as Spielberg has ever been,"From two-time Academy Award winning director Steven Spielberg comes Munich, the story of the assassination of the 11 Israeli athletes who were killed at the 1972 Olympic Games. The film stars Eric Bana as Avner, head of the intelligence unit assigned to kill everyone involved in the assassination. This is Bana's finest performance and finally taps into that thespian persona that we've all known he was capable of. Bana hasn't been more aware of his surroundings and character depth that his Avner requires like we've ever seen him.

The supporting players are adequate enough to make it through the picture but some are developed better than others. Geoffrey Rush as Ephraim, the operative heading Avner in different directions doesn't wear his character as well as others we've seen in past performances. Mathieu Kassovitz as one of the team members is the best of the supporting players as a torn individual between the job he is given and the results of his actions in the eyes of the almighty.

Ciaran Hinds has a presence on screen that gives the extra topping of an actor's showcase of talent. Daniel Craig as the ""badass"" operative is equally as charging and impressionable.

The candle of this picture is Steven Spielberg who's never been this dark and this thorough since his achievement Schlinder's List. Not holding any measure to Schlinder's List or Saving Private Ryan which are cinematic gems with this auteur at his finest, Munich is immensely erotic in cinematography and editing and a score by John Williams to die for. His choices here rather risky are so unlike anything we've seen of him before.

This is an exquisite motion picture and should be seen by all. Eric Roth's screenplay is pin-point with dialogue and rich in flow. This is definitely the Spielberg show.

Grade: ***/****",8
10 January 2006,"A Literate, Intelligent, Emotional Thriller About Morality Amidst Political Murder","""Munich"" is the first time that Steven Spielberg has combined all his story telling talents to serve a literate script.

It certainly seems as if Eric Roth's early draft outlined the basic plot while surely it was Tony Kushner, in his first for-hire screenplay, who added in the extensive Yiddishkeit, Talmudic discussions and moral angst. The dialog also refers to the meaning of ""home"" and the Middle East, as he did in his recent play ""Homebody/Kabul"" (let alone, of course, ""E.T.""). The film follows virtually the same themes and emotional trajectory as the recent Israeli completely fictional ""Walk on Water."" In both films, the sins and merits of the parents are passed on as responsibilities to the next generation that we know will lead to the nihilism of suicide bombers.

The opening montages of the playing out of the 1972 Olympic hijacking smoothly edits together real broadcasts with recreated perspectives from around the world as sportscasters were drawn into horrific breaking news. The hair, clothes and production design, and particularly the evocative pop music including multilingual covers of American hits, seamlessly consistently maintain the period. These images are a continuing almost dream-like leit motif throughout the film as the story plays out, so that all sides know why they fight yet literally starts blurring their moral differences. Ironically, these images reinforce why terrorism is successful at drawing the world's attention while generating its own continuing cycle of revenge.

With different characters schematically representing different points of view and philosophies, the motley-accented international cast creates mostly individual people, from the Israeli government apparatchiks to the gathering of the diverse Jewish team of incongruous action heroes to glimpses of other terrorists, and they spend a lot of time having midrashic debates over home-cooked meals.

The film is anchored by a brilliant Eric Bana as ""Avner"" who wrenchingly goes, Jack Ryan-like, from an intelligence analyst to active field agent, but then more -- to personal revenger to anguished post-traumatic-stress syndromed paranoid with haunted eyes. (It is a shame that he's not getting remembered at award time, but it has been a great year for lead actors.) I enjoyed the irony of his character posing as a German, particularly to gain access to ideologues who help the Baader-Meinhof Gang, with Germany serving as a locus for international terrorist planning, whether Basques' E.T.A. or I.R.A. etc., then as it did with the 9/11 plotters (and portended further at the end with the view of the pre-9/11 NYC skyline).

The formation of the team is freighted with other ironies as well - Daniel Craig with his accent, body language and voice creates another unique character in his career as a steely, unreflective South African who is solidly single-minded in his goal: ""Don't f*ck with the Jews!"" and can just as easily pretend to be an ANC supporter. Mathieu Kassovitz is marvelously nervous as a toy maker turned bomb maker, and Hanns Zischler is very old world fastidious as an art dealer turned documents forger and team accountant regularly toting up the cost of each kill. Ciarán Hinds disappears into his ruthlessly efficient, gray Mossad bureaucrat, recalling Alec Guinness as George Smiley in another intelligence service in a Cold War with questions (and there's also close-up shot of an umbrella in London that recalls an infamous assassination from that period).

A lot of the film's tension is caught up with their efforts to avoid collateral damage, which, symbolically, gets harder and harder for them to do. It is a bit heavy-handed but very effective for the emotional core of the film that those who feel guilty become the most vulnerable.

Too much in service to the themes and less to credibility are the mercenary information merchants. Ironically, Mathieu Amalric is usually cast in French films as a Woody Allen type, such as in ""Kings and Queen (Rois et reine),"" while Michael Lonsdale, a la his role in ""Ronin,"" as the patriarch of this amoral family business perfectly embodies the European intellectual sang-froid of anarchists with principles available to the highest bidder of the moment, like the information equivalent of Nicolas Cage's gun seller in ""Lord of War,"" that is the detritus of colonialism. But it's as if they are the sole confidential informant in a cop movie, let alone ones who rent the same safe house to opposing terrorists at the same time, for an interlude that simplistically allows for presentation of the PLO's unambiguous position. There's lots of amusing references to hiding behind American dollars, but at that time there would have been plenty of Arab petrodollars available for similar nefarious ends. There's also a Mata Hari side story that goes a bit over the top visually, James Bond-style. This is definitely a hard-R film.

Very unusual for a Spielberg film are the strong, physically dynamic women and ""Avner""s emotional ties to them, from a baby to the tiny grandmotherly Iron Lady Golda Meir. Noted Israeli actresses play ""Avner""s mother and wife: Gila Almagor both provides the inevitable Holocaust resonance and sounds like a Biblical Hannah in telling of her prayers for a son, and Ayelet Zorer, who was also so moving in ""Nina's Tragedies (Ha-Asonot Shel Nina)"" is not the usual wifely appendage but an essential, beautifully sensuous grounding for her tormented husband in mature scenes that are unlike any previous Spielberg film (finally contradicting the ""Dawson's Creek"" critique that there's no sex or romance in his films). But it's an unnecessary production design repetitive element to have the mother's apartment oddly filled with menorahs.

These nuclear family relationships intelligently link ""Munich"" to ""A History of Violence"" as a reflective, geo-political counterpart.

The tight editing of Janusz Kaminski's beautiful and varied cinematography (dark Graham Greene-murky Europe vs. the blinding light of Mediterranean machine guns-and-bikinis Israel) is a continuing subtext in service to what is being said.

John Williams' score is uncharacteristically subdued and is in service to the tension in each scene.",10

23 May 2006,Spielberg was brave to do this one.,"Writing a review of Munich independent of my personal experience during the war proved a difficult task. After all, I did have nightmares of Israeli operatives targeting all my family members ruthlessly and without any remorse the night I saw it. This says something though, that the movie got to me and for that, I have to give Spielberg credit. I also have to give him credit for being courageous enough to do it. Despite my countless reservations on his so-called objectivity, he did criticize the Israeli revenge policy, advocating the premise that violence only begets violence.

The movie recounts the events of Operation Bayonet, the Mossad's retaliation to the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972. On the surface, it is an action-packed thriller with good guys and bad guys. The good guys are Israeli agents who speak English to each other while the bad guys are overweight Arabs who only speak in a language the average American will not understand without subtitles (which were not always provided for some reason). But Spielberg manages to sneak in a few scenes that instill doubt in both the viewer and the agents (at least some of them) that maybe the unquestionable morality of the operation is in fact questionable.

Munich is highly entertaining, despite its long runtime. It has its cheesy moments but also its confrontational and thought-provoking ones. Although I was expecting a movie that is highly biased  don't get me wrong, it is biased  I felt it sent a strong message to Israelis and to the rest of the world. The best way to describe it is in Carl's (Hinds) words: ""I knew guys like you in the army. You do any terrifying thing you're asked to do, but you have to do it running. You think you can outrun your fears, your doubts. The only thing that really scares you guys is stillness.""",8

23 January 2006,Did I miss something?,"I am surpsied that so many people loved this movie, I for one could not stand most of it. How did you not find this a complete affront to the situation between Israel and Palestine?? Are you not offended that there is a lot of money being made from this? Isn't anyone else bothered by the Hollywood-esq ""action-assassin-character"" formula used to portray the Isralies? Each one has ""their own specialty and they are back with a vengeance to give those other murderers what they asked for..(insert rest of cheesy trailer voice-over line here."" These are real people being killed off, and I felt that there was no insight aside from obvious things like the WTC in the background at the end. The only thing Steven Spielberg made clear is that this violence will continue forever.

I thought it was offensive to make an action movie out of this subject matter, SS is making $$ off of these people's tragedies!! How can you say this movie is a masterpiece???? It's garbage, and I am sorry that I gave my 10 dollars towards this. Next time I will research a bit more before going to see a movie because my fiancé wanted to.

And the scene at the end when he is screaming while having sex his wife and flashing back to people being massacred, GIVE ME A BREAK. That was the stupidist thing I have ever seen.

This whole movie is all about real people dying, and both parties are at fault. Both parties are murdering in each other; I already knew that about the situation in the Middle East. How about some insight into why the hostage crises took place and what went on before it? Also, all of you saying this has ""great action"" should really think twice about what exactly you are watching. If they made an ""action"" movie about Sept 11th you all would be throwing bottles at the screen.",1

8 February 2006,Thought-provoking and filled with emotion,"This movie was just incredible! I didn't know if I would like it, but I'm so grateful that I saw it! It was intense and so filled with emotion. You have to be in the mood for something deep, it's definitely not a light movie. It was like a documentary, with all the news clips and so on. We always see things on the news about the fighting and the hatred, but this movie shows us a glimpse of the actual people who are affected and their emotions. It's not a typical Hollywood movie, at ALL. I didn't even know that it was a Spielberg movie until the very end, and I'm glad I didn't know. It was just such a ""real"" movie, not fake or dramatic or forced. It was like you were watching a real man going through real experiences, and you never feel like you're taking sides, you just get lost in the hopelessness of it all. Although you feel like the situation is hopeless, you don't feel like the movie was a waste of time, because this is a real conflict in the world, and you just feel a little more informed, and thankful for that. The movie was so interesting and deep, I hope that everyone will go see it.

20 August 2006,The Never Ending Story,"In 1972, eleven Israeli athletes were executed by a terrorist group known as Black September. The Israeli government assigns five undercover Mossad agents to eliminate the eleven Palestinian leaders supposed to be the responsible for the attack.

""Munich"" is a super production filmed in many countries and based on a true event. Although being too long, this tale of retaliation and revenge is very well executed. I do not know how accurate this story is, and I appreciated it as an action movie and not a political one actually. The screenplay remains as neutral as possible, as usual in a Hollywood production, with characters questioning their methods and realizing that they are acting in the same despicable way as the other side; that for each of their action, there is a reaction; further, like a chimera, when they eliminate one leader, immediately there is a replacement. This movie is good but overrated in the nominations and awards. My vote is eight.

23 October 2006,"""When you look into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you.""","""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values Forget peace now. We have to show them we're strong."" Golda Meir, Israeli Prime Minister, September 1972.

This movie is not a factual recount of 1972 slayings of Israeli Olympic athletes by the members of Palestinian terrorist group ""Black September"" in Munich, Germany even though it is based on the real events. After the murders, a group of Mossad agents are sent to Europe to track down and assassinate the Black September members responsible. What the movie explores is how in doing so with burning desire to find and punish the murderers, in following the ancient law of an eye for an eye, the searchers for justice nearly become terrorists themselves. You can't just look into abyss and stay the same because, ""When you look into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you.""

In his new, easily one of the best films he ever made (in the same line as ""Shindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan""), Spielberg looks at terrorism from many different angles. He does not justify killings, and there are many, many terrifying killings in his film and behind every death there is a human character and every character is a real person, not cartoonish villain or a super-hero. Devastating, powerful, and controversial this film will split the audiences and will have as many admirers as haters.

15 January 2006,What Price Vengeance?,"Steven Spielberg's huge popularity means that he is frequently the target of critics, whether it is for shouldering the blame for the Hollywood ""blockbuster"" trend that started with JAWS, for alleged audience manipulation (as in E.T.), or for the more weighty issues behind SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. But nowhere does it seem that criticism has been as fierce as it is with MUNICH. Here he is, the most popular filmmaker in Hollywood, tackling the subjects of terrorism and vengeance with the same consummate skill he tackled with sharks, the Holocaust, and aliens--and here are people slamming him not only for doing so, but for doing so in a way they don't agree with. Why is this? For starters, as the title indicates, he uses as a focal point the murders of eleven Israeli athletes by members of the ultra-violent Palestinian terrorist group Black September at the Summer Olympics in Munich on September 5, 1972, and the response by Israel. Eric Bana is one of five Israeli Mossad agents sent to track down eleven high-ranking Palestinians who are believed to have had a hand in planning the Munich massacre. The purpose of the mission is to send a message once and for all to the Palestinians that Israel will not be intimidated into ceasing to exist as a country. The team goes about their business throughout Europe, though their operations are not the most perfect (which is so often the case in missions of this sort), and are always bloody. Very soon, however, they learn of other Palestinian terrorist acts, including the hijacking of a Lufthansa jet in Germany, and they find themselves not only being the hunters but also being the hunted and the haunted as well. Near the end, after he has moved to New York, Bana openly wonders to his superior (Geoffrey Rush, in an incredibly direct performance) whether they really got the exact ones who plotted the Munich tragedy. It is a question that remains open-ended, as the film ends with a view across the Hudson River to Manhattan and the twin towers of the World Trade Center.

No film about real-life acts of political terrorism will ever satisfy everybody, but Spielberg has come in for some extreme attacks. On the one side are those who criticize his stand as being too pro-Israeli; and on the other are those who feel he gives too much credence to the Palestinian terrorists. The fact is, of course, being Jewish, he is hardly going to go against the state of Israel on anything. But he also sees the troubling ambiguity of the aftermath of Munich in relation to the decades-long Israel/Palestinian conflict and, with respect to what Israel did to avenge Munich, he asks the question: ""What price vengeance?"" How can a mission like the one Bana and his fellow Israelis undertake ever fully satisfy the need for vengeance for Munich without costing a huge price, in terms of human lives lost, and in human souls that are destroyed in the continuous cycle of bloody revenge killings? These are very troubling questions, and I think this is why certain people with extremist views are attacking Spielberg for MUNICH, even with its superb ensemble acting, taut editing, and compelling storyline. A lot of people don't want to deal with that painful reality; nor do they want to deal with the fact that the world doesn't work on a black-and-white/good-guys-and-bad guys level. Spielberg knows the world doesn't operate like that. And the film's final shot of the World Trade towers clearly states that the questions of vengeance and retribution are now being directed at his own country with respect to its war on terrorism, motivated by revenge for 9/11 and the price *that* war is taking on American lives and the soul of the nation.

The consummate skill that Spielberg, his crew, and his cast put into making MUNICH work is what I think will outlast the attacks against the film. This is a film that is a must-see for all those who really care about where our world is headed, and how we deal with the always troubling subject of terrorism.",10

4 January 2020,Boring and not credible,"I've no political skin in the actual events that took place in 1972 I simply want to watch a decent story told by a master story teller. After 20 minutes I was a little bored after 40 minutes my frustration grew as unlikely event was piled on unlikely event. Sometimes out motley crew are inept gun slingers sometimes bungling bombers and on one occasion they are part of a crack commando unit. It is very difficult to believe this movie is actually based on real work events and I suspect a good many real events have been omitted to paint our heros in a favourable light.

With that said, I believe the movie was a very well made, well thought out, and well acted piece of work. Steve Spielberg shows us again that he is not only great at action/sci-fi spectacle movies like ""War of the Worlds"" (yes, I liked that movie, so there! ) but he's also a genius at movies that explore very touchy issues like in ""Munich"". The only thing is, emotionally I wasn't as engaged as I should have been with this movie. That is the reason why I can only give ""Munich"" an 8 instead of a 9 or 10 like many other critics out there. I guess that's what differentiates one movie critic from another. They might all agree that a movie is very well made, but how much emotional impact they get from the movie will differ, and thus the varying ratings for the same movie.

OK, enough babbling. Let's get on to the review! At the heart of the movie is a semi-fictional story about the details of the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre of the Israeli athletes by the Palestinian terrorists, and the endless cycle of revenge and retribution that follows. All credit must be given to Spielberg for presenting as balanced of a viewpoint as one can of this messy situation, for he does not favor either side of the conflict, and allows the audiences to make the decision for themselves.

What is most interesting and powerful in the movie is the story of one man (played by Eric Bana) who has to lead a small group of assassins to exact revenge on those who planned the massacre, and all the emotional turmoil he and his team have to experience throughout their mission. Eric Bana played the lead character's part with masterful skill and subtlety. He is at first happy for revenge, but as the mission goes on, his beliefs are challenged and the killings start to become a burden on his soul. It is watching this slow transformation and development of Bana's character that fascinates me the most about the movie. I believe Bana's performance should warrant an Oscar nomination, but in a year where there are so many great performances by a male lead, it'll be a toss up.

As usual, the cinematography and action of the movie were very powerful and realistic, and I expect nothing less from Spielberg. The only problem I have with the movie is near the end, when there seemed to be multiple endings, one after another, similar to ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" or ""Return of the King."" While I understand the need for these endings to provide closure to the story, I found myself wondering ""when will this movie end?"" a couple times watching it. It's a very small gripe for such a good movie, but I just wanted to point it out.

In conclusion, ""Munich"" was a very well directed and acted film with a LOT of poignant themes involved. Even with my slight emotional detachment from the movie, I still strongly suggest you to see it. It'll definitely make you think and leave you emotionally exhausted.",8
25 December 2005,Spielberg's back with a vengeance,"Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's ""Munich"" seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. ""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, ""When does it ever end?""

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. ""Munich"" could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul. ""When does it ever end?"" Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",7
6 April 2008,A Masterpiece In Every Way,"Set in the aftermath of the 1972 massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics, Munich recounts the dramatic story of the secret Israeli squad assigned to track down and assassinate 11 Palestinians believed to have planned the 1972 Munich massacre -- and the personal toll this mission of revenge takes on the team and the man who led it. Eric Bana stars as the Mossad agent charged with leading the band of specialists brought together for this operation.

Inspired by actual events, the narrative is based on a number of sources, including the recollections of some who participated in the events themselves. Munich 10/10

2 January 2006,Obvious Drama with Very Little Impact,"At the beginning of his career, Steven Spielberg had an almost perverse desire to entertain his audiences. As a result, we were spellbound by his movies. Then he decided that he was going to make movies that were ""good"" for people, and he produced dreadful stuff like ""Amistad."" Lately, he's been trying to merge the two approaches to storytelling, and his movies have suffered for it. His pure entertainments, like ""War of the Worlds,"" haven't been particularly entertaining, and his message movies, like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" have been short on message.

""Munich"" is further proof that Spielberg is just not an especially intelligent director. He wants to thrill us with a cloak and dagger story even while he's preaching to us. The problem is this: the thriller parts of ""Munich"" undercut the seriousness of the topic, yet they're the only really entertaining moments of the film. Tony Kushner has written a clunky screenplay that jars to a halt every twenty minutes or so to discuss the moral crisis at the center of the movie as if we've been invited to sit in on a civics class, rather than letting the crisis evolve naturally from the material or allowing the audience to do any of the work for itself, which it is entirely capable of doing. And the action movie sections, while admittedly exciting, are manipulative and reek of classic Spielberg. He just can't resist the pull of emotional bombast and resorts to cheap tricks in order to build suspense. For instance, in a scene in which the team of Israeli assassins has rigged one of their target's phones to blow up when it is answered, he goes out of his way to introduce a child into the scene to heighten the tension; however, Spielberg is so predictable that we know a child will never die so aimlessly in one of his films. A truly original director would have made that scene suspenseful without pandering to our base emotions. And late in the film, during a scene in which Avner, the lead assassin, is making love to his wife while images of what happened to the Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics flash through his head, Spielberg's histrionics derail the movie altogether into pure camp. Never mind that Avner couldn't possibly be remembering what happened since he never actually witnessed the events in the first place--at a moment when the film should be gripping, it's instead ridiculous.

The movie has a terrific look, and reminded me of those gritty paranoid films from the early seventies, like ""The French Connection"" and ""The Conversation."" Indeed, the look of the film and the skill with which it's put together will give people the illusion that's it a more important film than it really is, and will likely get it nominated for a buttload of Oscars. But in a year of such great movies that have already covered much of the same ground, ""Munich"" seems even further away from being an important film than it might in a more mediocre year. ""A History of Violence"" pretty much had the final word on the cyclical nature of violence and how it eventually degrades human morality; and Steven Gaghan showed with ""Syriana"" that a political thriller can be intelligent and exciting all at the same time.

I was impressed with Eric Bana, mostly because I've only seen him in ""Hulk"" and ""Troy"" and since those two movies don't comprise the world's most stunning acting resume, I was pleasantly surprised that he has quite a bit of skill. One senses that he didn't need Spielberg and company to stop the proceedings for the periodic lectures they wedge into the film; he could have done just fine on his own. And no other actors really get much of a chance to develop characters we care about, which has always been and probably always will be a weakness in any Spielberg movie.

I'm not Jewish or Palestinian, so I think I can speak pretty objectively to the fairness with which Spielberg approaches the topic. He makes an admirable attempt to address both sides, but the film's sympathies obviously lie with the Jews, and there a few moments when it takes on a self-righteous tone that threatens to tip the balance. However, Spielberg is Jewish, so I could easily excuse this.

There's a haunting, powerful film to be made from the events detailed in this film, but ""Munich"" isn't it.

Grade: B-",6
21 February 2006,"butchers' hands, and gentle souls.","Munich sounds like a catchy name, doesn't it? And the topic of this movie is, to say the least, a hot one. When you enter a movie with such a hot topic like Munich, a topic on which you've already formed a somewhat strong opinion, you hunger to criticize the flick. That was the case with me. But after seeing this movie, my head was full of unanswered question on which I had to find new answers.

Obviously this movie is after Schindler's List Spielberg's second movie that touches the subject of Jews. But in this movie he takes no sides. He sympathizes with both the Jews and the Palestinians. Maybe ""sympathize"" is too strong a word. I'd rather say he let's us see both sides of the coin. The movie has no real good or bad guy. I would define the main character of the movie as an antihero who slowly gets into trouble with his moral guidelines.

Spielberg chose to give this movie a dark tone and an unsettling (brilliant) score that puts us viewers in a constantly alarmed mood. Each time the assassins take down one of their targets the heartbeat like score forces us to ask: Are they doing the right thing? And the general style of the movie seemed to me similar to the, in my opinion great style of The French Connection.

Like all the Spielberg movies, this movie is relies more on it's story than on the performances of the cast. But nevertheless the cast delivers a solid performance. Eric Bana doesn't fail to carry the movie with some strong assistance from actors like Geoffrey Rush. He was very believable as the lone Israeli assassin who at first gets hunted by moral questions and finally becomes the prey himself.",10
17 December 2005,Steven Spielberg has made yet another masterpiece.,"In 'Munich' Eric Bana plays Avner, officially a former Mossad agent who now works independently. Unofficially, he and four other Mossad agents have been contracted to eliminate those who planned a terrorist attack on their countrymen.

In 1972 a group called Black September assassinated 11 Israeli athletes at the Olympic games in Munich. Based on George Jonas' book 'Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team' this movie tells about how one group of men enacted Israel's retribution and the prices they had to pay.

Eric Bana is awesome in the film as a man who undergoes a dramatic change after what he does for his country, a country that cannot afford to acknowledge his existence. I also liked seeing Michael Lonsdale as Papa. People might remember him as Hugo Drax in Moonraker (my favorite Bond villain).

This is one of the best movies I have seen all year. Steven Spielberg has made yet another masterpiece. My only issue is that about 30 minutes should have been cut out near the end.",8
5 February 2006,A thin line between executioner and a victim to be executed,"I'm giving it all the stars possible because it was the best film of a few years of my life. I got interested with the poster which appeared online long ago, where a man with the gun, the executioner, looks like a victim to be executed. The dose of despair in ""Munich"" is breathtaking. The biggest contradiction of human nature is shown clearly: human-beings don't want to be killed, but a machine of violence following violence following violence is working and even with all understanding and diplomacy it's barely possible to stop it. And audience is helplessly watching the way those pinions inside the machine moving and affecting each other. Spielberg showed the sequence of a human-being breaking under the weight of God's duties he was given: to take lives away. ""Munich"" is strong enough to affect every viewer. It had an impact on me, it had an impact on part of audience who came to see ""Hector of Troy without a beard"". They stopped to giggle and grow serious after first 10 minutes. Movie is powerful when no one can open a mouth and start making silly jokes.

22 May 2007,The human side of warring factions,"First, on a light note, I saw ""Road to Perdition"" right before I saw this film, and therefore made the conclusion that Daniel Craig is in every film made. At this point, I feel like I know his face better than one of my family members.

""Munich"" is a powerful story done by a powerhouse group, as it is directed by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Tony Kushner. It's the story of a young Israeli, Avner (Eric Bana), who is asked to head up a team with the mission to eliminate the men responsible for the massacre at the 1972 Munich Olympics. The situation is re-enacted but real television news clips are used throughout the beginning of the film. Though he has a wife and their first child is on the way, Avner accepts the assignment, which takes him all over the world tracking down and killing the miscreants. When his assignment comes to an end, he finds he is unable to shake his experiences.

""Munich"" demonstrates, in the form of Avner and his team, the disintegration of those qualities that make us human beings in the first place. These men believe in what they're doing but become disillusioned - can they all be trusted? Whom can they trust? What is the point of, as one of them puts it, ""all this blood"" when the people they kill are replaced with worse people? In the beginning, Avner clearly has no affection for killing - he watches, horrified, as it goes on. The team is careful not to hurt civilians - for instance, they protect a little girl, the daughter of one of the Black September planners, from a bomb intended for her father. Later, Avner's orders are ""just do it,"" and there are bodies of innocent victims everywhere. Avner pays a man named Louis huge money for information on the whereabouts of the Black September men - and then begins to doubt him - is he in turn telling the other side his whereabouts because he has become a target? I agree that Spielberg does not take sides in the film and shows how everyone suffers in any violent conflict, and that after a time, people hate for the sake of hating and kill for the sake of killing, often forgetting what started the whole cycle.

Eric Bana gives a fantastic performance as Avner. He looks so different at the end of the film than at the beginning, as he becomes increasingly more paranoid. He is particularly frightening in the scene where he is making love to his wife and reliving what he's been through. One really feels the harrowing experiences he's had and what it has done to his spirit.

A thought-provoking and sobering film.",9

16 December 2005,Another Spielberg Wonder,"Out of the gate, political questions aside, this picture is directed brilliantly and, to my continuing amazement regarding Spielberg, with new methods of displaying action and pictorial picture telling. Years ago, it took a while for me to be impressed with Spielberg. In recent years, he seems as though he can do little wrong. His maturity as a story teller and his development of endless methods of telling his stories visually makes each of his movies a fresh experience.

MUNICH is a sobering picture about a weighty topic and manages, with few exceptions (and those exceptions could easily be cut), to deal with moral and ethical questions with an artful minimum of intellectuality. The implications of being involved in a political war are always brought to a personal level, where they should be. And doing it this way, without any solid answers, leaves the situation in the middle east, as far as the story goes, an open question. Spielberg doesn't attempt to put any exclamation point on the moral justification of what we see in this movie.",10
30 January 2006,Why a cheap set?,"Much has been written about how well the subject has been treated and the impartiality of Spielberg's approach - a given these days if he doesn't want to end up like Salman Rushdie. Much has also been said also about the sheer quality of the production. But I am puzzled to say the least about why a director with the financial means of Steven Spielberg would make us believe that Budapest is Rome and Malta is Athens. From the flawless recreation of European capitals in the early seventies to the impeccable costume design to the beautiful cinematography  'Munich' is a visually fascinating movie. Except no scene was actually shot in Rome nor Athens. We were clearly in Hungary and Malta. And it showed. For those who know these cities this begs the question: was Spielberg on a shoestring budget?

9 February 2020,Yawn,"This was not Spielbergs best work. I understand the importance of the story, but I've watched it multiple times and its just not worthy of all the attention. Long periods of boredom surround bits of action or meaningful dialog.

The acting was not well directed, surprisingly.

It could have been so much better.

30 May 2006,Hamlet in Tel Aviv,"As a thriller, ""Munich"" works very well. Unfortunately, Kushner, Roth, and Spielberg felt the need to overlay the thriller with a political statement. Thus, we are faced with an assassin who talks like Hamlet, because he has to talk for Kushner & Co. It is difficult to get involved in an action movie when even the main character's heart is not in it.

At the beginning of the movie, Avner (the main character) is offered a clear choice: to join the mission or not; and he decides to join. Then, after killing his first target, he begins to feel moral qualms. Some of his team mates react in the same way. Nothing strange about that, and yet their crisis of conscience does not seem sincere: their words and actions hardly betray any feelings about killing. Instead, they talk about the abstract morality of their mission, and its likely consequences. They are almost too cerebral to be recognizable as human characters. They do not amount to much as philosophers, either. Their discussions offer no more insight than: killing is bad.

To be fair to this Hamletic hit squad, part of their problem is that they are faced by conflicting information: first they are told that new terrorists are recruited by terrorist attacks, like Munich; later they are told, or tell themselves, that killing terrorists creates more terrorists. Damned if you don't, and damned if you do.

This cognitive dissonance takes its toll on Avner. In one scene, he empathizes with a terrorist who wants to kick all Jews out of Palestine. In another scene, flashbacks of his terrifying experience in Munich do nothing to inhibit his sexual performance. A psychiatrist could make a career out of studying this guy!

Once more, apart from the psychological flaws, the movie is actually very good. The logic of Avner wanting to take part in the Beirut operation is pretty shaky (did Avner want his informers to know that he was in it, or not? and why go there in either case?); the way Avner buys information looks too easy to be true; but otherwise I found the plot believable. Even the physics is realistic: nobody flies off backwards when hit by a bullet, for instance. It would have been a great movie if Kushner & Co. had allowed the story to speak for itself.

As a footnote, the statement ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values"" (see memorable quotes) is questionable. It is hard to believe that the ancient Mongols or the Vikings ever had to compromise their values. The Icelandic sagas show that the ""cycle of violence"" is easily broken, when both sides accept that the other side is going to stand up for its rights. Genghis Khan had his own (quite effective) way to break the ""cycle of violence"". Maybe the Viking and ancient Mongol cultures do not count as civilizations, but even so, they are still valid as proof of concept; so it would have made more sense to say: ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own unrealistic expectations"". But then the statement becomes a tautology.",7
28 January 2006,another powerful work from the master,"There could hardly be a film more relevant to our times than Steven Spielberg's ""Munich,"" the master filmmaker's grim and controversial rumination on how violence only begets violence and how the philosophy of ""an eye for an eye,"" when taken to its extreme, only winds up with two men who cannot see. It certainly wasn't a ""safe"" subject for Spielberg to tackle, especially in the extremely sensitive post-9/11 world in which we live, but Spielberg has never been a filmmaker content to rest on his laurels and he certainly isn't doing so here.

Based on the book, ""Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team"" by George Jonas, the film uses as its starting point the tragic killing of eleven Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Olympic Games. To get revenge for the murders, the Israeli government secretly hires a handful of assassins whose job it is to hunt down and kill those responsible for the act. Avner, the man chosen to be the leader of the operation, is forced to abandon his pregnant wife and later their newborn baby to perform his mission. As the body count begins to pile up, Avner is forced to question his actions, becoming more and more morally confused, guilt-ridden and paranoid as the story develops.

Spielberg has been harshly criticized for being too egalitarian and non-judgmental in his approach, for implying a kind of moral equivalence between the Israelis and the Palestinians. I don't really feel qualified to answer those charges, but from an artistic standpoint, I believe the director has taken the right approach, for in art, moral ambiguity is always more fascinating and challenging than moral certainty. Spielberg certainly generates sympathy for the Israeli athletes who are the first in the movie to fall victim to the bloodshed, and the Jewish individuals called on to exact the nation's revenge are shown as generally righteous men motivated by a desire for justice and concerned that innocent victims not fall prey to their violence. It's true that the Israeli government doesn't fare nearly as well here, and it is in this area that Spielberg opens himself up to the most criticism. However, this is something for the more politically inclined to deal with. Those of us interested in fine film-making will have less trouble with this aspect.

For as a movie, ""Munich"" is a powerhouse of a drama, thanks to Tony Kushner and Eric Roth's thought provoking, intelligent screenplay and Spielberg's incisive, tightly disciplined direction. The movie doesn't wander off into side alleys or irrelevancies but stays intimately focused on the characters as they go through the grim business of hunting down suspects, detonating explosives and even engaging in challenging moral discussions from time to time. Spielberg makes every moment count, whether it be showing us the intricate step-by-step process through which these men eliminate their targets or capturing a man's moment of joy and anguish as he talks on the phone to the little daughter he's never met.

As a humanist, Spielberg seems less concerned with heroes and villains than with the devastating toll escalating violence takes on both the individual psyche and society as a whole. He seems to be saying that we're in all this together, and until we begin to acknowledge our common humanity, the peaceful world we all long for will never come to pass.

The performances are uniformly excellent, especially the one by Eric Bana, who, as Avner, manages to make a complex and morally ambiguous character both believable and touching.

""Munich"" is not an easy film for many in the audience to warm up to or sit through. It demands concentration and a willingness to look at some of the harsh realities of the world we live in with an open mind and unaverted eyes. But for those willing and courageous enough to do so, ""Munich"" is a provocative and richly rewarding experience.",9
28 September 2021,Beautifully told story,"Beautifully told true story about the Israel Mossad hunting down and killing some Arabs that killed their people in the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany. I particularly enjoyed the scenery in France and other parts of Europe. A great lineup of actors who did a superb job. You got to respect the Jews in Israel for following through on such a horrific task. When the Mossad is after you, you're not getting away. The art direction and cinematography are beautiful. Nicely done art direction and the director shot from the right angles and lighting while capturing an interesting perspective. The characters really looked and acted the part.

15 February 2006,Wasted opportunity,"Sadly, this is a real stinker.

The characters are laughably wooden and the dialogue is excruciatingly hackneyed. In short this is the Yiddish A-Team does Europe, without the humour.

But this is much worse than simply poor entertainment. I believe that when making a film about an historical event the director has an obligation to either portray that event as faithfully as possible or to clearly state that it does not. The film begins with the words ""Inspired by real events"" which is merely a disingenuous muddling of the fact that this film is a complete fiction. It is not only dishonest but damaging to Hollywoodize history in this way, for both the real people touched by these events and the people who will come away from this film believing it to be the truth.

There were two documentaries about the post-Munich events shown recently on British TV. They were not only far more moving and gripping but told the facts. It was a great story; unfortunately Spielberg wasted the opportunity to tell it.",1
24 December 2005,Thought Provoking...Movie of the Year,"I just got back from watching this movie a little while ago. I wasn't too familiar with the Munich olympics and the murders of the Israeli team since I wasn't born for 10 years after that. I had heard some things about it and also did some research leading up to the movie. This was one of my most anticipated movies of the year and it has pushed right to the top of my favorite movies for 2005.

Eric Bana as Avner was an amazing choice in casting. First of all, I saw him in Hulk and wasn't impressed seeing as it wasn't that kind of movie. I will be watching for him in future movies. The depth of his character was developed so well to the point where I could feel his fear, regrets, and other emotions by just looking into his eyes.

The violence and blood was very tasteful and I really liked the way that some of the sequences were shot (not going to post any spoilers). Steven Spielberg really impressed me seeing as I never would have expected this kind of movie to come from him.

A lot of people have said to me that they thought this movie was boring. I don't know how this movie could be boring. I asked those same people if they thought Traffic was boring (seeing as its the only long dramatic movie that came to my mind at the time) and they said yes. In conclusion, if you are not a fan of dramatic movies that tend to be long...then you don't deserve to be called a movie watcher.",10
1 February 2006,Good film but go see the original,"Munich is a well crafted film by the biggest director on the planet. Great pacing, suspense and cinematography. The biggest problem I had with the film is that I've seen it before. A little known film called THE SWORD OF GIDEON. Munich is almost a direct copy from the original. What a shame that Spielberg has to produce a remake of a much better film. Enough already with the remakes. People want to see original stories with fresh new ideas and writers. Why are independent films so successful, because the ones that are well made and tell a good story are box office darlings. It's amazing some Hollywood films have budgets north of 100 million. Just incredible how much money and time is wasted. If you want to understand what happened in the aftermath of Munich, rent THE SWORD OF GIDDEON.

11 December 2005,"Impressive film-making, but superficial and heavy-handed","I saw this movie at a screening and I'm very mixed about it. In a way, it was kind of bad, and yet also admirable...

It was great to be seeing a big budget film tackle political subject matter. And the film takes great care to present a balanced point of view: there is a strong effort to humanize many of the characters, Arab and Israeli.

But I felt hit over the head with the film's ""unbiased"" message of peace. Once again, Spielberg buries potentially interesting & adult subject matter with his slick film-making skills and his heavy-handed, ""soul of a child"" sensibility.

There are some great things here. The acting is pretty great. Eric Bana gives a fine, understated performance. Daniel Craig is magnetic, and several of the supporting actors are excellent and surprisingly authentic, notably Michael Lonsdale.

The production design, sets and cinematography all work together superbly to re-create the early '70s. There aren't many films lately which can truly evoke a specific period. Munich does it almost flawlessly. I really felt transported by the sets, costumes and lighting, it was if I were watching some 30-year old French thriller. The only thing that gave it away were the smooth, dynamic camera moves, many of which, by the way, involved extremely complicated choreography.

There is a visceral excitement to some of the film. YES, it's extremely violent, but a good portion of it is devoted to the suspense and thrill of international spycraft, always a crowd-pleasing subject.

But, as the characters carry out their harrowing missions, the film starts to feel hollow. Considering the fascinating nature of the subject matter, it feels like there's too much slick film-making in place of ideas and/or character development.

There's some good dialogue here and there, but several times, I felt the actors were explaining too much, as if the filmmakers didn't trust the audience to ""get it."" Once these realizations set in, the film starts to feel way too long...

When the film, later, clumsily reaches for meaning and character depth, it feels forced and too late. Though Bana is very good, the script doesn't give him enough to flesh out his character. There is one scene in particular which is SO OUTRAGEOUSLY BAD, it doesn't even seem like the same movie.

Ultimately, there's no real emotional tug here, and one gets the sense that the same story could have been told more effectively in a shorter film which focused more on the main characters.

But, yet, the film did affect me, mostly for the way it convincingly transported me, through its look and some visual sequences, into its world, evoking thoughts and memories of historical events and the state of our world today.",5
24 December 2005,One of the great films of all time.,"Steven Spielberg's treatise on middle-eastern violence ranks alongside his Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan as a towering achievement. Part electrifying thriller, but heart-wrenching tragedy, this is likely to provoke more thought and debate than any other film this year, and has all of the hallmarks of a master storyteller at the peak of his form. Rather than criticizing Israel, as some have suggested, or vilifying Palestine, as others have complained, Spielberg observes the cost of violence on nations and individuals. Working from a brilliant script by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, Munich asks difficult questions and doesn't provide easy answers. The cast, including Eric Bana, Daniel Craig and Ciaran Hinds, give excellent, understated performances. The recreation of the Munich massacre is as devastating in it own way as Spielberg's take on the D-Day landing, but the quiet moments where the Mossad assassins question their own righteousness are perhaps even more effective.

Munich is one of the bravest films ever made, and Spielberg deserves to join the exclusive club of three-time Oscar winning directors on this one.",10
7 August 2006,A lament for the loss of idealism,"Steven Spielberg's Munich is a lament for the loss of idealism, not only for Avner (Eric Bana), the leader of an assassination squad, but also for Israel, a country that once proclaimed the supremacy of human values. The film deals with events stemming from the deaths of eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic games in Munich, Germany at the hands of a group of Palestinians who came to be known as Black September. It is not a documentary but historical fiction that dramatizes the unofficial Israeli retaliation for the deaths in Munich, depicting the revenge killings of a secret intelligence operation.

There is much bloodshed and horrific violence in the film but there are no heroes and no villains and, to the chagrin of supporters on both sides, the film contains more questions than answers. Will the killings stop the terror or will the men killed simply be replaced by even more dedicated terrorists? What is the result for an individual's soul and indeed the soul of a nation? Is revenge killing ever justified? These are questions in which Spielberg has shown considerable courage in raising.

The leader of the unit is Avner, a member of the Mossad, the Israeli version of the CIA, and the son of a war hero. Though he is reluctant to leave his wife who is pregnant, he does not question his mission out of his belief in the righteousness of the Israeli cause. His team includes Steve, a dedicated Zionist from South Africa (Daniel Craig), a toymaker who has turned to making bombs (Mathieu Kassovitz), an antique dealer (Hanns Zischler) and a veteran military officer (Ciaran Hinds). All work for Mossad and their case officer (Geoffrey Rush), though officially no one has an identity or connection to the organization.

The film shows that the primary decision was made by a high member of the government, presumably Prime Minister Golda Meir, who justifies the assignment by proclaiming that ""every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Each assassination attempt is shown in detail, including the planning and the execution as the team carries out its operations in Rome, Paris, Cyprus, Beirut, and Athens. As the killings pile up, the bloodshed begins to take its toll, especially the gory ""personal"" killing of a woman operative who lured and killed one of the members of their unit. The once idealistic Avner becomes disillusioned by the experience and he and others begin questioning the morality of their assignment and whether it will ultimately help or hurt the Israeli cause. Some like Steve, a hard liner says, ""the only blood that matters to me is Jewish blood"". One member of the Israeli group, however, says ""Jews don't do wrong because our enemies do wrong. We're supposed to be righteous"" Another says, ""Palestinians didn't create terrorism. Palestinian lands were taken by bloodshed and terrorism"".

The Palestinian point of view is represented by a group of Arab bodyguards who unexpectedly share a safe house with the team in Athens, each unaware of the other's true identity. One of the bodyguards, Ali (Omar Metwally) claims that the Palestinians can ""wait forever. You don't know what it is not to have a home. Home is everything"". Although the film does not take a stand on how countries should react to terrorism, it questions the wisdom of the ""eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth"" philosophy and the ethical basis of the operation. When Avner concludes, ""there is no peace at the end of this"", he demands evidence from his superiors that the men they killed were actually involved with the Munich massacre.

Munich is an honest, tightly woven, and very suspenseful film that contains some fine performances, especially that of Eric Bana. More importantly, it asks us to look at what is possible in today's world beyond the exchanging of atrocities, to perhaps even envision the day when claims of religious superiority (""religionism"") will be seen as racism and homophobia are today, as relics of an ignorant past. It allows us to dream that the ultimate solution to the Middle East conflict will not be a political one based on dual states enforcing a religious apartheid, but a spiritual solution where direct experience, not ancient scriptures, will lead people to the divine presence.",9
31 December 2005,Saving Eric Bana,"Steven Spielberg delves deeper into unabashed realism with this film. Like Saving Private Ryan, this film does not hesitate to explore the horrors of the human urge to violence. Perhaps, Spielberg is trying to warn us of the end of our tendencies toward revenge that in turn leads to not only the endless cycle of violence but also to the inevitable ruin of the psychological health of those entrusted with the revenge. Spielberg depicts the massacre of Jewish athletes in Munich during the 1972 Olympic Games to illustrate his point. Eric Bana plays a member of the Israeli Mossad, which is assigned by Golda Meir the task of revenge. However, Bana begins to doubt the wisdom of some of the assassinations and asks his commander why the Palestinians were not simply arrested and tried, as Eichmann was. The intricacies of secret assassinations are vividly depicted, including bombings and cleverly disguised guns and accidental killings (collateral casualties). Government sponsored assassinations are seen as a dangerous and nasty business. Bana continues his wonderful portrayal of the hero, following his portrayal of Hector in Troy. And Spielberg continues to show himself to be a master of realism, as well as fantasy.",10
8 April 2007,Unconvincing and morally misguided,"Laughably fake, brimming with inexcusable factual errata and poorly written dialog. Case in point - Spielberg expects us to believe a ragtag, inept, guilt-ridden group of Mossad agents who rely only on a third party informer. In real life the agents were well-organized professionals who used no outside information, were more than willing to do their assignment and never regretted it.

The film's morals are as lacking as its historic and dramatic integrity. It refuses to make any distinction between the violence of terrorists and the violence by which justice is enforced. It completely disregards the preventative, defensive end of terrorist-hunting and portrays it as mindless vengefulness. This film makes one wonder if Spielberg would rather see murderers left to their devices.

22 August 2006,Stirring Masterpiece,"Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's ""Munich"" seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. ""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul.

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution.

Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. ""Munich"" could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul.

It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",10
25 June 2006,Interesting Espionage Thriller But Too Long,"MUNICH fulfilled my expectations but my wife and me found the movie too long. The story hits a still existing problem from the state Israel and their identity. Spielberg packed all that in an interesting espionage cat and mouse thriller set in some nice places in Paris and Rome. Believable scenery and costumes brought me really back to the seventies. I didn't know that Eric Bana could act so strong and here he convinced me and this performance should have been the Oscar for him. The picture was very clear and superb and the film is anyway fast paced containing many plots and twists with some violent scenes. No doubt MUNICH is well worth the five Oscar nominations. Steven Spielberg explained for me very well what happened in that black September of 1972 with the Juif situation and I recommend MUNICH to everyone that wants to understand more about the Juifs. I warn you that it has nearly three hours running time and so watch it only if you have enough time. I give for this five Oscar nominated document a solid 6/10. Too overrated on this site.

3 January 2006,Best Spielberg film in a while,"Spielberg's last film had a deficient story patched together with great modern FX and was a failure, even with Tom Cruise in it. Munich was a great story with almost no modern FX. Which film was better? Munich, hands down. Thus, FX alone does not a great Spielberg movie make, contrary to the opinions of many children of all ages who wouldn't know a great story if it came out of a dark closet wearing King Kong's ape suit. ""Show me the action"", they would say. Well, Munich had plenty of action, and plenty of great story too. That's enough for anyone who loves great and authentic(as is possible in a dramatic film) history films as much as I do.

Ahhh, Munich, that Spielberg labor of love so well done overall.....dramatic..... balanced.... well acted.... so aware of historical truths on both sides. Other than needing about 20 or so slow minutes cut out to enhance the pacing and suspense element it was terrific, and scary as hell in places. Spielberg knows better than most how to show the common man in uncommon crisis situations, with that man's warts and incompetences and humanity(or lack of it) bared, and he did it just right here, almost to nerve-wracking, nail-biting excess.

Others have detailed the story to a fare-thee-well, so I won't. Suffice to say, Spielberg ""gets it"" about the Middle East and its conflict history, and shows it in this film. His film told that a thousand years of Islamic-Jewish warfare is not going to be cured by trading lives now, just as it hasn't helped over those many past years. As one Islamic character in the film said.... as long as the Jews have a chunk of Palestine's homeland, the conflict will continue forever until they are gone, every single one. The keyword here is ""homeland"", even the film recognized that, and the Palestinians will stop at nothing until they get it back so they can die at home in peace and glory.

Carve another piece of land from some other country and give it to them instead?....Forget it. Palestinians will never stop until they get their original homeland back. It's ingrained in their religion and culture and they will never stop fighting for it. So, on it goes, endlessly.

Will they get it back under Dub's watch?....No! Will it ever happen?... Arabic people are many and Jews are few and the world has many days left. Jews have had the world's sympathy since WWII so they have prevailed in this war to date, but with time and possibly more sympathetic world leaders to this Palestinian plight, who knows? That's as good an answer as any, and it could happen someday. It's a fickle world and alliances change.

Someday, sometime, endless religion-based killing in the Middle East has to stop. See this film and understand better both sides of this issue. That's Spielberg's point, and I commend him highly for telling it so well.",8
5 March 2006,Nothing special,"Nothing Special. OK movie, started out strong. The film become too artish with the ending. I know the anxiety's were reflected, but I like the documentary feel of the beginning. Acting is perfect. The ending, what is with that? The dinner comment? I believe the actor wanted to escape his past at the ending. The commando part is good. A movie rental. Nothing special. OK film. I would not buy it. I wonder how real the film is? Not a date movie. Film in a dark tint, I wonder if such a back ground was for the mood of this film? No humor or release in the film. Comments about the policies and ideas of the people, in a political way.

13 August 2006,"Not as simple as ""Israel is wrong""or vice-versa","I recall reading in columnist Ann Coulter's Academy Awards article(not really sure why she decided to cover the awards,given her very public contempt for actors and awards,but anyway...),she boiled down the concept behind Oscar nominee Munich as ""Israel is wrong"".

From seeing this movie,I can clearly tell she's not seen this film,or if she has she was there to cherry-pick this for the kind of things she didn't want to see or hear. I'm sure she's not alone out there,but these people are missing the point of this film.

This film account of the book(whose title and author eludes me at the moment),co-written by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth,tells of the Israeli backed(though NOT officially recognized by the state)mission to find and kill the people responsible for the kidnapping and killing of twelve Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich(hence the title). The group is led by Avner Kaufmann(Eric Bana,very good here,as he was in the Hulk and Troy),the son of a national hero who is a star agent of the Moussad(spelling?). His team of agents are sent by fiat of PM Golda Meir(Lynn Cohen) herself and is authorized by a fellow Mossad commander named Ephraim(Geoffrey Rush) to go about their missions.

Over the course of about eight months,Avner and his five transverse Europe looking for and executing each person for whom they are able to get a hold of,with each mission becoming a little more dangerous and each target becoming more murky. As Avner comes closer and closer to finding the main Palestinian who headed(or financed)the Olympic kidnapping,the endeavor becomes much more dangerous and Avner starts having his doubts about the effectiveness and purpose of his mission.

Dripping in moral quandaries,this movie starts as an anatomy of a national call for vengeance and justice and ends as...well,something different. I don't think I'm giving away anything by saying that this film shows that revenge is not nearly as simple,easy or clear as it seems.

With fantastic supporting performances by Daniel Craig(the future JAmes Bond!),Ayalet Zurer(As Avner's pretty,worried wife and new mother),Ciaran Hinds,Mathieu Kassowitz(both as members of the group),Cohne,Rush,Michael Lonsdael and Mathieu Aralic(as,respectively,the father of the info broker and the broker himself,who supply Avner their info as to whom to kill)among others,this movie is a searing,heart-tugging film. As per Spielberg,there is no skimping on emotional spark-plug moments,and plenty of the images here will stick with you long after you've seen them. This film doesn't pretend to have the answers about the violence in the Middle East,it is merely showing that in one instance of violence and tragedy,the way a nation responds can sometimes complicate or even make worse to some degrees,the situation. Nobody here is really wrong or right,just unable to break the chain of violence that has become synonymous with the region. Anyone who simplifies the situation,or this movie,doesn't get it or the film.",9

2 February 2006,Spielberg does it again,"Having seen this film only yesterday, all I can say is that without a doubt I'm seeing it again next week. Having been disappointed with Brokeback Mountain I entered the cinema with low expectations, have not been treated to a masterpiece since Crash. Munich did not disappoint me.

The story follows 5 top secret Israeli assassins hired to hunt down and kill 11 Palestiniens who had a hand in planning the Munich killings. The story is superb, and is conveyed in a really convincing manner. While some parts may feel a little confusing, simply sticking with it is rewarding.

Eric Bana does indeed steal the show as the team leader for the deadly five, and is well supported from Daniel 'Bond' Craig, who puts on a more than convincing south African accent. Not a single hollow performance is turned in, and they all seem to be heavily affected from the job they are carrying out. It is superbly crafted how with all these brutal murders, their mindsets begin to change and the harsh reality of war hits them all.

The action scenes shot in this movie are brutally real. The action shots covered the actually killing of the Israeli Olympic team feels hauntingly real, as does some of the bombings which take place.

While some may be turned away by the 164 minute run time (which I know my friends were) I feel this is a great film, and definitely one of Spielberg's best. Definitely does deserve some recognition.

14 October 2013,"""There is No Peace at the End of This""","A provocative illustration of the aftermath of 1972 Munich massacre, a tricky meditation on morality & arguably the most controversial film of Steven Spielberg's filmmaking career, Munich is an intimately crafted, meticulously detailed & technically sound cinema that dares to examine both sides of a single coin yet ends up being an unsatisfying, convoluted mess.

Based on the infamous incident at 1972 Olympics in Munich where 11 Israeli athletes were slaughtered by Palestinian terrorists, the story of Munich follows the aftermath of that event and focuses on the secret retaliation program carried out by the Israeli government to track down & kill the alleged members of Black September; the group responsible for the Munich massacre.

Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film opens with an extremely accurate depiction of the massacre, followed by Israel's own response to the terror attack and for the first half of its 163 minutes of runtime, it's very engaging. But then the gear shifts, the fictional elements start taking over the factual ones & the control is eventually lost as the story entangles itself into one mess after another.

Technically, the film is as accomplished as any other Spielberg feature. Most of its depicted events are factually correct, Production design team manages to recreate the environment with strong emphasis on authenticity, Cinematography makes excellent use of the camera & lighting, Editing paces the film at its own desired pace but could've used a bit of acceleration while John Williams delivers with an emotionally-scarring score.

Coming to the performances, Munich features a pretty reliable cast in Eric Bana, Geoffrey Rush, Daniel Craig, Mathieu Kassovitz & others, and while their characters do have a depth & the performances are equally good, this aspect of the film never really stands out. Also, it was good to see the film not submitting itself to a one-sided perspective for it questions the whole act of retaliation, if it was worth it in the end & if it in any way accomplished anything.

On an overall scale, Munich is one of Steven Spielberg's most polarising works that's going to divide its audience with the difficult questions it has in store but purely from storytelling perspective, there was enough room for improvement as the story completely fails to hold its grasp in the later half. Nevertheless, Munich still makes up for an intriguing experience & shows a new dimension of Spielberg that many will find rewarding and for that, it's definitely worth a shot.",

6 December 2005,1972 comes to life,"Everyone is a victim in Steven Spielberg's latest - the Olympic athletes, the Palestians who take them hostage, the Israelis who devote their lives to avenging the incident. Everyone wants their home and family. Spielberg takes his familiar themes into new territory, striving hard to maintain a neutral tone even while depicting horrifying carnage. The film-makers may succeed in raising the debate about peace in the Middle East with strong performances revealing awkward and arbitrary responses to bloodshed. Eric Bana leaps off the screen and leads an ensemble cast in perhaps his meatiest role since Chopper. His Mossad agent character becomes more and more believable as his smooth veneer is quickly worn down. Jumping from city to city, the film credibly holds the period in focus with over a hundred speaking parts and convincing accents from the International cast. I heard one Israeli viewer questioning whether Aussies Bana and Rush were dubbed (the answer was no). 1972, sideburns and all, comes to life in the film through newsreels and exquisite production design. If there is anything that holds this back from being a great film, it's a few uncertain shifts between awkward humour, boys own action and noble, but somewhat blatant, efforts to balance Israeli and Arab concerns. The film works best as a fascinating tribute to the law of diminishing returns from the Arab-Israeli conflict without any suggestions of how the conflict as a whole could be resolved. Munich is not what you would call entertainment, nor is it 100% clear who its audience is, but a good film nonetheless. The case for the State of Palestine has a new celluloid chapter and a surprising ally.",7

9 August 2009,awful,"This movie is just about killing, killing in a rush, jumping from scene to scene, like the director is in a rush to show how this evil killer called avner manage to kill so many, the more the better. I was surprised to see the director was Spielberg. This must be without a doubt his worst movie. What is the point of this terrible movie? are we suppose to feel good and in the same side for this mercenaries who only know how to commit murder? Are we suppose to feel sympathy for this professional killers? Is this movie telling us that terrorism is OK only when it is perpetrated by the mosad? I would say this movie is about terrorists killing terrorists. There is no difference here between the mosad or their mercenaries and the palestiniam terrorists. Spielberg thought otherwise by the look of it. This film is highly offensive and disrespectful with the victims of terrorism worldwide.

6 September 2007,An Almost Perfect Thriller,"Real events translated into images by one of the most powerful filmmakers the world has known since Cecil B De Mille. Spielberg is to admire, really. He keeps his energy in top gear there is no sign of sluggishness in his work. ""Munich"" in many ways, is his most grown up movie. The characters are fully fleshed out and that is unusual in a Spielberg film. A change that I applaud because that's what I miss most in his movies. Real characters, multi-dimensional. That's why when that is achieved, something memorable follows. Remember Ralph Finnes in ""Schindler's List"". Here Eric Bana makes us run the gamut of emotions provoking questions in our minds. Who are we rooting for? The answer is clear and yet we fight it. The scene with the bomb, the young girl and the telephone (I won't say more than that) is truly cinematic brilliance. All the sequence in France, although I agree is a part of the puzzle, thought it added unnecessary minutes to an already overlong movie. But that is a tiny criticism to a movie that may very well be consider one of the best in its genre and an almost perfect thriller.

24 December 2005,a major disappointment,"I entered the theatre anticipating a tense drama based upon the 1972 olympic team hostage-taking, and the revenge sought by israel in the aftermath. despite its balanced portrait of the middle eastern conflict and its futile cycle of violence and lives left in ruin (and, comments posted herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the film's perspective is relatively unbiased), this overly-long study is very slow going, with little dramatic momentum and not much light shed on its topic. surprisingly turgid, it's tough to sit through -- not because of painful truths being revealed but, rather, because boredom soon sets in. the cast, featuring eric bana, daniel craig and geoffrey rush, leaves little impression, with the exception of rush, who's not in enough of the film to keep it aloft. miss this, and see the superior 'syriana'.

6 February 2006,"Fascinating, unsettling","Gripping, almost unwatchable drama about the assassinations of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, West Germany. Steven Spielberg's narrative is never complacent, and it never seems to take the easy way out, choosing not to portray either side as completely good or bad.

Told from the viewpoint of Avner (Eric Bana, who looks like a younger Liam Neeson), a man charged by Israel to avenge the deaths of the athletes - no matter what the cost. Avner is given a small group of men with which to carry out his task: Kill all 11 members of the terrorist group Black September.

Although not quite as evocative or provocative (to me) as Spielberg's earlier Schindler's List, Munich is compelling nonfiction, crisply moving Avner and his crew from target to target and juxtaposing his thirst for revenge with his thoughts of his family, including his newborn daughter. Spielberg does a good job, too, of compelling the viewer to care about Avner, even while the latter mows down bad men using guns and bombs and other toys.

The movie is unsettling, probably much more so if you remember the events of the 1972 Olympics, which I do not. In fact, considering I am not Jewish and do not remember those events, this movie still unnerved me quite a bit. One of the recurring themes is the old ""eye for an eye"" mantra that pops up in any revenge tale. Which is preferred - sinking to the level of our enemies, or rising above it? It's not a question that's easily answered.

Bana is very good as Avner, as is Geoffrey Rush (whom I almost mistook for James Woods) as Avner's liaison with Mossad. There's not a slacker in the bunch, though, no insincere performances, no flat notes.

The movie manages to be eerily compelling considering that the outcome is already known - that it, in fact, is still fresh in the minds of many people. Schindler's List had the benefit of arriving more than 50 years after the Holocaust, but with the events in Munich so chronologically close, it would have been easy for the story to lose its footing, to perhaps expose itself as propaganda one way or another. But it doesn't. Although it is pro-Israeli, it is not so to the exclusion of anti-Israeli views; to wit, it is not posited as a clear honorable-revenge story with an easily seen resolution.",9

5 August 2010,A Debatable thriller,"¨We are supposed to be righteous. That's a beautiful thing. And we're losing it. If I lose that, that's everything. That's my soul.¨ Munich is a very powerful and emotional movie that combines thrills with human drama. I went into this film expecting it to be simply a revenge movie, but it is much more than that; Spielberg doesn't take sides and brings a lot of interesting elements that open up the debate between Israel and Palestine and which country is really the enemy. Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest directors active in American cinema and he has directed several masterpieces, Schindler's List being perhaps the best one. Munich will probably not rank amongst his best work, but it's still a great and powerful film that required a lot of risks on Spielberg's part as a Jew because in Munich he never takes sides and by doing so both sides have declared him an enemy. The movie is based on George Jonas's book ¨Vengeance¨ and the screenplay was adapted by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth (Forrest Gump and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button). The screenplay was beautifully written and also nominated for the Oscars along with four other categories (editing, directing, score, and best picture), although it went home empty handed. Those were probably the strongest elements the movie had, which was finely edited and the score really enhanced the film. I thought that there were also some very good performances from the cast, especially Eric Bana who gives his best performance to date, and Ciaran Hinds who also nails his role. Spielberg has only directed the fourth installment of Indiana Jones since Munich in 2005, but we will be hearing from him soon.

The film opens with the 1972 murders that took place in the Olympics of Munich. 11 Israeli athletes were murdered by a terrorist group called Black September. Munich focuses on what happened after these murders took place although there are several flashbacks during the movie returning to this attack. Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) didn't negotiate with the terrorists and therefore the hostages were killed, but now she decides to allow for a black operation to take place in order to kill some of the men behind the planning of the 72 attack. They hire Avner (Eric Bana), a Mossad agent who had served as a bodyguard for Meir, to lead the assassination squad which consisted of five men. The other men hired for the job were Steve (Daniel Craig), the driver, Hans (Hanns Ziechler), an expert at forging false documents and passports, Carl (Ciaran Hinds), the man in charge of doing the clean up after the assassinations took place, and Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), the bomb expert who knows more about dismantling them than creating one. The men resign from their official jobs and the Mossad and work as black operatives not tied to the government. They only receive a list of eleven men they have to kill and have to get the rest of intel on their own and work as a terrorist group and the only connection they have with the government is the payment they receive in the Bank and through a middle man named Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush). Avner contacts a man named Louis (Mathieu Amalric) who finds the location of almost every name given to him in exchange for a high price.

The movie begins very slow, but once the assassinations take place the thrills and suspense begin to play a big part in the film. This is not your average revenge film, it's much more than that. It opens ethical questions and dilemmas on several issues. Even the characters feel remorse for what they do and end up questioning if they are doing the right thing. Ephraim and Avner have very insightful conversations which open up the debate on this issue. It seems as if every murder that takes place is retaliated by the other group, and every leader that is murdered is replaced by a new one so the war will never end. Some leaders justify their actions by claiming it is the price to pay for building their home and having a land. Spielberg is very clever and doesn't take any sides in this movie, he doesn't justify the violence and makes you debate over who the true enemy really is. Munich is a very powerful film that relies on good direction from Spielberg and a solid performance from the entire cast. I really enjoyed this emotional thriller and it will leave you debating several issues.

27 December 2005,An intelligent film,"""Munich"" is not Steven Spielberg's masterpiece; that would still be ""Schindler's List"". But, it is Spielberg's most intelligent film. Without providing answers, Spielberg accomplishes what most great artist do, uses his art to make his viewers consider the real world. In this case that is by posing the question, ""what is the most effective way to deal with terrorism?"" There are two basic choices, avenge terrorism with violence against its perpetrators, hoping it will deter future acts or accept that violence begets more violence and vengeance merely further fuels the anger that spurs terrorism. These questions are mostly posed in the last 45 minutes of ""Munich"", the first hour and 45 minutes is a very good thriller.

The movie starts with the terrorist attack at the Munich Olympics of 1972. Israeli PM Golda Meier decides on the first tack in responding to the terrorism, saying at times a nation must compromise its values and that Israel must appear strong before the world. Avner (Eric Bana) is recruited to lead the team that is assigned to locate and kill the 11 leaders of Black September that planned the attack on Israel's athletes. Avner is provided with a team of 5 with various skills, such as bomb-making, clean up and documentation. The team starts upon its mission and begins to kill the terrorists. (not said, but note-worthy is in appearance the Palestinians killed all appear to be middle-class, middle-aged men. It is possible by killing these people, Israel inadvertently allowed younger, more radical and violent men to take their place).

It is after about 1 hour and 45 minutes that the movie changes from mostly straight-forward thriller to questioning the effect of the killing. Various men of Avner's team have various reactions to participating in killing others. Then, having attracted attention, members of Avner's team start to be killed. Avner becomes almost paranoid about his own safety. By film's end, Avner fantasizes that he is both a member of the Black September attack and a member of the doomed Olympic team.

Spielberg also portrays both Israeli and Palestinians as defending their actions due to their desire to have a home. This is a familiar Spielberg team. The unanswered question, which having seen the film one must consider is: What do you do when 2 people want the same home. Can they ever reconcile these desires and find a way to live in peace? The Cold War, South Africa and, hopefully, Norhtern Ireland found peaceful resolutions, maybe one day this can also happen in the Middle East.",9
6 August 2007,A Portrayal of Humanity Like Schindlers List,"MUNICH After two years I finally saw the movie tonight...and in a way I was awestruck.

Now most stupid people will watch this movie and say its the most biased movie they have ever watched, either biased against Jews and Israel or biased against Palestinians and Muslims....these people are just nincompoops (i.e. fools) This movie is a portrayal, a very beautiful and all at once ugly portrayal of human nature, very much like Steven Spielbergs other masterpiece ""Schindlers List""....this movie encompasses a whole range of human emotion to an uncanny degree as reflected on the characters, it lends no preference over which ""side"" is better, its just an astonishing and shocking portrayal of humanity.

First of all the central theme is vengeance, but also mixed with that is rage and hate, self-preservation, nationalism, ethics, paranoia, and of course love of family and nation. One actually feels for the main character, Avner, (masterfully played by Eric Bana) in this movie, and the roller-coaster of emotions that he endures and the ensuing paranoia and guilt after has had helped commit his actions. One feels as if he is transformed with Avner from a good soldier who puts God and country before all else to a tormented human soul who seeks justification for his actions against fellow human beings amidst a paranoia which engulfs his reality and threatens the ones he loves the most, his family. In essence the movie questions if the ends justifies the means, and if violence, vengeance, and hatred really solve anything at all....which we all know it doe not.

This movie has tons of action as well, for all the action fans, and as a student of the 1972 Munich Kidnappings, it accurately portrays the events that transpired in September 1972, and the bloody secretive war that transfixes Israel and Palestine over the next couple of years, filled with terror.

Overall a masterpiece of a film, which of course inspires claims of Bias either for or against the Jews , questions of who is the most terrible nationality Palestinians or Jews?, in the end no one is right, if everyone is wrong, this film finally is a study of human nature for we are all susceptible to unrestrained hate and vengeance and we are also endowed with a conscience, an ethical means of doing things.

There are things greater, than Jew, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist or Shinto, things greater than the color of your skin, or who is your God, or what language you speak, that thing is humanity, which is a burden or a blessing, a curse or a cure....it is up for you to decide, and this film like Schindlers List masterfully paints a real portrayal of the strifes and range of humanity. of what it is to be human.....

I LOVE THIS FILM Supramaxx rating 10/10",10
6 February 2006,This was a fantastic movie,"Just thought I would chime in since there seems to be so much negativity about this movie on these boards. I really thought it was fantastic--one of Spielberg's best, if not _the_ best. He took a really difficult topic and made it thrilling, compelling, exciting, and totally engrossing. The acting is top-notch and the set design, costumes, etc. really blew me away. Everything looks so authentic that you really feel like you walked straight into Rome or Paris circa 1973. Eric Bana, all the character actors--everyone completely became their characters.

I see that some people complain that Spielberg didn't completely get the facts straight, but this movie never purports to be a documentary--it is ""inspired by true events."" Really what it is about is how difficult it is to kill another human being, and the price we often pay for fighting for what we believe in. Is it worth it? Spielberg doesn't provide a clear answer--in this movie he simply asks the question, and I don't have a problem with that...",10
29 December 2005,Much too long for the message it delivers,"This movie is interesting enough, but are we afraid to edit, just because it's Spielberg? This is little more than a string of brutal assassinations, beginning with the first one in Munich. The acting is superb, the directing is too, but after a while, it's too much work for too little payoff. ""Munich"" is a quasi-documentary without supplying the historical background that a good documentary would include. I give Spielberg credit for some thought-provoking dislodge, but it's mixed in with gratuitous sex (and I usually like a certain amount of sex in a movie), gratuitous violence, and corn-ball dislodge. The movie just never really grabbed my heart.

Maybe the highly visible director/producer doesn't want to repeat Salmon Rushdie's exile and so he softened his message. This could have been another ""Schindler's List"", but it feels like the movie's editor didn't cut anything. (Was there even an editor involved?) I ended by not caring about anyone in the movie. There is not one truly sympathetic character.

Where are all the great end-of-the year movies?",6
16 August 2009,Intriguing But Rather Hollow Morality Tale Of Israeli Secret Agent Assassins,"Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's ""Munich"" seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. ""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, ""When does it ever end?""

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. ""Munich"" could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul. ""When does it ever end?"" Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",6
3 February 2006,Spielberg Strikes a Balance,"Just before I watched Steven Spielberg's Munich, there was a documentary on Channel 4 that followed the first half of the movie almost shot for shot. Apart from allowing me to brush up on my distinctly hazy knowledge of the Arab-Israeli conflict, this also provided a clear lesson in distinguishing between political history and intelligent film-making.

And, yes, there are discrepancies in the two accounts. Of course there are. But even assuming the documentary was rooted firmly in fact (and remember, it WAS on Channel 4  never an organisation to favour balanced reporting over controversial muck-raking), I would suggest that Munich is close enough to the truth to discredit the nay-sayers and educate the neutrals without compromising its entertainment remit.

Set in the immediate aftermath of the 1972 Olympic Games hostage crisis, the film charts the Israeli response to Palestinian terrorism. Keen to eliminate members of the Black September group who carried out the atrocity but equally reluctant to outrage the international community, Security Service agency Mossad employs a secret hit squad to do its dirty work and then distances itself from the whole operation.

The team is led by Avner (Eric Bana), the son of an Israeli hero, and contains an eclectic bunch of bomb-makers, fixers and heavies. And it is here that the film starts to distance itself from fact (or at least the documentary). Spielberg humanises his hit squad. They are fallible and conscience-driven and a world away from the unapologetic, bristling assassins depicted in the Channel 4 film where surviving members are interviewed and come across more in the traditional mould - their faces in shadow, but their distaste for the enemy very much apparent. Only Daniel Craig's brawny South African mercenary comes anywhere near the clinical coldness of these testimonies, but Avner and the others are perpetually questioning their motivation.

Spielberg purposefully omits any personal links between the innocent athletes cut down in Munich and those who seek retribution. There are no tearful widows or blinking, wide-eyed orphans. Avner and his team are not on a vendetta  they are merely following orders. Himself Jewish, Spielberg never glosses over the shady nature of Israel's response to the kidnappings, but he doesn't side with the Palestinians either. The terrorists are shown as brutal chancers and the other victims of the hit squad are simply targets, not martyrs.

If you look past the challenging material, this is intense human drama, perfectly captured by Bana's superb depiction of a patriot torn between his family and his country. Despite the risk of melodrama in the scenes where he justifies his job to his wife, he is strong enough to carry Spielberg's intrinsic message that conflict of this nature is futile: Victims will simply be replaced and the cycle of violence is endless.

There are some annoyances  The squad moves from inept amateurism to polished assassination machine in the time it takes to pepper an elderly gentleman with bullets in a Rome elevator shaft  but one cannot really fault the casting, especially, the spellbinding Ciaran Hinds who has gone from ham-actor extraordinaire in the bloated TV series Rome, to this terrifically controlled performance as ""cleaner"" Carl. Geoffrey Rush and Michael Lonsdale round off a mature ensemble and, despite the nature of the film, the violence and the gun-toting, the emphasis is not on gung-ho action, but on its consequences.

You cannot make a film like this without accusations of bias or glib preaching, but Spielberg has managed to counter these with a balanced, dignified endorsement of peace. That he has also made an enormously entertaining and challenging movie is a considerable achievement.

21 November 2021,A Remarkable Movie,"There is something about Steven Spielberg when he make a serious movie, it didn't feel like it was his movie, from the atmosphere, tension, and the look of the movie, example: Schindler's List, The Color Purple, Always, Empire Of The Sun, Saving Private Ryan, etc, compare to a very Spielberg movie like ET, Hook, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, etc, and Munich is definitely one of those Spielberg movie that it's serious, dark, intense, yet it's brilliant, incredible, and amazing, Munich is a precious of time and a Remarkable movie.

10 January 2006,Spielberg Is Back At Directing Good Films.,"The year is 1972 and Palestinian terrorist have eleven Israeli hostages from the Olympcis in Munich. After a shootout and explosions, the deaths of the Israeli Olympians send shock waves through the nation. Avner, an Israeli Mossad officer is given the task of killing those responsible for Munich. Avner and his team begin their mission and it costs them more then they could have expected.

Spielberg's last couple of films have been sub-par at best and seems funny to me that this wave of lackluster films started off as crap and ended off as crap. Both A.I. and War of the Worlds were not of Spielberg's caliber, but now he has made his best film since Saving Private Ryan and is back at directing good films.

Munich is an intense film, it has haunting images, especially the opening segments with the terrorist taking the Israeli hostages. Unlike most films today, Munich is grounded. When people are shot, you see it's grittiness, people don't fly backwards. It's message of violence never solves anything is evident in the film's own violence. From being stabbed in the face with a butcher knife, to being shot in the throat naked. Munich does not go light on the realism of violence.

Bana leads the cast with a great performance, much better then his previous efforts Hulk and Troy, even if he was the best thing in Troy. One scene that connects with the audience is when Bana is talking to his daughter on the phone, when his child says ""dada"" for the first time, the tears of joy and fear are immediately brought to Bana's eyes. He is overjoyed with the fact that he hears his daughter and she knows it's her father, but also fears that if he continues on with the mission, he may never be able to see her. Beautifully done scene, Bana expresses his emotions perfectly and Spielberg captures it all on screen.

Spielberg's last few films have been below his level of directing, War of the Worlds, The Terminal, and Catch Me If You Can were decent films, but not of Spielberg's usual caliber. With Munich Spielberg has directed his best film since Saving Private Ryan. Straight from the start we see the talent of Spielberg as he inter-cuts the actual events of the hostage situation and what Spielberg has recreated. The film runs 163 minutes long, but Spielberg's style is gripping enough to keep us wanting more. Spielberg's visual style is back, with Bana going through the difficulty of his first kill, the blood mixing with the milk from the groceries the victim was carrying is horrifying. Spielberg handles a difficult subject very well showcasing the faults of both sides.

The films faults are few, but the are faults that effect the film nonetheless. The Twin Towers and the sex scene at the end. To me it felt like a Gatorade commercial, with Bana's sweat flying all over the place. You knew that Spielberg was going to inter-cut this scene with the massacre of the hostages and it doesn't fit too well. Running fifteen some odd minutes short of three hours, Munich does drag in some scenes, but others are so intense, that it makes up for it.

The film is controversial and will challenge you to think if what they did was justified. You can make your own judgement on that, but we see the horrors that plague Bana after his mission was ""over"". Trying to cope with his ordinary life with his family, looking over his soldier for somebody that may have a target on him. Paraniod and Depressed is how he feels after his actions, not being able to sleep, always looking out his window. Whether you can connect with it's characters or not, you have to give sympathy for the hardships that he had to endure, and will endure.

In Munich we get a glimpse of what Bond will look like in the upcoming Casino Royale. As Spielberg gives Craig a silenced handgun, it screams bond and was humorous to see. You may not cry at this film, but you will be changed in some way. It's intensity and message is conveyed clearly and will affect those we see this film. Steven Spielberg creates a film that has impressive acting, beautiful visuals and a tight script which all make Munich a perfect choice for a Best Picture Nominee at the Oscars.",8

22 August 2006,Simply another masterpiece.,"It is quite safe to say that ""Münich"" is among the five best movies that Mr. Spielberg made till date. With a topic shockingly relevant even after thirty-three years, Spielberg reaches out to both emotion and judgement of the audience. The main four reasons behind his achievement? The film's screenplay, cinematography, acting and of course his own trademark serious yet visually appealing style of direction.

Israel security officer Avner is assigned to conduct a secret government operation to kill eleven Palestinian high officials after eleven Israeli athletes were murdered in 1972 Olympic Games. He gets aided by four teammates with four entirely different characters. They travel to several European and Mediterranean countries in order to do so. The film effectively portrays the basis of so-called modern terrorism and speaks against those who justify it. The biggest achievement of the film is that it doesn't take any side. There is no hero in this film. Avner questions the utility of terrorism and counter-terrorism in the end but only after he carries out his mission.

Janusz Kaminski's ever-brilliant cinematography and Spielberg's ideas effectively blend in to generate some unforgettable shots in the history of cinema. Who can forget the dramatic midnight encounter and exchange of words between Avner's team and some Palestinian agents in that old room in Athens? Or when extreme paranoia strikes Avner at a time near the end of the mission? or when he's still haunted by the Munich murders even while having sex with his wife? The use of violence in this film is graphic and shockingly realistic and none of the scenes are actually uncalled for. The film majorly becomes a character study of every different mind related to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Yet the film remains absolutely neutral... almost passive. It doesn't even shout a message like ""Terrorism is bad"" or something. One can imply anything from it.

Eric Bana plays the role of Avner with great perfection and style. He effectively catches that vital bit of determination of the character behind his gentle and calm demeanor. Geoffrey Rush also deserves much praise as Avner's superior officer in the Government. Daniel Craig and the actress who played Avner's beautiful wife also did well.

While Ang Lee's work in Brokeback Mountain is passionate and personal, Spielberg's in 'Münich' is almost hard realism. Spielberg doesn't voluntarily evoke the audience's emotion by exaggerating a particular scene. But who cares? he will surely win more Oscars in upcoming years.",10

24 June 2006,a low for Spielberg,"I love Spielberg and much of his work. I first loved 'Duel' a minimalistic piece of horror in the early 70s, then he created a genre in 'Jaws', and he brought charm and sensibility in the alien stories in 'E.T.' and 'Encounter'. Later he tried to broaden his themes with 'Schindler's List' and 'Ryan' which were not masterpieces, because of the limits of Hollywood cinema approach, but yet were good films. I am afraid 'Munich' is a low.

The Israeli TV made a few series about the life and moral dilemmas of Israelis that have to fight terrorism and defend their country by using non-conventional means. I am sorry to say, but these movies realized from the Israeli perspective with tools of tele-novellas are better and more true than this movie. Moreover, a bunch of Palestinian and Israeli movies recently were much better in catching the roots of the Middle East conflict and the psychology of its players.

Much was written about the lack of authenticity in 'Munich' in re-creating the Israeli and Palestinian characters, or the numerous location mistakes. I was not that much disturbed about these aspects, but much more concerned about the lack of artistic truth. Palestinian and Isralis in the film behave in schematic way, they are represented through the stereotype view of a person remote to the conflict. The moral dilemma facing the Mossad agents is falsely represented and badly timed. The dialog in in Athens between the Israeli and the PLO agents which could have been a rare opportunity of truth is missed completely and turned into some kind of TV-like debate. At best the film looks like a routine international thriller, at worst it is close to the ridicule, when it tries to fake 'deepness' in rendering the nightmare of the terrorist acts in badly staged black&white flashbacks, or the sex scenes which try to be maybe some way for the main character to consume his anger or doubts, but look just grotesque.

I hope Spielberg will overcome this low in his career, and get back to themes that he has better chances to understand or he dedicates more time and passion to really understand the issues at stake. Frankly, I miss a good dinosaurs movie.",5
18 October 2020,Wasted opportunity,"Munich was a wasted opportunity. The plot was great but the way of execution was not great. The pacing was a big problem, there were so many unnecessary scenes. Acting was good, loved them all. The script was good, adaptation was also good. The only problem I think was with movie was it's running time and the pace. Overall, it's different experience and you should give it a try. But I shall tell you that you may not want to watch it more than once.

2 November 2014,One of Steven Spielberg's best,"Many historical events around the world deserve a good adaption to the silver screen. This film does a magnificent job on portraying the 1972 Munich massacre while following up a fictional account of protagonists on their efforts to retaliate. The plot focuses on an Israeli man played Eric Bana who's assigned to set out to Germany and hunt down the eleven individuals who're responsible for the assassinations of eleven Israeli athletes, prior the Munich Olympics. The plot was very well written and the characters were brilliantly constructed. The acting was best aspect of the film, Eric Bana should have one an Oscar for his performance. He pulls off his character in a realistic way and it made the film more believable. During the assassination scenes, there is so much suspense that they would have you biting your nails.

Steven Spielberg is one of my favorite directors of all time, his movies are always satisfying experiences and this is no exception. Munich is definitely worth a try.

8 February 2006,Über Spielberg,"Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"" depicts the events starting from the assassination of Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists during the 1972 Munich Olympics. Mossad worker Avner (Eric Bana) is called to lead a group of five - getaway man Steve (new Bond Daniel Craig), cleanup man Carl (Ciarán Hinds), forger Hans (Hanns Zischler), and bomb maker Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz) - and avenge the massacre by hunting down and killing those behind the Black September attack. Aiding them from tracking the terrorists who have scattered across Europe and the Middle East is an informant named Louis, even as they find themselves targeted of assassination.

What is vengeance's worth? When is it going to end? In every war, those questions are easily generated yet hardly answered. That is, in essence, what Spielberg's latest film is about. Through its building of tension, Spielberg presents the themes of truths and paranoia through a group of hired killers, who, find themselves hunted as well. Sure there were controversies but that's enough about it.

The film itself is a visual delight. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, a staple of Spielberg films, sets most of the film in a dreamy setting with warm tones and low contrast (I am reminded of my ""sunsoft"" filter), while the score of John Williams, another Spielberg favorite, works superbly in many scenes as well.

It's not the best film of the director, though, as there were times the movie feels slow and lags at times. But the portrayal of every murder and assassination especially during the tense opening scene, and the flashbacks showing the brutal killings of the athletes, is altogether stunning. It is this force and soul that carries the film.

The actors portraying the members of the group are superb, Ayelet Zorer is brilliant as the Avner's wife, and Mathieu Amalric brings a sense of fear to his character Louis. The movie, however, obviously belongs to Bana. The former Hulk brilliantly showcases his emotional intensity and almost every scene works with Bana on screen.

""Munich"" is a gripping film that portrays the morality of the event in an unobtrusive way. It isn't perfect but you have to give it to Spielberg for having the guts to film it, and doing it in a way only he probably can.",9

23 December 2005,"Terrifying, chilling but stunningly powerful Thriller.","After delivering two disappointing flicks(Terminal/War of the worlds),Spielberg is finally back in his usual form.He is best at dramatic and intensely realistic films.And Munich is just the film that shows why he is the best in the industry.

A morality tale about vengeance and its consequences.How one's beliefs destroy another's faith.A powerful shocking drama that leaves a chilling effect on you.

It begins off with an intense situation of hostage takeover,and really gives a feeling what it is like to be taken as a hostage.I was on the edge of my seat ,it shocked me and left me disturbed of how these athletes were put into a horrifying situation and the blood bath that follows.

It's the story of how a group of men struggle to seek their revenge against a group of terrorists who murdered 11 athletes in the early 70's during the period of Olympic games in Germany.They are assigned a mission to hunt down those who were responsible and take them out one by one.But as they begin this perilous mission of vengeance,they no longer become different from their enemies and they themselves are transformed into something close to a terrorist;as all of them lose their soul and the very thing that makes them humane.Their beliefs are challenged.They question themselves for what they're doing.Why are they doing and for what?Are they even doing it for the right reason.As they approach each target ,their worlds are shattered and haunted by the bloody killings that they make.And slowly leading them into horrific consequences.

The characters are all intense.They are men put into situations they rather not be.Every target they approach leaves a shiver to them,and a chilling effect on the audiences.Every target of theirs end up in a blood splattered scene.They slowly realize that what they're doing simply causes more chaos and destruction.But it becomes too late for these men to give up as they are being haunted by all the killings.They fear the world and somehow they're being targeted.And they no longer have their souls.

This is a powerful suspense thriller that takes us a trip throughout Europe,with beautiful locations as a setting.The film is filled with stark realism to every scene.The cinematography really gives the film a docudrama look.A very violently intense thriller that will leave you with fear ,shock,dilemma and perhaps leave you feeling some sympathy for those men who are committed to something they don't really understand.The film poses very provocative questions with controversial remarks.Can there ever be peace?

Spielberg has always been a master when it comes to dark ,unsettling subjects.His approach to serious films is different from those commercial ones.When he arrives at a certain concept he really brings the best out of it.I never admired Spielberg as an artistic filmmaker.To me ,he was more of a moneymaker.But here ,he diminishes his trademarks and gets involved with a very striking subject that surely leads to controversy.I've never seen a Spielberg film this dark or graphically violent.Not even Schindler's List or Minority report were this dark.

I would simply regard this film as his most accomplished and meaningful film since Schindler's List.His most haunting and powerful film yet.Although there is a certain lack of emotion.There is not enough emotional drama than there is dramatic or violent moments.Spielberg seemed to focused more on the act of violence than how these men felt.I mean we don't see them speaking about anything but violence.How each target would be executed.But you could see that they were terrified at all times.Fear was all around them.The very first target they assassinated ,they weren't sure and were nervous about it,they almost bailed.And by the end one after another was being hunted.Avner started to get paranoid,started having nightmares,dilemma's.He was haunted by those deaths he saw and he felt guilty.He doesn't know the right meaning to his actions.Spielberg somehow takes us deep into the minds of terrorists.For once we see how they plan their attacks and bombings,and that gives a cold feeling.Shivers run down your body.

The actors work well together,and only Eric Bana gives a soulful performance.Only his character was broaden.While the rest were perfect in their roles.

Superb camera work ,giving an utterly realistic looks, Stunning in every way.The script was tightly written but the films length could've been shortened.It was simply too long.There was an excellent score to heighten the tension and emotion.

After watching this film,I would never in my wildest imaginations ,dream of becoming a spy or an assassin working for a government or whatever.I always thought it was cool and really fun.But watching this film,I realized that every second of your life is inflicted with fear.You have no control of your mind and you live in fear 24/7.Terror is what all you feel.

This film is an unforgettable,shocking ,unsettling and haunting film.A very flawed masterwork from a man who is widely respected.A very risky move made by Spielberg which has done anything but disappointed.A powerful achievement and he deserves to be praised for this film.

14 January 2022,Intelligent And Intimate Epic,"It's easy to see this as another part of Spielberg's response 9/11/01 - a kind of more cerebral one, without War Of The World's blockbuster thrills. It may well be that - but it's also a very good film in its own right, delving into the moral and political complexities of the issues at its heart. The first two-thirds of the film is excellent; the last does drag a little. Throughout its running time it does occasionally flirt with the wrong sort of sentimentality, a fault which becomes more apparent in that slower closing section. But there's no doubt this is an intelligent, gripping, intimate and well-intentioned epic that does justice to the depths of a story which it tells from just one point of view, an achievement of some note.

5 February 2006,"If you see this film, be prepared","This film is Steven Spielburg's best work since Saving Private Ryan. The story is simply amazing and the performances given are breathtaking and full of honest emotion. Quite frankly I had begun to doubt Spielburg's skills in this age of CG film making, but this film shuts me up. The story is perhaps one of the best Spielburg has brought to the screen at least since Private Ryan, it may be better. I will give one warning about the film though, don't go in and expect to leave feeling good. The film is to honest about the world for that to happen, you have to realize that what Spielburg shows you here, is not the world of the movies where their is absolute good and evil, it is more like the real world, full of its shades of gray.

2 September 2006,Unfairly criticized as anti-Israel,"Steven Spielberg drew quite a hostile reaction from many within the American Jewish community (and in Israel) for what was taken to be a criticism of Israel for its effort to kill the murderers of 11 Israeli Olympic athletes in Munich. That criticism focused chiefly on the moral doubts and nightmares suffered toward the end of the picture by the agent, Avener, (Eric Bana) sent by the Mossad to find and execute the members of Black September who had carried out the murders. At the end of the screenplay by Tony Kushner et al., Bana argues with his chief handler that the dead killers have been replaced by people who are even worse and that revenge breeds revenge and will continue forever. What is missing from the screenplay in my view is the appropriate answer to Avner's troubled view -- namely, that failure to punish terrorism will embolden Israel's enemies to continue killing Israelis and Jews all over the world. They must be made to understand that terrorism has deadly consequences for the terrorists. (That point of view is articulated to a very limited extent earlier in the film by the actress playing Golda Meir, then Israel's prime minister, who authorized the reprisals.) Steven Spielberg was so troubled by the criticism that in the DVD version of the film which my wife and I saw, he takes 10 minutes or so before the movie begins to explain why the film is NOT anti-Israel. I didn't think it was. As an ardent supporter of Israel, I had no trouble with the assassinations (now referred to as ""targeted killings"") of the Black September gang, nor did I find it troubling that Bana's character eventually cracks under the strain, having lost several of his comrades while carrying out his assignment. On a far more modest and therefore more human scale, the Israeli film ""Walk on Water"" also deals with the moral struggles of a young Israeli agent instructed to make friends with two grandchildren of a Nazi murderer in order to get to the grandfather and execute him. ""Walk on Water"" is a smaller and more personal film and the emotional effect on the Israeli agent is made more real by the fact that he comes to like the homosexual grandson (though he is prejudiced against gays at the beginning) and falls in love with the granddaughter who has chosen to expiate her country's sins against Jews by living and working on an Israeli kibbutz. The Israeli agent in Munich is under greater stress than the agent in Walk on Water because he has killed seven people and has lost several of his comrades. Yet the emotional and moral dilemmas are much the same. Is Israel justified in seeking out and killing murderers of Jews? Yes. Is it credible that an Israeli assassin would be traumatized by carrying out his assignment? Certainly. Does displaying that dilemma call into question Israel's right to revenge the death of its citizens? Not in my book. Steven Spielberg made a movie, not a propaganda film. He has made other movies that have demonstrated his firm attachment to the Jewish people. If anyone can tell me that he has killed seven people, lost comrades in doing so and been unaffected emotionally or morally, I'm prepared to listen. Otherwise, excuse me, I think this is a fine film (even though I feel Walk on Water was even better).",8
5 January 2006,Spielberg is a master storyteller,"Like the great hitchcock or kubrick spielberg has remained at the top of his game for quite some time. the man simply knows how to tell a great story. munich like pretty much every other spielberg film is a genuine masterpiece. he accomplished the 70's theme with ease it seemed, and the casting was stellar. It is Bana's best performance to date. Daniel Craig delivered a surprisingly great performance and Rush was on point as always. The gritty look of the film and kaminski's brilliant cinematography deliver one dynamite package. my only complaint is that it seemed a bit long and some of the scenes dragged on a bit. Overall a 9/10 seems like a fair vote for spielberg's Munich.

29 January 2006,This is no Sword of Gideon,"If you would like to see a good movie about the Munich tragedy I recommend Sword of Gideon. Made in 1986 for HBO it beats this movie hands down. I really cannot believe that Steven Spielberg directed Munich. He is capable of a much better movie. This movie drags. Good set decoration is no substitute for a good show. The film broke twice while we were trying to watch this thing. Turned out that was the best part of the movie. We anticipated this show for weeks as we live in a backwater. It did not open here until January 27, 2006. Glad we went to see it as now we know and don't have to guess, but we were really disappointed. Spielberg should go back and watch Duel and remember why movies are made.

2 April 2006,Most interesting movie from Spielberg since Schindlers List,"I'm no huge fan of Steven Spielberg, rather i find him a competent if rather uninteresting film-maker. Especially these past years. Now however, after seeing Munich, i had to re-evaluate my stance somewhat.

It is a brave thing Spielberg is doing in this movie. Tolerance for multiple perspectives has declined recently to say the least, and here Spielberg is presenting a movie without clear morals dealing with the touchy subjects of religion and terrorism. And in my opinion the timing is perfect. The ability to not see things in just black and white is what i feel separates intelligent people from fools, and so many people act foolish today just because they don't use that ability. What makes this movie great is the fact that Spielberg never comes even close to justifying the terror attack on the 1972 Olympics in Munich, he just asks if barbaric acts should answered in kind. A just question.

The movie itself is well made with excellent acting. Great thought must have gone into the casting process and what we get is near perfection. Eric Bana is excellent as is the rest of his team of assassins. The technical qualities of the movie are excellent, achieving a very 70's feel. But of course the story is the star here and this is by far the most interesting movie from Spielberg since Schindler's List. Unfortunately for him the race for the Oscars was tight this time around with loads of worthy entries, otherwise this would have been a clear-cut contender for several awards.",8
30 December 2005,Spielberg's Best Film Since Schindler's List!,"Steven Spielberg's 'Munich' is not so much a political thriller as it is a wrenching human drama. Those who go to see the film specifically expecting it to take either the Israeli or Palestinian side will come out either disappointed or angry. The film is arguing from an Israeli perspective but is severely critical of Israeli policy all the way. What the film, ultimately, is arguing against is meeting acts of terrorism and violence with more terrorism and violence. Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner also are arguing from the perspective that if one intends to solve the problem of terrorism, one must look at the actual causes of terrorism and keep your pride and nationalism in check. The film's message is one that strikes a chord in a post 9/11 world.

The plot of 'Munich' follows Israel's response to the killing of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Germany at the hands of Palestinian terrorists. The Eric Bana character, who works for Mossad, is assigned to lead a team of four people who will track down those responsible for masterminding the killings in Munich and use whatever methods necessary to eliminate them. Some people have objected to the very idea of portraying assassins as anything but people who bravely and boldly follow their orders for the sake of their nation's security. What Spielberg rightly does instead is humanize the assassins and portray them as people who have fears and doubts as all the rest of us do. (*small spoiler warning*) What is so masterful about the film is the way we get to know these characters and the way their confidence in the mission slowly dissolves. The assassins begin to realize the futility in carrying out their mission as they see how their terrorist targets merely get replaced by other terrorists. When all is said and done, they realize, nothing gets accomplished.

As usual from a Spielberg film, 'Munich' is an incredibly well-made production with stunning camera-work and cinematography. John Williams' score is haunting and brooding and the acting is impeccable (Eric Bana deserves an Oscar nomination). The screenplay gives weight and dimension to all the characters as we see their disillusionment slowly sink in. 'Munich' is incredibly powerful and moving, a film that will shake you to the core. It is Spielberg's strongest production since Schindler's List and is as equally passionate as well. That people can still criticize Spielberg for being timid, melodramatic, and overly sentimental is ludicrous. This film is an act of courage and bravery and shows Spielberg at his absolute best. Here, he shows himself as a director in complete control of his vision. Bravo, Mr. Spielberg!

I award 'Munich' a 10/10. It is also the best film I have seen in 2005.",10
7 February 2006,Between Vengeance and Justice,"""Munich"" is Steven Spielberg's offering, hoping to tell the story of Black September, a Palestinian terrorist group that triggered a tragedy at the Munich Olympic games of 1972. The attack led to the deaths of eleven Israelis. This led to bloody government-sanctioned retaliation. Eric Bana plays Avner Kaufman, a Mossad agent appointed as leader to a group of men charged with hunting down the terrorists of Black September. The story is bloody, and does not pull any punches. Bana gives a good performance, showing Avner's descent into paranoia. The viewer gets a real sense of what Avner is going through, after overseeing one assassination after another. ""Munich"" is a dark but story for our time, or for any other.

11 October 2008,Underrated Steven Spielberg movie,"Munich (2005, Dir. Steven Spielberg)

In 1972, 11 Israeli athletes were murdered at the Munich Olympics. Following this event, five men, including Avner (Bana) and Steve (Craig) are assigned the job of assassinating those men responsible for the Munich massacre of '72.

Underrated Steven Spielberg directed movie which combines the suspense created with the acting talents of its cast. Takes a while for the story to get going and the running time could have been cut down slightly, but is still an enjoyable movie, whether you know the history of the Munich massacre of not.

Look at the waistline bulge on that guy. Look at that. Think he might be armed, eh?  Steve (Daniel Craig)

12 February 2006,ever a loaded issue,"OK. We should all know by now that the situation in Israel/Palestine is a loaded issue: no matter what you say about it, someone's bound to take offense. In the post-September 11 world, it would seem virtually impossible to take a balanced look at terrorism.

Surprisingly, ""Munich"" manages to do so. Focusing on some Israeli agents given the assignment of killing the Palestinians who assassinated the Israeli Olympic team in 1972. Led by Avner (Eric Bana), they travel all over Europe to track down the men. But after a while, Avner begins to have misgivings about the whole mission: every time you kill a terrorist, you create another.

The movie also lets us hear the Palestinian side. One man explains that the Palestinians have been a displaced people for over twenty years. Of course the Zionists claim that they never had a country to begin with.

So overall, I will assert that Steven Spielberg has made an acceptable movie.",7

13 March 2008,Masterpiece,"Munich (2005)

**** (out of 4)

Steven Spielberg's brilliant film telling the story of what happened after the 1972 Olympics is a sad, depressing and incredibly violent film that hopefully people will go see. I know there's all sorts of controversy already surrounding this film and while I do think the film favors the Israeli's there's no doubt its message hits right at home without being preaching and without Spielberg adding a B.S. happy ending like he's done throughout his career. Spielberg is being very brave here in how he tackles the revenge subject and especially in the way he shows the violence. Again, had this not been Spielberg the film probably would have gotten a NC-17 rating because of the gore and violence but not once is it shown in a stylish way or in a way trying to make it look like a good thing. The film starts off depressing and Spielberg keeps it that way all the way till the ending. The performances by the entire cast are wonderful and the film hits on all levels. A crowning achievement for Spielberg, which is a lot better than Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. My father loved this one as well.",

11 February 2006,"Pointless, one-dimensional and sentimental","I found this film to be an attempt to intellectualise revenge, and the role of one man within the cogs of the vengeful machine (might he just crack up, whaddyathink?!). Kill Bill was much the same, but that at least had panache and great direction!! If Munich is 'based on true events' as it says, then it needs to do a whole lot more justice to BOTH sides of this particular tale. It seems to me to be a film which, although it fails to thoroughly glorify Mossad, it certainly allows them a fair share of understanding. Meanwhile, the Palestinians are merely 'terrorists' - very simplistic.

Sadly, I was really disappointed by Spielberg's take on this subject.

6 March 2006,powerful work,"Avner calls home to hear his wife's voice and check on his daughter who he has only seen once, because he is off killing people. She is learning to talk now and over the phone she utters ""dada"". Avner begins to cry. Because of this scene, Munich is the only 2005 film so far to make me cry.

The film is heartbreaking, powerful, devastating, and suspenseful. It is by far one of the best films of the year. But then again, what do you expect form the great Spielberg. He presents us a film that keeps us at the edge of our seats hating the main characters because of there crimes against nature yet sympathizing for them and hoping they pull off their mission.

Everyone in this film is bringing there all especially Ciarán Hinds and Mathieu Amalric. Hinds countenance in every scene gives us a character who is mysterious and we want to learn all about and when he succumbs to his final destination, the audience is heartbroken. Amalric on the other hand is one of the best villains of the year. The great thing about this performance because ALvin knows he's tricky but he must use him to complete the mission.

There is one line in the film that stand out as the theme of the film and a theme of life itself: ""All this blood comes back to us."" And indeed it does. Consider the scene where Alvin and Steve go after Salamah but karma ends up screwing up the mission.

As I said, the film is a powerful piece of work with great camera work, performances, and direction. It is a yet another masterpiece to add to Spielbergs resume. Well done to all!",10
9 April 2007,An Fantastic Film,"I think that ""Munich"" is one of the best Spielberg Films. I think that's the second, after ""Schindler's list"". The Soundtrack is wonderful, from the master John Williams. Eric Bana gives a memorable and stellar performance. Daniel Craig, Geofrey Rush, Mathieu Kaswowitz are so good and credible. The film has a good screenplay. It has a good film editing. When you see the film, you believe that you're in the 70s, because the decoration and the clothes are in a fantastic adaptation. I think that the film isn't slow, it has action and emotion all the time. Spielberg knows, how do a masterpiece. It's one of my favorite directors of all time. My hope for the Oscars 2005 (best film)was : 1.Munich or Crash 2.Brokeback Mountain 3.Capote 4.Good night and good luck

""Munich"" it's a masterpiece for ever and one of my favorites films. It's a great, fantastic, wonderful, amazing film. 10/10

22 January 2006,Failed opportunity to illuminate Palestinian terrorism; instead we mainly get James Bond redux,"Docudrama about the Israeli-sponsored counter-terrorism team assembled (with the blessings of Golda Meir, Israel's Prime Minister at the time) to retaliate against the Palestinian terrorists and their co-conspirators responsible for slaying 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team and staff at the 1972 Munich Olympiad. The screenplay - by resident Broadway genius Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, who also wrote ""Forrest Gump,"" ""The Horse Whisperer"" and ""The Insider"" - is based on a book by George Jones, entitled ""Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team.""

Ever the entertainer, first and foremost, Steven Spielberg gives us no insights about the causes of Palestinian or Islamic terrorism, but, rather, a high intensity, slick action movie on the order of the James Bond flicks. We even have a bomb maker who creates too cute, one of a kind, overly gimmicky devices tailored unnecessarily for each assassination, just like the lethal toymakers in the Bond stories. (Maybe it really happened that way; my point is, why did Spielberg dwell on such techie details when there were more weighty issues to address?) The pace is fast, and as the team take out one anonymous, one dimensional bad guy after another, with ingenious methods and plenty of risk-based tension, I could not resist being caught up in the excitement of blood sport on display here.

As for more serious geopolitical subtexts, we do get misgivings expressed about the whole notion of revenge embodied by this team - an eye for an eye, Talion Law, the Code of Hammurabi, the raison d'etre for their lethal mission. Occasional doubts about the mission do furl the brow of the serious minded Avner (Eric Bana), recruited from within Mossad, Israel's CIA, to lead the team, but only in passing. His ambivalence seems easily patched up. The bigshots behind the mission  people like Mrs. Meir (Lynn Cohen) and the team's Mossad supervisor, Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush)  have no doubts at all that history and God are on their side.

The other four team members are an interesting lot, but we really don't get to know them all that well, even in the expanse of 2 hours, 44 minutes film running time. The chief trigger man, Steve, is played by a coolly psychopathic, baby blue eyed Daniel Craig (Ted Hughes in Sylvia; the latest actor to be anointed for the James Bond series role). Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz) is the bomb maker, recruited for this task because of credentials that are at best equivocal: he was formerly a toy maker and bomb dismantler. Turns out that some of his devices are too powerful, causing collateral damage. Carl (Ciaran Hinds) is an expert in obliterating evidence, traces of the team members' identities. Hans (Hanns Zischler) is a master document forger. The group wine and dine their way around Europe in elegant circumstances between assassinations, another Bond-like touch, however true it may have been.

A fascinating side story here concerns a Paris-based Mafia-like family that indulges in espionage and other dirty tricks for hire. Avner contacts a son, Louis (Mathieu Amalric) and pays handsomely ($100K per person) for information on the whereabouts of people the team wants to take out. Louis eventually takes a blindfolded Avner to meet the family's leader, Louis's father, called simply ""Papa"" (Michael Lonsdale), a stout avuncular fellow who takes a liking to Avner that stirs jealous sentiments within Louis. The world of this amoral French crime family would serve as excellent fare for expanded treatment, perhaps in some other film.

Just in recent months we have witnessed an rapidly emerging and maturing cinema of contemporary terrorism (""The War Within,"" ""Paradise Now,"" ""The Friend,"" ""Syriana""), to which ""Munich"" adds something, but not a lot. To be sure, the violent practice of Talion law still dominates relations between Israel and Palestine. And, at one point in the film, Louis plays a fiendish little trick on Avner and his mates. They are put up in a safe house in Arab territory, Yemen as I recall. Late in the evening, in troup another gang also instructed to use the same safe house. They are Arab terrorists. A long, tense, guns-drawn moment ensues, but the situation is defused when Avner's team passes itself off as a leftist German terror cell (think Bader-Meinhoff or Red Brigade). An intriguing discussion between Avner and the Arab team leader follows, about the historic inevitability of their causes. The Arab leader says that Islam will prevail against the West, even if it takes 100 years.

This is one of the film's best scenes. But much of ""Munich"" seems like a throwback, a film that would have been more timely in the 1980s perhaps, but less so now. The hit team's targets are people we never meet or learn about only superficially. We don't know why they did what they did to contribute to ""Black September."" It is unfortunate that with the immense resources at his disposal, Mr. Spielberg could not have reached for something less showy, more edifying to our understanding of the dynamics of contemporary terrorism. My rating: 7.5/10 (low B+). (Film seen 01/09/06). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.",8
23 February 2006,A review from France,"First of all, I do not know when the Hollywood guys would get the point, that in France and above all in Paris we do not listen to Edith Piaf while driving cars.

The funniest part of the movie was the scene where the Mossad guy while making love to his wife thinks of PLO terrorists getting killed. Makes me think of supposedly Woody Allen's advice : « To forestall an orgasm I think of my bills ».

As a action movie, this was better than Minority Report and the War of the Worlds. The latter, I suspect was made by the CGI guys while Steven was taking a nap in his ranch.

The action scenes were wonderfully shot and some night scenes made me think of Collateral.

Well that's it. It just stays as a a good thriller. Political message ? You must be kidding. The Farelly brothers's movies carry better drama and psychology.

Eastwood like Spielberg is a good action-movie director. But Eastwood seems to have matured better like a good Bordeaux.",1
26 February 2006,Wow!!!,"The Godfather used to be my favorite film. Well, that is no longer true, now that I have seen Munich, Steven Spielberg's newest film.

In 1972, 11 Israeli athletes about to compete in the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany were taken hostage. When Israel tried to retaliate, all 11 were killed. This is the true story of what happened next. 5 men were given one order; to kill all 11 people who were involved in the Munich massacre.

Going back to The Godfather, Munich was lighted very much the same. Was it an accident or was Spielberg trying to say that the people doing the executions were just as bad as the mafia? Anyway, the direction was beautiful and some parts made my heart pound, it was so intense.

This was the only movie that has ever made me want to cry. It is just so powerful, especially because it is so true. It creates many moral questions that you and the characters will have to ask yourself. Is is right to follow violence with violence. Is what Avner (Eric Bana) and his crew are doing morally right. Well, you'll have to figure it out yourself. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!

Final Verdict: 5/5 stars",9

20 April 2007,Spielberg at the top of his game,"ET wanted to go home, and Elliot missed having a father. In Jaws, the father wants to find his son. In Minority Report, the Dad wants to find his son, ditto the Dad in War of the Worlds, and the Mum in Close Encounters. In Terminal, Tom Hanks wants to go home. In Saving Private Ryan, they want to bring the son home to his mother. Spielberg unashamedly explores the same theme of family and belonging in the vast majority of his movies. Sometimes he gets it spectacularly right - ET; at other times it falls flat on its face - AI. In Munich, his passion for this theme reaches its crescendo as he flawlessly blends the micro and the macro: the Israelis as children looking for their lost home (mirrored by the displaced Palestinians), and Avner roaming the globe but longing to be with his wife and daughter. What makes Munich such a special cinematic experience is that Spielberg manages to hold in check the sentimentality that so damages his other work. In Minority Report, Samantha Morton gives a speech to Tom Cruise about all the possible futures his son could have had, an embarrassing gush of sentimental tripe. But in Munich, Avner breaks ranks to be with his wife when she gives birth, but his sentimental words are undercut by her teasing; the scene plays out realistically, touchingly, and devoid of sentimentality. It is almost a post-modern apology from Spielberg for the excesses of previous work. There isn't a missed beat in Munich. My God, those transitions - the attention to detail is breath-taking.

I was struck watching Spielberg on The Actors' Studio when he said that he is aware of Spielberg the icon, an entity separate from himself, that people criticise or deify, but that as Spielberg the man he is removed from that and suffers over every film. That is reassuring to hear from the most successful and celebrated filmmaker of our times. Clearly Munich is a result of this process of reflection and self-doubt. The day Spielberg relaxes, film-making will suffer. Long may the rigour and self-examination that produced Munich continue.",10

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg.

A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution.

Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill.

1 March 2006,all the boredom of a documentary without the historical truth,"This film has the feeling of a documentary. It has the kinds of extraneous details and odd occurrences that documentary makers leave in their films to give you a fuller history.

Unfortunately, the consensus from historians and intelligence experts seems to be that Munich is neither accurate nor plausible. It neither shows what really happened, nor even a competent construction of what might have happened. So when you strip away the value of learning true history, what is left? Not much.

A large part of the film has to do with mundane details of an intelligence operation. This would be interesting if these details were accurate, but since they aren't, its hard to see why anyone would care about them.

Another major part has to do with the relationship of the main character with a criminal he uses to get the job done. Again, this is all made up, so it doesn't tell you anything historical about how criminals and intelligence agents cooperated in the 70's.

What's left are the ""issues"". The two issues are whether terrorism is moral and whether killing terrorists is moral. But the movie doesn't really bring any new ideas to the debate. It doesn't even do a good job of exploring the obvious ideas.

If you are willing to accept that this film will teach you nothing factual about the history, nor will it explore the politics, but are hoping for at least an interesting story, you won't find it. As far as revenge movies go, this one is totally boring.

I wish all the theaters that showed ""Munich"" had instead shown ""Walk on Water,"" an Israeli film about a modern Mossad assassin who kills terrorists. ""Walk on Water"" never claims to be anything but fiction, but it explores the issues of justice, revenge, and morality with more truth than ""Munich"" does. ""Walk on Water"" also has real characters and a good story, both of which ""Munich"" lacks.

""Walk on Water"": http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0352994/",1
9 November 2006,shameless state-sponsored propaganda,"taken as just a technical achievement this film was nice and slick eye-candy. Sadly good eye-candy is a great vehicle for effective propaganda. Let's see if I understand the message of this film correctly: Arab nationalism = bad. Jewish nationalism = good. Arab/ Palestinian terrorism = bad. Jewish terrorism = good.

If you doubt the overt racist tone of this film, watch it again and insert ""white, Aryan, or Arab"" every time you hear ""Jew"" and see if you find it acceptable. I believe most people would picket a film depicting the racial or religious superiority of Aryan Christians or Arabs Muslims. A good example is when on character utters the line ""the only blood that matters to me is Jewish blood"". Insert any other race or religion into that sentence and most would call that overt racism.

I kept waiting for Spielberg to give us at least 1 sympathetic Arab character. The only Arabs we see are militant, hateful,reactionary fighters, or pseudo intellectuals who articulate a very simplified version of the Arab/Israeli conflict.

One Spielberg tactic of late seems to be this formula: one of the heroes, an intellectual, is slightly sympathetic to the humanity of the enemy. Said sympathetic character then dies or pays dearly for his foolish sympathies. Message: kill when you have the chance without hesitation. Forgiveness, understanding, and compromise are foolish ideals. Barbaric, ruthless acts are the real mechanisms of justice.

When your message is just blind nationalism, you can twist a film to glorify anything as necessary to preserve the race or homeland. I thought it was particularly disgusting to make an almost messiah type character of Eric Bana as he discusses his situation with his mom. Once again the Holocaust is dragged out to justify the barbaric acts of the films heroes, only in this case our ""messiah's"" message is the cliché ""never again"". This is a shameless effort to tie all of Israel's actions back to the Holocaust and attempt to justify the highest degree of hate, violence, and overt racism by claiming supreme victim status.

I hope people recognize this film for what it is: a slick propaganda film designed to prop up the ongoing Israeli atrocities and vilification of the Palestinian population.",1

13 August 2010,"Compels you to ask all the right questions, as opposed to force-feeding you easy answers","I have not read the novel that this is based upon, but it is worth noting that while it has been attacked, it has never been discredited. This isn't a documentary, it is a dramatization; still, the level of detail is high and the realism is through the roof. You do need to possess a basic insight into the Israel/Palestinian conflict, and it's a good thing to know some of the important people back then who were involved in it. The version I watched was 150 minutes sans credits, and worth every moment. This is incredibly gripping, and astonishingly intense. The action is photographed and edited to be chaotic(think Saving Private Ryan), and this neither glorifies nor bastardizes the events that it shows. Every acting performance is spot-on; Bana is stunning. The dialog is well-written and natural, and the camaraderie between the members of the main group is convincing and subtly developed(as such, no character feels one-note or flat, even if they can't flesh them all out extensively). This is psychologically accurate, dealing with what happens to people when they kill other humans. It doesn't take sides and goes into the gray areas, and there are discussion(one is particularly unforgettable) in this that provide plenty of food for thought. This does not decide what is correct. Instead, each viewer will by themselves have to ponder... was it justice or revenge? Was it right to do? And is anything resolved? There is a moderate amount of bloody and gory violence and disturbing content and a little full frontal female nudity and mild sex. The DVD comes with a single featurette(making that menu seem superfluous), entitled Munich: The Mission, The Team(I will review it on its own page here on the site), and a 4 and a half minute intro by Spielberg which is well worth the time. I recommend this to anyone that cares about the situation between the Jews and the Arabs. 8/10",8

13 January 2023,When the sports world changed,"The Summer Olympic Games were underway in the first week of September 1972. The Olympic Games were generally a joyous time of sportsmanship and competition. However, in this Olympics the world was changed when terrorists from the Black September group managed to infiltrate the Olympic village. They took 9 members of the Israeli Olympic team hostage and killed two others in the process. The terrorists demanded the release of over two hundred of their jailed comrades and flight out of what was then Munich, West Germany. The German officials attempted a rescue of the hostages, but the result was that all nine hostages were killed. Three of the terrorists survived.

As a consequence of this event, the Israeli government authorized what they referred to as Operation Wrath of God. The security forces were told to hunt down and kill all people involved in planning the attack. This movie is a rendition of the actions of the Israeli team of agents that engaged in the killings.

This is a tense movie and to the extent that it is possible, shows the events in a reasonable approximation to what actually happened. There were five members of the Israeli team from disparate backgrounds. The events of the taking of the hostages up to when they were killed is shown in flashback snippets, with the allegation that West German authorities bungled the rescue attempt not appearing until very late in the movie.

The very brutal world of tit-for-tat terrorist acts between the Israelis and the Palestinians in the seventies is very much a part of the plot. Some of the violence is very graphic, but the turmoil felt by the agents is also an integral part of the story. Most of the people they kill are very respectable looking, totally outside the mold of the wild-eyed pistol waver. As they take care of their targets, there is a great deal of concern expressed by the team members as to whether they are really making a difference, wondering whether they were simply escalating the terrorist violence.

This is a great movie, worthy of the accolades it received. However, if you do not understand the basic history of the event, reaching the proper level of historical significance of the events may not be possible.",10

13 April 2006,Another Masterpiece,"Munich came to the theaters only last week and I planned with a friend to go and watch it but he bailed out on me but I went regardless.

First of all lets just say everything about this movie is immaculate to the point of it being remarkably beautiful. The acting, the screening of the tragic events or even just the backdrop was utterly amazing. It has a very liquid like flow to it from beginning to end. This has to be one of the best and powerful films this year with strong performances by Eric Bana and Daniel Craig. Munich had me on the edge of the seat right up to the end and I was disappointed when the Credits started rolling since I didn't want the movie to end - but all good things have to come to an end right?

Just when I thought Steven Spielberg was slacking off a bit he delivers this little gem. Awesome....to put it in a word.

11 October 2018,A Heavy Experience,"Back in 2005, I was a bit young for a movie like this, and when I eventually got around to it, I couldn't say that I enjoyed it that much. I think it was purely because Spielberg directed it that I decided to watch it. The violence was glaringly realistic and in your face. There was little that reminded you that this was a ""Spielberg movie"". For me, it was just a ""heavy experience"". I *will* give credit to Eric Bana, who I thought did some amazing acting in this! It was just... really... an unpleasant movie, in my opinion, and I wish I could appreciate it more. 3/10

7 November 2006,The morality of assassins killing assassins,"This film is Steven Spielberg's take on the moral dilemma faced by assassins killing for the sake of their country's morale. If the protagonist was played by a better actor, it might have worked, but the film lacks spark and drags on much too long.

Avner, played by Eric Bana (The Hulk), is a Mossad agent who quits to head a secret unit of assassins being sent to Europe to hunt down the people responsible for the killings of the Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972. Avner's motives for joining the unit are vague. He appears to passively accept his assignment and doesn't express much enthusiasm for revenge, so when he later begins feeling guilty about the killings, it's hard to understand where this emotion comes from. Bana has to carry the movie to make it work and he's just overwhelmed by better actors playing supporting roles.

Michael Lonsdale and Mathieu Amalric are memorable as the father/son combination heading a group of free-lance agents operating out of Paris. Geoffrey Rush is excellent as Avner's Israeli handler. Daniel Craig, the new James Bond, appears as one of the Israeli assassins. Ciarán Hinds also turns in a fine performance as another one of the assassins.

""Munich"" is not one of Spielberg's best efforts. Usually, he draws the viewer into his films by way of emotional attachment to the characters, but with the lead player being a bit of a cypher, it just doesn't work. Still, it's entertaining and worth watching.",7
15 December 2005,Spielberg's Best,"I saw Munich last night at a screening in Hollywood with a Q&A after with some of the production team. If you are old enough to remember the Palestinian terrorists attack during the 1972 Munich Olympics you will remember the emotions you felt when you see this film. The filmmakers have put up on the screen the world of 1972. Rick Carter, Janusz Kaminski, Joanna Johnston and their teams have once again created a world the actors can inhabit, can live and die in. The sound design was breathtaking. The audience and I were fully involved in the film. I looked around a few times and saw a lot of people sitting literally on the edge of their seats leaning towards the screen. As to it's political content I am sure it will inspire a lot of conversations. Steven Spielberg once again seems to have allowed his crew's to do their jobs and what we get to see up on the screen shows his trust was well placed. I am personal so glad to see Mr. Spielberg and the rest of the producers take a chance on a film that will be controversial and will make people think and talk, thanks.

2 February 2006,South-African accents !! (& other observations),"There seems to be a lot of blathering about this film's topicality... Yes, Hamas won, YESYESYES the world is going to end..... Well done to Steven Spielberg for releasing the film now (obviously a calculated box-office move) My critique is - slightly - different (I am not going to bore you with questionable information or ""leaked"" documents about the ""FACTS"" or with some tired pro-or anti- Israel rant).

Spielberg was either confused, thoughtless or lazy with the Daniel Craig character, a South-African-Afrikaans-Blonde-Blue-Eyed-Zionist-Assassin (phew!). EXTREMELY improbable. With a film that claims to be as resonant and is as ""messagy"" as ""Munich"" does, he can't afford to make (BIG) mistakes like this.

I think it comes down to this: Americans (for whom this film was primarily made) don't know what a ""Jewish South-African"" would look or sound like. Nor would most of the world. They might have SOME (vague) idea of what a ""White South-African from the 1970's"" looks like: a blonde haired- blue eyed, violent, chunky lookin' fella with a thick, gruff Apartheidy-type ""Afrikaans"" accent. Jewish South-Africans were classed as ""White"" in South-Africa under the old dispensation.

So, in my view, Spielberg merely subsumed ""South-African Jewishness"", an entirely unknown type in the realm of the International Cineplex, under the International Stereotype of ""White Oppressive Afrikanerdom"", a recognizable, almost ""parodic"" category. This is troubling for reasons I won't get into here but which should be obvious. Spielberg has sacrificed sense in favour of easy intelligibility or, rather, recognizability for his audience.

Or maybe Daniel Craig is just a rubbish, crass, nuance-less actor who, here, gives a broad, obvious performance? No, this is harsh. I think it calamity is the fault of Steven Spielberg, an arch-enemy of nuanced cinema. This is a calculated, but lazy, move on his part.

Same goes for the accents, generally, in this film. Wouldn't Israeli Jews (Avner, his wife, P.M. Golda Meir & her officials, etc.) speak in Hebrew amongst themselves & not in broken English? (But subtitles for monolingual Americans is box-office poison, right?) Anyway, to start on this would drag into question a number of (improbable & impossible) things about this film that irk me These include that senseless flashback to the massacre from Avner's perspective. He wasn't there, so Spielberg has to make a narrative booboo in his quest to FORCE us, to COERCE us into caring. He exonerates and whitewashes all of Avner's ethical self-questioning - that we've had to sit through for the duration of the movie - by showing us the disparity between the Israeli group's ethical action, their patriotic, hence ""necessary"" crimes, as opposed to the ""Arab"" group's heinous, brutal, senseless crime. Why does doesn't Spielberg ""flash back"" to some of Avner's sins? Because that would tarnish his ""hero"" status and Spielberg wouldn't have a -RA-RA-, rousing ending. In Spielberg's worldview, it seems, there needs to be a hero. For all the film's ""Violence is not the right way"", ""violence begets violence"" rhetoric, for all Spielberg's claims to equivalence, to ""showing both sides"", we are never in any doubt as to who is RIGHT, morally and ethically justified. And anyway; ""Homely"", self-searching assassins who dine and laugh with one another; their common, self-less cause? Ahem... Assassins need to be clinical, exacting, to negate conscience. That wouldn't fit in with Spielberg's project: we HAVE to like them, we MUST care for them, believe in their JUSTNESS & it it is they that are invested with conscience & high-mindedness, not the other side (Avner's shakiness on the first kill; they only kill their targets & there's a big, sweaty, tense moral cadenza when this goes wrong; the ""What have we done"" speeches, etc.

If you haven't guessed by now, I HATE this film: It is far too shallow and insubstantial; its argument is simplistic (witness ""Golda Meir's"" ""grandmotherly"" proclamations & the silly scene between Avner and a Palestinian); its message is clunky and hollow; its perspective on ""THE SITUATION"" is utterly conventional & bland. It is not nearly as controversial as some people seem to think it is (or it wouldn't have been nominated for a ""respectable"" Oscar).

It DOES contain a few nice cinematic touches, amongst other details, but on the whole: ""so what?"".

This is a conventionally thrilling ""Boy's Movie"" badly melded onto a ""real life"" or ""topical"" situation. The film shows the limitations of Hollywood's narrative conventions (finely honed & market researched ""frivolous entertainment"") when dealing with ""serious"" global, political subject matter.

Anyway, suffice to say that Spielberg is cleaver to explicitly preface his film with a ""BASED on real events"". He should start, if he can, making films for grown-up people.",4
10 July 2006,great movie,"this movie doesn't have greatness written all over it like other highly publicized movies, but for 2+ hours, you can't think about anything else but what's going on on the screen in front of you. It really gets under your skin. I don't know how. The direction is amazing. You cannot watch this movie wtih kids running around or the phone is ringing. You really have to give it the time of the day. I really liked this movie. I recommend it to any movie buff. It is important during the whole movie to stay impartial and do not take sides so you wouldn't ruin the movie for you. And to be fair, the movie was, to a certain extent, objective. Although over did it a little bit with the Jewish morals but still, not too much.

24 February 2006,"A heavy, thought-provoking and inspired Spielberg film but a little wavey","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits

A true story from Steven Spielberg, depicting the massacre at the 1972 Munich Olympics by Palestinian fundamentalists of Israli athletes and the subsequent and immediate backlash by the Israeli authorities who wanted swift retribution for the atrocity.

On the day I went to see Munich, I'd had to get up a bit earlier than I usually would to go to a (distant) relative's funeral in the morning and I'd travelled straight from there to another destination up to see it, so maybe that had worn me out a bit, or maybe I just wasn't in the right frame of mind to sit through it on the day, but either way after about two thirds of the way through this 164 minute Spielberg saga, I must admit I found myself nodding off for a little while. Or maybe it was just that, despite the thought-provoking and inspired subject matter, Munich could emerge as a fairly boring film in parts, which is a bit of a problem for films this long. I'd sat through and enjoyed a similar sort of film from Spielberg, Schindler's List, which I ended up rating as one of the best films I'd ever seen, but I was able to see that at my own leisure on video, unlike Munich.

In between making big special effects filled blockbusters like War of the Worlds and Jurassic Park, Spielberg likes to make more deep and meaningful stuff like this and Schindler's List as well, making him a varied sort of film-maker. I admire him for this and like to try and give more credit to this sort of work than his cinematic eye-candy stuff. But I just didn't see Munich as a perfect work.

Maybe there wasn't enough humour and light-heartedness in it, maybe there is something morally black about the story. It certainly has a strong cast to guide it, in the shape of Eric Bana, Daniel Craig and some Israeli supporting cast members, as well as a good story to go with it. But as interesting as Munich can be, it can be just as boring in equal measure. ***",7
23 December 2005,The Price of Revenge,"Once again, Steven Spielberg follows one of his ""Hollywood"" blockbusters with a more dramatic and more serious film. Most people over the age of 40 or so can remember with some clarity the 1972 Summer Olympic games in Munich, West Germany. Sadly, many Americans seem to remember most America's basketball team getting ripped off by the Soviets. However, the greatest tragedy was the kidnapping and murders of the Israeli Olympic team (coaches and athletes alike). It was a horrific event, made worse by the complete incompetence of the West German officials (who handled the crisis as poorly as anybody could). It was that poor mishandling by the West Germans, and the escape from any kind of justice by the assassins, that motivated the Israelis into deciding that something more had to be done. And that ""more"" was getting revenge against anybody that bore any responsibility. So, the Mossad (secret police) put together a hit-list of people they feel were involved in the plot and killings. Were these people on the list all legitimate targets worthy of assassination? That is a question each person, depending on their own motivation and beliefs must answer. However, one clear point that Spielberg makes in this wonderful film, is that killing for revenge for killing, does not resolve conflicts or bring peace, just more hardship. Moreover, the mental toll taken on by these Israeli assassins for carrying out their justice, raises interesting parallels with their targets. The Bible says ""Vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord,"" indeed.",7
28 December 2019,Bana is the Manna,"Who would have thunk that Bana would do something like this. I remember as a kid watching him in Aussie comedy shows ... next thing he becomes a movie legend ... amazing. This is a bloody good movie re-telling a true story. The whole tragic tale is one of Spielberg's yet again magic moments. He has so many of them.

16 December 2005,Spielberg's 'Munich' flawed but thought-provoking,"Director Steven Spielberg is probably going to take heat from both the Palestinians and Israelis for his latest film, a retelling of the events following the hostage tragedy at the 1972 Olympics in West Germany.

He'll take much more from the Israeli side, I'll wager, as many may see this effort as more of an attack on that state's handing of the terrorist problem, and equating its efforts as just as bad as the original crimes committed against it. But being Jewish, perhaps Spielberg has a better angle on the issue.

It is nevertheless a hard-hitting, uncompromising look at how Isreal's secret service (Mossad) dealt with the members of the Black September group which kidnapped and ultimately murdered nine Jewish hostages during the '72 games in Munich.

Eric Bana (""Troy"" ""The Hulk"") is Avner Kauffman, the reluctant army officer forced to go undercover in Europe to exterminate (with extreme prejudice) 11 Arabs thought to be associated with the Black September organization. He is personally asked to take this mission upon himself by none other than Israeli Prime Minister Golda Mier (Lynn Cohen, ""The Station Agent""). He even leaves his pregnant wife, Ayelet July Zurer, behind for love of country  or vengeance.

Like Brian DePalma's ""The Untouchables,"" (in which good men break laws to get bad ones) we then meet this group of ""good guys"" which will aid Kauffman in carrying out the plan; the macho Daniel Craig (""The Jacket,"" as well as the newest James Bond), nerdy Mathieu Kossovitz, uptight Ciaran Hinds and middle-aged Hanns Zischler. On the surface, it would seem that none of these men could carry out the mission given to them. One is an antique dealer, another is an account and one makes dolls.

When the time comes for action, however, each knows his job and  for the most part  they know what they're doing. At first. The inaugural hit is an elderly Palestinian author who has just translated ""The 1001 Arabian Nights"" into Italian. He is shot several times in his Rome apartment building, and while Kauffman initially feels guilt over the slaying, he soon learns to kill without much thought.

The clan then begins to run into problems, one bomb is too weak to kill its intended victim; while another blows the front of a hotel out. A sloppy shootout in Athens gets the Russians involved and secret information leads to a deadly firefight in Beruit between Palestinian terrorists and the Israeli Army.

Meanwhile, to get information (whether it's good intelligence or bad, we do not know), Kauffman & Co. are forced to rely on a duplicitous Frenchman, Louie (Mathieu Amalric) for millions of dollars. They also have to deal with the CIA, which seems intent on protecting some of the terrorists.

Failing to get one of the bigger fish, and after losing three of the group, the mission is called off by Kauffman's superior, Geoffrey Rush (""Shine""), while Kauffman wonders what good it did. ""For every one we eliminated,"" he says, ""six more take their place - and they are worse."" Spielberg's point is well-taken. The hostage murders only galvanized the Israelis, while their retaliations only galvanized the Palestinians. It seems a lose-lose proposition all around and it's still going on in the Middle East today.

Spielberg does a fine job of directing this rather low-key, matter-of-fact melodrama that tries a bit too much to be fair and balanced, while costumes and set design accurately reflect the film's early 1973 time period. The final crawl indicates that most of the bigwigs in the Munich murders escaped immediate detection (sheltered by the Russians or hid in Arab countries), but most were eventually tracked down. Kauffman's victims, however, seemed to be minor characters, if even that.

The major flaw was that it was about 15-20 minutes too long. Time is wasted on unnecessary narrative while the movie teases us with at least three endings. All in all, though, it is thought-provoking and certainly one which will be talked about for a while, at least.",7
23 June 2013,"Steven Spielberg still AWESOME, so shut up if you don't agree!","After the entry of the 21st century, Steven Spielberg began to be criticized by the new generation. A lot of them saying that he was losing his edge, that he longer make good movies like he used to, that he is getting lost on making entertaining movies such as ""AI"", ""Catch me if you can"", ""The Terminal,"" ""Minority Report"" and ""War of the Worlds ""(which are nothing bad at all, all of them just great movies). But ""Munich"" served almost like a letter in response to those critics telling them to shut up forever.

""Munich"" shows (almost perfect) the truthful events of the terrorist attack by the terrorist group called ""Black September"", which took place on September 5 in the Summer Olympic Games in 1972 in Munich (dah). In this attack, 11 Israeli athletes were taken hostage by the terrorist group, and were later brutally murdered when the terrorists were caught in a shootout with the German police. The story follows a group of agents of ""Mossad"" led by Avner (Eric Bana) who are ordered to hunt down and kill the leaders of the group ""Black September"" and the men who planned the attack. All of them fled and spread throughout Europe.

The film is able to demonstrate in a very realistic and at the same time loyal to the actual events of the fateful day. The partnership of Tony Kushner and Eric Roth on the screenplay works superbly giving a simple writing while packed with suspense leaving the man-hunt behind the responsible for the attack more tense leaving us more intrigued wondering how it will end, and together with the direction Spielberg all works fantastically.

But while the film works as a drama demonstrating the true story of the attack and also as a thriller full of suspense showing the hunt for those responsible, but at the same time functions as a symbolic and human exploration of religious conflicts involved in the film. The screenplay delivers several moments of dialog between the characters questioning the cause of these conflicts and the cause of them and the reason for so many deaths. And also dialogs about the relationship and family honor involved in the midst of those religious conflicts, most of them involved with the character of Avner that while is hunting the terrorist leaders, he has a pregnant wife at home to worry about and a father with a great military career. While giving a somber and also reflective tone throughout the film.

The cast was also highlighted in an excellent way, all superb in their characters since Daniel Craig as the angry and sarcastic agent Steve to Geoffrey Rush as Ephraim the head of the ""Mossad"", all great but who stands out and demonstrates a real talent is Eric Bana gives a astonishing performance (even the weird accent can give).

""Munich"" only shows that Spielberg still manages to make films with a bleak vision and matures upon a true story. And along with Eric and Tony writing manages to bring to the public tense and reflective moments about the religious conflicts and the family values and religious influences involved, delivering a superbly well written screenplay and alongside with a fantastic direction and excellent performances, makes ""Munich"" one of the most ambitious and magnificent films that Spielberg brought to the world.",10
8 December 2006,Why cut my nails? They grow back?,"Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's ""Munich"" seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. ""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, ""When does it ever end?""

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. ""Munich"" could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul. ""When does it ever end?"" Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",10
10 July 2006,"Fast paced and gritty, though rushed at times","Akin to spy films, only without the spies, Munich is a gripping emotional film that takes you too the edge of your seat and to the brink of tears.

Following the slaughter of 11 Israeli athletes by a group of Palestinians at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, a group of Israelis is then contracted to hunt down and kill the organizers of the event.

Violence begetting violence and the futility of it all is the major theme that Steven Spielberg wants you to take away from it all. Throughout the film the replacements for the people they kill are mentioned, even going so far as to kill one of those replacements. You'd think that with the message so clearly spelled out, the movie would be an insult to the intelligence of the movie going public (though I guess that depends on what you think of the intelligence of the movie going public). But it's not. The message is so simple, so obvious, that it would be an insult if the characters DIDN'T know it and state it.

Eric Bana proves his talent by masterfully portraying Arven, the man put in charge of the Israeli hit group. He is torn between doing a job and getting revenge and perpetuating the violence. He doesn't want to spend all that time away from his pregnant wife, which is a Spielberg trademark, the issue of fatherhood. Seriously, look at his films, it's an issue all the time, distant, absent or neglectful fathers, or men not wanting to be fathers, or some kind of father issue. It was an interesting way to present that sub-plot.

The supporting cast was wonderful, including Brit and new James Bond Daniel Craig, and Bana's fellow Aussie Geoffrey Rush, all of the men wrestling with several issues concerning their assigned task.

The real star of the picture though is Steven Spielberg. It's his most un-Spielberg film to date. I honestly thought it was a Ridley or Tony Scott film at times. That's a sign of a true craftsman. You know his films when you see them. Indiana Jones, Jaws, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, E.T., Saving Private Ryan you can look at them all and say ""That's a Spielberg film."" And here we are, thirty years after his debut with Jaws and he's disappeared into his film.

The only real downside I could see in this film was that it was a rushed film and you could see that at some points. Spielberg has constructed two massive films in a little over a year. He started War of the Worlds in August of 2004, and it was ready by the following June. He immediately started on Munich and had that mostly done by the end of November. But there were some noticeable continuity mistakes. And I say noticeable because I rarely notice them, because I'm not looking for them. But there are a few, showing that the editing process was rushed.",9
21 May 2006,No Quiet on the Eastern Front.,"Powerful. Tense. Riveting. Everything. A Spielberg masterpiece that should be described in the ""superlative degrees of comparisons only"".

Once again, Steven Spielberg reflects, or perhaps supersedes the methods of the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. There's no need to describe the plot. There is no need to explain or criticize. It's the ""way"", the technique, the presentation, the integration of location +character+music+plot+effects that ascends to a heretofore unattained level of action and suspense. If you are able to look past the political issue, you will see a modern cinema masterpiece. Spielberg has come light years from 'Star Wars', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' or 'Jurassic Park'. Creations such as 'Schindler's List' and 'Saving Private Ryan' and now 'Munich' make his science fiction entertainment seem like merely toys for children.

The film makes a political statement. It's bound to be controversial. The shady world of cross and double cross espionage, and an expose of, perhaps, a terrifying underground war, fought without concern for borders or boundaries. The presentation is far from one sided. In fact, there is a scene that parallels that of the captured German soldier in 'Pvt. Ryan', you get to see and hear 'the enemy'. It is not a 'war movie' as you might be used to, but it is a 'war movie' and the assassins eventually begin question their common confusion about the 'ethics' of their mission in this war.

This is cinema 101. A must see masterpiece.

As for the story, and the emotions that you're sure to experience, see it for yourself.",9

30 June 2022,Masterpiece,"This is Spielbergs Godfather or Apocalypse Now -- his most complex thematic work, but also his most technically astounding. It's a brutal, morally ambiguous paranoid thriller. A moral and spiritual quagmire from which the characters cannot escape. It's incredibly haunting, and contains some of the best camera work of Spielbergs filmography.

I absolutely reject that this film chooses a political side. There's a critical scene on a staircase between Avner (pretending to be a German) and a Palastinian rebel, when they're sharing the safehouse together, in which the Palatsinian PoV is put across brilliantly. The bomb maker leaves the mission because he no longer sees it as righteous, and Avner's level of regret in the closing scene, and the final image of the twin towers leave me in no doubt this is not an endorsement of the Israelis.

This is about a character who starts off with a very black and white view of the situation, and ends up full of doubt. If anything the film was ahead of its time politically, and its real utility is as an inditement of violence as a political solution. A message we can all get behind.

A quick note on the much discussed sex scene; Avner has severe PTSD, his anger and trauma, and the perverse sense of excitement he gets from the mission has chewed him up so much that even making love to his wife becomes a violent attempt to repress the memories that haunt him. It's incredibly sad, and I think the scene is powerful.",10
26 February 2006,"Slow, but beautiful","I have never really been a fan of agent movies, you know, the kind of movies where an agent clad in a trench coat forms a team and tries to fulfill some goal, which he of course always does. I see for example Michael Caine i big glasses.

Munich is fresh and interesting because the Cause is not the main theme in the movie. Instead it has its focus on the change in the character Avner, who is introduced as a devoted patriot. He is however forced to question his task, as it becomes increasingly difficult to see what good it does to murder leaders who are quickly replaced by others.

Spielberg also gives us a revival of American 70-s movies, with the slow but tense storytelling. Yes, there is the classical conflict and the deepening of the same, but the audience is given time to reflect during the watching. The movie is not about absolute good fighting and winning over absolute evil, as in the fairy tales or many of the 80-s and 90-s movies, but is instead told in a beautiful and interesting multi coloured scale.",7
16 January 2006,A Cry for Peace,"I just watched Munich while the Golden Globes were on TV. I saw Brokeback Mountain and really enjoyed it, but when Munich ended and I found out that Brokeback Mountain won best picture, and that Munich wasn't even nominated, I became very angry at the awards show's results.

Munich is tremendous. The dialog is solid, so is the camera work. But what is most important to this movie are the emotions portrayed by the characters. They are put in situations of all sorts including family vs. country and what is right vs. what your country wants from you.

This is clearly Speilbergs cry for peace, and if you want to see a movie full of suspense, good dialog, and social importance, go see Munich.

12 June 2006,Excellence unrecognized,"Hands down--the most effecting, and best produced, directed, edited and acted film I have seen in a long time. It is a masterful telling of a personal dilemma within a horrible political truth and it succeeds on every level. But sadly, too many people said to me--I saw it on TV...I didn't need to see it again. And so, they missed everything this perfectly-cast movie had to offer. That day in Munich our world officially lurched into the pain of the terrorist era, and to dismiss it, without watching it,seems irresponsible. Aside from superb work from the DP, and music that hasn't been so scary since Jaws, this is a nail-biting suspense story that packs its full wallop when you finally leave. Eric Bana should have walked home with the Oscar...taking us into his core and answering his life-and-death questions with him...did he succeed? Was it worth it? How has the world suffered? What type of never-ending cycle was started? It was almost like lifting up a rock onto a never-ending snake pit. Bana was so exceptional--as was everyone in the cast--that in the trite, ultimate commitment, I truly forgot I was watching a movie. Spielberg continues to be the master and Hollywood's jealousy is sad. And as a New Yorker who watched the Twin Towers smoking on 9/11, the ending scene said it all.",10
14 February 2006,Spielberg goes out his comfort zone - was it worth it?,"As someone with limited sympathy for the politics of either Israel or Palestine, I went to see this film with no little degree of trepidation. As the film got under way, I felt I might be pleasantly surprised. It was a thriller, based on a historical incident, and well-told. With the demise of the Cold War, stories about secret service plots, espionage and counter-intelligence seem too few on the ground, and criticising a Spielberg film for being pro-Jewish seems as silly as criticising James Bond for being pro-British.

The film takes the 1972 terrorist attack on Israeli athletes at the Olympic games in Munich as its starting point and then follows one of the hit squads assigned to revenge the attack (it is based on a book that straddles fiction and non-fiction lists called 'Vengeance').

As targets are identified - some of them a bit too old to have been the young Munich assassins - they are wiped out with varying degrees of skill, lack of skill, or bungling. The assassinations generally inflict unintended civilian casualties, and the assassinated are quickly replaced - often by better and more numerous terrorists.

Avner, the leader of our hit-squad sent by Israel's intelligence service (Mossad), eventually starts to succumb to doubts about the legitimacy, effectiveness and morality of the operation, as well as general paranoia (some of which seems reasonable) about whether the mercenaries selling him information are also selling information about his own whereabouts to enemies, or whether Mossad will endanger him and his family if he chooses not to take further missions.

This is where it all goes badly astray. Spielberg excels as a storyteller, not as a philosopher. With the remarkable Schindler's List, he told a story of bravery, of the non-violent and successful resistance and escape from the Nazis. The heroes were clearly defined and worthy of universal admiration. With Munich, he forces us to consider the current Middle East situation, where neither side is universally considered blameless. Avner's musings about the wrongness of violence are unconvincing and impotent. Although the film includes a few shots of Palestinian hardship, it nevertheless came across to me as a confused apologia for Israeli over-retaliation - in a similar ilk to Oliver Stone's cancellation of US guilt in Vietnam in 'Born on the Fourth of July' ('it was bad but necessary / well-intended, so let's move on').

Spielberg said he wanted the athletes to be remembered - but the film hardly shows them - you would be hard pressed to remember their names or anything about them from watching Munich. The martyrdom process that both the terrorists and Israeli assassins engender however is dwelt on for over two hours. It has come in for criticism from the Israeli government and the author of the book on which it is based. Spielberg said he hoped the film would produce discussion - it probably has and will, but possibly not of a useful or constructive kind. This, however, is my very personal view. By raising questions it might conceivably arouse productive debate within the Jewish community. My low rating is because it left such a bad taste in my mouth.",2
8 March 2006,Munich is worth awarding,"I have watched this movie after Oscar academy.Although I haven't watched another awarded movies yet,this film is good enough to get some prizes. I don't agree that Munich is not as good as Spielberg's previous productions.He portrayed the emotional fluctuation of Avner deeply, and the struggle of his heart about the contradiction between Jews'compassion and Israel's loyalty are absolutely introspective. I would like to have a great deal to this society. However,after watching this film,I am confused whether it's really worth to do something like what Avner done in Munich. I wonder how many people can be stressed like it and even I may commit suicide in such kind of a madness.

1 March 2006,Very Relevant to Our Times,"Steven Spielberg's latest film begins with a terrorist attack on innocent civilians that is witnessed throughout the world. Both the families of the victims and those of the terrorists are affected, and a nation is left with the question of how to respond. Sound familiar? The year is 1972, and a group of terrorists, who have come to be known as Black September, have kidnapped and killed 11 Israeli athletes and their coaches participating in the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. This prompts Golda Meir, Israel's prime minister, to call a cabinet meeting in which the decision is made to assemble a team of elite assassins headed by Meir's former bodyguard; a gentle family man ""with butcher's hands"" whose wife is expecting their first child.

The team includes people who are experts in different areas of espionage. Robert is an expert in bombs. Until he was given this assignment, he worked taking them apart. Hans is a forgery expert; it is his job to keep the real identities of the group members secret with falsified documents. Then there are those who do not seem to have any particular talent, but are needed to do things like clean up after hits (i.e. Carl), or look really cool in sun glasses and add a touch of glamor to undercover work (i.e. Steve, who appropriately enough is played by the newest James Bond).

As the body counts start rising, Spielberg has some of his characters question whether their mission is really the best way that they can serve Israel and their own humanity. Robert questions whether killing people goes against what Judaism stands for. He reminds Avner that the Jews are a ""righteous"" people, and that is what makes them ""beautiful."" Avner questions the purpose of killing one group of terrorists, only to have them replaced by a group far more dangerous to Israel.

As a whole, I found this film very thought provoking. However, like ""Shindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan,"" it is also extremely violent. Spielberg, like Mel Gibson, is not a director to give the audience much relief from painful images. A worthy film, which deserves its nomination as best picture, with a cast dominated by strong actors, with no one giving a bad performance. The only criticism that I had of the film was that it may be a little too long, or it at least felt that way. As you can imagine, when the plot involves the location and killing of several antagonists, there is a tendency for repetition, although Spielberg somewhat avoids that by making each killing unique (as morbid as that sounds!).",10

28 May 2006,Exhausting!,"I love Steven Spielberg's movies but I truly wanted to hate this one.

The happenings at the Munich Olympics, 34 years later, are still fresh in my mind, and my feelings of that day, that someone needs to get even with Black September and its supporters is still present. Therefore, I wasn't ready to accept a large part of Spielberg's premise---that there was a great personal toll on the Israelies who were commissioned to carry out targeted killings of those who actually planned and/or carried out the terrorist plot.

With mixed emotions I have to say that this is an outstanding movie pointing out the complexities of how a free Western society reacts to the actions of society's lowest common denominator--those who would rather destroy a perceived enemy than attempt to work with them as partners.

While there are many fine technical aspects of Munich--the precision needed to hunt down and destroy the terrorists--what is most memorable is the final questioning by the Israelis of the implications of what they are doing. And, it is important to note, Israel has pretty much gone out of the targeted assassination business.",9
26 December 2005,Extremely powerful look at history,"People should learn from history, and yet we keep on repeating some vicious circles. Much praise is to be given to Spielberg's courage for exploring a moment in history that many would choose to forget. There are outstanding moments in this film, from its near perfect direction by Spielberg, a man who seems incapable of making a bad film to Eric Bana's moving portrayal of a man tortured by circumstances he has very little power to change.

The film is not perfect, moving a little too slow at times and would have benefited by the removal of a few redundant scenes, but it carries a big powerful punch, one that it isn't easy to ignore. In fact, there were a few people discussing it outside the theater, and it amazed me how little they had chosen to understand.

It will probably be a controversial work of art, and that is what is supposed to be as long as it makes people ""talk"" instead of choosing other more destructive ways to solve problems. It is a movie that should be seen, discussed, and used as an example by people who want to make the world a better place.",9

9 February 2007,An Outstanding Thriller,"This film is about what happened after the Munich Olympics in 1972 where five men are chose to kill those who were responsible for that fateful day.

First of all, this is a very violent film. I have never seen these kinds of killings before like actually showing people get shot by many bullets and so on...

This is a very suspenseful film. It held me to the edge of my seats and it's one of the best thrillers of this year. The performances by the people hired to kill those who killed these others were great. It took me a while to find out that Daniel Craig was in this film.

This is a really gripping and intelligent thriller with outstanding performances and a lot of violence. Although a good film, it's really not the best film of 2005 but it's one of the best.

25 December 2005,"forget the politics, the movie is just plain tedious.","In my opinion, the majority of the reviews of Spielberg's ""Munich"" have failed their readers. From what I've read, so many people are reviewing this movie's message rather than the film. Like ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" or ""The Passion"" before it, I think some people's political leanings and/or allegiance to Spielberg (I love Spielberg, but well... you'll see) is tainting the scores.

While there are many hailing this as a great film, Spielberg is getting nailed from all directions because of ""Munich"" - Israeli groups say he is naive about terrorism, Palistinean groups are saying it doesn't humanize them enough or show what their motives really were. There are some that instead say it is too even-handed, that Spielberg has tried too hard to please everyone. If I really had to pick one, I'd go with the latter - it seems the only message of this film is about the haunting price of revenge, that violence only creates more violence no matter who does it. I can deal with that. Neither Israel or the PLO strike me as innocent, and I've been attacked so many times for even saying so that I've kind of given up on even having an opinion. Does this even matter though? No. I found ""Munich"" to be the worst Spielberg movie I've seen. It's the least commercial, and the least watchable, and my opinion has nothing to do with politics whatsoever.

A variety of little problems were evident from the get-go. While this movie has the watchword 'inspired by true events', some characters are historical figures I don't recognize, such as the female Prime Minister of Israel. Some way of pointing out who she was while she was on screen would have been helpful rather than finding out who she was much later. There were no location subtitles despite frequent scene changes. Many scenes feature characters speaking in foreign dialects that in my opinion should have been subtitled. The characters took off on their quest before ever being properly developed, and would fail to be adequately developed as the film progressed beyond generic 'types' - the hothead, the smart one, etc. The film is overly quiet and distant, and most of all, bloated, with too much time between anything happening. It feels like we were given a directors cut DVD of a b-revenge flick that wasn't good at a regular running length in the first place. So basically, this movie bored the holy hell out of me.

I love Spielberg, and saw this movie not because of any specific interest in the story, but because I trust him to hold my interest. Spielberg has made movies about serious subjects before, and as much as we don't want to say it, Schindlers List and Saving Private Ryan are entertaining films. ""Munich"" is not.

Despite a cast of people I like including Daniel Craig, Geoffrey Rush and Eric Bana, each character is stone faced and dull, with no one giving a standout performance. Eric Bana in particular is atrociously bland here. When he isn't staring off into space with dead eyes, he's required to go into amazingly forced crying fits. The conversations between any set of characters rarely show any passion, and most situations they find themselves feel really phony. The only tension the entire movie has is the occasional feeling that something is going to go very wrong, because the group is very incompetent in carrying out their cold blooded revenge.

Much has been made of that violence. Yes, it is loud, realistic, and kind of exploitative. But that doesn't really matter, since these action scenes are also incredibly repetitive, and eventually fail to even work as a tool to wake up the audience. I don't know if we were supposed to feel all that sympathetic for either side, but some of the revenge murders are vicious enough to make me wonder just what the point was by making them so graphic. I guess this was supposed to reinforce just how nasty killing actually is - that the images can and should haunt you forever - but really all it does it make you feel less sympathetic for everyone. I eventually stopped caring what happened to any of these people, and that's when I began praying it would end. But it kept going and going and going and going. I found out that the script was given a run through by Tony Kushner, writer of ""Angels In America"", and it is said he had an influence on the set. It shows. ""Angels"" is probably the one piece of media I've hated most of this past decade, as there hasn't been a movie or series more boring or pretentious. Without saying what it is, there is a scene near the end of ""Munich"" that is so kitschy, so overblown and ridiculous, I'm sure it was Kushner's doing.

I'm definitely not alone in my dislike of this film - I've got a significant roster of well known, thoughtful reviewers who also hated this movie for the technical aspects of film-making alone. So decide for yourself, but don't make my mistake of going to see it just because it's Spielberg. - Goon",1
16 March 2022,The Game Exists Where The Fear and The Risk Persists,"The most landmark movie of our times in the context of highlighting political imbroglios of a social sort considering the drift in movie studios has always been to pitch a victor versus a vanquished irrespective of the brickbats that sort of endeavor attracts in a highly globalised and interconnected world where sugar from Peru is delved in Tea from Darjeeling placed in a cup of porcelain made in China. While the ask seems to entirely veer towards showing the ever prevalent plight of Israel in its quest for survival with often narry a chance at the same, the Palestinians and their affiliates, in this picturization at least, come across as as significant in their heroism as do seemingly bona-fide spies with formal backing. What starts as a defence of government manifested as a microcosmic representation of world society translates into a pain of defence of that same microcosmic representation now manifested even more microcosmically in personal human relationships formalised macrocosmically in world society as what we call 'family', essentially, as could be derived from the whole tale, a notional formalisation to prevent enemies from tearing at your roots for being a representation of that microcosmic manifestation of world society that couldn't factor in some others in their limited perception of how a family should be macrocosmically, or microcosmically!",9
24 December 2005,The other list,"I wonder how this film would be judged without Spielberg's name attached. My feeling is it would be hailed as a masterpiece. However, with great achievement comes great expectations. Most of those expectations will be exploded by the end of Munich, the least Spielbergian of Spielberg's films. Firstly, there is no obvious hero here, and that is the point. Terrorism and anti- terrorism drags all of humanity into an unheroic world. Witness Avner's reaction to the young Israeli soldiers who revere him when he returns from his mission: He doesn't believe he is a hero. Secondly, the pacing will alternately disorient, lag, overwhelm and frustrate. I would argue the beginning of the second act owes heavily to The Day of the Jackal, a film which also tried to demonstrate just how banal the days of an assassin can be. Tony Kushner, best known for Angels in America, writes scenes that disturb. They may irritate you at times, but you will remember them. In Munich, one such scene is the sex scene that ends the movie in which Avner is dreaming about the murder of the Israeli Olympians. It seems so ridiculous at the time, but days later you will still be haunted by it. Finally, Munich's point-of-view may come as a surprise considering it was directed by the man who won so much acclaim for Schindler's List. Of course, you would think Spielberg's sympathies would lie with the Jewish state created after the very Holocaust he set his most acclaimed film during. But Munich is a nuanced piece that takes a horrible event that solidified most of the world behind Israel and shows how Israel's response, to hunt down the planners of the kidnapping, turned into something just as unjustified.",9
22 November 2019,meh spielberg half hearted attempt at a spy movie,"Seriously valid real life subject.. good actors.. reasonable theory of how to do X but it seemed more an anti-violence agenda than a thriller about real justice vs the terrorists that maimed and killed XXXXX # of people in the name of their religion

Sorry but in the end a reasonable flick but SS certainly could have done far better imo esp given he didn't lack funds or acting talent.

Therefore while its not a bad film per se it is not an award winning class some think it is. so i give it a pass at 6 stars.

21 December 2005,A brilliant exploration of the moral costs of violence.,"""Munich"" is a tremendous movie, thanks largely to Tony Kushner's brilliant screenplay, that explores the nature and moral costs of violence. As such it is necessarily an extremely graphic film in its depictions of violence.

Based on historical events that began at the 1972 Munich Olympics: the kidnapping and killing of Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists, and the Israeli efforts to assassinate those who planned and carried out that attack the movie centers on Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana in a wonderful performance) who leads the Israeli death squad. Bana shows Kaufman, a gentle patriot, whose work pulls him from his pregnant wife, being deeply transformed by the brutality of his work. Around this transformation we see others, mostly Israelis, and their attitudes about what has been or must be done.

With Kushner's script and Spielberg's direction the actors all around share credit for fleshing out characters that could easily be cliché and stereotype into more fully human figures. Some of the more peripheral figures even present more depth and reflection on the range of opinions and experience of Isreali Jews than do some of Kaufman's teammates.

This film is sure to raise a lot of political controversy, and anyone with an opinion will find both brilliance and flaws. From my own perspective, I was dismayed that Israeli terrorists were fully fleshed humans we were drawn to care about, and Palestinian terrorists were little more than props and targets. On the other hand, some of the Israelis articulate points that will anger fervent Zionists including acknowledgment that whatever Israel is it is land taken by force from Palestinians. While this is a very Jewish film, it accepts no easy assumptions about the Zionist state. Its criticisms will be far too mild for some, and an unconscionable betrayal according to others.

The exploration of violence, whether for or against any state, is one that is far more widely applicable. This film is not just about Jews and Israel, but a cautionary tale about those who use violence and how that feeds into an expanding destructive vortex.

Kushner's script and Bana's performance easily merit Oscar nominations, and this could even get a nod for ""Best Movie."" I think the political questions it raises make a nomination likely, but a win very improbable.",10

8 October 2012,Spielberg's Finest Hour!,"'Munich' is an Astonishing Film, Spielberg's Finest Hour! Rare comes a film, so historical, so well-executed & so brutal. Its A Masterpiece!

'Munich' Synopsis: Based on the true story of the Black September aftermath, about the five men chosen to eliminate the ones responsible for that fateful day.

'Munich' explores a journey that can be prolifically defined as: Bloody. 'Munich' is so arresting, devastating, dark & violent, that it left me spell-bound. Tony Kushner & Eric Roth's Screenplay is masterful. Spielberg's Execution to this historical film, deserves a Standing Ovation! Spielberg demonstrates a story, that's hard to execute, as there are NO Heroes here, its all about blood & power. I am mesmerized by his work, he's never been so involved & so bold, ever. Janusz Kamiński's Cinematography is epic. Michael Kahn's Editing is razor-sharp. John Williams Score is compelling.

Performance-Wise: Eric Bana delivers a highly engaging performance, that can easily be credited as a ""career best turn"". Daniel Craig is flawless. Ciarán Hinds is effortless. Mathieu Kassovitz is efficient. Mathieu Amalric is simply fantastic. Miichael Lonsdale is perfect. The Great Geoffrey Rush is impeccable, as always.

On the whole, 'Munich' is a Cinematic Moment!",10

6 February 2013,Munich (2005),"Munich ,a thriller that deals with Mossad's response to the siege and killing of 11 Israeli athletes by Black September at the 1972 Munich Olympics, is a near flawless piece. There is a definite message in this film and it's obvious to anyone who sees this movie and understands politics. It's important to point out that this film is ""based on real events"" and is not true-to-life as far as the history of Munich's aftermath. If you're okay with that, then it's an excellent story. The Jews had always been a recipient of numerous conflicts and atrocities since the ages of antiquity. They had been involved in slavery, territorial conflicts, racial discrimination and struggle, religious controversies and several other misunderstandings and for that the Jews is considered to be the most sensationalized race in this world. The most often miserable fate of the Jews has countlessly been re-portrayed in film and has captured considerable sympathizers. Since the Jews had been in conflict with different races and countries, their never-ending history of war is not anymore new to the world. And movies with their struggle against countries like Egypt, Greece, Rome and Germany had continually haunted every audience. Spielberg didn't reside on what just actually happened on the Munich Olympics hostage tragedy and its aftermath but it tried to depict the characters' dilemma on their given assignments since the predefined missions were not really clear and pure. Although the veil of nationalism and justice was the major pretext of their elders, Avner(played by Eric Bana) was caught between conspiracies he had no clue of and would somehow fail to understand unless his elders feed him the truth. The already sensationalized history of the Arab-Israeli conflict has smoothly shifted to the dilemma of the character and his allies, giving us a point of view that we need to reconsider and reflect as well as it is often overlooked in most sensationalized and biased situations as that. The memorable aspect of this film are the tragic flashbacks of the events at Munich with the Israeli team being taken hostage to their haunting deaths at the end but to me personally best part was a postscript note that says 9 of the 11 men targeted by Mossad were eventually assassinated. It's again nothing less than a masterpiece from a great director and one could just imagine how Spielberg was able to harmonize and give rhythm to a number of short scenes on the movie to create an overall theme of pure drama and portrayal of the effects of the Black September tragedy in Munich to the individuals related and to the world.

11 December 2005,So close to perfect . . .,"Personally, I have always believed that a long movie isn't always a good movie, but this film is the exception to that rule. At the end of the film I was shocked at how long I was in the theater; time just flew by. This film has everything I was looking for, action-wise, and a fantastic storyline that kept me at the edge of my seat. I loved the drama and the history--this wasn't just another story that someone dreamed up. It was interesting because these events happened before I was born. It was fascinating to see how the world was at that particular era. Hopefully, it will be advertised more so the public will be attracted to it. Because of the action and drama involved, I would say this is one of the best films of 2005, without a doubt. YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM!

8 July 2006,An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.,"This movie does provide a powerful, gripping and for most part realistic view of the 1972 Munich Olympic tragedy and its aftermath. Of course, especially the movie its view of the aftermath, is mostly, if not entirely, fictional and we will probably never know if events as presented in this movie actually really truly occurred. It however is not the movie its intention to provide a realistic and documentary like view on the events of the 1972 assassination of the Israeli athletes and what happened afterward. The movie does make the viewer think. Is violence always the best way to answer violence and what are the consequences of it. The movie is filled with deep and important questions like this that the movie does not try to answer but it leaves it up to us to think about and draw our own conclusions.

People often accuse this movie if picking sides. To me this just seems silly. It's not a question of whose side were the film-makers on, that really is not relevant for the movie. The movie does show both sides their motives and it does help you to somewhat better understand both parties and why they do the things they do. So is that the reason why this movie is considered to be controversial by so many all over the world? I don't think that is the main reason. I think it's because of it that everyone suddenly now has a face. The movie shows that terrorist are also humans who have a family and emotions. Not everything in this world is black and white or as simple as it first seems. You suddenly now see that the terrorist get nervous and unsure as well and doesn't seem to be so completely ruthless and heartless at all. This movie does a very good job at portraying this. This might be a shock for some people, who never really considered this or thought about.

The story is a very gripping and interesting one. Even though the movie is 164 minutes long, it's no bore. The events in the movie are always interesting and the questions asked in this movie forces you to think and perhaps might even reconsider some of your views. Basically the movie for most part is a good old fashioned espionage-thriller but with a realistic and gripping twist to it. The movie shows that ultimately violence leads to nowhere and in most cases only worsens things. It's a vicious circle and downward spiral, that leads to nowhere and ultimately only leads to more pain and suffering on both sides. At least that my view and interpretation of this movie. You can draw your own personal conclusions from it.

Really Spielberg does deserve credit and respect for having the courage to bring up such a sensitive but yet still relevant subject that is considered highly controversial.

The movie does a very good job at re-creating the '70's style and atmosphere. The settings, costumes, hair are all very good and realistic, as simple and irrelevant as it all might seem at first sight.

The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is at times highly impressive and delicious to watch. The musical score by John Williams was also great and just perfect for the movie. It was one of the best and most powerful scores of the year for me and in my opinion he should have won an Oscar for it as well.

Not sure if Eric Bana was the right choice as the main lead. I already wasn't the biggest fan of him after watching ""Hulk"" and ""Troy"". He doesn't really have enough charisma and is too boring. He also didn't really convinced me in this movie but I think that his way of acting and personality suited the character in this movie quite well. Daniel Craig was really good in this movie and he played a great character. Ciarán Hinds was also great as always and so was Michael Lonsdale, who is perhaps one of the most underrated and under-appreciated actors of the last decades.

The movie is for most part a very realistic and authentic made one. It however gets also a bit too obvious that this movie was made a bit in a haste. Not every storyline gets fully and well enough developed and the main reason of the Mossad mission gets a bit muddled in. At times you forget that this is a movie that concentrates on the aftermath of the 1972 Munich Olympic tragedy. I think that is also the reason why Spielberg constantly puts on flashbacks of that event into the movie to help us remember. It however does mostly feel out of place at times and works distracting. Not the best example of movie-making and storytelling really. The movie also gets a bit too moralistic at times, which causes it to lose some of its credibility. The movie does at times also chooses the easy, simple and save road. As weird as it might sound, the movie does still have lots of humor in it. It's the typical Spielberg humor that is present in this movie. I wouldn't call it misplaced, since it worked well in the movie but it does make the movie a little bit less impressive and powerful to watch at certain moments. It's the only reason why I don't really this movie to be a masterpiece. But fact remains that this movie still is one of the most powerful movies that were released in the last couple of years.

An important movie about an important event in history. See this movie and draw your own conclusions from its story and choose your own interpretation of it. It will grip you and make you think and reconsider guaranteed.

22 September 2021,Munich,"Munich appears to be conflicted between two separate vantages on the Israel-Palestine conflict, one significantly more interesting than the other, and thus never quite converges into the Great Movie that it very well could (should) be. These are as follows: (1) a rumination on the futility of revenge-based combat, within the broader context of the real-world struggle it depicts, all framed through the psychological effects on an individual participant (the wonderful Eric Bana); (2) a Michael-Mann-esque action/thriller centred on Israel's covert operation in retaliation to Black September. It is through the talents of Steven Spielberg that this combination occasionally works, and works well; his directing is expectedly brilliant throughout (there must be about a dozen beautiful shots of/through car windows and mirrors here), almost to a fault - the sleekness and effortless polish of the cinematography is jarring within the setting of gritty action, making the assassination scenes relatively stale and repetitive (especially given the lengthy runtime), yet still oftentimes entertaining (e.g. A Hitchcock-inspired scene with the daughter of a target re-entering the house where a bomb is planted). Film (1) is where Munich almost shines, particularly when focusing on Bana's personal conflict between country and family, revenge and religion (less touched upon but still present), and his own resulting guilt. It rarely dives deep enough into the potential character study though, in part due to being weighed down by film (2) - which itself suffers from lack of characterisation, of the Israelis but also especially the Palestinians, who never receive more than a few minutes screen-time each - and equally as a consequence of the attempt at generalising the conflict to one of countries at war, rather than focusing on our protagonist's own war with himself. When going all in in the latter aspect, the film excels: its best sequence is probably Bana tearing apart his apartment, panic-stricken about a hidden bomb (huge The Conversation vibes), then riddled with grief after the deaths of his partners. Other attempts however - i.e. An embarrassingly out of place penultimate scene wherein a ridiculous score plays over Bana mid-climax, intercut with nightmares of his mission (I understand what Spielberg was going for here, but the delivery is baffling to the point of being laughable) - are less successful. Indeed, Munich ends a little clumsily compared to its first two hours, and ultimately fails to become truly special. Surprisingly earnest in its attempt to play both sides, even if its biases clearly show favour towards Israel - though I don't believe Spielberg fully delivered on the potential for greatness here, his withheld sentimentality and delving into unfamiliar genres is admirable, and many of the film's sentiments sadly ring true: ""There is no peace at the end of this.""",6
3 February 2006,Spielberg amazingly captures the sense of what happened at the Munich Olympics in 1972,"I went see 'Munich' at the weekend and I was amazed at what Spielberg accomplished. He superbly capture's the reality of 1972 and the events of what happened at the Munich Oylmpics. Spielberg has returned with the team who helped him to make the Truimphs of 'Shindler's List' and 'Saving Private Ryan' to create a thrilling historical film of an account of which 11 Israeli Athletes where took hostages and then killed.

Spielberg has not only created a film that is thrilling but the other side of it is that it's an emotional film which at moments will strike the heart. In another sense it feel's like 'Munich' is a Documentury which is brilliant for this type of film.

If you want to see something that captures the heart with emotions it's 'Munich'. 9/10

18 January 2007,Overlong and superficial,"I really struggled to reach the end of this film. It seemed to go on forever, without any real narrative verve or purpose.

None of the main characters were properly developed and consequently I could not have cared less about any of them. There was no serious exploration of the morality or immorality of what they were doing or why. Just a bit of callously expressed indifference from the South African guy played by Daniel Craig, and a lot of pained expressions from the Eric Bana character.

As for the plot, it was obscure and incoherent. Often I wasn't even sure what country the action was occurring in, as the assassination crew moved from one anonymous victim about whom we knew nothing, to another. Every now and then a character would announce how many hundreds of thousands of dollars a particular hit had cost, but what reaction the film-makers wanted the audience to have to these figures I have no idea. Certainly the assassins never seemed to be struggling for cash.

There were a few impressive set pieces and the seventies period detail was nicely done. Yet when the film finally ended I was more relieved than anything else. It simply had no resonance for me whatsoever.",4
7 January 2006,The best,"The reasons why I gave this film a 10 are simple. This is single handedly the best film made in the last 10 years. The editing was impeccable, the direction was above and beyond and the cinematography was untouchable. The fact that they used a rough grain film and used it well in anything other than a war film should confirm my previous statement. This film ran the gamut of emotions. I felt sad, happy, tense, sick and incredibly excited all in the same few hours. The acting, well i won't waste your time (you already know my opinion). It's great that Stephen got such a large crew to make this films, because to be honest, it could not have been done without them. Eric Roth and Tony Kusthner are the most amazing writers, the foreshadowing and other literary devices they used in this masterpiece were impeccable. The metaphor they use such as ""We have butcher's hands and sensitive souls"" make for a very dynamic movie. The ""political"" parts, were political enough that at first glance you do not understand, but as they progress, it becomes a very fathomable. John Williams once again proves he is the best film scorer in the history of the industry. Well, that's my two-cents, i hope you enjoy the film, but if your looking for the political points and not enjoying the movie as a whole, than don't bother seeing it. Oh, and by the way, this very instant, i'm wearing an awesome hat. Just to let you know.",10
6 June 2007,Not impressed.,"The film in general was objective in a sense that it attempted to explain (at least verbally) the two sides and the cycle of violence involved in the conflict. However, when considering the implicit nature of images, the film did injustice to the presentation of both sides. The biggest thing that I noticed was the subtle racism towards the Arabs. All the Palestinian characters were either completely fobs (so the audience could not relate to them at all), or they were wealthy pigs (so the audience was annoyed with them). They spoke broken English and were presented as emotion-driven fanatics. The exception was perhaps the Italian-Arab poet who translates 1001 nights.

This representation happens all the time actually, and this is perhaps why it is easier for Americans to relate to Israelis over Palestinians. People always associate Israel with ""the west,"" those who are like Americans and Europeans while the Palestinians are just backward folks who are nothing like ""us."" The psychological affect of this is that people pick sides and align themselves with the people who resemble them the most.

Another thing that I noticed was that the Israel assassins were presented as noble characters. The main character is this soft-hearted, beautiful man who cradles his child and says fluffy things to his wife whom he clearly adores. You cannot help but be charmed by this character. The hit-men do everything in their power to avoid killing civilians (esp. the scene when the little girl goes back to her house and they go out of their way to stop the bomb from going off). The same is not done with the Arab side, which is fine since this is not necessary true. However, it is also true that the state of Israel does not differentiate between fighters and citizens, between old and young, between women and men, or between child and adult. Towards the end of the movie, the group kills a woman who seduced and murdered their colleague. This murder is done with tremendous guilt and much difficulty. So this ultimately makes them appear as individuals with sincere personal conscience (and good men with good intentions). On the contrary, the Arab violence is illustrated as senseless brutality and the audience is never really able to understand the Palestinian cause.

Another interesting thing was the fact that the Israeli authorities never provided evidence of guilt to the assassins (as far as the men who they were to kill). So periodically, the audience sees the charming fellow described above struggle with this issue and question the officials for the information. Again, this makes him appear like a man with a firm sense of justice. How cute.

Overall, the movie was better than I actually expected, but it was in many ways, exactly what I expected. I will admit that at one point, it is conveyed that little attention was given to the 200 and some Palestinians who were killed after the Munich tragedy. No one mourned for these people and the world remained fixed on the Munich event. This is true, and the addition of this clip was a sign of an attempt on the film makers part to be ""neutral.""

Finally, films about supposed Arab terrorism are usually filmed from the viewpoint of the victims and not the terrorist, interestingly, this film was shot from the perspective of the Israeli assassin team leader and not from the view of the victims of this tragedy. So naturally, the audience found itself rooting for murders.

Oh... and the film was not really about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict... at least in my opinion.",4
12 October 2014,Suspenseful action-packed thriller with great intellectual and emotional depth,"Centred on Mossad's systematic assassinations of the Palestinians behind the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre, Munich is both a suspenseful action-packed thriller and a stirring portrayal of the agent tasked with this grueling mission.

It asks deep questions that were especially pertinent post-911 and that remain relevant today, what with rebel groups still very much alive. Given the reprisals spawned by each assassination attempt made by Avner and his team, do revenge attacks make a country safer or do they just perpetuate an endless cycle of violence? Are national security agencies justified in taking action against suspects without strong/direct evidence? The film also shows the effects that killing (even where it's for a just cause) can have on a person. Avner struggles to shoot his first victim and is overwhelmed by the gruesomeness of it. But soon, he gets comfortable with his role and finds himself pursuing anyone who tries to stop him or hurts his team. The experience leaves a deep mark on him however. Throughout, he fears for his family's safety and even after the mission is over, has nightmares and suffers from paranoia.

Intellectual and emotional depth aside, Munich had many tense, exciting moments followed by great action scenes. I was kept glued to the screen. Watching the team members, with their quirks and diverse backgrounds, work together in such a high-stakes environment was also highly entertaining. Spielberg chose a very effective way to tell the story - current events interspersed with episodes from the Munich massacre as Avner visualised it. This helped to build suspense, and also mimicked the deep impact that the massacre had on the collective consciousness of the Jews, especially the team charged with executing revenge.

I wouldn't ordinarily recommend violent films, but this one stands head and shoulders above the pack for the important story it tells.",9
7 January 2006,"The hopeless result of ""an eye for an eye"" philosophy.","This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. I haven't stopped thinking about the disturbing images or the troubling questions the movie raises. The hopelessness of two people groups that live out an ""eye for an eye"" philosophy of life is depicted with the skill of a master director and story teller. Others have already said, ""'An eye for an eye - tooth for a tooth' approach to life leaves everyone blind and toothless."" How does one lead a people group into a life of peace without responding to the aggression of another people group while maintaining peace? This is the rub of the movie for the Israelis and the Palestinians. The greatest rabbi of all time said, ""Turn the other cheek."" Neither group in the movie considers this option and the results are devastating at the national and personal level.

30 January 2006,downward spiral,"Spielberg is the last person you'd expect to be the director of this movie - no good against evil story, no happy end, no glorification of anyone... You would not even expect it to come from Hollywood. This is not the Saturday night popcorn entertainment kind of film, it's very dark and gripping and will keep your brains busy for a while after you've seen it.

Some people in this forum find the movie too long, some suggesting that the makers did not take enough time to cut and edit it. But in this case the length of the film is a tool to make a point: pointlessness.

SOME SPOILERS: The Israeli ""assassin team"" receives a list of 11 people to execute in various places all over Europe, all of them are supposed to have some sort of connection with the Munich attack 1972. After the 3rd or 4th kill, the film is getting harder and harder to watch. Not only that there is no bright moment anymore to smile about or to make you feel easier, the feeling of senselessness grows and the graphic violence is getting more intense by each ""chapter"" of the story. You want it to stop, you want the guys to finish or to give up, but they keep going. You start counting down the kills, but then they even start killing people not on the list, like other assassins that got ""in their way"", or people replacing people they already have murdered. And then you get it: this is never going to end. It will continue for as long as people respond to violence with violence, and it will get worse.

Apart from the great directing and writing, I have to mention the awesome performance of Eric Bana as the main character Avner, he is extremely believable at all moments. In the beginning he is that smiling, shining young man, ready to take on the world, and in a slow, almost unnoticeable process he becomes a paranoid, twisted and depressed wreck.

If you enjoy movies that do more than just entertain, and if you can take the strong graphic violence: go and see it. 10/10",10
15 July 2006,Blakespot Reviews,"Munich, 8/10, 3rd best of 2005, 132nd best movie of all time.

This movie fell only three spots short of a 9/10. I really liked this movie, probably one of the fairest war movies I've ever seen. There have been movies before that refuse to take sides. But in those movies it mostly seems that they try to make the message, ""everyone is evil, there are no good guys, everyone just wants to kill everybody."" This movie is more on the side of saying that everyone is pretty okay. All these people involved in terrorism or anti-terrorist espeonaige or killing or war... they aren't fighting cause they want to kill people, they all have something to fight for, something that's extremely important to them. This movie doesn't really attempt to answer any of the important questions in the mid-east crises, but that's not its job. Wonderful movie, good characters, and most importantly.... I never got bored.

8 December 2017,A Spielberg Masterpiece,"There are basically three types of movies, ones which simply entertain in its running time, ones which fail to achieve that objective and ones which stay with you long after it is over. This certainly is in the third category. A chilling tale of Munich Olympic killings and the eliminations of its perpetrators aftermath, this movie drives home a point or two. The conversations between Avner and Ali and then again of Avner and Carl bring forward those arguments while the agents go about the pursuit of their targets. Despite its length, the movie is thoroughly engaging with top-notch performances from all, but hard to not mention of Mathieu Amalric and Ciarán Hinds in their respective roles. Tension was acutely palpable in the assassination scenes; and as a viewer, one would experience the journey they go through hunting down their targets and could relate to their resolve being weakened and fatigued as they go from one part of the globe to other to complete their mission and getting hunted themselves. Spielberg's take on Operation Wrath of God is dark, realistic and gripping to say the least. The infusion of the Godfather-like character of Papa to the story may have been an improvisation in the script but that much liberty can be given to this great director. Nothing less than 8/10 for this Spielberg masterpiece.",8
13 November 2014,Controversial film shows the moral vacuum of revenge,"Munich is Steven Spielberg's fantastic drama about Israel's secret revenge program ""Operation Wrath of God"" in the wake of the 1972 Olympic Games massacre in Munich, Germany. While I believe Spielberg approached the subject with what he believed was a balanced and sympathetic perspective toward both the Israeli and Palestinian points of view, Munich is a film that powerfully shows the moral vacuum entered into when an oppressive government decides to inflict even more destructive terrorism on the people they're already oppressing. The leader of Israel's strike team, Avner, ends up looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life, knowing that he's created more terrorists than he's killed, and left wondering what he's actually achieved. Pro-Israelis and Zionists were outraged by the film and called for boycotts, and many reviewers blasted the film for insinuating that Israel's actions were actually worse than the terrorism they were responding to. One scene even allows a Palestinian militant to make a powerful argument for their cause, and the film ultimately makes the viewer question the kind of ""eye for an eye"" policies that exacerbate conflict rather than end it. Spielberg's film is expertly directed and the performances are excellent throughout.",9
30 January 2006,Realisation is full of clichés,"Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's ""Munich"" seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. ""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, ""When does it ever end?""

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. ""Munich"" could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul. ""When does it ever end?"" Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",6
5 February 2009,"Extremely Exciting , Suspense Filled , Perfectly Paced ... I Could Go On!","Munich tells the story of 11 Isralie Athlete murdered when a hostage operation doesn't exactly go as planned. The Group of people behind it were/are known as ""Black September"".

What the film really focuses on is everything that came after this event. In response to this a new attitude/ approach is taken it is decided by the Isrealie government that the best way to change things to fight back is to start doing some of the killing themselves. So it is decided that a team shall be put together with the intention of finding and killing the people responsible for the slaughtering of the athletes.

Chosen to lead the team is Avner the son of a once war hero who has to agree to leave his life which is taken up mostly by his pregnant wife for a while and focus on the objective in hand he can not tell anyone about this and will be given four other team members in which to carry out his ""work"".

Well what happens after all this is quite simply amazing and shown so well by Spielberg. The film shows the consequences of the attitude ""fighting fire with fire"" It shows how over time the men doing the revenge killing almost can't handle it and lose there eagerness to kill back. It shows how this affects you , others around you and even sometimes people who don't deserve to die. The film almost spells out that killing gets you nowhere and doesn't change nor right wrongs. What the film also does is shows that the men doing the hunting down for those responsible ultimately become the hunted in a world were information can and will be sold to whoever will pay the most. It shows how even after the mission is over Avner is affected by what has happened he is scared as he is now a man wanted and is scared for him and his family's life.

This film is full of edge of the seat stuff! and is ram packed full of suspense. Even at it's long running time not for one second is this film slow and never manages to drag in anyway!

With amazing performances from Bana and the other four members of the team including ""Daniel Craig"" this film is for anyone who just generally loves movies.

It has no particular target audience and can be enjoyed by all. Everything in this film just feels so perfect the Cinematography , Performances , Action , Handling of violence and how real it feels in general!.

It's one that all lovers of both drama and action movies will enjoy and makes you wonder what more Spielberg could have mastered if he had opted for more serious movies like this.

8 January 2006,Give him the Statue,"I have just recently seen 'Munich' and it was one of the brutal, heartless, intelligent and wonderful films have seen in a long time. Spielberg's use of flashback and time-line to spin this horrible tale, though not entirely original, was a stroke of genius. I believe that director Peter Weir also used this style of directing in his 1993 film 'Fearless'. The Jeff Bridges character, who flashsback constantly throughout the film of the plane crash he walked away from is eerily similar to the Eric Bana character's journey in 'Munich'....both films endings culminating in the final telling of the tale....great performances abound as well in 'Munich'...Ciarans Hinds best work to date (Rome & Sum of all fears)...Our newest James Bond, Daniel Craig, puts in a stellar performance as well....also a nice touch bring back former James Bond Villain, Michael Lonsdale, (as Drax in Moonraker) to play the culinary-obsessed, Double-agent 'Papa""...This a must see....first three hour movie I have seen in a long time that I did not want to end....give him the statue.

10 December 2020,Glossy Revenge Fantasy,"Munich is nothing more, nothing less, than a cheap revenge fantasy of the kind that Hollywood has been pumping out for decades. They used to star Chuck Norris or Sly Stallone going back to re-fight the Vietnam War. Later on they were helmed by Mel Gibson getting revenge on somebody or another, often the British. Still later Liam Neeson carveda mid-career out of paranoid revenge fantasies revolving around family members. These days revenge movies usually come in the guise of superhero movies.

The difference here is the Spielberg brand. The perpetual J3wish victimhood. The rote story-telling. The tiring steadycam. The trite dialog.

In short, this is just revenge pr-n dressed up as a major motion picture. Kinda surprised it didn't win the Oscar like the execrable Braveheart.

24 December 2005,Spielberg's Back,"Rolled out of bed at 11:40 on Friday morning to see the 12:20 show of Munich, and wow. This movie is the best movie of 2005 without a doubt. Where do they find these actors? Every single actor from Bana, Craig, and Rush to even just the terrorists give outstanding performances. Intense, heartwarming, shocking, and sad, this movie just doesn't have it all, but it works to it's full potential to achieve one of the finest films I have seen not only in years, but maybe in my lifetime. Spielberg gets criticized for only being able to do well with ""period-pieces"", however, I think that if you can do something extremely well, and has meaning with your religion, hell yeah. Crowning achievement. I look forward to seeing the Oscars. Go Munich.

16 February 2007,Munich is easily Spielberg's best film since 1993's Schindler's List! One of the best films of 2005!,"This is easily one of Spielberg's best films since 1993's Schindler's List! Munich, the great Steven Spielberg's new political thriller retracing the horrific events of the massacres of the Israeli athletes in 1972, is not only the best film from Steven Spielberg since 1993, it is also the film that is sure to turn off many of his loyal supporters around the world.

Munich has no easy answers. From it's beginning to it's end, the film's graphic subject matter will not be easy for those to take.

Eric Bana, Oscar worthy in every way, portrays Israeli Mossad (intelligence) officer, Avner Kauufman who was years ago a bodyguard of the then Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.

Kauufman is a loyal Israeli supporter who wants nothing more than for a strong Isreal and it's citizens.

Hours after the massacre at Munich, Avner is contacted by an Israeli intelligence officer played by Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush to plan a top secret mission of retaliation against the members of Black September, a Palestinian terrorist organization responsible for the murders of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic Games.

Avner is brought together with a group of European Jews each with a certain specialty, one who is great with weapons, and for getaways, one for creating explosives, one who is excellent with forging documents, and one for clean up, leaving no traces of Israeli responsibility.

The first sets of retaliations goes as planned as the group led by Avner and his hit-man team track down and ""assassinate"" each of the Black September members responsible for the assassinations in Munich.

Shortly afterwords, the tables are turned against Avner and his team as Black September and it's members begin tracking Avner's team in retaliation for the first bombings. Avner starts feeling the pressure when members of his own team are marked for assassination, and after some of the bombings go horribly wrong. This starts to mark questions in Avner and the audience's mind about what is right and what is wrong in dealing with terrorism.

This begins a long game of cat and mouse between the Israels and the members of Black September as they chase each other across the globe, from Europe to the Middle East, searching for revenge on one another.

One of the biggest and most tense scenes is where Avner, and a member of Black September argue each other's point, Avner justifying the existence of Israel, and the Black September member arguing for a homeland for the Palestinians.

There are no points in confronting terrorism, is the movie's message, each time you retaliate, the other side will also retaliate.

This is definitely Spielberg's darkest film, with some of the most graphic violence recreating the assassinations of the Israeli athletes, and those looking for simple answers will not find them in this film.

Spielberg has raised some serious questions, about the state of Israel, it's existence, and how they handle and justify their defense against terrorism, and this film could anger some of his most loyal fans.

However, I applaud Spielberg for the questions, that he and his film have laid out, and the questions it asks for how our country is leading the current War on Terrorism.

One word about this film, it is surely going to be controversial, some will absolutely hail it, and some will absolutely hate it. This film will surely divide people, into some really hard decisions, that's for sure! Four stars out of four!

Nominated for five 2005 academy awards including Best Picture and Best Director, and easily one of Spielberg's overlooked masterpieces of dark drama.",9
20 January 2017,"Bombs and bullets can kill, but they never hurt as much as the truth...","Avner (Eric Bana) is a former bodyguard assigned to lead the killings of eleven men for their involvement in the Munich attacks. There's no contract because the mission doesn't ""exist"" which means that it will be taken care of, with Israel's 100% efficiency. And while it will profoundly affect the executioner, this is not a character study, unless you consider the psychological mindset of a whole country as a 'character'.

First, I had mixed feelings regarding ""Munich"", but they all converged toward a positive appreciation. If there is one thing ""Munich"" ever proves is that Spielberg, while flawed as any human being, is a man of peace, and while it became trendy to support war and attacks in the name of patriotism, it is even more admirable to question it in the same spirit. ""Munich"" would be attacked on both sides, but as Spielberg pointed out, being attacked doesn't mean ""being contradicted"".

The title refers to the hi-jacking of Israeli athletes by PLO members during the Olympic Games of 1972 and what a sneaky irony that it had to be in Germany, as if history wanted to repeat itself. The operation ended in tragedy, as eleven athletes died, to the world's shock. It was a time where Palestinians had already lost the 'communication battle'. Things would change in 1987 with the first Intifada, when kids throwing stones at Israeli tanks replaced hooded terrorists holding machine-guns, thus contributing to the first 'change of heart' in favor of the Palestinians.

But in 1972, Israel was the offended country. The film is based on George Jonas' book ""Vengeance"" chronicling the targeted assassinations against Palestinian dignitaries accused of having pulled some of the strings that lead to 'Black September': eleven men, for eleven athletes, an ""eye for an eye"" move Golda Meir took all responsibility for. She personally believed that there was no time for peace. Why wouldn't they put these men on trial like Eichmann, who did far worse? Eichmann was arrested at a time where Nazism was terminated, and the new evil from the Israeli perspective was the Arabs, as long as these influential people lived, Israeli would die.

What I admired in the film is that it doesn't only discuss the victims' actual responsibility in the Munich attacks but even the sheer value of their deaths, because each one brings more ruthless successors, perpetuating a never-ending cycle of violence. I expected the movie to open with the blood bath that triggered the whole chain of events, but this was ignoring what a master storyteller Spielberg is. He punctuates the film with elements of that fateful night as violent interludes reminding the viewers why Meir took that decision, the climax coinciding with the killings. But this is not manipulation, as one could accuse Spielberg of. The point is that violence is ugly and blind.

Spielberg depicts each assassination with a Hitchcockian attention for details, one of them involves a bomb trapped in a phone and the biggest suspense comes when a little girl is about to answer the phone instead of her father. But for all the thrills the film provides, what struck me is the way the targets, or at least the first ones, are depicted as 'harmless' people, even sympathetic: one is an Italian-speaking poet and had just finished to translate the Arabian Nights in Italian, he's an intellectual and his involvement in Munich events has been denied, another one is a doctor and a family man, when he's interviewed, he insists that many camps were bombarded by Israel (which means that there are already people who paid the price for Munich).

It seems crucial for Spielberg to shows shades of innocence in the victims or at least be indirectly vocal about the Palestinian pleas, and never without really discrediting them, and it actually pays off. When a Palestinian says that they use violence like Israel does, it also means killing innocents, it indirectly provides alibis for the target assassinations as the men killed are still less innocent than civilians. And when a PLO member discusses with Avner about the Nazi guilt, I felt this was the director of ""Schindler's List"" reminding the audience that no matter what they think about Jews and Arabs, it is a war for a land, not some extermination project.

Now, to say that Spielberg sided with Palestinians would be too much of a stretch, but the point the screenplay (the book was adapted by Eric Roth an Tony Kuschner) is that violence can't be the solution to the problems it causes. And even at the end, when most of the men are eliminated, there's no real satisfaction or overwhelming effect, it is just about a job that had to be ""done"", it could have been unfair, but there's a key scene where Avner's mother says that ""Israel had to be 'taken' because no one would have given it anyway'. At least, both sides would agree on that.

Served by a great cast: Eric Bana, Geoffrey Rush, Daniel Craig and Mathieu Kassovitz ""Munich"" explores the dark corners one country could be driven into, in order to ""make a point"", and it is very fitting that there's a part played by Michael Lionsdale because he starred in my favorite political thriller ""The Day of the Jackal"", and ""Munich"" is perhaps the closest that come to that level of documentary-like gritty realism. I didn't need to wish De Gaulle's death to somewhat 'root' for the Jackal, so I guess even an Arab could be fascinated by the level of organization put to avenge eleven athletes.

Maybe admitting that there's a lot to learn from the 'other side' can be a first step toward a reconciliation, but one of the tragedies Arab people must deal with, is that there's no Spielberg's counterpart in the Arab world, to the point that it took a Spielberg film so people could hear their voices.",9
15 January 2006,Munich - what a rip off,"Save yourself the money and just watch a documentary about that tragic event. Very little in the movie revealed anything that I had already seen in a free documentary on TV. While some of the way the assassinations were carried out revealed some new insights there was very little else that was surprising. It might be a good movie for someone who is not familiar with the Olympic tragedy, it could be equally confusing for them. Take my advice just watch the documentary. Spielberg really dropped the ball on this one. If you compare it to Schindlers List this one fails big time in comparison. I had big expectations for this movie but walked away feeling utterly disappointed as did others in the theater.

4 February 2006,Eric Bana is fantastic,"I am from Spain. Already I have seen Munich for my is one film excellent. Above all the interpretation of the actors and the assembly. Eric Bana has returned has to show because is the best actor of the world, this marvelous one, is a grief that it they have not nominated for the Oscar deserves itself it.The emotion that the gives its performance Avner, itself there is not not words to describe it I Expect that this film serve so that Eric Bana be but known in Spain, since here is almost stranger as soon as the film for my is not as violent as they say, the violence is the just one for the type of film that is, and the scenes of sex do neither exceed, the assembly is outstanding. Congratulations to ERIC BANA and to STEVEN SPIELBERG BY THE FILM.

25 December 2017,Spielberg's Bitburg,"Towards the end of Reagan's second term, he agreed to visit and lay flowers at an SS cemetery in Germany. Most people thought this was morally wrong but he did it anyway. Now Reagan was a good man and a great POTUS, but he went to hell because of this abomination.

Spielberg will join Reagan in hell for MUNICH. For a famous Jew to make a movie in which he strikes a moral equivalence between people who murdered Olympians in cold blood because they were Jewish and the people who sought to bring these murderers to justice is also an abomination. So why did Spielberg do it? Because he is much more liberal than Jewish.

The movie itself is OK. 3 stars for the cinematography and acting, but the movie reeks of cowardice and duplicity. At least the Academy didnt reward this abomination with major awards.",3

11 February 2006,A missed opportunity,"I've always had the feeling the Spielberg is the master of the popcorn blockbuster and the apprentice when it comes to anything deeper. I know that Schindler's List was an exception to this rule, but an overwhelming majority of the worlds population don't really need to examine their belief's to decide where their sympathies lie in terms of the holocaust.

For those that don't know the film shows the Israili retaliation to the Munich Olympic massacre by the Black September group. The film is nicely played and the script is good, but the film is far too pc for anything interesting or memorable to come out of it.

I suspect the movie is trying to convey the inner turmoil that goes on in the minds of terrorists, be they state supported or from any of the terrorist organisations around the world. I say 'suspect' because it completely fails in the objective. The film doesn't engage and an opportunity to consider what it must be like to be a member of Black September or Mossad is lost.

The film's Oscar nod says more for Spielberg's reputation in Hollywood than it does for the quality of the film. The film also gives little insight into the conflict that continues to threaten world peace to this day. I saw a very interesting documentary about one of the victims relatives. They said that members of the Israeli government kept them updated on the campaign, but they didn't really want revenge. The five minute interview shed more light on the incident than this film managed to do in 150 minutes.",4
14 March 2014,"An emotional, character based drama","Steven Spielberg has done it again. He is one of the best Sci-Fi directors of all time but he also shines in Non-fiction dramas as well. Personally I think this is much better than Lincoln, but not nearly as good as Saving Private Ryan. It dives deep into how Avner had to deal with the psychological troubles assassins go through. Eric Bana plays the lead and gives the character much depth that I think the other characters struggled from. May very well be Bana's best performance in his career. Daniel Craig was also good as one of his four partners, (Pre James Bond days). What I really liked about this film was the fact that they didn't cut out the Israeli's as the heroes. As dark of a film as it is, it needed lighter and more pleasant scenes, and you get that with Bana's family, lead by the beautiful Ayelet Zurer. It's truly a great historical piece, no matter how close it was to depicting true events or not. John Williams also added intensity with his score, and the cinematography was great as well. I can't really say it was an enjoyable film, considering people were being killed every 15 minutes, but its an interesting watch. Especially if your not familiar with the terrors that occurred in Munich. 8.3/10",8
3 February 2006,Fact or Fiction? Who Cares!!!,"There is a lot of controversy surrounding the credibility of the book which this is based on, is it true or just a load of lies? Well i say who cares cos it makes for an outstanding film! The story is a simple story of retribution, Eleven Israeli athletes get killed by A Palestinian terrorist organisation called Black September, to avenge there countryman the Israeli government puts together a rag tag bunch of assassins to kill off the hierarchy of black September, questions are raised about the morality of the mission and in the long run is it going to make any difference? Where this film succeeds is in it ability to shred your nerves and make your belly do backflips! It is almost definitely an emotional roller-coaster with the ability to make you laugh, cry, jump out of your seat, bite your nails and with some extremely bloody violence make even the strongest feel squeamish. Acting wise, Bana's performance for me should have got him a nod from Mr Oscar, it is a performance that shows us just how versatile he is, from maniac man (Chopper),big green bloke (hulk), sandal wearing sword swinger (Troy) to this career best performance as an under experienced assassin. Spielberg is on fine form also, making sure that we get the full effect of every emotion and every death, and although political makes it easy enough for everyone to understand. To summarise this is a barnstorming movie that never feels as long as the running time and sucks you in and wont let you go till the credits roll. Watch it i urge you!",9

16 October 2015,Spielberg at his most mature and unsentimental,"Steven Spielberg's Munich questions the value of compromising your own ideals in the name of retaliation, whether 'doing what your enemies do' is a necessary stance or the beginning of a downwards spiral towards violence and bloodshed of which there is no end, and ultimately, no point. There are ancient political and religious rivalries in Ireland, South Africa and, especially, Israel; countries that have been torn apart by civil unrest. There seems no reasonable solution apart from forgiving and forgetting, but this doesn't seem to be an option. In the wake of the terrorist attack at the 1972 Munch Olympics, Israeli prime minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) decides that lawful justice will not suffice for the murder of 11 Israeli athletes and team members.

A crack team is put together to carry out a series of carefully planned assassinations of alleged members of the Black September group. The group's leader is Avner (Eric Bana), a Mossad agent and soon-to-be father who is briefed of his task by the shadowy go- between Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush). The rest of the team is Carl (Ciaran Hinds), a clean-up man, Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), an expert bomb-maker, Steve (Daniel Craig), a South African weapons handler, and Hans (Hanns Zischler), a professional document forger. Their first hit takes them to Rome, where they are sold information on the whereabouts of target Wael Zwaiter (Makram Khoury) by a Frenchman named Louis (Mathieu Amalric), who claims to work for an organisation unaffiliated with any government.

Highly controversial upon its release, some extreme views questioned director Spielberg's sympathies and ultimate goal. For most people not directly linked to the various religious groups and organisations seen in the film, it should be clear that Spielberg makes a point in showing both sides as equally sympathetic and morally ambiguous. Every attack and execution is a result of one action or another, bringing into question the whole idea of revenge (the movie is based on the book Vengeance by Yuval Aviv, who Bana's character is a fictional substitution for). Israel itself plays a key role. Although we spend little time there. Munich takes us to Italy, Greece, England, Spain, Lebanon and America, but Israel's disputed lands are never far from the characters minds.

Avner is an especially haunted soul, questioning the ethics of his operation and plagued by visions of the events at the Munich Olympics, the latter of which are portrayed with a chilling authenticity at various point throughout the film. He later meets Louis' 'Papa' (Michael Lonsdale), who argues that family, over any government or religious organisation, is the only unit worth fighting for, casting Avner's mind back to his recently-born child. The ensemble cast do a very good job at carrying the weighty tones of the film on their shoulders, but it is Spielberg himself who is the most deserving of acclaim here. It is the director at his most mature and unsentimental, and as the industry's most famous Jew he has taken a huge risk by tackling an extremely sensitive issue. It upset the people on both sides, but that is precisely the point. How can anyone come out of such a bloodied conflict, of which there is no clear end in sight, with a clear conscience?",9

17 January 2006,Munich - A Review and a Learning Experience,"""It costs dearly, but home always does,"" said by Mathieu Amalric who played Louis in Steven Spielberg 'Munich' is all telling and should have been the bi-line for this film.

Entering the theatre I knew nothing of the subject. I was born in 1974 and have literally never heard a single thing about this tragic event. Perhaps that disabled my experience, perhaps it assisted me in watching from a fresh perspective, I am not sure. Not being a historian by any means and not being well-educated in the plights of our fellow humans on the other side of the world, this movie taught me an abundance of what I should have already learned years ago.

Spielberg, being an obvious Jewish supporter, I thought this work would have been much more biased. Instead he beautifully and intellectually demonstrated that all involved are human at their very core and are all simply fighting out of loyalty and love of home. Neither side was portrayed as monsters, heartless terrorists or simple assassins. We, as spectators, were able to sympathize with the entire situation.

This movie was phenomenally acted, beautifully written, and the direction was executed in Spielberg's usual magical essence.

I believe that this world was meant to have no boundaries. We were all meant to have a home, and that home is simply earth. Land is that on which we walk, I do not believe it is what makes us who we are. So much torment, death, and destruction in the name of Land, Home, and God. It is so sad when what we all need to realize is that belongs to each of us in our hearts, not below our feet.",8
31 December 2005,"Gripping, terrifying, emotionally wrenching.","If only it were fiction...

""Munich"" is an outstanding movie from the one director today who consistently hands us outstanding movies, making his own mark of excellence higher to reach. How can a movie maker do it again, after ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Schindler's List"" have slammed the moviegoer between the eyes?

""Munich"" begins with the 1972 massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the ""peace"" Olympics in Munich. The Israeli mission to hunt down and kill those responsible for planning the assassination is the movie's story. A team of 5 men, previously unknown to each other, none of whom is a trained killer or assassin, is assembled and their job is to seek and destroy those who were responsible for the massacre. Their leader is a man who has ""the most boring job in the country"", as he describes it to his wife; nervous, frightened-looking, inept at first, he and his team begin their mission and their discovery of killing, passion, fear, loyalty, paranoia, and the ability to retain a sense of morality in a world that increasingly shows none. Chilling, terrifying, exciting and dreadful, in the true sense of the word.

For myself, the most compelling moment was when Avner, the leader of the team, in the midst of the horror of what he is becoming, telephones his wife and hears his baby daughter for the first time. Avner's face crumbles as he weeps for what he once had, once was, once thought was so boring but was so innocent, what he can never have again.",10
6 March 2006,"Haunting, gutsy and brilliant.","Absolutely the most haunting and memorable film of 2005, if not of this century. I agree with Roger Ebert that Spielberg has very carefully and courageously placed our sympathies in this film between Israel and Palestine. However, I also feel that Spielberg simultaneously reminds us that our current ""War on Terror"" is not only unwinnable but also just part of a mankind's historical and hopeless cycle of pride, envy, murder and revenge. The latter task is a tricky one for Spielberg to pull off, but he does it so heart-wrenchingly in Munich without being terribly preachy about it. As in so many of his best films, here the action speaks so much louder than words.

Munich should have received every one of the Oscars for which it was nominated, and I would also like to have seen Eric Bana nominated for Best Actor and at least Geoffrey Rush nominated for Best Supporting Actor. It's hard, in retrospect, to imagine anyone else playing these roles so convincingly. Maybe Hollywood could someday add an ensemble category (as the Golden Globes do) for acting? Avner's team, like all the other characters, were so well cast in this film.

History may most remember Spielberg for Schindler's List, but our future is arguably more tied to Munich. What an incredible film to finally open up a dialogue upon such a crucial topic and to such a universal scale! Bravo, Mr. Spielberg! ;-)",9

24 April 2006,The cold hard truth,"War and violence are bad, we all know that, but most of us accept that sometimes under the most extreme circumstances it is necessary. Steven Spielberg's Munich explores the actions of the Israeli government's response to the massacre of the Israeli wrestling team at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games, and whether all the subsequent bloodshed was justified. Under the leadership of the patriotic Avner (Eric Banner), a group of five unofficial Mossad operatives (Including Daniel Craig) set out to exact revenge on a list of 11 men that the Israeli government say are responsible for masterminding the 1972 Black September slaughter.

This film is truly remarkable, and if not as poignant as Schindler's list it certainly comes close to being one of Spielberg's greatest films. The key to this film being so great is the cold hard truth it tells about the fine line between appropriate response and bloodthirsty vengeance. Many people die in this film both Jewish and Palestinian, but not once is death shown to be glorious or satisfying. Indeed as the Mossad squad go about their duties, the consequences of their actions weigh heavy on them to the extent of breaking point. The real life events that this film are based on could quite conceivably be an action vehicle for a Chuck Norris, or an Arnold Swarznegger type film, killing all the bad guys and helping to make the world a better place, but instead Spielberg gives a balanced and thoughtful insight into the conflict between the Israeli's and the Palestinians.

Ultimately Spielberg underlines what many of us fear about the world today, violence breeds violence and solves nothing. The one point this film really rams home is that the actions of Israel did not make the world any safer or better, they made it worse. It is entirely understandable watching Avner's decent into paranoia and despair. We see a Jewish patriot haunted by the fate of the murdered athletes, fail to get any sense of justice or satisfaction from his actions as guilt and fear overcome him. Eric Bana, who was already well regarded for roles in Troy and Chopper amongst other films, is superb portraying Avner and now surely stands up there amongst the greatest Hollywood actors of today. The normally bland Daniel Craig is also surprisingly good as a supporting actor as are all the cast, especially Geoffrey Rush and Michael Lonsdale.

If you're looking for some lightweight action entertainment I would suggest you avoid this film at all costs, however if you want to see stark reality on the futile nature of revenge and the dark nature of mankind then this film cannot be missed!",10
25 January 2006,A Balanced View from a Human Perspective,"Very fine piece. I read from several semi-trusted sources that it glorified the Israeli position over the Palestinian. Wrong. It was a balanced, personal perspective that was, at heart, anti-war. I think, any viewer would feel compassion for the Palestinian's also from this piece. However, I can see how Palestinans would not be satisfied, but trust me, the point was made several times, very explicitly, that they both share the same story. Displaced. No home. Brutal tactics. Fight or die.

I spent a month in Israel in '73. I was 19 and sleeping on the beaches at Eilat on the Red Sea. Golda Mier came to town and they used fire hoses to get us off the beach but it was all good natured. So we built hippie shanties out of cardboard in hills. I slept in city parks all around Israel and the occupied territories. Stayed in several kibbutz settlements where goats like to eat passports. I hiked alone and camped in the mountains above the Dead Sea. Played chess in open-air, dive bars drinking beer till the wee hours.

I went there to see what it was like to have your back against the wall and see what war cost you, does for you and to you. It was like going back in time to our own American Revolutionary War. I was not disappointed. That's what ""Munich"" accomplishes. War is not tidy.

I took a ship from Haifa to Cyprus. You couldn't go directly from Israel to an Arab country, so Cyprus was the stepping stone. Israel doesn't stamp the passport directly, but gave me a sheet to hold their passport stamp. That way you can toss it and get into the Arab countries. The night I got to Cyprus 30 bombs went off in the capital. It was unstable, but more from the Greeks and Turks who both claim Cyprus. I got the next ship out to Beirut.

Beirut was beautiful in '73. This was a few years before Lebanon started to melt down, but I was in the city right around the time of the para-military raid they depicted in the movie. I spent a few weeks in the Beka Valley near Syria exploring the Roman ruins. The hash oil trade was the main line of business in village where I stayed, but I declined to buy into it no matter how attractive and safe the dealers made it appear.

When I saw ""Midnight Express"" five years later in 1978 it made my butt pucker. I took the same path as the main character over land through Syria and Turkey to Europe. Syria was full of Soviet goods like the very heavy, clunky cameras that, nevertheless, worked pretty well. Turkey was full of 1956 Chevy's. I ate some bad sausage in Turkey and almost died for a few weeks. Beautiful land.

My point is that being around there a few months gave me good feel for the very complicated, intractable situation and a love for all the people involved. Steven Spielberg does an honorable job with ""Munich."" Well, maybe the last speech by main character's mother was a bit much, but just a bit. The movie depicted what I saw in the eyes of a young Israeli women soldier in '73. It's the same look I saw in eyes of a young Arab man who played a game of chess with me and shared some beer.",10
26 December 2005,surprisingly well done!,"I am not a Spielberg fan. With the sole exception of Schindler's list, I have found his films to be boring, predictable, saccharine and manupaltive. Here he has done something wonderful - he has brought the Middle East crisis forward on film as even handedly as possible - given the circumstances. The film manages to bring the suffering of both the Jews and Muslims as part of real people - that aren't that much different if you can look at it from each of their's perspectives.

I am shocked that people find this an 'ordinary film.' This is a brave film that I was even surprised could be made and distributed. And the fact that it was made by a Jew and could see the Palestinian side is even more astounding.

I really hope people see this film and it makes everyone think a little more about what is happening other than just 'some crazy terrorists killing people.' There is a reason behind every violent act - and while, in my opinion, that violence is never justified, the motives for the violence are sometimes understandable. I believe it is through this understanding that peace may one day be achieved.

It is very hard to talk about the film without getting emotionally involved in it's subject matter. I think anyone who really cares about what is going on in the Holy Land will be moved by this film. The acting was great and my only real complaint is the graphic nudity and sexual situations that I just felt could have been avoided and the same message conveyed.

This is not just a great film - but an important one. And I am fortunate that someone with enough clout like Spielberg could get this distributed in theaters.",9
2 April 2006,My Munichcipalaties have decided that this film deserves a Silver medal!,"Steven Spieldberg has been praised as the premier ""gold medal"" director in cinematic history. There are many that share that sentiment while others that opinion that he is more in the ""silver or bronze"" auteur medal category. Why I am I getting into such a ""medalica"" state in describing Spieldberg's career? Because his latest controversial flick is inspired by true events of a historic horrific Olympic tragedy. Many know it as Black September. It was during the 1972 Summer Olympics held in Munich when 11 Israeli athletes & coaches were assassinated by a Palestinian terrorist group. The premise of ""Munich"" is what happened next. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir ordered a vengeance strike against the Palestinians planners of Black September. The Israeli covert revenge team was led by a former security officer turned agent named Avner. His subordinates were comprised of a former toymaker now bomb crafter, a forgery specialist, a practical agent, and an experienced schematic hit specialist. These Mossad agents are not exactly the Israeli armed forces ""high five"" but remember the operation was very clandestine one. The main focal point is that they seek revenge for Munich, non-stop. It is no bullocks that the film has sparked up controversy from Palestinian and even Israeli groups. Palestinians state that Spieldberg depicts them as unmerciful terrorists while Israelis state that he was too lenient against the non-pals Palestis. Personally, I thought Spieldberg was too harsh against his own Israelis, ""jew"" know what I mean. Hey, if this film is controversial why can't this review be of the same caliber? The film's ""message for peace"" signifies that revenge is useless and non-resolving by having Israeli apply egoistic vengeful tactics. Eric Bana executed a Herculean performance as Avner. Bana masterfully portrayed Avner as a righteous family man, a devoted countryman, and later a conflicted hit-man. Spieldberg's recreation of the Munich horror integrated with actual footage was resourceful and effective. The screenplay of ""Munich"" was complex, but yet, suspenseful. Writers Tony Kushner and Eric Roth did give ""Munich"" justice by giving Spieldberg their ""words"". Undoubtedly, Spieldberg has developed a cerebral film. ""Munich"" is not a masterpiece, but it is startling enough for one never to forget that striking back is the same as striking out. Games Over! **** Good",8
16 February 2006,A Haunting Steven Spielberg Masterpiece,"I'm a very big Steven Spielberg fan and I love all his films. Since Schindler's List, this is Spielberg's best movie next to Saving Private Ryan. Munich is a film that is a thriller that deals with the aftermath of the tragic events at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany when Black September took the Israeli team hostage. The movie does not get very political, but stays more with their characters. A group of assassins is hired to seek and kill the people who planned the attack. Eric Bana gives a superb performance, which is Oscar-Worthy, as a husband and father who leaves on this mission that nearly drives him mad and makes him question his motives of why he is doing what he is doing. The memorable aspect of this film is the tragic flashbacks of the events at Munich with the Israeli team being taken hostage to their haunting deaths at the end. Steven Spielberg, creates another memorable film that is a masterpiece and one of the best films of 2005.

9 October 2009,One of the worst movies directed by Steven Spielberg (if not the worst!),"From my point of view 'Munich' is one of the worst movies directed by Steven Spielberg, if not the worst: too long, boring and rethorical (with the worst rhetoric inside).

The facts who inspire the movie have been reproduced so badly that sometimes sounds improbable if not ridiculous.

About the movie message that would be an accuse act against the violence and its perverse consequences I haven't found it: it seems more focalizing on the director point of view... everyone can agree or disagree with it but certainly it doesn't help to understand too many things.

2 February 2006,Oscar nomination for Munich - how could this happen!!!?,"How could anyone so indulgently spend so much money to make such a tedious movie. I know I was not the only person in the theatre looking at my watch. Spielberg should be given a slap for every cliché.

One doesn't have to take sides to know murder is wrong whatever the circumstances, but Speilbergs attempt to humanize both Mossad and the terrorists is downright embarrassing. The slaughter at the Munich Olympics followed by the revenge killings was a rough, brutal moment in our history and I feel this movie totally missed the point. I expected a sharp, violent depiction but instead was presented with simplistic, sentimental soap.

Others I have spoken to had a similar response. One left the movie without empathy and no interest in what it had to say.

21 September 2010,"Affecting, dramatic thriller with unbalanced point of view","""Munich"" is Steven Spielberg's thriller about the Israeli act of reprisal against Palestinian assassins for the murder of 11 participants in Munich's Olympic Games of 1972. Or let's better say it is based on it. Most things in the movie were invented by Spielberg to create a thriller for cinema, and he was successful. It is a thrilling story about five men who fight for their country. Just to realize, that in the end they all made everything even worse. That is the message of the movie, and it is a good message: revenge doesn't help, but it makes the situation worse. But the movie has some problems with being unpolitical. Too often the Israelis are shown as the insentient evil killers and their Palestinian victims are people, who appear to be nice and not very cruel. After some time you have the feeling it is an anti-Israeli movie. OK, not really that drastically, but the balance is somehow missing. Furthermore I think it was not intelligent of Spielberg to choose an important historical event with strong political background for a thriller that ends up being not correct in its historical background. Together with the imbalanced presentation of Israelis and Palestinian people, it is dangerous for people who don't know what really happened in 1972. I think many people who saw that movie still believe that it was a correct movie and that the Israelis are the ""evil"" persons. And that is the big problem about this otherwise really great film. Movies about an event that really happened and which are of historical and political importance shouldn't be reduced to a thriller for entertainment, if they don't show the truth.

It was somehow hard to find an adequate conclusion for ""Munich"". I think the best I can say is: The movie is great, it is thrilling, sad and has a good message, BUT: Please read up the historical background before watching it, or at least don't take the movie to seriously in its correctness.",7
29 June 2007,true story,"at first when i looked at the box and seen 2:44 run time i was like oh no,, i'll be bored, but to my delight i was not. the only thing that i wish that they would have done in this movie is shown more of the planning involved in the actual killing of the hostages at the Olympic area, other than that i liked the movie in general with few complaints. the object was to kill those responsible for munich , 11 of them i believe, there is also a mention of Carlos the Jackal midway through the movie. i thought it was funny that the team leader of the assassain group was a chef, you had the bomb maker,, the identity fixer, and the guy who cleans up other people's messes. on the whole the movie seemed to be very accurate in fact, based on a book written in 1984. there is lo'ts of blood and gore in this one, some action, but not as much as i would have liked, from a historical point of view i think it was a good movie, just bugged me where they started the movie,, they s hould have started say like the day before, but enjoyable throughout, with only one or two parts that should have stayed on the cutting room floor.

15 January 2006,"murky morality, powerful execution","""Munich"" is a pseudo-docu-thriller that is brilliantly stylized and performed, with a rollicking pace that makes its near-three-hour run time pass with surprising efficiency. While this dramatization of the events that followed the massacre of 11 athletes at the 1972 Olympics at Munich is, at heart, rather basic revenge fodder, and its message of ""Who are the REAL terrorists?"" is less than profound, Steven Spielberg makes every moment count. Eric Bana is an Israeli leading an innocuous team of everyman 'experts' (one skilled in bookkeeping; another in explosives, etc.) across Europe to search out and kill the masterminds behind the Munich massacre. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that the issue at hand is NOT the 'bad men,' but the principle of violence/vengeance itself, and the effects it has on the morality of the individual; Spielberg uses flashbacks of the actual Munich crimes as a simple method of iterating this. The group of men exhibit a heartfelt rapport on par with the company in ""Saving Private Ryan""; the violence is handled in a similar way, with gritty choreography and cringe-inducing sound effects that drive the feeling home. Of all the films that have come out in the wake of 9/11, ""Munich"" might be the most attuned to our current attitudes and mentalities, while giving us a fittingly ambiguous answer to the question of violence itself.

6 January 2007,Seriously and incredibly overlooked and unappreciated,"This film, like a select few of Spielberg's is what i like to call his collection of secret pleasures. these films, which include schindler's list are made by Spielberg for his own personal benefit in many ways. Walking into the theatre as a favor to my sister who wanted to see this film. I thought is was going to be about confusing and boring politics of foreign countries observed in an American point of view. I thought it would be boring and extremely confusing to someone like me. I thought it was one of those films that would only be enjoyable to a viewer who's main passion in life was poring politics of foreign countries. I was extremely mistaken. Five minutes into the film I sat up and paid attention to what it had to say. putting all my prejudice aside i watched it and was enthralled by what I saw. I left the theatre entranced and in love. I was shocked and delightfully surprised. Eric banna was absolutely amazing and IMO was cheated out of an Oscar, because he deserved it. The film was also made by the supporting cast members, too many to name. I was delighted that is was nominated for best film but IMO it was a sick and quite tasteless joke that Crash won. Even though I knew there was no chance of Munich winning. the Oscars are far too political to give the award to a film like Munich, or even BBM. But if you haven't seen this film i suggest you go to your nearest blockbuster (or netflix) and rent it for a measly 3.99, its a small price for such a delightful film.",10
26 August 2009,Joseph Goebbels eat your heart out.,"Steven Spielberh here directs a glorifying homage to revenge and violence. Which is fine if your making fiction, but is this a responsible way to deal with an important issue?

Some directors, Quentin Tarantino for example, get away with making films which bear no clear relationship to the morality or social laws which help society function on a daily basis. They do this by making it obvious that the film is a film, and is set in a separate (and in QT's example highly stylised) world, inconsistent with ours but relatively consistent with itself. This allows the presentation of violence in a somewhat positive light without the director being suceptible to accusations of moral vacuosity.

Spielberg here does not benefit from such a protective screen. Setting the film in the real world yet also presenting pre meditated violence as a brilliant virtue of Mossad is dubious to start with. But why present one type of violence (violence and terrorism with an emancipatory based legitimacy argument) as totally senseless, and another (A world wide romp of revenge and pre meditated murder) as the wholesome redemption of the Israeli international pride? It seems Spielberg may not have approached this from an independent perspective.

This would be fine, if he wasn't convincing other viewers of its Documentary like unbiased depth. This is a film which is designed wholeheartedly to promote the Israeli world view, and based in a mindset of hate, revenge and a lack of dialogue, which would be great entertainment if it didn't try and pretend it was a fair and realistic presentation of fact.",1
9 January 2006,Munich Has A Faulty Premise: Innocence,"Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's ""Munich"" seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. ""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, ""When does it ever end?""

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. ""Munich"" could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul. ""When does it ever end?"" Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",7
1 February 2006,Israel was right by killing the terrorists.,"I have just recently seen Munich which has impressed me very much not only for its good story but also because of the extraordinary performance of all the actors. Apart from the story itself what Spielberg tells us is an important question not only about the conflict between the Israelites and the Palestinians (despite of the fact that I am not a Jew, I have to declare that my position is in favor of Israel) but also about the human nature. Is it right to take revenge of any kind against all those who have killed our people? He declared his total opposition against the killings of the terrorists because he thinks that violence only creates violence this is why in this movie what happens makes the audience think about the consequences of our acts of revenge. Although I like him very much and think that his words are absolutely beautiful, the reality is that those sport men were brutally killed by a gang of terrorists who were and are still supported by terrorists nations such as Iran which are never condemned in the UNO and nobody did nothing. Israel was right in its actions otherwise all the Arab nations would have tried to exterminate the Jews something that is happening in these days. It was right to kill them because this is not a normal conflict between two nations, the problem is that the Arabs want to destroy Israel and consequently they want the extermination of the Jews population. I support Israel.",
11 January 2006,Spielberg delivers again,"Steven Spielberg delivers another fine movie to add to his impressive repertoire. He captures the 1970s feel with clever use of archive footage, and mixes this brilliantly with recreated footage. The film grabs its authenticity from the simple ordinariness of the assassination team. There is no 'day of the jackal'-type reporting, just a group of people gathered together to do a job. Admittedly Bana plays his role well but for me, Geoffrey Rush steals the show. Every scene that he's in, he dominates. A fine performance. This is without doubt a war film, and one that eloquently shows us both the futility of war and the shifting nature of it too. Perhaps it's an indictment to man's efforts in the region that we seem hardly to have moved on at all when it comes to peace and tolerance between these two nations. As usual, Spielberg gives me food for thought for many days.

31 January 2006,intense and mature,"It's not a usual Steven Spielberg's film; this time, the director that got us used to commercial and sentimental productions, has examined the consequences of Munich Black September with a thought-provoking movie. It is definitely very violent but greatly acted and surely compelling, moreover explores the political situation of that time in a meticulous and thorough way, showing at the same time how Israel operated after those terrorist acts. Perhaps runtime is too long but Munich is not at all the kind of movie that bores the audience, on the contrary it is so gritty and deep that you don't even realize it's getting a bit too long in the final part.

2 March 2006,A living proof about Spielberg's geniality,"At first I thought this movie is one of those 'new and no story' movies. I didn't have a clue it was directed by 'the Genius'. The story is outstanding-the story is true. Bana did his job extremely well, in fact great. things that happened during Cold War were absolutely illogical and one of those things is described in this masterpiece. On one side Spielberg shows us a story about revenge and war between Israelians and Arabs and on the another side it is story about a man who had a family and hope for better and peacefully life. I have no words any more, I'm fascinated and positively surprised. I hardly wait for new Spielberg's movie-it should be another piece of art.

3 December 2016,A master filmmaker's take on Munich massacre,"I watched this movie today and i was deeply traumatized after what happened to those innocent Israeli athletes who were brutally slaughtered and the German authorities failed to save them, the best part i liked in this movie was the thrilling factor which gave me goosebumps while watching. i can somehow relate it to an Indian's point of view as India also has enemies who masterminded the 1993 Bombay bomb blasts and the gruesome carnage which paralyzed Mumbai for 3 days are still on the run. This movie is a must watch for every Indian soldier who has the desire to serve and die for the country. The violent scenes could have been toned down a bit but otherwise it is still outstanding.

23 December 2005,"Terrific movie, with Spielberg politically naive; Kushner self-hating","I bring certain insights regarding the Mideast into this movie i just watched. If you are only interested in the human drama which is so excellently portrayed, my remarks may appear irrelevant to you. Since we are nearing the ""next holocaust"" for the Jewish (Israeli) people, I must share my insights now. Owning dual citizenship as an American and Israeli, i also share many years of deep research into the history of Israel's place in the Mideast. It is therefore, with resignation that i watched the movie bend its knee to the accepted left-wing viewpoints totally accepted by Tony Kusner (he sits on a board of the most shameful pro-Arab Jews) and to some extent naively assumed as truth by Mr. Spielberg. This is most evident here by the unspoken assumption that the Arabs are freedom fighters for a land ""taken by force"" by Jews (Israelis). This is the classical BIG LIE of the terrorists and believed by the Left, and it is unfortunate that it is not only kept solidly in place in this movie, but given credence (while the majority of Arabs came to Israel for employment under the Zionist enterprise in the 1930's and 40's, every one now claims his grandfather had orange groves and olive trees taken by the Jews.) While this is common knowledge in Israel, Spielberg falls for it in a major scene of moral- equivalence. The vitriolic, unapologetic Jew hatred so evident in all Arab countries is not deemed important enough to even address, nor deemed as important as pointing out their refugee camps (in reality slum cities kept in place by the Arabs thru the UN) or the fact that there was no ""Palestinian movement"" even in years prior to 1967, when Jordan and Egypt held the West Bank and Sinai, respectively. In other words, there is not a single character who really speaks for an intelligent, historically accurate. strong nationalist Israeli position. A position that would be regarded as ""normal"" for any other country.",8
19 June 2016,underrated,"Munich is the most underrated film of Spielberg, is very little spoken, whenever you speak of Spielberg, comes in your mind films like Schindler List, Saving Private Ryan, Jurassic Park and Jaws, Munich is rarely mentioned, what it is sad, because Munich in my opinion along with Saving Private Ryan is the best two Spielberg films (the ones that I saw), the script is good, has great dialogue, the direction is excellent, Spielberg manages to make the film that has three hours does not get tedious, the soundtrack is good, the cast is great, Eric Bana is excellent, the chemistry of the 5 major players is very good, the film is violent, has very violent times, plans to assassinate the terrorists are very good, are moments you waiting to see, and the action scenes are great, Spielberg rarely leaves to be desired in those moments, Munich is a great movie with a great cast and full of great moments, perhaps the last great movie Spielberg unfortunately an underrated film.

2 January 2007,One of Spielberg's best - an important and thought-provoking film,"""Munich"" is not an easy film to watch - it is realistically (and sometimes gratuitously) violent, it is disturbing, it can be rather hard to follow at times, and it is quite long (at nearly three hours) - but it is a rewarding film that provokes thought...something which, unfortunately, many Hollywood films fail to accomplish these days.

It is very loosely based on the aftermath of Black September and the 1972 Munich Massacre in Germany, during which eleven Israeli athletes were slaughtered by Palestinian terrorists who had tried to use the hostages as leverage in a political battle.

Following the attack, the Israeli government assembled a crew of Jewish men to travel across West Europe and assassinate the figures involved in the planning of the events in Munich. The team of five is led by the character portrayed by Eric Bana, and he begins to wrestle with his own tormented conscious as he questions whether his actions are just or if he is merely being used as a pawn to carry out secret government killings.

The cast is top-notch, and it's one of Spielberg's most well-directed films in ages. It's refreshing to see this after a string of generic no-brainers such as ""War of the Worlds"" and ""The Terminal."" This echoes ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Schindler's List"" as some of the riskiest material Spielberg has worked with, but he manages to pull it off without taking sides (as many have tried to twist it into some type of Israel-.vs.-Pakistan debate). He also manages to take the material - of which there isn't much available documented facts - and make it compelling and engaging without necessarily going out of his way to distort facts. In his DVD introduction, Spielberg explains that creative liberties had to be taken simply due to the fact that no one has ""come out"" yet and really released any definitive information on what, exactly, happened after the Munich massacre. The only thing that's known is that a group was assembled, and nine of eleven targets were assassinated across Europe in the months that followed.

The film provokes discussion and, although some better editing could have brought its runtime down a good twenty minutes or so, Spielberg proves once again that when he's at the top of his game he really is a great director - one can only hope that he begins to work like Scorsese and choose his projects more carefully.",9

29 December 2005,Disappointing due to mixed message,"Spielberg, I'm afraid, is more concerned about pleasing Hollywood than he is in pleasing Jerusalem.

Everyone knows there are no winners in a war against terrorism and that terrorism begets terrorism. This is elementary, so the movie has to be more than just that.

Everyone also knows innocent people get hurt in terrorism, so again, this message is juvenile because we all know that too.

So what is this movie primarily saying? You have to first see this through the eyes of the protagonist - Avner (Eric Bana).

First, Avner went through a 180 moral metamorphosis here. In the beginning, he was all for these assassinations. By the end of the movie, he no longer wanted any part in it and even defected from Israel. He didn't like it when he realized he and his family could be targets like the people he hunted down. I think the movie wanted you to identify (and side with?) Avner's reasoning/conflict.

Second, I believe the movie wants you to be disgusted with vengeance and the scene with the Twin Towers at the end was put there to heighten these feelings even more (to make it personal to Americans). Ultimately, terrorism can and did end up at our (USA) doorstep. Was the Twin Towers a result of Munich? Maybe indirectly it was. Is America supposed to wink at terrorism and do nothing because vengeance is wrong and ultimately doesn't serve a useful purpose except begetting more violence? I think everyone knows terrorism is in America because America supports Israel.

So what? What should Israel had done in the face of Munich? Nothing? What are we Americans to do about terrorism today? Not support Israel anymore? The problem in the Middle East is much deeper than Munich. Because I believe Golda Meir and Israel's act of vengeance were projected in a negative light, I believe this movie ultimately will sway people against Israel and thus our support of Israel.

For that reason alone, I find this moving wanting. The Middle East Conflict is much bigger than any retaliation of one event (Munich). If Spielberg wanted to make a statement against retaliation, he should have picked a better forum than Munich.",9
1 September 2006,Major Disappointment,"This COULD have been a good film IF the director had been disciplined enough to decide on just what kind of film genre he wanted to make and then stuck to it.

Instead Spielberg goes from action/adventure to caper to political thriller to drama all the while throwing in some not so subtle propaganda.

No wonder the movie was almost three hours long! The film would have worked so much better if Spielberg had condensed some of the killings into one montage. Not JUST because the movie would have been shorter but because the montage would have emphasized, cinematically, the fact that the killings were starting to get out of control and become blurred...instead of just showing the same basic scene over and over again.

Spielberg needs to look at some of Francis Coppola's films to get a lesson in what a good montage scene can do for a film.

The other thing that really bothered me about the film is when a director manipulates the audience into thinking that he's somehow above the fray of politics and that the film being shown is somehow morally on a higher ground. It especially bothers me when the film in question, winds up being very politically pointed, though the director would be loathe to admit it.

And I'm not arguing whether I agreed or disagreed with the politics in the movie. What I'm saying is that there ARE political sides taken, though perhaps not the obvious ones demonstrated by the characters in the movie, but still, political views, by the director were espoused. So if that's the case, at least be straightforward about it instead of manipulating me and and further publicly stating that the movie was above ""politics"".

Case in point: The movie ends when two characters in an outside location in the NY Metropolitan area walk away from each other and the viewer is left with a shot of the skyline of NY City.

You guessed it...The twin towers of the World Trade Center are the most noticeable reference point in the shot. Hardly a coincidence in a three hour movie dealing with terrorism.

Obviously Spielberg was again, stating his political agenda loud and clear. Which is fine, but the movie, like its director, refuses to accept ownership of its own beliefs.

And on a more personal note, I thought one of the later scenes inter-cutting Bana having intercourse with his wife while yet another terrorist attack was being perpetrated was not moving...it was just gross.

Again, Mr. Spielberg should watch some of Mr. Coppola's films to see how ""GOOD"" montages are done.

I do want to say though, that Eric Bana is a strong leading man who has a lot of charisma. He should have a long career ahead of him.",6
1 October 2013,a tragedy causes a chain of revenge,"This is based on the Munich massacre and Israel's vengeance after that. Avner Kaufman, acted by Eric Bana, is appointed as a leader of assassination team by the Israeli government to revenge the people who arranged the Munich massacre. Although Avner carries out the plan successfully at first, bloody days and unstoppable violence gradually deprive him of his mind.

Steven Spielberg is mainly known for his entertaining movies, such as Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park or E.T. However, he shows another talent in this movie. In fact I can't believe he made this even now. He dealt with so difficult and complicated topics; a conflict based on history and religion and a chain of hatred. In making this movie, he didn't simplify the situation and events but succeeded in editing those as a single work. In addition, owing to the great directions, we can feel a gloomy atmosphere suitable for this bloody movie all around the scenes. As a whole, I think this is one of the masterpieces of movie world.

Is there a justifiable murder in the world? This movie put the question to us, but never tells us the answer. Violence leads to another violence. But nevertheless, we sometimes view that as necessary. I couldn't watch this without thinking over such a thing. Actually this movie doesn't leave pleasant aftertaste. However, I'm sure it's worth watching. Try this, and then, what do you think of it?",10

7 February 2006,An exceptional film about an exceptional event,"Having just seen this film tonight I think it is the best film of it's type I've seen in the last 10 years. On the surface it operates as a taught and exciting thriller based on actual events. Beneath the surface the messages for those who are prepared to open their minds and their hearts is that in a world where an 'eye for an eye' justice is followed then we will all end up blind. For every violent act of justice one society performs against another so they will live in fear of retribution. What is justice, and when does it become vengeance and when does vengeance become no more than murder or genocide.

The screenplay is excellent, the cast work well individually and together and for me Eric Bana is SUPERB and should have got the Best Actor Award because he easily was. Likewise Spielberg's directing is superb and engages the viewer and carries them along both emotionally and intellectually.

This isn't a film everyone will like for those who dismiss the film then I would have to question their agenda. It's a film I liked and would strongly recommend.",10
2 October 2020,Can be a bit slow and clunky at times.,"Munich is a film examining the gruesome events in the 1972 Munich Olympics and its aftermath. We follow a team of Mossad hitmen who track down the men responsible for the massacre with vengeance.

Spielberg doesn't disappoint with this film at all. The action is satisfying and brutal. Tension leaves audiences at the edge of their seats. And there is a ton of focus on realism, which I enjoyed. We see the trigger event, planning, execution, and retaliation phases of the operation. The plot may be slow at times but the action is worthwhile when it does happen.

The film also answers our questions about the team's logic and rationality. There were times I asked questions about different things within the film only to have it answered later on. These were done by weaving them in dialogue in a thoughtful and natural way.

Another aspect of this film I loved was the examination of the aftereffects of the operation. Munich goes a bit further than the usual vengeance films and shows us the aftereffects of such a high profile operation. We see the other side retaliates and the paranoia that infects our protagonist's life.

Munich also did a great job of asking larger questions to the audience. Many times the film reminds us that killing one leader of only leads to more brutal leaders sprouting up. The film extends this logic out and asks us how these conflicts ever end? Some work is also done in showing the PLO's logic and beliefs as well. We also see the complexities of Mossad vs with other spy organizations. Though some of these points were not as explored as much as I'd like.

But some things hold this film back from being a true masterpiece.

For starters, it's a 2 and a half-hour long film. Though not a fault in itself, I felt that some scenes were clumsily added in and may not have been needed. While the first and second acts are strong, the third act felt a bit weak and I was dissatisfied with the ending.

Not to mention that awkward sex scene...

3.5/5. A great examination of Munich & the Mossad operation in retaliation.",7

12 February 2015,Extraordinary!,"Every film made by Spielberg left a mark on me for good. That guy simply has all the talent and information and resources to make a good film. This film is no exception. Many things are said about Steven, but I just want to add this. He simply had all the best in him to make it to the top, not only in the movie making but in the American and civilized world. He is respected by many people, and rightfully so. Too bad we do not have more people like him in the world. World would of been a better place. However, I am not sure that is possible given state of the affairs in the world today. It is probably going to get worse, and I am afraid that a civilized part of the world is going to get more uncivilized. Unfortunately!

As far as this film goes, everything was fantastic, from the beginning to the end, plot, acting, sets. The scene which will stick in my, and probably in everyone else*s mind is the scene of the murder of the naked Dutch woman.

13 January 2006,On par with Schindler's List,"What Mr. Spielberg has gone and done is something that only a few filmmakers in the history of cinema have managed. He has managed to create a film of history that explains our current situation beyond any film I have seen since September 11th(the last shot of the film supports this). Spielberg is one the few directors remaining who is able to yield to the actors talent allowing them the freedom to truly ACT. The film was long, no doubt, and should be seen in the theater, but in view of the length, Spielberg never loses our attention. Flawlessly written, directed, acted, and edited, this film is stuff of greatness. By far the best film of the year. If anything the most underrated film of the year as well. If it fails to win Best Picture than the academy should take a year or two off to evaluate its judges. Dark, yet supreme.

2 January 2006,"Spielberg pulls a ""180"" on Israel.","Before laying out money to see Steven Spielberg's much-hyped Munich, I would urge you to read a recent explanation in the Wall Street Journal as to why people who support Israel are outraged by Hollywood's latest attempt to undermine the struggle against Muslim terrorism.

The movie, surprisingly, characterizes terrorists more sympathetically than the Israelis who combat them. Its historical accuracy is highly dubious. Spurious straw man arguments are put in the mouths of Israelis in support of their actions. A false dichotomy is created between supposed Jewish ideals and Israeli behavior, as if it were a tenet of the Jewish faith that they should passively let their enemies slaughter them. The movie's hero ends up turning his back on Israel, and regarding the Mossad as the enemy.

In an apparent effort to support the bizarre reasoning of some who seem to regard terrorism as a natural and legitimate response to our response to it, the butchering of Israeli athletes that sets the story in motion is put at the END of the movie. Evidently, the intent is to disorient viewers as to cause and effect, leaving a subconscious impression that Israel's punishment of the Palestinian killers is the only thing that made them kill in the first place.

Tony Kushner, who was brought in to rework the original screenplay, considers the birth of the state of Israel to be ""a historical, moral, political calamity,"" the policy of the Israeli government to have been ""a systematic attempt to destroy the identity of the Palestinian people,"" and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to be an ""unindicted war criminal."" Little wonder, then, that there was little, if any, pre-release publicity attached to this project.

Be warned: Spielberg (aka The Maestro), for all his God-given talent, has produced the most expensive anti-Isreali political statement in the history of the Middle East. He's apparently forgotten that Israel is presently surrounded by nations and ideologies that pray daily for guidance on how best to complete what Hitler began.

NEVERTHELESS, this is a beautifully shot, brilliantly acted film. My Chicago homeboy, Janusz Kaminski, gives yet another example of why he is arguably the greatest cinematographer in film history. Bana & Rush are again very compelling, as are the myriad Isreali & Sabra actors featured here.

Truly, I regard The Maestro as the preeminent storyteller of modern film. As such, my disappointment aside, I'll again be first in line to see what he comes up with next.",5
8 June 2006,2nd Best movie of 2005,"Spielbergs epic about the revenge Mossad unofically took out on palestinian terrorists who were responsible for kidnapping Israeli athletes in 1972 munich olympics is both thought provoking and highly entertaining. The acting was first rate, and the screenplay was extraordinary from Eric Roth and Tony Kushner. The direction was also great from Spielberg, this one of my favorites from him. After watching this film, it made me think about a lot of things, i am a very political person and i thought Spielberg captured reality pretty well with this one, he showed different sides and didn't make unnecessary directorial commentary. Although i disagree with spielberg on many issues, i thought this film was great because it was pretty unbiased which is hard to be on a topic like this. 10/10

17 February 2006,Horrendous - waste of time,"I have to admit my confidence, Mr.Spielberg was had faded if not dissappeared after the last Jurassic debacle, but with re-newed faith I gave this film every chance to change a faltering opinion of someone hailed as one of the greatest directors, to my cost I must emphasise. They say a director is alone in his interpretation of his subject matter, in this case very much so as I would be surprised if anyone with a modicum of sense enjoys what is basically self indulgent and very pointless filming with and repeat formula that in this case had me hoping that even the dinosaurs would appear to brighten the day, no such luck. I fought sleep throughout, concede to Mr.Craig who I am sure will go forth to be the very best Bond since Connery or Lazenby, that he must have been tempted by the price tag and of course wowed by the Spielberg label and pedigree in the sad and very insular world which encompasses the Hollywood clique of has beens and played outs who now hold dominion over the majority of your visual leisure. Spielbergs only good move here was casting Craig, doubtless on the basis of his forthcoming fame as 007 in the hope that it would sell what is other wise a waste of your cinema admission. Stay at home for this one, it makes Eastenders dangerous and new. Gibberish, every word of it.",1

5 February 2006,Empty movie,"This was my greatest disappointment in the last year. The movie is completely empty.

Looking for action? Sorry, the old lady next door would be able to handle situations better than trained agents. Psycholgy of the main hero? Even a runway for the new Airbus is curved compared to the movie. I do not mention the historical (im)precision; I believe the movie was not made to be a document. In addition, it was not interesting visually, Paris did not look like Paris (do not get mistaken by the Eiffel tower shot), London is characterised by heavy rain....

And the last observation, the movie could be one hour longer or shorter - no difference.

""When does it ever end?"" Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",10
15 February 2014,A Monumental Achievement,"I totally loved this movie not only because it was directed by my all time favorite director Steven Spielberg, The reason why i loved this movie is because the movie explains the story of these men who are hired to kill the people responsible for the Black September terrorist attacks at the 1972 Munich Olympics, Director Steven Spielberg completely knows what he is doing behind the camera. Curse those jerks at the academy because Spielberg didn't win the Oscar for best director because he totally deserved it. Munich also deserved to win best picture at that ceremony, the movie also has a very vengeful plot to it. The movie features great performances from the entire cast including Eric Bana,Daniel Craig, Geoffrey Rush,Ciaran Hinds,and Michael Lonsdale.Those of you who didn't watch this masterpiece watch it, but kids i think tat you should wait until you get a little older in order to watch it by yourself.

25 December 2005,A very average movie from a very talented director,"When you achieve the success that Mr. Spielberg has, it's probably difficult to get others to tell you the truth and how they really feel about your work, or for you to listen to them, if they do.

This could have been a very interesting exploration of the tension between being forgiving and seeking vengeance. The film skims that issue but never really delves into it.

Instead, it is a rather boring version of Mission Possible. No real techno stunts or tension. Very predictable and rather boring. The New Yorker review is right on point.

Mr. Spielberg, it's been a long time since you've given us a movie that reflects your true talents. I hope we see one in the year ahead.

20 August 2006,The trauma suffered by Mossad agents,"Munich is definitely among the top of Spielberg's best movies. The movie is well crafted right from the way the title is displayed(showing all cities involved in the movie(incident) to the end of the movie where the director sends a strong message to the Zionist regime (or) even the warring nations at a larger picture.Eric bana shines as Avner exemplifying the saying 'Action speaks louder than words'.He is a stern Mossad agent who is asked to kill 11 Palestinian names, who are said to have planned the Munich massacre. But as the operation goes on, he starts losing his partners, all of them realizing that what they are doing is not righteous and Jewish.Ironically, everyone who realizes his fault face tragic end and the one who doesn't budge till the end escapes unscathed. Avner suffers a great mental trauma mistaking natural events for a bid on his life and loses peace totally that he is unable to enjoy his wife. He starts doubting whether the persons he kills were actually behind the Munich operation and gets out of mossad leaving a strong message that 'there is no peace at the end of all this'.A must watch movie . P.S. The movie is not at all biased.He gives the two chances for the arabs to explain their side. Hats off to the genius for maintaining neutrality in this movie. But,the israelis seem to be disgruntled with this movie which was expected.",10
7 September 2020,Great film,"The movie works at different levels. At the surface, it feels almost like a thriller action movie, but when you start enjoying that aspect of it, you question the enjoyment since the movie is based on real life assassinations. The end left me profoundly questioning why I enjoyed the movie and who's side I was on.

3 January 2006,Intelligent even gripping movie but without the killer punch,"""Munich"" is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seats for the first hour or so. It is fast-paced, slickly done (but then what else would you expect of Spielberg), and the editing is taut. The acting is competent without being exceptional. The script puts more emphasis on incidents than characters. With all these good things going for it, the movie still fails to deliver the killer punch that will make you remember the movie a month from when you watched it and cause you to think. The killing of the Palestinian terrorists responsible for the Munich Olympic Game massacre is a matter of faith with this devoted group. However, after the first few killings, I lost the point behind it. A few gripping scenes yes, a few bloody scenes yes, but where is the narrative that strings all these together. The movie to me loses its message in its overemphasis on style. The human element, the one thing that I absolutely insist on in a movie, is there but again without the punch. The protagonist echoed my feeling when he said they have killed a bunch of terrorists yes, but only for each one to be replaced with someone more bloodthirsty. This is where the good guys lose their moral legitimacy and ultimately their ability to carry the audience (ok, I am speaking for myself but maybe not).",6
13 December 2020,Shameful Israeli propaganda,"I couldn't get through more than 15 minutes but whenever they show any Israelis they're all poised and perfect angelic humans and of course the big bad Arabs are always screaming and sweaty and angry. F off. If you wanted to make a movie about the incident at the Munich Olympics maybe try to understand how it got to that point. Then you'd inevitably start at Zionism and learn about it's flaws. But nope. Not in Hollywood can't do that. Palestinians are bad boom boom action blood kill em all. Idiot Spielberg or should I say Shillberg

24 January 2007,I'm not a Spielberg fan and this film too is a disappointment,"Spielberg loves to show violence - be it with a knife, a gun, or using sex to depict violence in the body, mind or spirit. There is usually this twisted edge to his films, I include Schindler's List in this for sure...but Munich is a very bizarre film. I am not sure what Spielberg was trying to do with the film. Having lived in Israel during the Munich massacre, I was very aware of Israeli culture, language, behavior and most of the scenes that take place in Israel are just very poor in portraying the Israeli world. It may seem incidental, but to use 'Yiddish' phrasing rather than Hebrew phrasing was truly annoying. Eric Bana is miscast. Sorry everyone, he just is not believable as a young Israeli Mossad agent. The rest of the Israeli Mossad team - well they too just don't give me the feeling that I am watching Israelis. And from there the film goes down hill for me. Spielberg lost me within the first 5 minutes.

I could write a scene by scene criticism of the film, but I have to be honest, the film is boring. 1972 was a very interesting year on the planet. I never felt like I was in the year 1972. Add to that, Spielberg and the script, does not give me enough insight into Black September - he doesn't give me their motivation for the massacre.

I have to say that in comparison, the film, THE LITTLE DRUMMER GIRL which also explores the world of terrorism and the Israeli Mossad was a very good, solid, informative, on the edge of the seat film. I wish Spielberg would stop being mediocre and give us something we can really get our teeth into.",2
6 January 2012,"Has realism, tension and humanity...One of Spielberg's best","Okay so the basic premise of this movie is about a group of Assassins that go around killing certain people for the Jewish people and their land. And the movie is very well crafted and kept my interest from beginning to end and even has good amount of tension and surprises. And it's mostly all believable, the movie is thrilling despite it goes from one assassination mission to another. The plot has a good blend of being simple and yet a bit convoluted but in a good way. The character driven aspects are well done and it's just great just watching the characters have conversations with each other because of the rich and thought provoking dialogues. I especially liked the final message at the end of the movie. Eric Bana did a great job being the leader of the team of assassins, in fact the whole cast was great and fit right into there roles. Spielberg really did a excellent job for the casting for this movie. Every character had a top notch presence on screen and most of them were fleshed out. I could type up a whole essay of why this movie is worth seeing, but I will just say it's one of the must watch films if you enjoy watching movies.

30 December 2013,Disappointing propaganda,"Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's ""Munich"" seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. ""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, ""When does it ever end?""

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention.

""When does it ever end?"" Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",3
13 August 2006,Mediocre effort given the opportunity,"For some reason, I wasn't mad about this film. Aside from the ""underlying messages"" of the film, I think the actual film making was wrong.

To begin with, the actual events of the Munich hostage situation is littered in sections throughout the film. While I can see what Spielberg was trying to do, I somehow would have preferred it if either: A) the events of munich were not shown at all; or B) the events of munich were shown in order and sequence at the opening of the film.

Second, the film couldn't seem to make up its mind in relation to focus. At times, I felt as though I was watching a scene in a film like True Lies or Mission Impossible and at other times, I felt as though the film was trying to deliver some poignant points about Israel and conflicts in the middle east surrounding it. It's not that it's impossible to have two separate focuses in a film, but I just felt that this film did not adequately pull it off with enough coherence.

Third, I felt that the character's ""attack of conscience"" seemed somewhat out of place or rather overstated. Let's face it: they are Mossad assassins sent on a mission following Munich. I found it difficult to believe that they were so distraught from carrying out assassinations. Otherwise, what are they doing in that line of work in the first place? It was just a bit too forced in my view.

Forth, the film addressed a perspective: if we kill the head of ABC, he is simply replaced and the violence continues. Well its not as simple as that. It's a bit more of a gamble in my view. Sometimes head is replace by someone who is worse ideologically, but far less competent. Other times, the head is replaced, but takes the group in a different direction or loses the faith of its members. While the members that dissociate may become part of another group, it would be in israels advantage to fight or negotiate with fewer splinters within the same ""cause.""

Fifth, in relation to the Arab-Israel tensions/conflict, the film really didn't say all that much more than we already know. It's a circle of violence with no end in sight and revenge gets them nowhere. So there really wasn't a fresh perspective - more of a rehashed viewpoint of a conflict where most people with all sorts of views on the subject tend to oversimplify and ignore external factors that are at play on many occasions.",4
21 December 2005,An excellent retelling that does its job.,"The war on terror, especially when it comes to Israel, is a war of ideologies, and most people align themselves with one or another based on the information they receive or the religion they subscribe to. The reality of it, though, is the reality of every controversial topic--there's merit to both sides, and that's why there's controversy. Steven Spielberg's latest film, a huge step away from his morally comfortable fables, forces us to face the depth of the conflict, and of revenge and killing in general. Anyone seeking validation for their partisan views won't find it. Munich leaves viewers at a loss, and this is why it succeeds.

Munich tells the true story of a team of Israeli agents assigned to kill the Palestinians responsible for the 1972 massacre of 11 Israeli Olympic athletes. Aside from Tony Kushner and Eric Roth's rich and complex screenplay, Janusz Kaminski's gripping cinematography and the genuine, troubling performances of the cast are probably the film's most vital elements. Eric Bana is a strong, conflicted hero whose patriotism and doubts are reflected in his colleagues.

Despite the many characters and plot twists, it's a pretty simply told movie, and isn't hard to follow. Even though Spielberg has matured, he still delivers many of his usual powerful if contrived moments.

Munich is an excellent thriller, but don't expect a dazzling moral revelation or a neatly wrapped message. You won't get those things. Munich doesn't appeal to any political group. Rather, it stirs the doubt in all of us and forces us to face the humanity in everyone.",9
18 December 2005,please kill me!,"Squirmed through nearly three hours of Hollywood cinematic B.S. last night in ""Munich"", a film I was truly looking forward to see. Script was a nightmare. Reeked of ""Book"", multiple writers and lack of antagonist as well as a three act structure. Spielberg demonstrates a clear lack of political artistic backbone. Gutless film-making at its worst. He should go to see ""Missing"" by Costa Gravas or any number of great political art films. Hey, Steven, anyone can make the Nazis look bad! I have a feeling the Peeples' (""Unforgiven"") script was probably the best of the four written. Good choice by producer Kathleen Kennedy as this should have been a violent tale of redemption. Instead we get the ""Putzes Who Couldn't Shoot Straight"". Just one of many cinematic/historical problems: For me to believe that there was any moral uncertainty by members of the Mossad in carrying out retribution for those who planned and carried out the killing of THEIR NATION'S OLYMPIC TEAM is patently absurd! Spielberg looks at '72 Munich through 2002 intifada glasses and he goes blind. Tony Kushner, lead him down the path of Jewish guilt and self-loathing. To Spielberg's detriment, he followed him. So sad. Such great material wasted.

11 January 2007,got better as it went along....,"but it was still to long. About an hour in, I was thinking this movie is not very good. I didn't think the characters were introduced well and was wondering who was on screen. But, then it got better and the story made more sense, but at almost 3 hours, it was still too long. Edited to about 2 hours and 15 minutes would have been better.

Eric Bana looked great in this. He was good as well as the other actors. It was just the story set-up needed to be better explained. A story like this had too much info to fit into a big screen film. It would have been better if this was a made for TV 5 part movie. Characters like Louis and his dad and the other killers besides Avner did not get enough development. I would have liked to know more about there back ground.

FINAL VERDICT: A good film on an important subject matter, but was too long. If you aren't familiar with the story, it is hard to understand some of the characters. Overall, worth watching.",7
8 February 2009,A Thrilling History Lesson!,"Munich is a very powerful film in all aspects. I am surprised that acclaimed director Steven Spielberg directed this film because he is Pro-Israel. If you are expecting a movie such as Jaws or E.T, you will be disappointed. This film is a thriller and a history lesson meant to tell the truth by Hollywood.

This film is about the 1972 Munich Olympics games. Eleven Israeli hostages were murdered. Now, a team is sent out to kill the members who planned the Munich attacks. The leader of the team is Avner. He must leave his family and he is stricken with pains of war and death throughout this movie. All he wants to do is be home with his family.

The cast was absolutely amazing. Eric Bana is powerful playing Avner. I liked Daniel Craig's character. There are other great actors out there whose names I cannot recall such as the guy who played Louis.

The music is superb. John Williams can do any kind of music for any kind of movie genre. The music adds a more thrilling demeanor to this movie.

The one thing I have against this is that this movie is a little long so that meant some scenes were a bit overdone. Not much, though.

Overall, this is a fantastic film. It deserves the Best Picture nomination. I rate this movie 9/10.",9
13 May 2012,"WAY too long, but worth a look...","Very well made with all the attention to detail you'd expect from a film made by Steven Spielberg. Original music by John Williams was excellent also. Although it's very well made with some excellent performances, it has two things that I found were not in its favour. Firstly, it's far too long and secondly, the pacing of it is very slow and this, combined with the length does not make for an overly enjoyable viewing experience. Don't get me wrong, aspects of the film are quite compelling and the action sequences are as exciting as you'd find anywhere else, I just found it a little slow and far too long. Even so, I still think it's worth a look.

Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. ""Munich"" could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul. ""When does it ever end?"" Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",8
10 February 2006,A Remarkable Picture,"The Munich massacre always fascinated me as a young boy. When it happened I was too young remember it but when I got a little older I read about it and it became very interesting to me. This brilliant film directed by Steven Spielberg deals with the aftermath of the incident and how revenge took place. You probably already know the story so I'm not going to spend my time writing a review about the plot but about the film itself. It's an astonishing piece of film-making with powerful performances throughout and amazing direction. There are scenes in the film that are brutal and hard to watch, there is no doubt about that, but Spielberg doesn't let this flaw his movie at all. I am glad Munich has been nominated for Oscars this year but I am disappointed with the fact that Eric Bana has not been nominated. He delivers a sensational, hard-hitting turn as Avner and he is an actor of pure quality which has yet to be truly discovered in the Academy's eyes. Overall Munich is a devastating but excellent film of violence, revenge, betrayal, war and passion which is definitely one of Steven Spielberg's best. A remarkable picture.

16 July 2006,Terror's impact and the endless cycle of violence.,"Steven Spielberg is far from done as a film maker. As a 30+ year veteran of the big screen, Spielberg is continuing to evolve and re-invent himself with each decade. From the popcorn entertainment of 'Jaws' and 'Close Encounters' in the 70s to the moving human feelings obtained from 'E.T.' and 'The Color Purple' in the 80s to the world shaking 'Schindler's List' and 'Saving Private Ryan' in the 90s to the present, Spielberg is in total control because his true talent is in his choices. 'Munich' takes no side in the dispute between two sides in the most volatile conflict of the last 50 years on planet Earth. By taking no side, Spielberg has managed to take both sides and show them as equally flawed and equally human. The subject matter is the star performer of this film and the actors are merely taking their cues from it and while this film has been heavily criticized for its politics, no matter how this film was presented, it would have been criticized. How then do you make a film this sensitive in subject matter so attractive? Only Spielberg knows and he has managed to convey his vision convincingly. Extraordinary.

6 February 2006,The last scene,"The film is neither pro-Israel nor pro-Palestine. If you see and understand the scenes where Avner is talking with ""Ali"" and especially the very last scene in New York where he offers Ephraim to eat with him, as Jews are supposed to do it, you notice that the film only shows the completely desperate situation of both religions without naming one as the better one, the true one. And that's what makes the film so extraordinarily honest. Spielberg does never judge anybody, but he criticizes both parties. Ephraim turns down Avners offer to eat with him, he only sees the conflict, he is no longer aware what it usually means to be a Jew. Being Jewish for him means fighting against Palestine, he forgot his own roots. And that's the part where Spielberg delivers his own opinion, without judging.

22 January 2008,A complete Steven Spielberg Film : no doubt about it,"If one looks closely at Spielberg's cinematographic career, one would find that he has booked a special slot for controversial films which are even thought provoking to some extent.He achieves this hidden effect by choosing themes about which people are bound to have diverse opinions. This is the reason why Spielberg has complete hold over his work as someone like Richard Attenborough had for his film Gandhi (1982).Munich is one of a kind film which must be watched with an open mind as a biased viewer might spoil his own viewing pleasure.There is no need to take sides as nothing is shown neither in black nor in white. Although some of the situations featuring an ensemble cast of talented actors are truly spectacular there are certain confrontation scenes which defy logic.Although Munich tackles the same Jewish question as Schindler's List,it is very different from that film because of its insistence on color and an elaborate cast of actors.It is one of those rare American films completely dominated by French actors especially Mathieu Amalric.He is the only shining light of this somber drama.

15 January 2006,Doesn't quite pull it off,"Steven Spielberg was never going to make anyone happy with ""Munich."" Pro-Palestinian factions would find it offensive because the film never delves into why those Arab men took the Israeli athletes hostage (and ultimately killed them), and Jewish groups would find the Jewish characters doubting themselves and their philosophical dilemmas offensive, too.

One of my earliest memories of world events was what happened at the 1972 Munich Olympics. I've always been fascinated by what happened and the aftermath. So I was looking forward to this film.

I tried to view ""Munich"" as a film, not as a political treatise on Arab-Jewish relations or anything else, though it's tough not to see it in that light. I tried to see this film as a thriller loosely based on facts about the Israeli response to the events at the 1972 games. ""Munich"" would make a great double-feature with the 1999 documentary, ""One Day in September,"" which raised questions also about the hijacking of a Lufthansa airliner that led to West Germany releasing some of those who held the athletes hostage.

As a thriller, ""Munich"" works in spurts. It's a hit-or-miss film. Spielberg is a terrific visual artist and knows how to frame his shots. But the script by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth is so loose - and I don't mean with the actual events; that is a given - that this thriller never comes close to being as taut as it should.

Spielberg's working with a hugely talented cast. But, with the exception of Eric Bana as Avner, the others in his group seems awfully wrong for their parts. Most glaring is Daniel Craig's character, Steve. You're never quite sure what ethnicity he is. In one crucial scene, he's passed off as South African, yet his accent is anything but.

Spielberg's decision to handle the hostage-taking and subsequent botched rescue at the airport as flashbacks Avner sees don't really work, especially the final scene. What was he thinking? It's almost as if Kushner and Roth realized they hadn't shown the assault at the airport and so decided to tack it on in an incredibly odd manner.

As far as being a political treatise, Spielberg tackles the Palestinian issue, but also seems to use the Israeli response to Munich to discuss life in a post-9/11 America. Golda Meir's comment that even democracies have to compromise their principles for the so-called greater good seems to be a clear allusion to the Bush administration's attitude since 9/11.

But that's where it seems to end. Spielberg doesn't seem to be taking any stand. He's neither admonishing nor endorsing anything. And this middle-of-the-road attitude doesn't seem to quite work. It's as if he's trying to be as inoffensive as possible while making a political thriller.

Characters also chat about the morality of what they're doing, especially when they're asked to assassinate people based solely on the word of their intelligence agency and they get to see none of the evidence. They wonder where the evidence is. And the answer they get from the higher-ups is that they don't need to know. (Much like this administration not bothering about trivial issues such as due process since it believes holding even U.S. citizens incommunicado, without charges or allowing them to see their lawyers, is perfectly alright.)

Where ""Munich"" ultimately disappoints is that - rather surprisingly - Spielberg, Kushner and Roth fail to create a compelling story out of what should be riveting stuff. Their plot turns tend to get redundant, even predictable, though there's one well done sequence in the rain. The film needed more of that.

""Munich"" is by no means an awful film. It runs too long - cutting 30 minutes would have done wonders. The characters also seem strangely aloof. We're never drawn into their predicaments, moral dilemmas and anguish. And, in the end, they just come off mostly as talking-heads.",5

25 December 2005,"Scandalous and shameful, spewing salacious lies","'Equally as unjustified'.

That's the quote I read at the end of someone else's review.

(paraphrase) 'The tragic events of Munich led to Israel's doing something equally unjustified'...

And you see, Mr. Spielberg, that is precisely the problem. You release a film that poses a lot of questions, raises a lot of doubts...the sorts of things that would be best explored in the privacy of a library, or on the internet, for you to research and discover and discern and figure out, using solid sources and sound research techniques. But when you air your gripes in a popular format like a movie, wild theories and unanswered questions have a way of freezing themselves into the public consciousness. Perceptions are altered, people's understanding of history warp into the twisted and perverse theories your mind entertains, and blasphemy is born.

To suggest that Israel's hunting down of terrorists is 'morally equivalent' to terrorists kidnapping and executing 11 innocent athletes is mind-boggling in its Stockholm-esquire insanity. How do you feel, Mr. Spielberg, knowing that your artistic venture caused such thoughts to creep into the mind of at least one, and who knows how many other fertile minds? Irrational, morally relativsitic thoughts like this stem from your planting absurd thoughts into people's minds. What the filmmaker views as an artistic or intellectual exercise, others view as immutable proof of reality. So for example, when some of the Israelis in 'Munich' repeatedly question whether their ring leader has seen the evidence implicating their terrorist targets, the intelligent viewer understands this as the reasonable worries, fears and doubts anyone in an extraordinarily stressful, life altering position might think about, if only to keep his sanity. The uninitiated viewer, on the other hand, sees such an exchange as a none-too-subtle swipe at the justification for the Israeli government's selection of targets, and thus comes to such conclusions as Israel's pursuit of the terrorists being morally on par with the terrorists' gruesome actions.

And when the opening credits divulge the name of the book upon which the film is based, and include the words 'inspired by real events', the discerning viewer who takes the time to do a little research knows that the book was written by a widely-discredited figure who has been repeatedly accused of fabricating all kinds of stories, and of claiming connections to events or places or organizations in which he never took part. The uninitiated, on the other hand takes the film, many of whose moments of intrigue and blunder were no doubt ramped up in the name of artistic license, as gospel.

The cadence of Spielberg's piece however, and quite possibly his raison d'etre in creating this terrible affront, is the implication that the State of Israel has lost its Jewish character. The film takes breaks from the main cat-and-mouse aspect of the tale repeatedly to remind us, via long speeches spoken by many characters, about what 'true' Jewish virtues are: righteousness, goodness, justice etc. Certainly, Spielberg is no anti-Semite. But he then proceeds to demonstrate -- most vividly in the final 15 minutes -- how, in his view, Israel has deviated from that paradigm. How it is willing to do anything and everything to justify its existence and continued survival, even when those actions run contrary to the core of its collective spiritual being. Golda Meir says it, Avner's mother says it, Geoffrey Rush's character's whole being says it...and we, as an audience who sympathize with Avner, find such a stance increasingly reprehensible. And this reprehensible idea is not brought up in the abstract or in a vague and ambiguous vacuum, but as the 'official position' of the State of Israel, and by extension, represents the raison d'etre and collective zeitgeist of the State. That the state and its officers treat him so callously and coldly throughout -- certainly with far less admiration or affection than th Palestinian has for his daughter -- is one very disconcerting image that anyone who has been through the very family oriented aspect of Israeli political and military life can tell you is patently false. But it really comes to a shocking head in the very last line of the film. Avner, in a gratuitous line completely out of character, invites his nemesis to 'do something Jewish' with him. (Until this point, Avner has made no mention of his Jewishness, no desire to engage in anything remotely religious. It can only be assumed that Spielberg/Kusher included this only to drive their terribly anti-Zionist point home; that Israel has extricated itself from Jewish values.) When Geoffrey Rush's character refuses, it is the ultimate sign of Israel's (represented by Rush) complete break from all manner of Jewish values, which we've been schooled throughout the film to see as the epitome of virtue. This is the terrible, scurrilous point of the whole film, the way Spielberg manages to impugn the integrity and validity of the state while avoiding the charge of being 'anti-Semitic'  as if to say, I'm critical of Israel, but Israel does not represent Judaism. Israel, is in fact, the antithesis of Judaism, which is virtuous and righteous.

This is an argument used to justify and hide anti-Semitic attacks on Israel by Jew-haters for decades.

Shame on you, Stephen Spielberg, for buying the bile and advancing such a horrendously offensive theory.

For shame.",1
25 December 2005,Another Spielberg masterpiece,"Amazing! I went into the movie not expecting much, even though I am a Spielberg fan, but I came out thinking that I couldn't believe I had ever been skeptical about the movie. You come out of the movie actually thinking about the message the movie gets across. The message that resounds through this movie is that terrorism only leads to more terrorism. Spielberg does an awesome job of not really taking sides. He doesn't come out and say that the Isrealis were bad, and he does not come out and say that the Palestinians were bad. He remains surprisingly neutral. But that movie also leads a lot of questions unanswered which leaves the viewer really thinking about it and making some attempt to fill in the blanks. Overall I would highly recommend this movie. But it is not a family movie. It is also not a movie for the faint of heart. At times the violence is almost overwhelming. But at the end you will not regret seeing Munich yet another Spielburg masterpiece.

3 March 2006,Curtain Falls on Spielberg,"****Spoilers Included****

It's hard to hit the nail on the head about what doesn't make Spielberg tick. Although the man seems to master all the tricks of his trade, lately they just do not gel to make a coherent moving whole. His dramatic films lack soul. He resounds with the obvious, underlining every line of dialog. The sly innuendo of former years has become stiff with overstatement. His films seem exclusively shot in a vast obvious foreground where no detail is left to the intelligence of the viewer. And perhaps the courtesans of the royal court are afraid to tell the king the bad news for fear of banishment.

Munich proceeds awkwardly as if a first draft story-board had been tacked on the wall during a brainstorming session. A poorly edited hastily pasted pastiche that neither rhymes nor runs with its subject matter. Rome, Athens, nor Munich barely feel like the cities they're supposed to represent (probably because they were filmed inand sponsored by--Hungary and Malta). And the Middle East context reflects such a level of Orange County Jewish Club claustrophobia that one wonders if Spielberg and his harem ever even set foot in Israel to research the film.

The actors for the most part are deployed with the standard two-dimensionality we've been accustomed to in a Spielberg film. Shallow in character, high on histrionics. The Mossad team and its top banana Bana act with about as much authority as the San Fernando Valley Chicano-cum-Indians of Costner's Dances with Wolves. Even the prime minister in Golda Meir has become an off-the-shelf Jewish grandmother. The only credible performance was Michael Lonsdale's even if he was cast in the oft stereotyped role of the sly but slimy Frenchman sitting on the fence profiteering from both sides of a conflict (aka The Deer Hunter). And am I mistaken or does Avner's accent shift constantly between a Yiddish lilt and one you'd find in a Nebraskan suburb? Intentional? If so the effect is so 'subtle' as to appear sloppy and is virtually indistinguishable from the speech of another character, Louisand he's French.

One of the reasons many people find this film boring is the redundant nature and treatment of the assassinated Palestinians. The killings serve neither to raise the tension level nor drive the narrative forward. Rather they seem like tics on a hit-man's shopping list. A little bomb here, a bigger bomb there. And weren't those Black September veterans such regular lovable types: one old man who does his own groceries, another's daughter takes piano lessons while yet a third is available with aspirin or sleeping pills after the pharmacy closes. Sounds just like my bourgeois neighbors at home. If that is the point, then it gushes with over-simplicity. Adolf Hitler, too, was probably just as cute when he blew out the candles on his eighth birthday cake.

Then there's the issue of the camera work, where unimaginative framing and sequencing only serve the movie's discontinuity. Witness the messy hit at the Athens hotel. There were also far too many of those slow head and shoulder zooms that added nothing except draw attention to the zoom. The contrived outdoor banquet exchanges at the French country estate comes to mind. Table prayers in France? I've seen it once in twenty years here. And they don't pick apples in June either, even sour ones. All about as believable as Mathieu Amalric's flaunting a wad of $100,000 in the broad daylight of a Paris café. These are undercover agents??

If Mossad is a model of espionage and covert operations on the planet earth, the Spielberg version portrays them as latter day Keystone Cops. On the Amsterdam houseboat, the pocket silencers allow the victim, shot twice in the chest, to gingerly skirt her assassins, saunter over to the kitchen, pet and kiss the cat, walk a little further and ease herself into a rocking chair before realizing her barfly days were over. She could have pulled that gun from the drawer in a fraction of the time.

In another preposterous hit scene, our boys dress up as women and proceed to feign an arm-in-arm stroll along the docks of Beirut (like most Middle Eastern women naturally would do on a dark, deserted and forbidding night), yet don't 'surprise' the guards in the least. They then charge fifteen-man strong up a flight of stairs, blotch the operation by resorting to not-so-silent submachine guns, and retreat back down the stairs straight into the flying bullets of the Fedayeen before escaping into the night without a scratch. What a cartoon.

The clincher of convolution of course takes place near the finale, where Avner orgasms to the tune of the climactic Munich airport shoot-out. Begging the point that he could hardly have flashed back to the Palestinians on the tarmac since he'd been doubting their very culpability all throughout the film, the perverse suggestion that our hero or any other normal male on this planet could even have an erection much less an ejaculation thinking about murder and mayhem just boggles the mind.

Munich is a simple revenge story embarrassingly cloaked in an ever so sheer veneer of topical respectability that make it no more convincing than the Charles Bronson Death Wish series of the 1980s. I, like many, long for the old unique Spielberg touch when it was fresh with Indiana Jones swapping the whip for a gun in the bazaar or the kicking of the chair out from under the hangman's noose in Schindlers's List. When vignettes such as these were laced together back then, there were the makings of storytelling genius. Today, Spielberg is trying hard, too hard, to be Spielberg. And when he fails to find himself, he opts at turns for a bit of Kubrick here, a bit of Hitchcock there. The end result doesn't fly. If Munich is about Home, Spielberg should go there and stay put. It's over. Time to retire.",
22 December 2005,Disappointed,"What disappointed me the most was that the director mishandled the subject and made it into an action/thriller film rather than a thought-provoking drama. Terrence Malick would have been a wonderful choice. Throughout the whole film, I kept wondering if I were watching Munich or Mission: Impossible and Godfather flicks.

I also had problems with Mr. Spielberg's portraying of violence on the screen. Obviously, he didn't believe the philosophy of ""less is more"" as he depicted the killings full on. Most of the adult audience gasped whenever a violent deed was committed on the screen. I didn't think that thoughts rather than fears were provoked as we were wondering when, where and how the next one was going to hit the screen.

The film score also presented a problem to me. It reminded me so much of Schindler's List. I guess that Mr. William ran out of ideas and simply recycle his old scores.

The climax at the end (intercutting of a ""domestic event"" and the Munich tragedy) was really uncalled for and tasteless. It was disrespectful to draw such parallel.

However, I find Mr. Spielberg was courageous setting the tone of the film, neither Pro- Israel nor Anti-Palestine. The question of ""does retribution or an-eye-for-an-eye policy toward peace really work"" was constantly brought up through out the film. 30 years after the Munich tragedy, we all know the result (albeit it's a sad truth).

I only wish Mr. Spielberg made this film the way Terrence Malick made The Thin Red Line: subtle, philosophical yet thought-provoking.",4
25 December 2005,Brilliant Film,"This is a long film but I can't imagine anyone being bored or confused (a la Seriana) for the entire film. What a performance by all the fine actors in this film, so artfully directed that you can almost forget it's a movie. It's real and true, but not a boring (a la Good Night and Good Luck).Spielberg is our greatest director and this is by far his best film. Itis an exhausting and exhilarating film, although the facts are eithertrue or too close to the possibility of being true to be comforting.The ending is very touching and it would be wise not to take your eyesoff the screen until the credits are rolling. Great part for Eric Banaand a nice introduction to Daniel Craig in his first blockbuster beforehe becomes the new 007. This sure to win Best Picture in all the contests.

8 January 2006,"A very well-made, thrilling movie whose message is a little messed up","Having seen Munich yesterday myself and wondering how its politics would be, I was very surprised. In the film, while Spielberg showed the killings as gruesome, he focused more on the personal elements of Avner and the terrorists' lives. I expected that the movie would be outright against the ""revenge,"" and it was a pleasant surprise to me that the film treated it as something justified but a little too far. The politics I found pretty clear, though, was that Israel is supposedly ""sleazy"" and ""careless."" However, the film was INSPIRED by real events, so most of it could all be seen as playing into Avner's personal life.

What the film failed to grasp was that Israeli (and even some American) anti-terror missions are both vengeful and preemptive, as assassination of these terrorists helped bring an end to years of terror, as shown in the news clips in Munich. Also, a small detail that was interesting was the terrorists always driving Mercedes Benzes.

It was a very good film, though, and to me showed what people who work to fight against terrorism must go through and their emotional breakdowns. It left me with mixed feelings about its politics and how truthful they were, although much of the movie wasn't actually true, but it also left me with one definite feeling: terror.",7
14 January 2006,"Great story obviously but oh dear, those clichés","I remember the events of the Munich Olympics 1972 fairly clearly. I was 17 at the time, and resident in England. It made a big impression, watching it unfold on the BBC, the vivid images played out on TV. The slaughtered athletes, the botched German security job, the debate over continuing the games (they did but shouldn't have.) I remember the hijackings, Leila Khaled, Black September, Bader Meinhoff, The Red Brigade, the IRA, all that early terrorism that rather passed America by in the pre-9/11 world. So I was predisposed to appreciate this story, and it was certainly time that the story was told. I can't exactly say that I was predisposed to enjoy it. Is it right to enjoy a true story about a real-life slaughter? You can't possibly analyze the story, all you can do is analyze the telling of it, which is what I'll try and do.

To me, this movie is a classic example of how to ruin a really good story by throwing every cliché in the book at it. There were parts of it I loved. Eric Bana's performance, for example, was really outstanding, by far the best I've seen him give. It certainly works on the level of a thriller, as we watch the shadowy team of Israelis track down the shadowy team of Palestinians across Europe. I found the mental disintegration, self-doubt and mounting paranoia of Avner very believable, and the individual details of the kills were quite fascinating, although the lingering shot of the bullet wounds over the pretty Dutch assassin's breasts was perhaps slightly overdone.

The trouble is that Spielberg doesn't just set the scene for us as we move from country to country, he hits us over the head with it and then grinds our noses into it just in case we missed anything. To give a few examples. London. In the space of half a city block we are shown two red telephone booths, a red post box, a red London bus (double decker of course), a Mini Cooper, a Ford Zephyr and a black taxicab. And just in case you missed any of those, it's raining. This is London, OK? London. L-O-N-D-O-N. All it lacked was a Cheery Cockney Chappie to run up to our hero and say ""Mornin' Mate"" for it to have included every London cliché from A to Z (although had that happened I might well have got up and left.) Then there's the ""Oh look, it must be Paris, I can see the Eiffel Tower"" scene. And everyone was smoking at the table and mentioned cheese frequently, so we'd know they were REALLY French, not masquerading Belgians. Was that the Spanish Steps in Rome? We have bikes and canals in Holland, and Hey! it's Brooklyn, she lives in a brownstone and there are the friendly neighbors sitting on the steps! All Spielberg spared us was an aerial shot of the Acropolis in Greece. Is it a necessity for geographically challenged American audiences to be bludgeoned over the head with all this visual imagery so they'll have no doubts about where they are? Did someone in the props department find a locked closet with ""Europe"" written on the door and insist on using everything they found inside dating from every European movie made since 1930? The head-tossing sex scene towards the end, cutting between the violence and Avner's trauma also made me shake my head in disbelief that anyone as good as Spielberg could throw in such an obvious cliché.

The London street scene actually reminded me of Austin Powers, and that really wasn't the memory I wanted to retain of this movie, because it makes some very good points, chief amongst them being that for every terrorist you kill, ten more will stand up to take their place (especially true if you kill parents in front of their children.) And that exacting revenge has a terrible effect on the avenger. And did the Americans really make a Faustian pact with Black September to keep terrorism out of the USA? Interesting and thought provoking stuff, and yet it was thrown in almost as an after thought. That one question would make a great movie all by itself.

But I'm afraid mostly this movie just made me sigh. Am I getting too old to go to the movies any more? Is there anyone left out there who can make a movie devoid of cliché? Because for me this ruined what should have been a deeply moving story. But at least it has left me wanting to know more about the story, more about what happened after Munich, so it wasn't a total loss. Maybe I'll go and look for a book about it. With no pictures.",
18 August 2021,Drivel,"It's a story of revenge - something that resonates so well with the mentality of the people who made the film. They held a grudge against somebody, and they took revenge. And they played the victim all along.

How much in this film is similar to reality, and how much is fantasy and deliberate lies? I don't care. But my bet is that it's basically a pile of lies.

4 December 2006,A riveting achievement,"It would be fair to say that Steven Spielberg is a director who's craft evolves more sufficiently within each decade. In the 70's, he created the term ""blockbuster"" with Jaws and soon became the master of popcorn entertainment with films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T throughout the 80's. The 90's proved to be his ""mature"" era, as he directed deeply personal, mature, and melancholy films such as Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. Now, the early years of the 21st century, can easily be considered as a sort of ""experimental"" phase for Spielberg, as he somewhat departs from his David Lean influence and heads more towards his Stanley Kubrick inspiration. Not to compare Kubrick with Spielberg, because they are two completely different directors in their own ways, but, the way Spielberg has matured at this time has made his influence in the honor of his former colleague, an influence that is present in his latest masterpiece, Munich, as the film delves deep into the dark mists of human nature with thought-provoking themes that are conjured by awe-inspiring visuals and a gritty, melancholy atmosphere.

The film focuses on the aftermath of the 1972 Munich Olympics, when nine Israeli athletes were infamously massacred by the Palestinian terrorist group, Black September. It's a destructive issue that still haunts the face of the Earth today, as two cultures collide for the sake of their shared dream of having a homeland. As a result of the tragic massacre, the Israeli government decides to secretly hire a team of assassins, lead by a former Mussad-Agent, Avner Kaufman(Eric Bana). From the moment we see him, we know Avner is a decent man. He's polite, he has a sense of humor, and he's a dedicated husband who is urging to start a family. Yet, his current state of personal happiness is put to a halt once he accepts the mission that has been offered. With the help of four other men, each specializing in their own specific skill, Avner must hunt down and kill every Palestinian who was involved in the planning of the Munich massacre. But, it's only a matter of time before these acts of vengeance and desecration become the culprits of paranoia.

The issues and themes that Munich deals with are things that we still deal with today. Spielberg handles these controversial issues with great fragility. Being a Jew himself, he could have simply labeled the protagonists and the antagonists of the film, yet, the plot remains sufficiently neutral throughout the film's entirety, showing empathy from both perspectives. Although we see it from the Jews' perspective, that doesn't necessarily mean their morals are not as corrupt as those of the Palestinians. Munich displays how vengeance, echoed through the actions of five men, effects the depths of our nature and our state of being. By the film's conclusion, Avner no longer is, nor will never be, the same man. His actions reflect those that still haunt us today both as nations and as citizens of our countries.

Eric Bana is stellar as the film's ultimately sympathetic lead, as he carries the film with poignancy and a fragility that can be seen in his eyes. It's an utter crime that the Academy did not nominate Bana for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Spielberg, while presenting us with a subtle story, adds even more subtlety by giving us visuals that will haunt and provoke our thoughts for days, with the help of the film's gritty and stylish atmosphere that perfectly reflects upon the emotions that are intact within the film. The camera movement also works sufficiently as it blends in greatly with the era that is being presented (the 1970's), by using various stylish camera tricks such as quick-dolly-ins.

In all, Munich is the best film I have seen in 2005, and among the best of the decade. Spielberg has achieved in creating a thought-provoking masterwork that shall leave the view pondering upon its message for days. And if you can't swallow it all, that haunting last shot should sum it all up perfectly.",10
15 June 2006,"Powerful masterpiece on the horror of war, risks of vengeance, and costs of killing","June 14- The ambiguity and confusion of counter-terror terror has never been so accurately portrayed- nothing ever goes exactly as intended, and the firefights and bombing scenes are very realistic and harrowing. This actually shows the effect of a machine gun ripping through a human body, not the TV cartoon violence of thousands of shots without ever hitting someone. The killing of the gorgeous Dutch seductress assassin (a Montreal Naomi Watts type) is one of the most horrible ever displayed. ""Such a waste,"" she says as she's killed. The shadow war of retaliatory killings unfold as regular Palestinian terrorist events happen in the background, sometimes in apparent retaliation (vaguely remembered from my semi-youth).The Munich massacre was searingly and relatively accurately depicted. The incredible moral quandary of becoming what you hate, and are warring against, is vividly displayed and has immediate application to America, where our Bike Boy President and his nitwit neocons are disemboweling the Bill of Rights, sanctioning torture of innocents, and lying us into a conflict of faiths that could last generations.

Munich is based on a semi-discredited 1984 book: Vengeance, which already produced a 1986 movie: The Sword of Gideon. ""Munich"" doesn't claim strict historical accuracy. Many of the Israeli assassination targets had little or nothing to do with Munich; amazingly the alleged mastermind Abu Daoud(who was shot 6 times by Israelis but survived) claims the unwitting financier of the Munich kidnappings was Mahmoud Abbas- current Palestinian Authority President. Much confusion exists over whether the remaining 3 terrorists were later killed by Israeli hit squads or not- 2 may have been, but at least one was alive in 1999 for a documentary One Day in Sept.

Spielberg addresses the book controversy at the beginning of the DVD, saying ""Vengeance"" was attacked but never discredited. He does avoid the most atrocious event of the Mossad vendetta- the killing of the wrong man in a street in Norway, which publicly outed the whole plot. The Palestinians aren't cardboard cutouts, in the most impossible scene PLO gunmen and the Israeli hit squad share a safe-house after a long standoff (""ETA- Basque!"", scream the Mossad men). After, Eric Bana and a PLO guy argue about Palestine and the Palestinian has the same motivations- honor, homeland, family, stopping them from killing us. No way they wouldn't make them for Israelis, though.

According to a new book, Striking Back, the tragedy in the 1972 Olympics was the result of incompetent, pompous, cowardly German officials. It was run by blithering blow hard Bavarian bureaucrats, who because of the German Constitution, had almost complete autonomy- nothing of the rescue was run by the national German Gov.- it was all Bavarian and Munich police, who had no anti-terrorist training. In fact, there was no such thing in demilitarized Germany- no SWAT, no special forces, no anti-terrorists. The top Israelis who flew in were ignored and abused- their offer of a counter-terrorist squad rejected. Because they had no experience at all with Germany, because of..... the past (only 27 years from the death camps), they thought the Germans would run the rescue with their usual devastating efficiency and effectiveness. They couldn't have been more wrong.

First the Munchkens had a group of assault cops dressed on track suits assemble on top of the Israeli building- in full view of TV cameras airing footage to the Palestinians. Forced to retreat there, they sent the terrorists and captives by 2 helicopters to a military airfield, where a 727 was supposed to take them Cairo, but an ambush by sharpshooters was actually planned. 6-10 Munich police dressed as crew simply bailed out of the plane while the helicopter was in flight without telling anyone- it was suicidal, they thought. They were probably right- they still were wearing their police pants with Lufthansa jackets. They thought there were only 5 hijackers; when there were 8 (4 were employees at the Olympics); they had only 5 marksmen there out of 29 in the area, they had no proper searchlights, no night vision gear or scopes, no radios, no generator power, no armored cars, no forces or plans to storm the plane if things went bad.

""Later it was discovered that one of the snipers never fired a shot, and yet another sniper was positioned directly in the line of friendly fire, without any protective gear""-Wikipedia They just opened fire- killing 3 terrorists- and commencing an hour and a half firefight. The remaining terrorists quickly knocked out the 3 light stands with grenades, so snipers were firing in the dark. The Chermans refused to storm the plane, and insisted on waiting for armored cars. When they appeared, however, the hostage takers, realizing the game was up- blew up one helicopter with hogtied hostages with a grenade, and wiped out the rest with machine gun bursts. The Germans did kill 2 more hijackers after the massacre; 3 survived and were released 2 months later when Black September hijacked a Lufthansa jet. They were flown to Libya for a heroes welcome. German firefighters refused to go in and put out the fire even when the terrorists left- one hostage died of smoke inhalation.

To their credit, German officials did offer to exchange themselves for the Israelis, or an infinite amount of money, and one cop was killed in the shootout. Somehow the story got promulgated that all the hostages were safe, and Israelis and much of the world wept in relief. Then, like in the West Virginia mine disaster, they wept much more. The good Bavarian burghers stonewalled the Israeli families for decades, denying the existence of any documents about the case, giving them nothing in info or compensation (Israel also did nothing) until 2002. Finally- in 2004, they offered $114K to each of the 36 family members, now only 27. Disgraceful.

Truly a masterpiece, and a film that will have you thinking, and remembering- long after you see it.",
26 February 2006,excellent,"i thought this movie was excellent! another great movie by Steven Spielberg...wonderful acting, great cinematography. my only complaint about Munich is that the movie felt a little long towards the end, but otherwise it was packed full of action and drama. this event took place before i was born, but i was truly taken into the story and now have a better understanding of this historical event and the conflict between these two cultures. i have seen Eric Bana in other movies, but thought he did an excellent job of portraying Avner Kaufmann's inner turmoil and the commitment he felt to his country and his family. If you are not opposed to blood and violence, this movie is for you!

23 January 2019,Easily one of the best movies of 2005,"29 December 2005. This taut dramatic thriller personalizes and humanizes man's efforts to seek revenge and the difficult turmoil over the violence that overcomes us when it comes to religion and terrorism. Munich brings its audience into the personal lives of assassins who have been selected to seek revenge for the Munich Olympic murders of Israeli athletes. This mission is stark, violent, and tragic as well as human and personal as Spielberg offers a human face to all the characters both Israeli and Arab. This a powerful movie that offers its viewers a harsh, tragic look at a husband and a young fighter for his country who undergoes a personal struggle for meaning and devotion to his country and his family while trying to negotiate the often murky and dark world of intelligence and betrayal. This is a wonderful, compelling movie, one of the best of the year. Nine out of Ten Stars.

19 May 2006,Best Film of 2005,"Sheer brilliance. As a former soldier, and one who has studied terrorism and its aftermath for my degree, I couldn't fault this. Superb casting, ensemble acting, direction, and photography. Not a single anachronism or dodgy prop. Brave script and riveting execution. Almost as good as Shindler's List. Spielberg never ceases to surprise you. There is always something else great up his sleeve. How many other directors/producers can say this after such along career.

Eric Bana was absolutely brilliant in the central role. Ciaran Hinds was unrecognisable, leaving his BBC Julius Caeser behind.( how on earth did he do the two roles back to back ) Only the blonde Bond was out of his depth. Playing yet again a two dimensional muscle man, just like in Road to Perdition, yet this time with a cod South African accent.

7 March 2008,Spielberg support for the return Palestinian homeland from Israel,"Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's ""Munich"" seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. ""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, ""When does it ever end?""

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. ""Munich"" could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul. ""When does it ever end?"" Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",10
27 December 2005,GREAT film,"This was a wonderfully executed film. I am Jewish and it touched me deeply. Contrary to what one would think, Spielberg gave air time to both sides. His main premise, as I interpret it, is that the tit for tat killings are futile and neverending. The participants are caught up in a constant search for revenge with no end in sight. They are never free of fear. By proxy too the world is caught up in it as well and is never free either. Spielberg conveys that each side (Palestinian and Israeli) have justifiable anger. I agree with Spielberg it is simply a dangerous and impossible struggle. So many innocent people are caught in the line of fire and it affects one psychologically beyond repair. Still, as a Jew, my empathy lies with the character that said he cared about Jewish blood only. The Holocaust taints my perspective and I am sympathetic to the Israeli hierarchy caught between KNOWING that this is never ending and the righteousness of the Jewish heart wrenching historical experience and therefore its cause. At the end, I too, even with all the suffering, danger and loss of life cared about Jewish blood more than the others. THAT to me is evidence of how strong the passions are if one has the knowledge of the futility and endless violence but still can push even that aside and feel satisfaction when Israelis prevail!",10
16 February 2019,Movie full of cliche,"I found nothing thrilling in this movie, boring, that music just make you asleep, when they were on mission in London ofcourse there was rain, black cab and red phone boxes, also in France just Citroen cars everywhere, lots of scenes were wasted time, not for me at all

25 January 2006,"Good, but a missed opportunity","Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"" is a return to the director's serious nature. Although the spy thriller subject matter is closer to ""Minority Report"" than ""Schindler's List"", the tone is far more like ""Saving Private Ryan"" than ""War of the Worlds"", an interesting dichotomy that both aids and abets the film.

""Munich"" is inspired by true events that occurred after 1972 Olympics tragedy in the titular city. After several Israeli athletes are taken hostage and murdered by Palestinian terrorists, the Israeli government recruits five men to exact revenge (read: assassinate) upon those who initiated the kidnapping. The movie concentrates on the drama of quintet's actions and transformations as they undertake their collective task, viewing like a taut thriller, but featuring more development among both characters and plot.

Where ""Munich"" diverges from typical espionage movies is also where it predominantly excels. The reality of everything distances this film from even good genre flicks like ""The Bourne Identity"", not necessarily in quality but in nature, because the fully realized actions and consequences of ""Munich"" create an entirely different, more genuine world. The main characters, acted to a tee, all face moral dilemmas, evolving wonderfully through the quieter in-between scenes and more impressively during the more intense portions. Likewise the pace eschews the typically breakneck, impulsive speed at which most such films flow, opting instead for a deliberate approach that accelerates when necessary, making those moments all the more gripping. But the handful of pin-you-to-your-seat scenes are not enough to carry the entire film.

Steven Spielberg is a remarkable storyteller, a fact reinforced by manner in which he balances the action and character, continually bouncing between assassination attempts and dialogue-heavy development scenes. At times though this unevenness, accented by two discordant scenes, robs the film of a driving sense of urgency, leaving one with the feeling that it coulda/woulda/shoulda been better. One of those scenes, involving revenge, is shocking and discomforting, but at least effectively makes its contrasting point. The other, one of the closing scenes, is flat awkward, an ill fit both chronologically and emotionally. So out-of-place are these two moments that they nearly overshadow two hours of impressive drama.

Of course, this is nearly a three hour film, but would have fared better had it been trimmed down or at least reorganized. The decision to reenact the events of ""Munich"" was not a bad one, and it provides some of the movies most lasting images with classic archive footage and the reproduction of known moments from alternate angles. But intercutting these scenes over the course of the film interrupts the flow, particularly since the flashbacks are portrayed through the thoughts of a character who wasn't even there.

Despite the uniqueness, the film never kicks things to the next level. ""Munich"" is always interesting, but rarely captivating, thanks to some combination of factors. Maybe the minimal amount of music retards the drama. Maybe the tone of the heavy subject matter isn't conducive to Spielberg's style of story-telling. Perhaps though, more than anything, one can't help but think like the main character, wondering what the point is and where everything is going. Big and difficult questions are asked, which is commendable. These are emotions and choices that are notably similar to those felt and made in today's post-9/11 world, making Munich a still pertinent film that has the chance to be immensely powerful. But the answers provided are either non-existent or too simple, leaving the viewer feeling cold.

Bottom Line: Still good, occasionally brilliant, but ultimately less than it could have been. 7 of 10, recommended only if you're interested.",7
19 December 2020,"Good directing, reality falsification","The movie depicts actual events showing the Palestinians as terrorists. In a scene Avner (Bana) speaks to one of the Fedayeen and tells him that they, the Palestinians, had no country which is really question the ill intention behind such statement in a Hollywood movie. The hostage situation was known as poorly managed by the German authorities however the mishaps were never mentioned in the movie. The group of Fedayeen taking hostages at the Olympic Games had demands to free hostages in the Israeli prisons which also were never mentioned to the why. Avner is thinking/recalling the killing and empathizing with them although there are almost no clear records to what happened exactly in the Olympic hotel room. The world stance from Israel is falsified during the movie as ignoring their agonies while acknowledging the Palestinians' which shouldn't be the case if they have a state over the ruins of an invaded land. The Israelis in the movie are all the time talking about Jews and that they're representing the Jews, as far as known the assassinations were done by the Israeli intelligence for Israeli citizens not all Jews would acknowledge.",6

24 December 2005,"Vengeance As Always Seen Before, Just Not Like This","There's so much I want to say about Steven Spielberg's Munich. So much that needs to be said about what the film that he has made. This film that wraps up thousands of years of debate on morality and idealism, layers it with historical reference and atmosphere, and throws on a cautionary tale only to find that there's still more to this film that what meets the eye. I think of Munich not so much like an onion, but a head of cabbage (soft thriller on top but tougher, more bitter moral questions underneath). By the time that we see the final shot, I realize what exactly it is that Spielberg is trying to say.

Munich starts off with the daring heist of the Olympic Village by a terrorist cell of Black September during the 1972 Games. These are not the hard-headed terrorists that we're used to seeing in movies, but kids who are scared but believe they are doing something for ""the greater good"". The film jumps forward in sprinter's bounds through the next few days as we see the media frenzy, the family reactions, and the officials trying to cope with what is going on. Then it is over, the 11 athletes are killed with Jim McKay's epic words ""They're gone"" bringing the pain home.

But the film is interested in the aftermath of tragedy as the gears in Israel shift into reciprocity. ""Forget peace for now."" Golda Meir says to her advisers. They need to show strength, but can't do so with their hands full of blood. That's where men like Avner (Eric Bana) come in handy. He leaves behind his pregnant wife and family to join a secret operation to hunt down 11 ""targets"" that had a hand in orchestrating Munich. He has a team of four others, unlimited funds in a Swiss bank and ""no ties to Israel"", but he better ""keep his receipts"".

For the next few years, they plan a series of hits on their targets, getting better and more violent as they go along. The team isn't used to such cruelty, since none of them are really mercenaries. Even Avner was just a bodyguard before he took the job. Their bomb-maker (Mathieu Kassovitz) is a toy-maker by profession. And they are soon taking deep hard looks at what they are doing. ""We're supposed to be righteous"" one says in a fit of sadness. Even when they aren't shadowed by paranoia, they still convey in conversation they extraordinary difference between what they were and what they are now doing. And with their every success, Palestine hits back, a macabre dance of death as the old guard is being killed off as the new and more vicious guard takes over. And it's even said that the squads might actually be doing the work of the new guard of the PLO so that they can be in control.

But these are only a couple of the complexities of this film. Government and family dynamics are looked at under a scrutinizing microscope. And the deeper down the rabbit hole we go, we realize that if you replaced the word Munich and put in the phrase 9/11, that we have more in common with Israel than we might want to admit. Especially when the last thing we see before fade out is the twin towers in the background, a not-so-subtle reminder of what we are going through right now in our own country.

Performance-wise, this is a massive achievement in casting. There are no Americans in this cast which is headed by Austrailians Bana (in his best performance ever) and Geoffery Rush, British actors Cirian Hinds and Daniel Craig (yes, the next James Bond) and French actor Kassovitz. They perform wonderfully together and alone. They keep action tight and conversation even tighter. It could easily feel like a Sunday school lesson if it weren't for their performances and the dynamo script penned by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth.

For Spielberg, this film has been a long time coming. If you looked at all of his post-9/11 films, you'll see that they have dealt with portions of the traumatic experience. Minority Report deals with our paranoia, while Catch Me If You Can dealt with our loss of innocence playing dangerous games. The Terminal showed us a look at ourselves from the outside with humor and humility. And even the terrible War of the Worlds showed us the emotional impact of terrorism. But this film adds all of these things in and builds a foundation on all of it. We think that this is the worst thing in the world to happen, when all it really did was break us into what goes on to the rest of the world around us. That's really what Spielburg is trying to say.

There's been a lot said about Spielberg concerning his loyalty to the Jewish community and the Middle East. What he's really doing is making everybody think about the situation going on over there. There are no real victims in that struggle because both sides victimize while playing the victim. I cannot comment about the situation any further because I really don't know enough and I don't want to lead anyone to the impression that I do. But what Spielburg is doing is not drawing conclusions, but observing the behaviors of all sides. Look at the scene where our protagonists spend the night in a ""safe house"" with a PLO group. You'll see what I mean.

All in all, this is the most important film to see and quite possibly a classic in the post-9/11 era. And I can say with some certainty, this is the best film of 2005.",10
15 July 2006,Great tragedy gives you something to think about,"I've seen it 3 times now and it has really made me think about the whole situation. Although it is a story of an event that has taken place over 30 years ago, the whole situation in Israel hasn't changed. That is also the scary part of it.

Steven Spielberg really gives the impression of what possibly(we don't know the details)happened. It is about the response of a group of Israeli's who are ordered to kill all suspects involving the murder of 11 Israeli sports men. As the movie goes on the purpose of their mission is not always clear. Replacements take the tasks of those who have been killed. Some of the group know it isn't right but on the other hand it is.

The 2 1/2 hours are really worth it and this political/historical/drama earns a 9/10 rate because of all that is offers.

20 January 2006,Poorly done remake,"Spielberg's film ""Munich"" is a remake of the 1986 film ""Sword of Gideon"" starring Michael York and Rod Steiger. The true story of the terrorist incident at the 1972 Olympics and the Israeli response. This film is grittier and more graphic than the original, though many scenes are taken verbatim from it.

One problem I have is the title. Kind of like ""JFK"" which wasn't really about JFK, ""Munich"" isn't about Munich. It does recreate the original incident, but better to see the 1999 documentary ""One Day in September"". The final scene with the World Trade Center photoshopped into the scene was effective, but the point that was to be made was too nebulus. What is it exactly Spielberg is trying to say there? Again if you see ""Sword of Gideon"" much of ""Munich"" is redundant, and in a sense a rip-off, especially as it isn't being marketed as a remake, trying to sweep that under the rug. The good points are the realism of the camera-work. I think Spielberg reaches too far by taken incidents and trying to extend them into universal themes. Schindler's list was not the quintessential Holocaust film as some believe, it was a specific story (War and Remembrance would be the quintessential one). And likewise this is so far from a quintessential film on terrorism, but it wants to be.",1

10 April 2007,You don't see movies as fantastic as this everyday.,"This movie is just simply fantastic. Every second of it is edge-of-seat sweaty-palms gasping ACTION. And I'm not saying that because its an action film because is really not. Its a thriller, but one played so beautifully, with characters casted like out of heavens, AFTER SEEING THIS MOVIE, ONE CANNOT DENY SPIELBERG'S ABILITY TO DELIVER.

I don't know how to describe it. But it was so good, so very very good that even until the very end my heart was pumping. Its incredible because it makes you feel like every single character at once, you can feel for them, feel the moment. Even though it sounds corny, when you watch the movie your attention span will not even flinch. This is truly a great movie and watching it has been one of life's greatest experiences. RECOMMENDED FOR ANYBODY.

8 May 2006,"Bold and worth watching, but significant flaws keep it from masterpiece status---6/10","Munich takes a bold look at the MidEast conflict by examining the 1972 Munich massacre and it's aftermath. Steven Spielberg, widely revered in both Hollywood and the Jewish community, puts his neck out by (finally) criticizing Israel and it's politics, if just a little. Israel would make you think it's an anti-semitic film, but in actuality it is a fair look at the pros and cons of both political views. Eric Bana and Daniel Craig lead a Israeli assassin squad ordered to hunt down and kill all those responsible for the killing of 11 Israeli athletes. While the movie has some really exciting scenes and tries to be fair, it is way too long and sometimes seems lost, like it doesn't know which direction it wants to go next. Spielberg could have easily trimmed a half hour of fat off the film. There were some really good scenes in the movie, but they were few and far between. I commend Spielberg for taking risks and giving Palestinians a few moments in the movie to speak; i just wish he packed up all the good stuff in a tighter package. 6/10

26 December 2005,Munich was a very well-made and historically informative film fairly presenting both sides of the conflict',"I recently read in a publication (not sure if I'm allowed to say which it was without getting censored) that the film ""Munich"" would attempt to equally present both sides of the struggle related to the terrorist attacks at the 1972 Olympics. In other words, the article stated that the movie would not be pro-Israel. My brother, with whom I saw the movie, said he believed that the movie favored the Israeli side of the story. I am quite sure that a great many other people would feel that to be the case. This critique is my effort in showing that there was no favoritism in the presentation of this story.

Obviously, it could be expected that Spielberg would favor the Israeli side of the argument in the case of this movie. For example, the majority of the story and plot-line from the movie comes from the Israeli perspective; one could say that there were a great deal of phrases or sayings in Hebrew or Yiddish and that therefore ""Munich"" is pre-disposed to someone who is Jewish. There is clearly some truth in this, much in the sense that if you don't speak Spanish - you will obviously lose some of the meaning from a Spanish language film in subtitles that one who speaks the language would have understood. BUT the reality of that being the circumstance is that it would be historically inaccurate and unrealistic to have Israeli characters from that time, and in those circumstances NOT using that sort of phraseology. If Spielberg had not included this sort of language (for example the phrase, ""Mazel Tov"" in a few instances), it would have not only hurt the character development, but it also would have compromised what he knew to be the reality of the moment. From a film-making standpoint, it would have been irresponsible to make a story about an Israeli group and not have a pre-disposition to SOME degree to the Israeli customs and euphemisms.

Furthermore, there were multiple cases in the film where it presented not only the Palestinian mindset of the current conflict in the Middle East, but also where the terrorists who committed the crimes in Munich did not intend for it to be as violent as it was. In other words, we were not urged to see them as monsters or terrible human beings, as a less politically-sensitive director may have done. Transversely, in certain sequences, it was clearly presented that the main characters struggled with the ethics of their tasks and felt wrong about their actions.

There was also no apparent attempt to make enemies of Palestinians or to show the terrorists as horrible people, but rather to present that they are on one side of a war and that people on either side of a war do what they have to do to fight for that in which they believe. The goal of a terrorist is obviously to create terror, but it was clearly demonstrated that even terrorists, while they commit murder and do horrible things - have families, and are real people. I felt this was an extremely important facet to this film.

Finally, if there wasn't the desire to present both sides, many scenes in which both parties were made wrong or right for their actions could easily have been omitted. Multiple sequences of the movie were presented specifically so that the viewer could be left to devise his or her own feelings and opinions, instead of being led in one direction. I feel that ""Munich"" very well performed its stated purpose of saying that 'terrorism helps no one and hurts everyone', without getting politically one-sided. In addition, it achieved part of its purpose - to put viewers in a position to never forget what happened to the athletes in the events in Munich.",10
21 August 2006,"The athletes were shot, the movie is too","After the blockbuster ""War of the Worlds"", Steven Spielberg quickly followed it with a very different of movie: an historical drama about the killing of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich by Palestinian terrorists.

The situation of 2005 was often compared to 1993. That year, Spielberg made the most-successful film of history (at the time): ""Jurassic Park"". It was quickly followed by what was about to become Spielberg's undisputed masterpiece: ""Schindler's List"", which won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.

While ""War of the Worlds"" is a terrifying and spectacular sci-fi action thriller, ""Munich"" is a very ambitious project, but it ultimately fails to satisfy our expectations.

Let's examine the film point by point. The beginning scenes with the Palestinian terrorists and the Israeli athletes start the movie pretty well. We feel the interaction between the terrorists and the hostages. The mêlée with the terrorists and the police at the airport is thrilling. Unfortunately, it's very uncomfortable to edit it as a Avner's (Eric Bana's character) flashback. It would have been even more convincing and real if it was told in a linear sequence at the beginning of the movie. However, it could have meant that Spielberg would have had to chop out the TV footage, which are quite fascinating.

It tries to be a thoughtful drama about Israeli-Palestinian relations, but it never involves us in an interesting way. It depicts Israelian dialects and traditions, but that's all.

Characters try to be interesting and dramatic enough, but the most interesting are the gang members. Eric Bana is very touching and professional by moments, but he often acts too much spontaneously and we don't believe him. Steve (played by future-super-spy Daniel Craig) is cool and he acts quite well in mood-enhancer scenes, such as the moments where he and an Arab companion argue about the station they will put on the radio.

The plot is too much complicated and the only thing we know for sure is that they have to shoot eleven Arabs who are supposed to be related to the Munich events. We quickly lose ourselves in the action and dialog doesn't help. I never knew the name of some important characters before I saw the credits.

Because it was so much discussed, publicized and aimed by high expectations, ""Munich"" is the kind of work that brings Spielberg back to Earth. It's not because you have a good concept, a good name and a good streak that you're gonna have a good movie. There are fairly good moments in the film, but it's not what it could have been. ""Munich"" is good, but it's also disappointing.",6
3 November 2007,Mumbled mess,"In the interests of making it appropriate, I should probably make this review go on for ages and include a lot of heavily accented muttering and be really obvious in what I am trying to communicate with little by way of anything novel or new in there. At the same time, I should probably have a strong central effort to it, and make the whole thing look pretty. And that, pretty much, would be a fair summation of this mixed-bag from Spielberg. The subject matter was interesting and could have been substantially more thought provoking than it was. Eric Bana was good throughout, but the surrounding cast seemed a little muddled, and whilst the attempt to show a fluid morality was praiseworthy, the end result was just a bit flat and cold. Additionally, a good 30 minutes could probably have been lost without harming the end product. On reflection, I seem to have given the film a bit of a kicking, but that is probably just mainly down to disappointment, as it promised but did not deliver.

10 June 2006,Don't Give Israel Guilt Feelings ***,"While I rated this film *** we are given a depiction of typical Jewish guilt.

This deals with revenge by Israel following the Munich Massacre of 1972.

Along with Steven Spielberg are Janusz Kaminski, his cinematographer, and John Williams for musical scoring. These people worked with Spielberg in the Oscar winning ""Schindler's List"" and other films.

Yes, the picture shows a moral dilemma. After killing many of the assassins, the Israelis are being depicted as committing atrocities as well. The writing was done by Tony Kushner, who has been a frequent critic of Israel during its forever conflict with the Palestinians.

The acting is first rate. Spielberg used many unknowns along with Geoffrey Rush, who is quite effective as an Israeli agent.",7
30 April 2010,"Admirably evenhanded, but ...","The film Munich is fiction, although it's fiction based on fact. How much is fact and how much is fiction I don't know. But then there is also the important point that some fiction — honest fiction — can contain and convey as much truth as fact and that 'fact' is all too often something of a moveable feast: one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, a distinction which is relevant in Steven Spielberg's film Munich. The acts of terrorism it portrays, the slaughter of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics, and the subsequent vengeance meted out by Israel, is so wholly horrifying that to talk of film as entertainment would be obscene. Thankfully, Spielberg is such an outstanding and sensitive filmmaker that at no point does one feel that Munich is in any way intended to entertain. He also attempts, and, I think, largely succeeds — despite himself being Jewish — to remain evenhanded. No one comes out of this smelling of roses, not the Palestinians, not the Israelis, not the shadowy French middlemen and not (their roles are oblique but by no means unimportant) the Soviet KGB and the US CIA, both cynically involving themselves for their own ends. And although of necessity any moral discussion of what the Palestinians do and how Israel reacts cannot in such a film be too detailed, Spielberg also, in my view, admirably remains neutral. As a 'document', although a fictional 'document', Munich gets the cigar. But as a film, I have various quibbles. Visually and narratively and in so many other ways Munich is never short of excellent. Spielberg as an almost innate gift and, for example, tension is organic and not racked up artificially, as is the way of some filmmakers, by all kinds of flammery backed up by some portenous score. The acting is also superb, especially that of — former Australian stand-up — Eric Bana. What rather jarred with me was the ease with which Bana and his group of assassins can move around with ease, can cause extreme havoc, yet are never troubled by the police or a country's secret service. Obviously, were this long film to spend any time at all establishing matters in all the many countries in which the assassins operate, then it would become even longer. But for me the fatal flaw is the shadowy Frenchmen who facilitate the assassins' work at every turn, locating targets, organising safe houses and the like and without whose assistance the assassins would never even get started. Only two of them have speaking roles, a father ('Pape') and his son 'Louis', although there are obviously far more of them. To put it bluntly, they play the role of deus ex machina (although they appear throughout the film rather than at then end to effect some kind of resolution) and without them Spielberg wouldn't have a film. These people are the real cynics, working for the best paymaster and even, it is more than suggested, working for both sides merely to make more money. There is a curious piece of cod philosophising by Papa in which he attempts to justify his cynical approach by suggesting that all governments are 'bastards', but this is such cartoonish stuff that it can hardly be taken seriously. But that is a criticism — and in my book a major criticism — of the 'film' Munich. There is, though, more to Munich than that, and I am prepared to accept that others might not share my sensitivity to such a detail. And that apart, Munch is an extraordinarily good film, not least because it is — my quibble apart — also an honest film.",7
9 January 2006,Spielberg goes for the jugular,"Right from the get-go Steven Spielberg goes for the jugular without pause or hesitation in the opening moments of Munich, his latest film about the events that happened after the 1972 Olympic terrorist massacre. Of course I wasn't alive to have experienced this myself, but what's up on the big screen is nothing short of breathtaking, and shocking. I almost feel as if I did experience it in the same way as many people did back in '72, sitting on their sofa's watching it on television. The opening scenes are brutal, vicious and gut-wrenching, and the same can be said for the rest of what follows afterwards. For those who may have thought that Spielberg might have been ""losing it"" or ""getting soft"", clearly they don't know crap, and obviously haven't seen this film. This is Spielberg's darkest and most razor-sharp film in years, right along side Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. There's just something about the way Spielberg does historically based non-fiction, you get sucked in, you're there...and he's always firing on all cylinders.

Munich is 164 minutes long, and from the start of it Mr. Spielberg demands that you pay attention. The film follows five agents working unofficially for the Israeli secret service to hunt down and assassinate the 11 terrorists that were believed to have been behind the planning the murders of the 11 Israeli athletes during the Olympics in Munich. Leading the team is Avner, who's brilliantly played by Eric Bana, a man who at first feels perfectly fine about taking up this new assignment, but as their assassinations go down, one by one, he starts to feel as if it's all been for nothing. Members of his own team are being hunted down by Arab terrorists, who are getting back at Avner and his team for their assassinations. It goes back and forth, we kill them, they kill us, and it never ends. And in the end Avner fears for his life, his wife and his new born baby, that possibly around every corner, or in any car someone might be trying to kill him. Avner's paranoia is both very real and very haunting, and the things he has done in the name of his country have left scars that will haunt him for the rest of his days.

Munich is one of only a few films to come out of Hollywood that seems to support the idea that killing for revenge is not only a terrible thing, but ultimately pointless. The only other film I've seen in years that suggests the same thing was Clint Eastwood's Mystic River, another great film. Unlike films like Kill Bill or Man on Fire, Munich shows us that revenge is a cycle that never ends; violence begets more violence. And the story and situation that's presented in Munich relates strongly to what's going on in our world, right now as I write this very review. These are the kinds of films that people NEED to see, because they have powerful messages, and they NEED to be heard. This is without a doubt one of my favorite films of 2005. And if the Academy Awards weren't so political, this film should, at the very least get a few Oscar nominations. Why can't there be more films like this?",10
16 August 2006,Politically Correct...,"I have to disagree with most of the critics. This film is not a masterpiece, but nothing more than a propaganda manifesto of political correctness, currently very much ""in vogue"" in 'developped western societies'. I rarely mix politics and films, but considering the aim and message of this movie, I cannot help myself from doing so in this case. I will therefore refrain from commenting on the technical and artistic aspects of the film and concentrate on the essence, which is highly politicized (to avoid any misunderstandings, I would like to clarify I am not Jewish, nor do I have any affiliation whatsoever with Jews or Israel).

This is a typical case of a film praised by all only because it has been made by a great director, and it carries a message almost everybody nowadays wants to hear: hear no evil, see no evil... It is far too simple to sit and preach peace on earth for all from a quiet place and at a safe distance, totally out of contact with reality, the harshness of the real world. Unfortunately, the reality is very much different from the one seen by looking out of a window of a multi-million dollar Villa in Hollywood. Life is a brutal game of survival; always has been, always will be. No matter how much we would like to think that the world is now a better place, that humans have evolved to being a non-aggressive, peace-loving species, the truth is nothing has ever changed since the dawn of time. We are still the same power-thirsty animals, fighting for dominance and survival. Only the means and the form of that fight have changed. We are fooling ourselves if we think that after the end of the cold war, now the world will quietly settle down and cuddle into an eternal period of universal peace. How blindsided can one get? There are wars everywhere, massacres perpetrated daily...

Notwithstanding the end of the cold war, the Russians still like to think of themselves as a superpower, they still see themselves as the 'anti-western' power, they still fear us and hate us, nothing has changed. The Chinese, very much the same. Do we honestly think they are our friends? Or do we prefer to do so because it is good business? The 'Islamic nation' on the other hand, is a story to itself. Do we really think we can simply sit together with the fundamentalists and talk it over? 'Talk it over' with people whose major ambition is to blow themselves up in order to try to kill one of us? Do we really think that they will be content with any kind of agreement? It hurts to think that so many people can be so foolish to believe such nonsense nowadays. Have we already forgotten the scenes of jubilation on the 'arab street' after 9/11? Mark my words: they will not stop before either they destroy us, or we destroy them..., whether we like it or not!

Freedom and peace are not a given, they have always come at a price. If we want to continue being free and to live in peace, we will have to fight for it. Just wishing for it to happen is not good enough! That is an important lesson we must never forget and remember to teach our children. This is why I consider the message that the film bears not only to be bad, incorrect or unrealistic; I consider it dangerous.",6
23 December 2005,"If you don't know the story, research it.","I went to see this movie with my parents. They remembered the massacre of the Israelis at the Munich Olympics, and told me that the movie would be good. It would not be full of action, though...and I think that's what disappointed some people at the movie theater, who were expecting people to kick ass and take names.

I thought Eric Bana was wonderful as Avner, the man hired to be head of the secret operation, and the character of Steve (who ""doesn't care about any blood but Jewish blood""), played by Daniel Craig, was perfectly portrayed as a man who wanted to rush gung-ho into things, but luckily had Bana to calm him down.

It showed the truth of killing and assassination: you cannot have a conscience. If you do, you cannot get anything done. Their first kill was hard (they follow the Arab home to his apartment building and do a 'clumsy' kill by shooting him through his bag of groceries), then it got easier and easier for Bana. Even later, he admits to feeling ""no remorse."" But Bana, the main character in this film, is not completely heartless. He cares very much for his family and his pregnant wife, though I did not think the sex scenes were necessary to show love for one another. A part that touched me was when he called his wife, and his baby girl said ""dada"" over the phone to him, and he started crying. This shows that under the guise of assassin, he was a family man. Later on, however, after they end up getting 7 out of the 11 Arab assassins, he becomes completely paranoid and storms into the Israeli Embassy in New York, demanding they leave his family alone. This is the price he had to pay for doing this line of work.

I am 23 years old, and I enjoyed the story. I wish I knew more about the tale of the Munich Olympic assassinations (I wasn't even born at the time) and wish I had read more about it. So if you don't know a lot about it, read a little on the Munich Olympic assassinations and the story behind Israel, and what they did. Don't expect this movie to be all action; Spielberg is very big on story-driven movies. Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable film, very provocative and well done. It kept me entertained. For his performance, Bana deserves a nomination from the Academy, as does Spielberg for his directing and his wonderful story!",8
27 May 2006,Terrible,"If a movie is based around a real event then it should be faithful to that event and all associated events. After watching this movie I was left wondering why Spielberg chose to change history. First hand accounts are available but he chose to ignore that reality and substitute his own. These assassinations were done professionally and as a means of prevention. I was disgusted at how the Mossad agents were portrayed as morally conflicted amateurs. The real life leader of this team has repeatedly stated that he takes great pride in what he did for his country. I see it as a grave injustice that the brave actions of these men was slighted by an ignorant director for what seem to be pacifist political reasons.

I used to enjoy Dreamworks films. Not anymore.

17 December 2005,"Good action, but disappointing, and muddled overall.","I was so disappointed in this film.

Spielberg's direction is fantastic, as always, and the action scenes are thrilling.

But the script is muddled and poorly structured. It doesn't really bring anything new to the central question it purports to explore. Yes, we all know that revenge is an ethically complex issue. We all know that collateral damage is always possible and that guilt is a heavy cross to bear. But the film doesn't really impart anything beyond these simple platitudes. If that's not bad enough, the last third just gets SLOW. And I agree with a previous poster that the ""climax"" scene (wink, wink) is just unbearably ham-handed.

It's too bad, because the subject matter is so relevant to today's political situation. Spielberg could've said something really important and thought provoking, here, but if only his themes were as complex as his camera moves.",6
14 February 2006,Mossad portrayed as humane....,"I think this was one of the best late Spielberg movies: it has an interesting plot, suspense, action, it is less cheesy than usual... you are led into the picture from the beginning and cannot get out till the end... Obviously being made by a Jewish director we cannot expect a complete balance in the portrayal of such delicate situations and reasons behind them, but we can all see he must have made quite an effort to try and be impartial. In the end, contrarily to the old and unfortunately (for some, because Biblical) still valid saying ""an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth"" the quite simple message is that violence leads to more violence and this is not the way to follow... Beyond Spielberg's usual nice and moral messages (which I cannot digest easily anymore), still a few things didn't convince me in this movie. Who can really believe that Mossad (Israel's very efficient secret services) are so humane and have the conflictual thoughts of most of the components of that gang in the movie? If that was the case I doubt they were so efficient in killing and retaliate, as it happen-ed/s in real life... Can we possibly believe that all information came from a source which we never get to understand who they really are or work for (seems quite a dangerous and unconvincing part of the story)?? Why do we keep seeing Eric Bana having the nightmare of what happened in the airport (even when he has sex!!) if he wasn't there that night? Shouldn't he (especially if he is so humane...) have nightmares of the people he actually kill himself??? And, as usual, the Palestinians seem to be some kind of poor and dirty desperate fanatics, while Mossad have reasons to eventually do even worse things and then, being so enlightened and humane, to have conflictual feelings... Come on Steven!",6
3 August 2021,No Side,"This is a Great movie, I'm not either denomination, just enjoyed the suspense, the acting, the history makes me go read about it every time I watch it. Each person or group has its own reasons for participating in these events whether it's vengeance, country, religion, or soul, in the end it's the same ""human nature"" and the ugliness that engulfs all beings. Money is always the thing that keeps this stuff alive in the end. As far as movies go this was great cinema.

11 January 2006,absolutely shocked,"This may be one of the best historical movies I've ever seen. Steven Spielberg's Munich is uncompromising in its vision and open for discussion as how races are portrayed in this movie. It doesn't show one race or another in a bad light, it shows them as equals. What also works so well here is that this is a really well made Hollywood movie in historical and political clothing. You have violence, really graphic violence and some sex, nudity for both audiences as well.

Eric Bana gives the performance of his career as Avner, the leader of an assassination group targeting the people who killed Isreali athletes at 1972 Munich Olympics. Bana picks up a very convincing accent and a conscience embodied within a hit-man. It's such a strong performance, but I feel critics are underrating Bana's performance. I think its his best.

Daniel Craig plays Steve, a driver who hardly EVER panics even under fire. What Craig does is try to capture his soul, despite the fact that his character is not sympathetic. It's daring, and it WORKS.

The 2 hour and 45 minute running time might be a buffer, but this is a VERY important film and one of the best movies of the year. The violence might be a little disturbing for most people, as it was for me, and thats why i'm giving it 9/10.",9

6 February 2006,Why?,"What on earth made Spielberg tackle something like this l don't know, l watched most of it and to be honest l did not like it much after the first 30 minutes, but thought l would give it more chance, l thought it was bitty, it went from country to country without telling the viewer where you were, l remember Ciarian Hinds in a great (Jeremy Brett) Sherlock Holmes story, he's wasted here, the only bright part was when an older Michael Lonsdale (Drax in Moonraker) was on screen. I think it is very hard to portray modern history in an objective way, and to be honest l don't think this was a very good subject to film, without spoiling it for anyone the violence is sharp and unrelenting but there is to much talk between the action and that is where it looses it's way, see it and then make your decision...l give it 4/10

23 July 2016,???,"I have just watched this after watching One Day in September. Munich's primary way of identifying Jews is to have them say Mazeltov a lot. I found the whole film confusing - I had no idea who was on whose side and what the hell was going on beyond a lot of shooting and remote controlled bombs. Great if you like that sort of thing. Occasional interesting bits of dialogue - such as the importance of home for a nation - hidden among all the violence and sentimentality and an irritatingly self-conscious portrayal of Golda Meir. But everyone is pretty much as bad as everyone else and the film is a great proof of the saying ""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind"".

7 January 2006,Steven Spielberg could have made it shorter...,"The dialogue was well written,the cinematography was excellent and what I believe to be the best John Williams score yet, but the film didn't match up to Steven Spielberg's other works. Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan but this film just didn't work for me, but I would still give it a six out of ten. It's great that he is trying to get people to see things in a different light but it just seemed to be too long, which hurt the film the most. It was hard for me to understand what was going on as well, due to the fact that I know nothing of the matter before watching this film. Going in all I knew was about some event that happened at the 1972 Summer Olympics. The film shows what happened on that day and the days that would follow. Someone who is familiar with the story would probably enjoy this film more than someone who hasn't. I guess it like a history lesson for the rest of us, and for that I say thanks...

26 December 2005,Some people won't want you to see this movie.....,"This is a movie that some people won't want you to see because it gets beyond the simplistic propaganda of the media, and self-righteous introjected beliefs of our parents. It is a reality that goes beyond wishful thinking.

It is not a movie of hope in the naive sense, but hopeful in the sense that just maybe we can raise the consciousness in the world that we can at least respond to the situation with sanity.

Violence, complicity, duplicity, manipulation and paradox will make this movie a challenge to the belief systems of those who prefer to take in their information about the world from single sources.

Look beyond the ratings of this movie, those that would prefer things not to change will not like it. I was never bored although the movie is long, and I was entertained although the movie was very serious.",10
27 April 2006,Meaningful movie but dragged to the limit of patience!,"Steven Spielberg's name on the promos initially seemed like a stamp of quality. But soon, my curiosity faded when Munich which munched on and on for nearly three hours which really let me down. But, it's not too bad either. The gusto with which the movie begins makes it seem like re-creation of an action flick from history. The impeccable Spielberg stuff is seen in the film's technical stuff which can transport a viewer to the 1970's and makes one empathize the deaths of the athletes at the games.

Munich is the story of the aftermath of 11 Israeli athletes being killed by a Palestinian terrorist group called Black September during the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Four Agents of Mossad which is the Israeli version of CIA are under the leadership of Avner, (played by Eric Bana better known for his role as Hector in Troy) are sent for assassination of those responsible for the Munich massacre in what was historically called the ""Operation Wrath of God"". These men who are chosen by the Prime Minister Golda Meir herself are to leave their families for an indefinite time till their job is done.

The movie shows some gruesome assassinations and the errors that they make which actually make the movie far more realistic than the usual smooth action flicks. You see, Spielberg had a historical story to stick to. But in his eagerness to portray the feelings of the protagonist about the assassinations and his pining for his family, the movie was at least stretched by 20 minutes. The worst thing is that the movie's best points are made in those stretched parts. This one is only for those who love watching slow movies.

Rating: 6/10",6
9 January 2006,An Ingenious Fantasy by a Fantasy Genius.,"""Munich"" is not about Munich. Nor is it about events which followed the massacre of Israeli athletes. It is about Steven Spielberg's ego. And how far into audacious he can drive it without becoming Oliver Stone.

This movie's tagline boasts, ""The world was watching in 1972 as 11 Israeli athletes were murdered at the Munich Olympics. This is the story of what happened next."" Well, not exactly. It's what author George Jonas, screenwriters Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, and film-maker Steven Spielberg *think* happened next.

""Munich"" opens with a brutally-graphic hostage-taking sequence; Palestinian guerrilla group Black September killing and cudgeling the Israeli barracks into submission; news programs worldwide replaying that famous footage of the masked terrorist on the balcony we all remember watching obliviously as kids.

But before this sequence  four glib words: INSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS - simultaneously endowing the movie with *faux* import whilst granting Spielberg ""artistic license""  in other words, granting him the impunity to lie off the hook. The source material for this film solely being Jonas' self-admittedly uncorroborated book (""Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team""), makes this movie as much a fantasy as ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark.""

As Lew Wallace's decorative details in ""Ben-Hur: A Tale of The Christ"" (1880) achieved ""fact"" status simply through their compelling documentation in a powerful work of art, (even though the supposed Christian source tome, the King James Bible, is devoid of those details), it is only a matter of time before Spielberg's fiction will be regarded as doctrine if no further documentation of these events is made. (I doubt anyone will remember Michael Anderson's ""Sword Of Gideon"" in 1986  lesser movie, from same book.)

Eric Bana (still trim, taut and Troy-riffic from his last feature) is Avner, a Jewish family man and Mossad agent, called upon by Israeli Prime Minister, Golda Mier (Lynn Cohen) to lead a covert team in blood-revenge for the Munich massacre. Much is made over Mier's rationalization of morality  every ""Munich"" reviewer revels in flaunting her line - yet Mier only verbalizes (euphemistically, at best) how every individual behaves in every situation they encounter  by ""negotiating compromises with their own values"", i.e. using ""circumstantial morality"". There is *no* Kantian ""outside morality""; it is *all* Nietzschean nihilism. Truth cuts to cure. Was it not blood retribution that George W. Bush called for (admittedly less articulately) in retaliation against September 2001's terrorist attacks? Did not America rally behind him like maniacal rednecks out for Middle Eastern blood?

Where was your morality then, Christians?

More intriguing than morality conundrums is the mindset that would allow a person to pawn themselves out to a government who admit openly that they will deny your existence - and probably try to make you *truly* non-existent  simply for performing a duty for your country. (Maybe the government stance on anyone sociopathic enough to accept their ""uncivilized"" assignments in the first place, is to summarily excise those unbalanced personalities from society.) Whether the vengeance squad questioned the morality of their actions is simply ""writer's speculation"", and is a storytelling staple akin to anthropomorphizing animals: to add dramatic flesh to the plot and to better identify with the characters  but can people who enter into such one-way self-sacrifices be understood or ""humanized"" at all?

Avner's team, four misfits from various middle-class walks of life, includes Robert the toymaker-turned-bombmaker (Mathieu Kassovitz), who bears a disturbing resemblance to Arnold Horshack, and who pulls the short straw to perform the first execution with Avner. In a flustered scene, their hesitancy at pulling the triggers whilst facing their target - questioning the target insistently with no defining answers - illustrates that even with purchased ""intelligence information"", Avner still has deep-rooted doubts as to whether their targets are the actual terrorists. But again, we must ask: when the original Mossad agent dictated his tale to George Jonas, did he merely add this trait to his personality to humanize himself? Or did Jonas add this element to elicit sympathy for the titular ""heroes"" exacting revenge - for without this hesitancy in killing, wouldn't that make them as evil as the terrorists they were executing?

Avner's operatives complete 5 of the 11 killings before the movie  and, we presume, the piecemeal intel the real-life assassins had to work with - runs out of steam. Munich's powerful performances, masterful cinematography and direction are tempered by its slipshod conclusion, which leaves no resolution to the storyline (supposedly ""true"", so left dangling and expecting forgiveness), and a hundred rhetorical questions in its wake: does retaliation benefit economically or politically?; how does a retaliatory individual or nation return to their former steady state?; will Arnold Horshack ever graduate?...

Having wiped the term ""politically incorrect"" from his vernacular after ""Jaws"", ""revenge killing"" would seem outside the Spielberg canon  but as long as both predators and prey in ""Munich"" sport indeterminate Middle Eastern accents, Spielberg could rest assured that ruffled feathers would only belong to pundits unimportant to the funding and distribution of the film. Minority groups could whine over unfair depictions, but their placarding of theaters and seeking of reparations would only lend impetus to the film in the western-dominated avenues where it is slated to reap its income.

Anyway, after the bloodlust directed at all Middle Easterners after the 9/11 debacle (in such an arbitrarily juvenile manner that Public Service Announcements had to be aired actually describing the ideological, religious and national differences between foreigners of Middle Eastern descent), how much does White America *really* care about Arab nations assailing each other's jugulars - in a world INSPIRED BY STEVEN SPIELBERG?

11 January 2006,Stunning,"One word to describe the movie - stunning !!! It is one of the most realistic movies I have seen in my life, and this is coming from someone who watches about 5 movies a week on average. Why should one watch this movie: 1. For the top-notch acting by the cast. The selection of actors itself is excellent. 2. For a very realistic depiction of Israel at that time. 3. For the way the movie forces us to think. 4. For many thrilling moments 5. For a captivating depiction of the events at the airport.

Some might argue that the movie is a bit long, but who cares, as long it holds your attention, as long as the suspense is nail-biting, as long as the dialogues are of high-quality.

It is one of those movies which stayed in my head for a very long time.

29 November 2006,WOW rethink this movie people,"I don't know if everyone who posted on this website was watching the same movie as me, but if i had a choice on this website i would have given this movie a half of a star. Now don't get me wrong i like Steven Spielberg and i think he has produced excellent movies including one of my favorites, Saving Private Ryan, but seriously was i the only person tricked into seeing this movie. More on that later... Now i know that it has been about a year since i saw the movie but to this day i am still haunted by the effects of this film. Not only did i lose my 10 dollars for the ticket (which is a given) but i also lost over 2 hours of my time, my dignity, and respect. I am cut off indefinitely amongst my peers from ever picking out a movie due to my choice to drag them along to Munich. The major complaints about this movie is that it had no plot...and i mean no plot. There were vultures hovering around the theater the movie was so dead. After watching it and forcing myself to stay through it since i paid 10 dollars i now know that Eric Bana(who was once of my favorite actors) envisions cars blowing up and other violence of that nature during sex, and i also know how many ceiling tiles there are at my local theaters because looking up and counting had a better plot, and was more exciting than the movie. Also on a lighter note I'm not sure if this is accurate but i wasn't quite sure that the U.S. Olympic team was responsible for letting the terrorists into the Olympic complex enabling them to kidnap the Israeli athletes. What it basically comes down to is that i was tricked into seeing a movie that i and I'm sure millions of other people (including an angry crowd that left the theater with me) believed that this movie was actually about the historical and plot filled drama of the events that happened during the kidnapping and raid during the 1972 Olympics and not about the nothing that happened after wards.",1

""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, ""When does it ever end?""

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. ""Munich"" could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul. ""When does it ever end?"" Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",3
28 December 2005,I love the negatives on the movies...,"I love looking at the negatives on the movies on this website. Most negatives, like the reply that ""shames"" Spielberg, use mass amount of verbiage to justify their stupidity. It shines through so blatantly, it makes you wonder why they don't just get up and walk out, or why they go to see a movie anyway. Love the one that says ""Alias"" or ""24"" is better editing...(guess someone's cable was out and therefore they had to waddle out to the car and go see a real film?)

This is thought provoking film (and very good at it). That is problematic for some (probably and unfortunate bi-product of too much white bread and a ""no child left behind"" education), but it is interesting to see one ""hated it"" review talking about pro-Palestine views followed by another ""hated it"" stating a pro Israel POV. This is exactly the point of the film.

I look forward to reading more of your inane comments.

Keep it coming duds.",10
7 December 2005,I have seen it,"I went to a screening last night. Spielberg did a great job of weaving events of Munich with re-imagined events of agents plotting their attacks. Eric Bana's character has a lot of depth and his acting his excellent, plenty of emotion and his range is amazing. What his character goes through not only as a man, but as a man on a mission, with a family, and the allegiance to his country makes his mind go through many tumultuous stages. Various underlying characters do a great job, as members of his team. The next Bond, Daniel Craig's character is a bit showy, Matthieu Kassovitz is virtually unrecognizable, and Ciaran Hinds character remains composed.

As for any stance regarding Jewish/Palestinian comments that Spielberg/Tony Kushner/Eric Rogh make, I think they are taking real events that happened in our lifetime, some of which have to be re-imagined. They realize that peace in this region is still an ongoing process, and who knows when this may occur, but it is something we can wish for. It is interesting that there is dialogue that reflects this ideology, and yet today, the same situation remains in the Middle East.",8
18 January 2023,"Technically great, weak plot.","Watching the recreation of the period, the camera work, special effects; experiencing the diegetic 'score' and general feel of 'Munich' was a treat and allowed one to push many nagging questions about motivation, coincidence and false morality to the back of one's mind. However the excessive run-time, weak plot (and its holes) proved a bit of a downfall. The film is an hour over its welcome. Avner's approach at the last act is just not believable, and the bizarre sex-scene/'flashback' sequence was implausible, weird and ultimately comedic. The film is only saved by the technical directing, and classic tense action sequences (however cliched).

2 January 2006,"Munich72 Real World, Spielberg's Film","There's ""Munich"" the film, and Munich Olympics 1972 the event and its real-world aftermath; getting the two together would be impossible under the best of circumstances.

For those who weren't there - the World in 1972 - or unaware of Israel's various policy responses to threats, conflict and terrorism since 1948, Spielberg's powerful dramatization of the Black September terrorist Israeli hostage taking and tragically bungled ""rescue"" attempts by German federal and regional government cannot but generate powerful emotional and political responses.

His sub-text, what ""violence"" does to those who seek justice and whether counter-terrorist violence only encourages a continuing cycle of violence, may be right or wrong, effective or ineffective. As a film - exempting Spielberg's over-the-top closing sexual scene - and as art, it has and will continue to provoke an important discussion. One can only hope that discussion's heat throws ""light"" rather than burning everyone involved.

One ( or two ) very important - and it appears reflexively overlooked - reality checks.

No one on the Black September ( terrorist ) side has said they would not repeat the hostage taking, in fact one planner still standing complains Spielberg has slighted his role by not including him! And - perhaps more to the film's probing point and where Spielberg takes off from less disputed fact - no one on the Israeli side, including both ""Avner,"" the Mossad first- among-equals Mossad agent of George Jona's very thoughtful and questioning account, and not Jonas, either, has disagreed with both the counter-terrorism idea or the counter- terrorism actions.

So despite journalist/Israeli military intelligence expert Aaron J Klein's just-published ""Striking Back,"" there's agreement - any ""doubts"" about either the righteousness or the efficacy of that Israeli counter-terrorism while they may have been in the air, in every participant's final judgment the mission was wholly justified. Doubts for discussion, maybe; doubts about efficacy, maybe - but no doubts sufficient to stall or withdraw from completing the counter-terrorism mission.

Secondly, why were the ""beans"" spilled in the first place?

Spielberg's film dramatizes one reason - doubts as to whether counter-terrorism responses in fact become a successive stage of terror, perpetuating the ""cycle"" of violence. But Jonas - and a number of other military intelligence accounts - suggest another, just as old and just as serious, set of reasons. ""Politics,"" general, organizational, internal and just plain personal. Whomever disputes Jonas' account must concede, handling the material in a fair-minded way, those complex political realities. Mossad is no less immune to internal strife than the CIA or KGB.

If some terrorists believed they were ""removed"" by an opposing faction, what was supposed to prevent Avner from bailing when the Hunters not only became the Hunted, but the Israeli support - and funds - became more and more restricted, when the strings became tighter, more controlling? Spielberg gives some credence to this second set of reasons, including concerns about both Avner's family in Israel and his wife - and child - in New York City. But where Spielberg must necessarily sketch these - the fish Spielberg's frying is that first reason - Jonas and others simply have more time, and space, to lay out what for this Reader are more persuasive arguments about how the political devolves into the personal.

While Spielberg worries about the ancient Ends vs Means, the tired, frustrated, frightened foot soldiers lack either the luxury or the means to engage in political philosophy - they signed on for themselves, not their families.",8
24 December 2005,Thoughtful and thought-provoking,"Steven Spielberg creates a thoughtful and thought-provoking visual essay on the morality of revenge set against the 1972 massacre of Israeli athletes in Munich. Simplistic at times  understandably so, given the nature of the long and volatile history of the Middle East  the film effectively reduces the complex issue of Israel's territorial and sovereignty rights to a personal level. In a mesmerizing performance by Eric Bana who plays Avner, a Mossad agent contracted to hunt down those responsible for the atrocities in Munich, ""Munich"" unapologetically echoes the truth of the well-known apothegm: violence begets violence. A particularly worthy film  and a pleasant surprise from Mr. Spielberg.

12 March 2006,Spielberg's best since Schindler's List,"Munich is undoubtedly Steven Spielberg's best film since Schindler's List. In today's world of international terrorism, Munich is highly relevant and it deeply explores the conflict between country, duty, family and humanity. Told mainly through the view of Avner (Eric Bana), you can see just how difficult and disturbing waging a war against selected enemies can be. Leaving your family to perform a duty for country is already a hard task to swallow, while executing team strategies against the enemy adds even more danger and hardship.

Spielberg's directing in this movie is very striking and artistic, which not only exposes the most relevant elements of Munich but it also delivers deep impact to your conscience. That's right, Spielberg's impact is too powerful to ignore and your conscience will tingle a lot. Truly Spielberg is one of the greatest (if not the greatest) and he stands high and right beside the legends of Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and Lino Brocka.

30 January 2006,A movie no one is likely to like,"The reason I gave Munich such a ridiculously high vote is not the acting, nor is it the script or anything else. It is for the guts Steven Spielberg had to make a movie that appeals to no one. It's his personal statement, and as such, the general audience simply is not capable of appreciating it.

The younger audience comes to see the Israeli version of a 1970-s James Bond take care of the bad guys, and leave disappointed, after having slept through most of the movie. Teens beware - IT IS NOT AN ACTION MOVIE!

The older audience appreciates the portrayal of the 1970-s, but dislikes the whole issue the movie is about. Most of them do not know enough to even understand the events that take place on the screen.

The Jews and the Arabs don't like it because the movie is not pro-Israeli (it really isn't), neither is it pro-Palestinian (it really isn't). Furthermore, as they are directly involved in the conflict, they know the facts and have long since formed an opinion, hence Munich is of no use to them.

The only people to fully appreciate it are the few who know the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, can understand a bit of Arabic and Hebrew, have cultural awareness and yet have not taken sides in the conflict. I doubt there are more than a few thousand of such people in the whole world.

Therefore, this movie is a tremendous achievement. A bit of advice though - if you decide to watch it, do some reading first. Read about the events, read about the conflict. And as you enter the theater, leave all your opinions behind - bring nothing but pure knowledge with you.",10

17 January 2015,one-sided and not entertaining,"As usual in Hollywood movies, ignoring decades of oppression of the Palestinians by Israelis, depict the Arabs (Palestinians) as mere terrorists, savages whose only way of life is to kill Jews. I am an atheist (ex-muslim), I don't hate Jews just like I don't hate Christians, Buddhists, or Hindus. In fact, I hate religion and I detest terrorism and violence in any form (physical or emotional),  and firmly believe that violence is never a solution. But when it comes to the Palestinians, decades of suicide bombings, assassination missions, kidnapping of Israelis for prisoner swap, killing, torturing etc, I can hardly blame them, they are reluctantly goaded to this horrible life style. This is not a way of life, nobody wants to live like this, but when someone loses his home, his land, his freedom, his life  basic human rights trampled on with tank treads, morals will wither and disappear and blind hatred and violence will arise.

 No western movie has ever depicted the Palestinian oppression by Israelis, how they destroy their homes, their farms, their properties, killing their sons or whoever resists, desecrating their beliefs, plundering their land with their expanding colonies  the list goes on. But the Media always show the Arabs as attacking and the Israelis as defending, never the other way around. No one on earth (including the Arabs) condones what the Palestinian militants did in Munich, it's appalling and inhumane but has anyone ever thought why they did what they did? Those young Palestinians must have had families, children, friends, life . Like other people on earth they must had their own dreams, prospects , why would they do this!!! Can anyone Imagine the pressure pushing them toward this kind of violence, this desperation to embark on mission impossible (kidnap the Israeli Olympic team to swap them for Palestinian prisoners) knowing they don't stand a chance? that no one is gonna let them take those hostages no matter what?

I'm an Arab but I hate the Arab culture, their obscurantist traditions and customs, their stagnant civilization and most importantly their predominant and violent religion: Islam. I know the influence of Islam on violence (especially in the middle east), a religion whose more than half of its scripture dedicated to hatred and killing of other people ""infidels"", a religion that honors terrorism and deem it the ultimate good that leads to heaven. Muslim people have become terrorists, not only because their religion tells them so, but also because the west have always had their hands in the middle east, undermining the stability of the region and the sovereignty of its countries under the guise of democracy and freedom, mostly to make sure the OIL stays under their control, and probably some other strategic purposes. As for the Palestinians, they not only had their share of foreign intrusions, they had their land taken.

 The movie was biased and one-sided, it was not entertaining, and the message it delivered was wrong. I feel sad to see such hatred from both sides, and even sadder that the rest of the world does almost nothing to stop the atrocities committed and endeavor for peace between the two sides, instead they take sides with the oppressors, it's a shame. We are all human beings, we all have 46 chromosomes in each cell of our bodies, we all laugh when we are happy and we all cry when we are sad ... but it seems that the silly differences between us that we human beings created by default will always tear us apart no matter how high our thinking become and in spite of all the biological evolution breakthroughs that eventually led to our existence, we are higher animals, yet interestingly we are the only species on this planet where members kill or mutilate each other, simply for joy !

what a doomed review, neither of the two sides are gonna like it, I bet not even the moderate and open minded of them, but then again, who cares...

nobody likes the sordid truth? ...

sooo what?",4
8 January 2006,Spielberg scores again,"Once again the man whose known as the best filmmaker in Hollywood scores again with an incredible film. From start to end we are immersed in the amazing screenplay, acting, directing -- everything, its perfect. But what strikes me the hardest is that every kill is unique, personal, and fantastically executed. Every assassination is different, yet their one strong commonality is that we don't see the ""target"" as a ""target,"" we see them as a person. We know them as vulnerable, as a father, as a good person. And we watch each one suffer. Incredible work. I was surprised to see Spielberg make a picture that criticizes Israel as he is one of the most admired and active Jews in the world, however I believe he is making a statement about how there is no black and white and to terrorism and war in general. My one criticism for the film is the sex seen towards the end when we lose some respect and humanity with Avner. But, thats it. Definitely worth the price of admission. Could not have been better.

26 February 2021,A Mixed Bag,"After Schindler's List, which is a master piece I can tell Spielberg wanted to continue the realism feel he did in the former in Munich. The problem was it just wasn't duplicated in a good way. His overall message worked, which is that war is never ending. Revenge begets revenge and it just never ends, i.e. the conflict in the middle east continues with no end in sight. I liked that part, especially that Munich wasn't preachy or took any particular side, at least in an overtly biased way.

However, the writing wasn't very good. A perfect example is when he arrives at Papa. He asked a direct question of why he is there and then Papa responds with the typical ""movie"" poetic speech about something entirely different, here it is food and cooking. This has been done in a million movies where the writer thinks he/she is clever by injecting some elegant poetic writing into the film, but it is phony because no one speaks like that. The whole Papa scene was also totally unnecessary. It added nothing to the film. All he did was repeat what his son already had said many times. Finally, Papa and his son had arbitrary rule of not wanting to work with Governments, which were never explained. It just seemed to have been injected into the film for no reason other than to create some ""cool element."" It served no purpose at all and distracted from the movie's pace.

Another issue with the writing is the constant exposition. They constantly had the actors explain out loud the obvious. For example how the bomb would work etc, when we could actually see how it worked. We don't need to get an explanation that the bomb would go off after someone picks up the phone after seeing they placed a bomb inside the phone. This is just bad writing and a failure to trust the audience's intellect.

Another issue I had was Munich is SO directed, overly directed. Every camera move and actor blocking was so carefully choreographed while trying to create a documentary feel. Watch Straight Time to get a real sense of documentary feel cinema where you don't have fancy camera moves and actors staged. But instead totally organic and the camera is just there to observed the scene, rather than to dictate the scene.

It was also too slow. Do we really need a 3 hour movie of killing the perpetrators of the Munich terror attack? It was interesting for 30-45 minutes and then it grew tiring. The film should have been less than 2 hours long.

An interesting choice was to use very little music compared to most of Spielberg's films which are usually wall-to-wall music. I prefer no music, but you also have to make up for that in editing and sound design. When you are out and about there is sound that is ALIVE. Hollywood has an issue with stripping down everything and then replacing it with foley and ADR, but it rarely feels nature or real. Munich suffers from this.

If you are going to make a movie based on history don't fall into the trap of Valkyrie, which was a movie based on historical facts, i.e. killing Hitler but we knew Hitler didn't get assassinated so the movie lacked in suspense because they failed to focus on any character relationships that we could care about. Unlike Schindler's List which had those elements, i.e. it showed character and relationship build up and changes so we cared, Munich lacked in all the foregoing which made it uninteresting and lacked emotional connection. I just didn't care enough about anyone in this film.

Finally, they are supposed to work for the most powerful intelligence agency in the world and be some of the best military agents, but I have never seen so much incompetence before. Too much hesitancy with every killing. That just would't happen. Why go through all the trouble of planting bombs when they can literally just shoot each one of them? That didn't make any sense.",5

24 December 2005,An Excellent Movie and Hope for Peace,"I saw the movie yesterday with a full movie theater in the afternoon and most people were riveted. Yes, there were one or two who walked out, but my question is why.

Spielberg never judges the occurrences of Munich or the Israeli team who was to hunt down the perpetrators, what he does that is most important is raise ethical and moral questions.

Is that so wrong. I simply don't understand why some people are boycotting the film. I think maybe you should go see the film and then you can go make up your mind.

Spielberg's message is that when we use violence, violence comes back to us and that is true. He humanizes both peoples; the Israelis and the Palestinians and through them shows the terrible tragedy that is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Never at any one point does he make a moral judgement against anybody.

I don't understand. We're supposed to live in a democracy and Spielberg has the right to express the opinion through his movie, but for people to make up their minds either before they see it, or deciding to see it with a bias, doesn't help anyone.

It's a movie with open-ended questions, it doesn't judge, but raises very important, very relevant questions.

Is it wrong to question? I think a people or nation loses its soul when it's restrained from or refuses to ask important questions and looks at their own actions...that's what people in the movie are doing they are constantly self-examining themselves to see if their actions were right-for their peoples, nations, families. What is home after all? (as the movie asks)

That is not wrong-that is human! In short, if you haven't see the movie, go see it and then make up your mind...and PLEASE see it with an open mind and without judgement.

I think in order to be able to really look at peace it is important that we take a critical look at our own actions and words...they are not always right and we should ALWAYS question.

Thanks!",

19 November 2019,Gave it a 7 star rating,"Maybe two stars too high, but I like E. Bana , D. Craig stinks as an actor, and it makes the Israeli's look like terrorists themselves!

8 February 2006,This Is It,"Not a totally faultless film - Rush's performance is perhaps too inconsistent, and it may be a little over long - but this is Spielberg's Best Film all round. I'm thinking possibly because it is his most morally 'ambivalent', and it contains many curious facets. Previously his serious films seem to have been built of neatly constructed and shaped cubes that are stacked with great surety, and yet somehow this regularity seemed to deny the randomness of 'real life'. MUNICH contains many odd-shaped components that when stacked into an impressive whole, create the unease and unpredictability of human existence. Life's not made up of bad guys and good guys - rather there are good guys who do bad and vice versa. It's an impressively mounted piece of work, and one can't help wondering if the speed of the production process which meant shooting in June, and delivering finished prints by Christmas, has aided in eliminating the opportunity for an overly studied and crafted feel. MUNICH is a valuable contribution to debate on current global geopolitical questions, smartly articulated in the final scene, with the final pan sounding a premonitory but discreet warning of things to come.",9
24 December 2005,"violent, deep, touching....extremely moving...Spielberg does it again.","I know I am running out of adjectives to describe this movie...but I must say I was deeply move by watching it. Firstly, a marvelous performance by Eric Bana (a fresh face instead of the hackneyed big stars). This was exactly what the movie needed for the lead role. Great European locations to give the motion picture a true feel of what was happening; rusty streets, intimidating men with guns, gun shots in the background. All worked out superbly. Most important of all the historical significance. We all know about the German Olympics in 72 and as rightly tagged this is what happened after that. One of the very rare weak points are its a bit long, at times it keeps on lagging. But the ending was brilliant and after watching the whole movie I felt it was worth 3 hours. If you are a movie who wants some fun, this one is not for you. Surely it doesn't bring the chills n thrills which king Kong or Narnia does, but its a class movie-making. And here Spielberg wins over Peter Jackson (there are some who have started comparing them). Overall, a must watch for all who wants to see good movies: 9 stars out of 10.

11 May 2006,'Home is all that matters',"Attempting to understand what drives people to kill other people for any reason is, in the pit of the soul, a challenging enigma. Whether that 'reason' is war between countries at odds, protecting one's self when endangered, revenge or vengeance for deeds perpetrated by 'the other', for panic in the moment of survival - each of these feels wrong despite the fundamental belief to the contrary at the moment of killing. MUNICH is about killing, about vengeance, about protection of 'home', about existence in a world so bifurcated by age-old schisms, and about us. And while absorbing all of the 2 1/2 hour plus visual and philosophical information put forth in this epic film, the viewer is so paralyzed by the story that blinking for a second seems irreverent.

The tragedy of the 1972 Olympics - the brutal kidnapping and murder of eleven Israeli athletes by masked Arab/Palestinian marauders - is brought to the screen with brave and gutsy realism by a brilliant script by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth based on George Jonas' book Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team, directed with straightforward, no-nonsense sensitivity to all participants by Steven Spielberg, and brought to life by a cast that simply could not be finer. From the opening of the film sans credits with the Black September act of breaking into the Olympic games in Munich, the film moves swiftly through the formation of an anti-terrorist league of Israeli assassins whose job it is to hunt down the killers and murder them, to the final painfully unsettled end. This is all under the instruction and guidance of Golda Meir (brilliantly played by Lynn Cohen) and her advisors.

The team of Avner (Eric Bana), Steve (Daniel Craig), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), Hans (Hanns Zischler), and Mossad Accountant (Oded Teomi) are instructed by Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) and stripped of their identities to enter this mission. They roam the world based on information purchased from a secret group led by Louis (Mathieu Amalric) and Papa (Michael Lonsdale). Gradually growing into the roles of assassins the group begins to murder each of the perpetrators until their success is noticed by all manner of secret agencies (including the American CIA) and the tables are turned: the lives of the Israeli assassins are as endangered as those of the Arab murderers. In a particularly touching moment in the dark, Avner and a Palestinian soldier debate the need for the state of Israel and the opposite need for holding onto home by the Palestinian: it is a moment of writing that sums up the entire Israeli conflict.

The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski and the music score by the always fine John Williams add dimensions of atmosphere to this dark film, but it is Spielberg doing what he does best in directing attention to moments in history that will never be buried that makes this phenomenal movie an emotional experience for everyone, no matter their political or religious beliefs. It is simply a brilliant film about the need for Home - that sacred place whether internal or external that maintains the reason to live and even to die for it. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp",10

20 May 2006,Masterpiece,"This movie is a master piece in all forms. it covers the story of the Munich terrorist attack and the retaliation. i think that many people are being hard on Spielberg (although i agree with his inability to end movie well). in many of the action sequences throughout the movie, i noticed many elements of "" saving private Ryan""...the ""gunplay"" sounds like ""saving private Ryan""...and the way the atmosphere is created around the shooting.. also this movie had more action than i anticipated.

Acting is brilliantly done by Bana and others. i thought Geoffrey rush was also very good. this movie takes u deep into a hit-man's life. we see the effects it has on the man.

this movie does touch upon many moral issues. like whether or not the hit-man accomplished anything by killing all those men. and whether retaliation is the way to go about difficult issues.... Overall this is the best movie i have seen this year.

14 January 2006,I want Raiders Spielberg back.,"This must just be the year of me being damn hard to impress. That's my story for Film 2005: Bored. (and yet my favorite film of the year, one that I have seen three times and still want to see again, is yet another adaptation of one of the most well trod stories in the English language. Go figure.) For starters, it's way too long. Way, way, way too long and ended about half and hour before it ended. Spielberg, Kushner and Roth went out on what felt like 1001 tangents, striking out with random thoughts and moments that just add to the jumble of thoughts and ideas that lead to my next point.

What the hell was the point of this movie? I suppose at the end, I'm meant to take it for a statement of the impotence of violence, but I found it almost impossible to hold on to that feeling. It was a little 'too little too late'...too weakly expressed at the end of a very, very long, bland and violent (amazing how it can be both) morality tale. Paradise Now did a much better job with this idea, I think.

Yeah, it's Spielberg, so it's well crafted, and there were a few moments that I really enjoyed - during the Beirut mission, the staccato of the rapid gunfire matched with the clanging footsteps running down metal stairs was especially striking. I did hate the sequence with 'threatening to blow up the little girl'...hated with a passion. Cheap, cheap, cheap.

I have a question about the languages used in Munich. Now, I've never really experienced a multi-lingual society, so I don't know in a practical situation how much English would come into play. When dealing with characters of several different nationalities (one of which is a native English speaker), it makes sense to me for the group to be speaking English. But when it comes to scenes of just Israelis, would they be speaking English? Or is the English to make it more understandable to the audience, to not bog down a major expositional scene with subtitles? And if this is the case, how is that any better than Rob Marshall's use of English in Memoirs (which in the end only bugged me because of a). the way it negatively affected the performances and b). the way that they pulled out Japanese whenever they felt like they wanted to be mysterious or exotic)? Just a question.

In short, Boo. I want Raiders Spielberg back.",5
26 January 2006,Munich is an act of courage and conscience,"A mesmerizing presentation of Israel's inquiry to the massacre of its athletes in Munich Olympics 1972. It's a film of uncommon depth and sensitivity without any political bias. The movie starts with the Palestinian terrorist attack on Israel's athletes.If you don't know what the movie is about, you should try to read some background about it before you watch it. Speielberg absolutely takes you in 70s time. Events are unfolded in natural and flawless manner without any manipulation. It surely expresses the dual state of mind of a man who is serving his country carrying out the assassinations ordered by the Prime Minister of Israel herself, in response to the terrorist attack, exhibiting the power and keeping the peace process aside . He surely understands what he is doing is nothing but an act of vengeance and igniting more terrorism than causing peace and resolving problems that should be resolved. Spielberg leaves you deciding it on yourself what the movie wants to tell. All are fighting for their own homes, but at the cost of other's. A must watch portrayal of courage and conscience.

8 January 2006,"Real, open, and thought-provoking","It is a good one, if not one of the best of Spielberg.

It is not like in the popcorn movie like ""The Bourne Supremacy"", all the killings are cool, accurate, morally immaculate, and sort of enjoyable. If you like that kind of movie, this one might be not for you.

I agree with some of comments that the movie is far from enough to depict and explore the relationships among 5-member team. Maybe it is not what the director cares about.

if you are interested in heated topic of middle east crisis, and you are really open to the conflict between Arabs and Jews, you may enjoy the movie; if you are very opinionated on this matter, it is very likely your political judgment bars you from seeing some good points in the movie.

31 March 2008,Not your usual action movie!,"Munich is a movie that exposes the effects of the prevailing principles of ""peace"" on the men at the receiving end. It is an intelligent movie that does not stress and excruciate the viewer despite its long running time.

One thing is for certain-- the cinematography is very intelligent. It seemed as if the camera angles alone would tell a story! The cinematography also gives the movie that sort of suspenseful air that makes the movie rather slow than the usual fast-paced.

Another factor that makes Munich watchable till the end is the story development. The ending was definitely an ending, unfolding a hidden plot that has been running throughout the film. It does not rely on the killing of the targets to keep the story going.

Munich definitely has a plot, and it keeps that plot running until the end. The actors all gave good performances, and the cinematography aids the overall mood the movie wishes to impart to the viewers.

Final say? Definitely not your usual action movie! It's sleek and intelligent, and it definitely has a plot unlike other action movies which depend on the action sequences to keep audience members watching!",8
4 April 2023,Might as well dig two graves,"""He who seeks revenge digs two graves."" Confucius.

In the 2005 film ""Munich,"" director Steven Spielberg tackles a complex and controversial subject with his signature skill and nuance. The film tells the story of the aftermath of the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre, in which Palestinian terrorists kidnapped and killed eleven Israeli athletes. The Israeli government responds with a secret mission to track down and eliminate those responsible for the attack, leading to a cycle of violence and revenge that raises difficult questions about the morality of state-sponsored assassination.

Spielberg's direction is masterful, as he skillfully balances action and suspense with weighty ethical and political issues. The ensemble cast, led by Eric Bana as the Mossad agent Avner, is uniformly excellent, bringing depth and complexity to characters caught up in a dangerous and morally ambiguous situation. The film's production design and cinematography capture the mood and atmosphere of the era, while John Williams' score adds to the tension and emotion of the story.

""Munich"" is a challenging and thought-provoking film that doesn't offer easy answers to the questions it raises. Rather, it asks viewers to consider the human cost of violence and revenge, and the difficult choices that individuals and nations must make in the face of terrorism and political conflict. With its powerful performances and incisive direction, ""Munich"" is a film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.",8

5 March 2006,a good but depressing film,"Munich is a good but depressing film.It lasts for two hours and a half and in the first half the pace is rather slow.It is very difficult to analyze the most-complex conflict of the second half of the 20th century-namely the Israeli-Palestinian one.But this film manages to do it and to do it well.At first,the people who had to take the revenge are somewhat hesitant,they still find it difficult to kill(the first Palestinian),As time progresses however ,they are more and more sucked in the spiral of revenge and violence from which there is no way out.Because it is essentially a matter of survival and the stakes are very high.Avner,the main character gradually turns into a killing machine.But all this comes at a price-and it is huge!!!He becomes paranoid,loses his friends,alienates himself from his family.Yes,this is war-a bloody,merciless war on both sides.And what is worse is that war spreads far and wide turning Europe into a Iraeli-Palestinian battlefield. The scenes of murder are really hard to bear.But they are not there for violence's sake,they make a point.In this way it is justifiable to have such graphic violence shown. There are some shortcomings such as Avnir's dreams of the murder of the athletes mixed with his having sex with his wife-I didn't like this-it was superficial.But some scenes are wonderful-when he hears the voice of his baby-daughter on the phone,when he sadly watches the kitchen through the shop-window:a symbol of home and domesticity which he misses so much.Or when one of his victims,not knowing who he is offers to give him sleeping pills seconds before being blown up. Ultimately the film is very depressing because it becomes painfully clear that no solution will come soon.There were(and are)too much hatred,too much bitterness and violence.",7
8 April 2009,Vicious Circle Of Revenge,"Spielberg's 'Munich' is pretty much on the level of his best works like 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Schindler's List' but unlike those movies, this one is underrated. I didn't know what to expect from this movie but after seeing it, I was very impressed at how Spielberg tackled the issues without taking sides. He presents the facts and the dilemmas that arise with a fine understanding of the complex situations.

'Munich's execution is similar to that of 'Saving Private Ryan'. It's raw, it's graphic, and it's dark. The colours are a little washed out and this makes the images look more gloomy but also real. The minimal yet efficient use of music is a clever choice and the camera-work is superb.

The screenplay is fantastic. I don't mind long movies as long as they don't bore the viewer. The story is well told brilliantly maintaining the suspense and element of drama. The characters are beautifully written and they come off as humans on screen rather than caricatures. With 'Munich' there was not one moment when I felt that it dragged. The pacing was well maintained.

Without casting Hollywood bigwigs, Spielberg opts for an impressive International cast. and I love movies that have actors from different parts of the world. Here you have Australians Eric Bana and Geoffrey Rush (who're cast as Israelis), a British Daniel Craig, a French Matthieu Kassovitz, an Irish Ciarán Hinds, a German Hanns Zischler, an Israeli Ayelet Zurer and a Canadian Marie-Josée Croze. All these actors do nothing short of excellent. The film itself rests on Bana's shoulders and the actor proves that he can carry a complex film.

Overall, 'Munich' is a stupendous political thriller. Spielberg has succeeded again and it is no surprise why he is known as one of the greatest and most versatile filmmakers of today.",
26 December 2005,One of the best films I've ever seen,"I had planned on writing a detailed review of this film after I saw it but I realized that there's nothing you can say about it that would even remotely begin to describe how utterly powerful it is. Even as I sit here writing this, I am still overcome with emotion just thinking about it. There's something uniquely fascinating about watching a work of art being created by someone at the top of their game and Spielberg has created a true masterpiece. I know the film has sparked debate because of current events but I truly believe that this is a film that will be remembered and discussed for many years to come. This movie is about violence and the response to violence and the toll that it takes on everyone. It doesn't matter what religion or nationality you are, this is something that needs to be experienced by everyone. Rarely have I experienced so many different emotions while watching a film. After tying my stomach in knots for almost two hours with some of the most suspenseful and gut-wrenching sequences ever committed to film, I was left overwhelmed and drained at the end with the weight of everything I had just seen. Thank you, Mr. Spielberg, for making a film so brilliant and assured.",10
9 February 2006,Zzzzz... wake me up when it's finished,"This has to be the most boring movie I've ever seen. My wife and I weren't even able to watch it straight thru. We had to split it in two sessions of torture. Gawd... Not much action... to much foreign dialog, some translated, some not. That movie is DARK. I mean, almost 90% of the movie takes place on a cloudy day or at night. It's also too long... They could have made this in 1 hour and I still doubt it would be interesting. The whole structure of the movie should be changed. Some narration would have been a good idea IMHO.

Anyway, that movie should be sold in drugstores, in the sleeping pills isle.

7 July 2006,"Whose boat *is* this, anyway?","This kind of storytelling is what John le Carre is to spy books and why I fell in love with his work. I don't know who came up with the wonderful complexity, excellent storytelling, and suspense: Spielberg, the screen-writers or the writer of the original book; but it is movie-making and probably collaboration at its best. Even if Spielberg 'just' directed, which I can't imagine, he brought the story/script to life, gloriously. While giving much for discussion and thought.

Best line - ""Whose boat is this, anyway?"" (There *is* humor in this movie, black, but humor, nonetheless, which screams Spielberg (I have not seen any special features so this as well as my other comments may be addressed in those.) For the first time, I am happy NOT to see the special features.

And there is one shot, just one, no people, no dialogue, nothing but a shot, but it says a million words and gives another million to think about and I'll let the viewer have the fun of finding it. And then the work of dealing with the emotions and implications of it and what goes on in this world.",10
27 December 2005,Perfection! Spielberg does it again.,"We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.

We subscribe to just about anything about Israel and from Israel and we have received many reviews and mostly UNKIND words about this movie. Now after seeing it, we can't understand what in the world they are talking about. I guess interpretation is the only word that comes to mind. But we were not offended by anything in the film and thought it was magnificent. How anyone on the entire planet could ever think that Steven Spielberg who is the #1 supporter of Israel would ever do something that was unkind to Israel is just not worthy of comment. Steven has spent much of his adult life giving and giving and giving to the people of Israel and the Holocaust survivors. This movie was INSPIRED BY EVENTS it is not a documentary. It is simply spectacular and is a wonderful MOVIE. The entire movie is about a group of secretive Israeli's who seek revenge for this disgusting real life murders. In history, there have never been a single word leaked as to who these people were and what exactly they did.... That is not the entire truth is known or will ever be known. Eric Bana deserves academy award nomination and the entire cast are relative unknowns with the exception of Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush who is always terrific. See you at the Academy Awards master Spielberg.",10
18 November 2019,"Colder & darker than most Spielberg, which is clearly intentional.","Each assassination is a remarkable lesson in tension, but Spielberg is such a master, his ability as a technical filmmaker never undercuts his message: killing, no matter its necessity, is damaging to everyone involved. Every story beat, every character moment, every emotional-pull works together perfectly, leading to that inevitable paranoia-breakdown end. Hard to love a movie this brutally serious, but even harder to deny its fierce perfection.

14 March 2006,what an absolute masterpiece!,"This movie is one of the best action movies of the year high octane,thrilling and very exciting.This movie is definitely not for the weak hearted as it is very intense and violent in scenes.

In September 1972 the world watched on as one by one 11 Israeli athletes were killed by a Palestinian terrorist group called black September during the Munich Olympics.

This movie tells what happened next a group of men are employed by the Mossad a secret Israeli organisation to kill and take revenge on all those who had a hand in planning Munich.Avner(Eric Bana)is appointed as head of the group and not permitted to go home to Israel until his job is done.

Soon things begin to go wrong as the killing gets out of hand and Avner soon realises that he is just as bad as the people he is trying to kill,the people who planned Munich.

This movie has great acting,great directing and a killer soundtrack.This is a great movie and not one to be taken light heartedly.This movie has a greater meaning than revenge it shows us the extreme effects of violence on people and the paranoia and hell they go through to escape it.

But please don't just take my word for it please check it out for yourself!

3 January 2007,Disappointing,"Another disappointing film from Spielberg! In the first place, this doesn't look like a $75 million production. The cast looks authentic, but the actors are not allowed to show what they are capable of.

Compare this film with 'Paradise Now' made by an Israeli Palestinian, and showing the journey of two Palestinian suicide bombers. You can be sure that their budget was minuscule.

It's okay to take a documentary approach; non-judgmental and neutral. However, the filmmaker has to have an incisive POV. What's the point of this endeavor?

Spielberg is trying to say that violence brutalizes the participants, and does not lead to peace. Pretty trite, unless you can deliver the emotional punch of Paradise Now.

The documentary footage and reenactment of the Munich fiasco does have an emotional impact for those who lived through those days. But, what value does this film add for them? What's in it for the rest of us?

How could Spielberg have provided a documentary perspective?

It is rational to deter an enemy by the threat of retaliation. Eleven Palestinian operatives for eleven Israeli victims.

The lamentable point of the Israeli-Palestinian struggle is that retaliation does not work for Israel because of their political objectives.

That is, the expulsion of non-Jews from Israel and the occupation of occupied territories by Jewish settlers. That is why the actions of this group of Israeli operatives were futile.

On a historical note, Israel ceased its operation after the wrong man was killed in Norway. Five Israeli operatives were caught and convicted.

The Palestinians ceased their operations in Europe after they realized that the attacks were a political liability.",
9 May 2006,a poem inspired by the film,"I do not like Munich, I find it quite trite./ Terrorists are innocent, that doesn't seem right. /How can they be the victims when they shot the Jews? /In the name of peace, should killing happen to you?/

In this world of ours, Spielberg thinks we should play nice./ Don't fight for your liberty, the cycle will grow thrice. /Killing makes more killing and this leads to pain and death. /Thanks for the civics lesson, you should save your breath/

Bombers are better dead, they live for paradise./ Why not send them on their way, now wouldn't that be nice./ ""Oh, but that's not PC, you racist anti-Christ.""/ Forget it hippie film maker, you're not paying the price./

Spielberg betrayed us with this apologetic trap./ Munich was a terrible flick, disingenuous crap./ How could he betray freedom, liberty, and Jew? /How could he do it? (And war of the worlds sucked too.)",1
13 December 2018,a well-made film that wears out its welcome,"Historical drama chronicles the 1972 Summer Olympics when a Palestinian terrorist syndicate known as Black September killed eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team. Seeking retribution, dedicated Mossad agent (and equally dedicated family man) Bana is handpicked to lead a shadowy mission to seek out those responsible, but at what cost? Intensely riveting at times, as well as expectedly visceral and shocking, with sturdy direction from Spielberg that captures the essence of an infamous time in history, but the tension slowly dissipates as the story unfolds. Bana effectively conveys his character's growing vulnerability and disillusionment with the task at hand, and the always dependable Rush has a juicy role as his no-nonsense handler. Gripping early on, but a lot of really good elements are undermined by the sheer length of the picture. **½

25 August 2019,One of the better terrorism films to come out of 9/11 America,"The film is a deft blend of thriller, historical drama and an essay on the then-current political fall out of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Using the Munich Olympics killings and Israel response to them Spielberg explores the human cost of cyclical violence and unintentional blowback from assassinations and other possible responses to terrorism. The film manages to fairly, if briefly, represent the Palestinian side of the conflict. The film is better as a pure thriller and there's enough twits and turns to be engaging but its political themes are needed.

Unfortunately the tie-ins to 9/11 are forced. Spielberg and company try way to hard to make the analogy clear to the viewer. The film would be better merely pulling back; they should let the history speak for itself. The final shot is annoying in its obviousness. It is much like the rat in the Departed. We got the point, please don't spell it out for us.

Bana is quite good in this. His performance is a good rock to build the narrative on.",8

6 January 2021,"Great movie, all-star cast, highly entertaining","Some might call it thought provoking; others politically charged. This is a highly entertaining, well directed and produced movie. You are handed an all-star cast, none of which is wasted. Even 'bit parts' are carried out to perfection by some great renown actors. And I do not believe the film asks you to take sides or even that it tries to portray one side or the other as villains. There is more a theme about revenge and what is perceived to be justice in the eyes of some; a theme recurrent throughout all of humanity. It shows a complex web of people and groups with a cocktail of motives; some political, many financial - and few of them 100% trustworthy when lives depend on it. I won't ruin it by harping on about politics, especially since each viewer might glean something different from having watched the movie. This is a well-rounded movie, great script, top acting and the result is worthy of accolades awarded to it. I think you'll find the plot keeps you interested and keeps you guessing enough to keep you on the couch until the end. I gave it a nine because and dropped a point off because it is the ending that left me that one point empty.",9
16 March 2006,typical late Spielberg rubbish,"This constant adoration thrown at Spielberg mystifies me. This is typical of his recent efforts. Long winded, uninvolving, unexciting, bland, overwrought, sentimental etc, I could go on and on-

basically this is another entrant in the proof that this is a man that is slowly and surely ruining his reputation. At least in this one the loathsome kids that he seems to cast in every movie since Jurassic Park are absent.

To be fair however, it is nowhere near as bad as Catch Me If You Can, The Terminal, or War of The Worlds. That is not to say that I would recommend it in any shape or form. It is still crap.

9 May 2006,"When you live by the sword, you'll die by the sword","There's no question that ""Munich"" is sure to spark debate about the ongoing conflicts between Israel and the state of Palestine. The two powers have been going at it for years: when one strikes, the other reprises two-fold, and that's a lot of blood. For the most part, Steven Spielberg's take on the real-life events that unfolded in Munich, Germany in 1972 is a bold and explosive vision.

The events first open as Palestinian militants disguised as tourists storm an apartment building where 11 Israeli athletes participating in the '72 Munich Olympics are staying. The gunmen themselves are eventually killed in a shootout with German authorities but not before they've killed their 11 hostages.

Israel's prime minister makes it a point to not compromise their own deeply-rooted values, but if they don't act they'll appear weak to the rest to the world, so action must be taken. (So perhaps her decisions aren't so much motivated by out-and-out vengeance as they are politics.) She dispatches a team of five men, led by Avner (Eric Bana), to track down and eliminate the 11 men responsible for the massacre (and according to my information, nine of the 11 men were killed).

Based on the book ""Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team"" by George Jonas, Spielberg's ""Munich"" also makes a point to explore the nature of revenge while trying its best to not take sides. We know how Spielberg feels about Israel and his own Jewish heritage, but we also see that the man put his heart into this vision. The violence in ""Munich"" is quite graphic and unsettling but it's still a powerful experience, as we the audience is forced to confront a growing problem within the Middle East.

Though it seems both powers are at a stalemate, one character in ""Munich"" is blunt that the battle could take hundreds of years and many lives, but eventually the ""promised"" Holy Land of Israel will fall to Palestine simply because the Palestinians want it more.

From the way things are looking now, I think he's right.

16 February 2006,Spielberg is still top-dog despite an unsatisfying whole,"First, the good news. Spielberg once again shows that in director terms he's peerless. He exercises a technical prowess that is frankly on another level to other directors.

The scenes involving the set-ups and execution of each assassination (which is essentially all this film is about) cranks up the tension to an unbearable level despite their predictability and even manages to diffuse this with some moments of ultra-black comedy. Editing, photography and sound design are all masterclass level.

However, as Spielberg has undoubtedly improved with age as a director, as a story-teller he again seems to have become a little complacent. This film is little more than a document of what happened following Munich and is as coldly calculated as the protagonists.

The actors do well to capture the feeling of paranoia and lingering doubt in the rightness of their actions, but this would have been much more satisfying had the director fleshed the characters out with back-story.

As for the now infamous sex scene involving Eric Bana's character, Avner, and his wife inter-cut with scenes of the massacre of the hostages and terrorists at the airport, well, all I can assume is that this was in the hands of another director, such is the cack-handedness of it. It is probably one of the most needlessly self-indulgent scenes in recent memory and, being at the end, significantly mars this film.

Having said all this, you still have to marvel at the director's abilities and hope his next offering will be a more satisfying whole.",7
28 September 2021,GOOD POLITICAL THRILLER.,"Whenever Steven Spielberg directs a thriller/war movie, it's usually always good, if not, great, and this in my opinion is no exception. Munich is a very good political thriller that is intense, sometimes unsettling, well-acted, and very well-directed.

27 May 2022,How to prevent that the circle of violence becomes everlasting?,"""Munich"" is a somewhat lesser known Spielberg film. It is about the vengeance mission of the state of Israel after the massacre of Isreali athletes at the Munich Olympic games of 1972.

The film is based on the novel ""Vengeance"" written by George Jonas, but for me the plotline resembled a Frederick Forsythe novel. The question is if liquidating one terrorist after another does not become rather dull in the end. After all in ""And then there were none"" (1945, René Clair) ,after the famous story by Agatha Christie, every perpatrator has its own sin. In ""Munich"" the guilt of all the terrorists is the same.

The answer to the question above is principally yes, although Steven Spielberg is such a talented director that he is able to hide this fact for much of the movie. As an example I can refer to the second liquidation. The target has a cute little daughter and this causes two complications. In the first place how to prevent that by accident the little girl and not the terrorist is liquidated. This complication leads to one of the most tense scenes of the movie. Secondly it makes the secret agents aware of the fact that the persons they are liquidating are not only terrorists but have another side also, for example being a father.

The first two hours of the film may be a lttle too long, but this is largely made up for by a revealing last half hour.

After a few killings paranoia begins to slip in by the secret agents. Are they gonna be a victim of vengeance for their vengeance? They expect that all the traps they have employed so far, will also be used agianst them.

There is also an ethical question to be answered. Why did Adolf Eichmann got a trial and this terrorists not? At the beginning of the film prime minister Golda Meir says that ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."", but aren't you sacrificing the same principles you try te defend in this way?

On top of that there is the more practical question if you aren't fighting the dragon with ten heads as every liquidated terrorist is replaced by one that is even more ruthless. This way the circle of violence becomes never ending.

The film is situated in the 70's, a decade full of terrorist movements. For the terrorist attack on the Olympic games in Munich the ""Black september movement"" was responsible. In the same decade also the Baader Meinhof group (""Der Baader Meinhof komplex"", 2008, Uli Edel) and the Red Brigades (""La meglio gioventu"", 2003, Marco Tullop Gioradana) were active in respectively Gemany and Italy.

Remarkable for me was the fact that the secret agents as I called them were less professional and more emotional than I had expected. The joint meals nearly had a family atmosphere, that we also know from films like ""The Godfather"" (1972 - 1990, Francis Ford Coppola).",7

12 February 2006,"Gripping, shocking, unflinching, pessimistic, unforgettable","For the past few years (since the Kubrick-inspired A.I., to be more precise), Steven Spielberg's production has started to show a more pessimistic reflection on what is going on in the world. Still, these films had some sort of happy ending. Munich doesn't. It's Spielberg's most violent and shocking opus so far, a voyage into the bleakest parts of the human soul.

The movie begins with the kidnapping and assassination of 11 Israeli athletes in Munich, 1972. The entire world watches this event in horror on TV, while Israeli PM Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) makes a very controversial decision: those responsible for the massacre will not get away with it. And this is when the film really kicks off: Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana) and four other Mossad agents (Mathieu Kassovitz, Daniel Craig, Ciaràn Hinds and Hanns Zischler) are sent to Europe to track down and coldly execute 11 men, all involved in the Munich attack. Those five agents are initially eager to serve their country, only to become exactly like the very people they're meant to kill: each murder is expertly planned and committed, without any remorse. Avner and his men won't realize the truth (violence leads only to more violence) until it's too late.

That's the aspect Spielberg's most interested in: under the disguise of a gripping, merciless thriller (which the film is) lies a painful reflection on how monstrous a person can be. When we first see Avner, he's an ordinary man who's about to be a father (one of the director's trademarks), as well as an enthusiastic patriot. Two hours into the movie, he's a paranoid murderer, afraid of the fact that someone, perhaps even his boss (the remarkable Geoffrey Rush), might try to hurt his family. He accepted his assignment without any questions, only to be left alone with his doubts: what if his actions won't change anything? What if the war will go on once he's done his job? Spielberg stated this film is a ""prayer for peace"", and he's right, by proving violence isn't the best means to obtain it.

Most people will say Munich is the most unusual Spielberg movie in that it has no happy ending. That's not really correct. The truth is it has no real ending at all. It's probably the most shocking aspect of this masterpiece: after two-and-a-half emotionally exhausting hours of pain, anger and death, there's no sign of joy or reconciliation. The 9/11 parallels, hinted at in previous pictures, emerge in an all their brutality come the desperate epilogue: some wars can't end, not even on film.",10
3 January 2006,"Spielberg's darkest chapter to date, Bana and Rush give performances of there career's, one of the years most horrifically intriguing and compelling films","**** Eric Bana, Daniel Craig, Geoffrey Rush, Ciaran Hinds, Mathieu Kassovitz, Hanns Zischler, Ayelet Zorer. Directed by Steven Spielberg World renowned director Steven Spielberg's newest and darkest film ""Munich"" has Oscar caliber written all over it. Based on the true events in 1972 when Palestinian terrorists kill Israeli athletes and hired Mossad agent along with a crack team of specialists go after them leading up to a horrific aftermath. Bana and Rush give some of there best career performances thus far, a compelling look at near minded destruction and a few state of the art explosions along with it. Spielberg has out done himself with one of the years best and one of the greatest films in general, a definite multi nominee for a few academy awards. My final rating 10/10.

31 December 2005,Most Depressing Film of the Year,"""Munich is a really well made film with an admirable message that both the terrorists and assassins are not so different from one another. It is also the most depressing film I've seen in several years.

The film starts with the kidnapping and killing of the Israeli athletes, then it gets bleaker as the film progresses. At 2 hours and 44 minutes, it is pretty unpleasant to sit through and left me in a pretty grim mood for the rest of the day.

The production quality and acting is excellent throughout.

""Munich"" is a good film with a good message, but not everyone should see it. This is the most depressing film I've seen since ""The Pianist,"" but I thought ""The Pianist"" was a better film.

""Munich"" is not for the faint of heart.",7
14 October 2006,Offensive at Best,"I have, for a long time, followed the incident that occurred at the Munich Olympics, so you can imagine how excited I was when I heard this film would be made. By all accounts, it should have been great: good actors, a compelling story and gut-wrenching footage of the actual event. But when the story got handed over to Eric Roth and Steven Spielberg, any chance the film had to succeed was snatched away. Spielberg should stick to ""B"" movies, instead of trying ineffectually to deal with delicate matters. The script is shallow and ridiculous, polished over with a thin veneer of trying to display both sides, when it really has a single and distinct point of view. It is even worse, though, by trying to deny this. While there are some scenes that are cinematographically beautiful, most are boring or stacked with hilariously obvious ""subtle meaning."" The film goes on too long, drags, and is overly episodic. The actors are given nothing to work with (only Jeffrey Rush shines in short scenes) and the film is so blunt and heavy handed you can almost feel them squirming through the scenes (especially in one scene between Bana and his wife near the end). One of the worst films I can think of: muck masquerading as a masterpiece (far worse than the admitted muck of even Uwe Boll). If you want to know a truly terrible film, this is worth a watch. Otherwise, I would avoid this offensive mess all together.",1
24 December 2005,Munich gets you where it hurts.,"Munich is one mess of a movie. Not because it is a bad movie. Matter of fact, it is an excellent movie. A movie that assumes you know the reality because it doesn't tell you where the reality ends and where the non-reality begins. In this case, you should know that Black September really happened, but it's the cause and affect that is being dealt to the public. It's the cause and affect this movie is really about. Whether the after-effect really happened, it doesn't matter. A mess was made and someone needs to clean it up. How do we fight fire? - with fire of course. How do you clean up a mess? - make a bigger mess.

That reminds me, this is a Spielberg movie that is nothing like the War of the Worlds he released earlier this year, but had the name not been used already, they could have called this one War of the Worlds, too. All the worlds - personal, political, familial, sociological, and any other you can think of - go off course and face possible annihilation. Gravity sucks you in and you can't escape. Maybe it was the black hole. No matter, you will become as engrossed in this movie. If you can forget about what you know politically or religiously, you will be ahead of the game. Forget about who is out to get who; watch what happens to those who let themselves get wrapped up in someone else's war.

Eric Bana's Avner becomes so wrapped up in death, life seems impossible to accept and yet becomes so dear. Daniel Craig will impress you as well. I think I see now why he was selected to be the new Bond. Cirian Hinds does a great job, also.

Why see this movie if you know about the true story? The story, the mystery and intrigue, Spielberg's best movie so far, great acting, self-realization...you name it. Just don't miss it.

I give it a 9/10 thanks to all the above reasons.",9
15 November 2019,Story that needed to be told,"I have seen him doing better and worse movies so this one is in the middle for me. I don't really love that much his new stuff but this one is well crafted and told. Eric Bana is great.

10 February 2006,Brave and important but flawed,"Wonderkid turned Hollywood legend director Steven Spielberg makes three types of film: family entertainment (""ET"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""Indiana Jones""), action adventures (""Jaws"", ""Minority Report"", ""War Of The Worlds"") and serious political works (""The Color Purple"", ""Amistad"", ""Schindler's List""). ""Munich"" is firmly in the last category and, in the sense that it picks up on his Jewishness, the book end to ""Schindler's List"". There is so much to commend this stunning work, but equally so much to cause reservations.

An examination of the Israeli secret service response to the 1972 massacre of 11 Jewish athletes at Munich, this is one of the best political thrillers in a long time, imbued with sustained tension, with some powerful action sequences, and literally exploding with mayhem and murder. The acting is of a high quality with five key roles: Eric Bana as Avner, Mossad agent and leader of the assassination team, Ciaran Hinds as the pipe-smoking planner, Mathieu Kossovitz as the Belgian explosives expert, Hanns Zischler as the German master forger, and Daniel Craig as the South African getaway driver. Each time, they - and we - doubt the reason for all this killing, Spielberg flashes back to that terrible time in Munich.

Above all, this is an honourable and worthy film that poses huge and topical questions about what leads terrorists to take innocent lives and what measures a democratic state can take to combat such terrorism before it betrays the essential values of that society and in the process corrupts those carrying out such revenge. If there was any doubt as to the contemporary force of these issues, we are reminded of them in the closing seconds as we see New York's World Trade Center standing in the background.

The major concern with Spielberg's narrative is the extent to which he has taken artistic licence with the known facts. Although the work is only said to be ""inspired by true events"", the constant reference to the memory of the reality of Munich and other touches such as the portrayal of Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir give the impression that this is almost a drama-documentary.

Every action in the film is carried out by one group, but in fact Mosaad deployed several. The operation is represented as funded by, but otherwise out of the control of, Mossad, whereas the secret service was totally in charge. Although some things go wrong in the film's account, essentially the killings are cleverly executed and the murder of an innocent Arab in Lillehammer in Norway is never mentioned. Information on the location of the intended targets is shown as coming from an odd French family of anarchists - this is taken from the 1984 book ""Vengeance"" by George Jonas - but there is simply no evidence that such an unlikely faction exists.

Above all, Avner and his team are shown as increasingly troubled by their actions. However, we know from a new Atlantic Productions television documentary featuring interviews with Mossad agents directly involved in ""Operation Wrath of God"" that they had no doubts and exhibited no hesitation. Perhaps Spielberg is entitled to refashion the operation somewhat in order that he can raise questions and challenge us to think through the moral issues involved, but some of this is just too contrived, such as when the Jewish team find themselves sharing an Athens safe house with Arab terrorists. Also the incident with a freelance Dutch female assassin seems included simply to provide some colour and sex.

Spielberg has had critics from all quarters. From the Jewish side, he has been branded as guilty of ""an incorrect moral equation"" and ""the sin of equivalence"" because he has characters articulating the Palestinian cause. From the Arab cause, a former member of Black September has accused him of focusing on ""the Zionist side alone"". Even George Jonas has charged him with ""humanising demons"". However, the families of the athletes slain at Munich have publicly praised the work. When all is said, ""Munich"" is an important and brave work that really should be seen and thought about. It may be 164 minutes, but there is never a moment of boredom and rarely has a film raises such sharp moral issues in such a considered manner.",
4 March 2006,shame on you Spielberg,"horrid ending. worst sex scene ever. wife was not a real person, as she was perpetually supportive and accepting of her husband and showed not even stress from her predicament. acting, however, in the film was good. direction was offensive. lazy and overplayed parallel editing, over the top iconography. Spielberg knows how to make movies, he should not insult his audience with such self indulgent identity exploration. it is indeed a very messy thing, terrorism. i don't think the film commented beyond the overt and obvious on its subject matter: what happens when the line is blurred between duty and acts of terror/violence, what does it mean to be a Jew, what does it mean to have a HOME, what is the cost of that HOME, etc.. there was some success in displaying the tasks of the protagonists as stressful and disorganized.i wish Spielberg had adhered to that same visceral approach when he addressed the arc of the story, the structure, and the stylistic application thereof. he pulled an AI, and slapped a schlocky Hollywood infrastructure. gag me.

29 March 2006,He who takes the sword...,"...shall perish with the sword. That's what my grandmother already used to say. The problem are the so-called collateral damages (killing innocent people, etc). It looks like this movie has roused great hostility in Israel you can never tell why since it's not for or against Israel nor for or against Palestinians. It doesn't take sides in that conflict. It only shows a bunch of murderers on both sides but we all know already that terrorists and secret agents are flour of the same bag either they belong to CIA, KGB, Mossad, ETA, IRA, Hamas or the likes of them all, all of them beneficent organizations that only want our well-being and plead the best causes in this world. With a slight inconvenience: to achieve their purposes they don't show the least respect for human rights a despicable thing of course. Consequently my comment will stick exclusively to the movie as such without making any reference to the fact that we are in the presence of Israelis and Arabs since its action could occur with any other groups with the same type of conflict. What this movie proves thoroughly is what anyone of sense already knew i. e. that these selective murders of hostages, terrorists, or secret agents not only don't solve any problem but aggravate them all by creating a spiral of violence in which one killing by one side leads to ten killings by the other and so on. The structural problems behind the conflict remain unsolved. And besides that it achieves nothing on practical terms since the murdered terrorist's and secret agents' bosses are immediately replaced by even worse ones. Furthermore we have here a technically well made movie like it is Spielberg's point of honour (by the way isn't he also a Jew?) and a well told story that may not be true in every detail but is certainly true in general terms according to what I said above. Another important feature of the movie is that terrorists and secret agents are shown not as the usual inhuman robots but as human beings with their joys and sorrows, their families and beloved ones, their weaknesses and incompetences, their doubts and uncertainties and even now and then some stings of conscience when they reflect upon what they are doing. The story has nevertheless a few gaps. Besides the apparently facility with which the location of the terrorists to kill is done as well as with which most killings are prepared and done, we never know what kind of organization was the one who informed the killers of the whereabouts of the men to be killed and what was its ideological affiliation as it seems very doubtful that they did it only for money since according to the words of one of its members and of its chief (a curious personality) they never worked for or against any government. Anarchists? We'll never know. And what kind of efficient network they had which allowed them to locate everybody so quickly? But in conclusion this is a movie made with much solidity upon a very momentous and important theme.",7
20 May 2018,"Intense, Realistic Assasin Film","I was not expecting this kind of film for something based on historical events. It's a great assasin first with a straight forward direction that is easily followed. It also shows the tremendous toll this line of work puts on the human psyche with Eric Bana bringing in the best performance I've ever seen him portray on screen.

Yet again Spielberg proves he's the master of suspense. Experiencing not only the intense moments as the play out on the edge of your seat, but feeling the same paranoia Bana experiences. For such a long film, I didn't look at the time once as it drew me in with ever bit of action and every line of dialogue! One of Spielberg's best!

10 July 2014,"Too Long, Too Moralistic, Too Violent","Steven Spielberg is a great filmmaker, he knows how to strike all the right notes and how to make deep, decent, sentimental albeit deeply moving powerful roller-coaster of an epic movie. Here, he aimed well, but missed several times. The very topic of Munich terrorist attacks is a huge theme which can be made into a riveting steamroller of action and suspense. But then, almost 3 hours, slow move, too much moralistic stuff, totally unnecessary sex scenes, brutal violence and too much blood make this seemingly good film a wreck. Eric Bana and Daniel Craig are both good, but not so very well to persuade us. The whole film slides along very slowly and it adds to the creepy dark air. The movie started very well, but then it all gets very dull and slower, then simply unbearably slow and yet violent. Not the best in SS's canon, not the best surely

28 March 2018,"Great film, hard questions with harder answers.","Really enjoyed this, one of those films that can have you arguing with yourself if two wrongs make a right. Can a nation, if it's politicians decide, rightfully take revenge whilst it's own citizens would face severe consequences if they did the same. The film handles this well, at the start you understand this desire for retribution. Then it throws up, we only did that because of this you did to us. If you've an open mind it leaves you even more confused as to who is right and who is wrong in this sorry state of affairs.

9 February 2006,The story of Israeli's reaction to Palestinian 's attack in Munich again Jewish's athletes during Olympic games in 1972.,"After the murder of eleven Jewish's athletes during 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Israeli government decides to build a secret vengeance against the murderers. For that, a secret commando composed of five men was placed under the order of a young leader, Aver. Their mission was to search and kill each member of the Palestinian commando who has participate to hostage seizure, wherever they were in the world. During several years, the Jewish commando kills nine among Palestinian terrorists. But several members of Israeli's commando will be killed. It is a magnificent movie full of humanity. Steven Spielberg shows the diverse reactions of the commando members, especially Avner's one and insists on the vanity of violence to solve conflicts between human communities.

12 February 2006,Tragedy followed by another tragedy,"What happened in Munich 1972 was extreme. But much more extreme is what happened afterwards, according to this movie. That is the retaliation by the Israelis, totally ignoring the laws of other countries and those of their own. Death squadrons were sent out to murder the ones Israel, without any trials or proper police investigations, found guilty.

True story or not, there is a moral discussion here about these things, but that doesn't seem to be most important issue. This is an action movie, not very exciting, and the Palestines are mostly shown as uncomplicated fanatics, although not all the time. The focus is on the Israeli agents, but it doesn't go deeply.

If you want to be entertained for almost three hours (although it's one hour too much), see this. But don't expect any really interesting questions or answers.

12 February 2006,Long movie,"This movie was pretty long but good. I was not aware the the amazing Eric Bana played the main character. He was very good and has once again proved himself to be the poor man's Tom Cruise. The violence in this movie was very real and the plot was very hard to understand. I didn't love this movie and it is the least good out of all the Oscar nominees. I ate a veggie burger after seeing this movie by the way and was reminded about how ironic it was that we were watching the Winter Olympics on the TV and how there could be another attack. You never know though. The amazing Palestinian's are very bizarre in this movie and the female from Holland was a bizarre sub plot that went nowhere. Those bizarre guns were very interesting....that looked like air pumps!!

12 October 2018,The hunters become the hunted,"This is a thought-provoking movie, to say the least. At first you get the impression that it will be a straight-forward account of revenge and retribution, the killing or assassination of the individuals responsible for planning the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. However, it quickly becomes apparent that the story is much more complicated than that. The Israeli assassination squad, although supposedly professionals in their field, do not carry out their tasks with the cold blooded efficiency one normally sees in a James Bond or Arnold Schwartzenegger movie. They fumble with their weapons, hesitate to pull the trigger, set unrealistic parameters regarding ""collateral damage"" and then are overcome with guilt when any ""non-target"" is killed. Finally, the hunters become the hunted, realizing that the underworld of paid informants can also be turning over information about them to their enemies. Paranoia (displayed primarily by Avner, the team leader) that is created by ""being hunted"" is combined with the realization that the ""targets"" of their mission may not have all be directly connected to the Munich massacre and the total purpose of their mission may never be explained to them. Added to this are the ""unintended consequences"" of their actions, as they realize that each individual they eliminate is often replaced by one or more successors who are even more dedicated to the goal of destroying Israel. And, as Avner's conversation with the Palestinian Ali shows, each side in the conflict can demonstrate a moral purpose to their cause, justifying whatever actions they may take, no matter how those actions violate the morality of their society. What began as a tale of black-and-white issues becomes, in the end, a morass of decisions, actions, consequences, and, sadly, a failure to reach any conclusion or closure to the anger and suffering caused by the initial act of terrorism.",9

20 September 2022,Waste of 3 hours,"Seriously, don't waste 2 hours 44 minutes of your life watching this crap.

OK, I'm not a Spielberg fan, but even he could surely do better than this.

Ostensibly about ""Munich"", I suggest reading the wrapper before watching the film, as it's really about an Israeli hit squad which was sent after the men who planned the Munich attack, which itself forms a minimal part of the film's content. This didn't trouble me, in fact it sounded like a great hook for a movie, but the actual film falls over in several important ways.

The most important of these is that the film just can't decide what it's about. Is it a thriller? Is it an attempt to paint a human face on a squad of Mossad assassins (I mean, really?) Is it an exposé of Mossad incompetence? Is it somehow about cooking? Or did Spielberg just get some funding and didn't know what to spend it on? There are serious failures of cohesive story-telling here.

The (slightly too literal) ""climax"" of the film finally betrays its intent - that violence begets violence, and hatred begets hatred, and that those involved pay a price for their involvement. But then why pad it out with all the other incoherent rubbish? There are long sections of the movie where I just couldn't figure out what was going on.

I can't just walk away from the portrayal of Mossad - are they really just a bunch of amateurs? Because that's not their rep. The team of assassins here seem to have been assembled from an entirely random group of untrained and inept people - a bomb expert who's never set a bomb before; a guy who is warned to steer clear of the ""honey trap"" yet walks right in. Doubtful plans which seem fraught with entirely avoidable risk. Does the national intelligence agency of Israel really rely on shady, double-dealing French freelancers to track down their targets? I have my doubts.

And those camera angles. I mean, why? If they added something artistically, it was lost on me. It just looked like someone left the tripod at home and they had to use a bar stool instead.

Not a film I will hurry to watch again, nor one I will be recommending to others.",3
29 April 2007,"A movie with the right amount of tension and excitement, one of Spielberg's best","I had seen this movie before like over a year ago and now I watched it again last night. I like to think this is one of Spielberg's best works yet to date. Well it can be a bit dull at places, but it's still a great movie.

There's this certain tension throughout the movie, it's exciting and interesting. The whole story is very well put together and it has great characters. What comes to the role performances I think it's Eric Bana's best role performance yet to date. He also fits in the role like a blanket on a bed, he's pretty perfect in it. In my opinion the whole casting is succeeded very well. Other Mossad group members are played by Daniel Craig, Ciarán Hinds, Mathieu Kassovitz and Hanns Zischler and they seem to be just the right actors for the right parts. We also see Geoffrey Rush in the role of Ephraim, which is pretty nice after constantly remembering him as Barbossa from some kind of a reason.

The plot has enough twists and tweaks in it and though it's not of course so exciting as for the first time, I still enjoyed it very much. It's very believable, realistic. It's also intelligent with its twists and as we go towards the ending, it still has this certain energy, tension and surprises to keep you interested all the time. The screenplay's very good, but it's still nothing phenomenal, because of its (sad to say) dullness in places. Could be because I had seen the movie before, but I still would have liked some fillings here and there. Is it even necessary to talk about the directing? Well, it's Steven Spielberg and once again I think the directing is fantastic. Some of the parts are just so exciting you stand up and watch the whole scene without even blinking an eye. Just superb.

The movie was nominated for 5 Oscars: For ""Best Achievement in Directing"", ""Best Achievement in Editing"", ""Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures (Original Score)"", ""Best Motion Picture of the Year"" and ""Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay"" and it still makes me sad that it didn't win any of the categories. It sure would have deserved at least one Oscar, as if you look at the movie in its wholeness, the pieces are put together very well and the movie doesn't struggle in any way imaginable. The music is composed by the all mighty John Williams and you can't go wrong there now can you? The music's still not in so big role after all, but it's still in the right places and it's great. There's no actual main theme or beauty worth mentioning in the music, it just fits in the movie in its own way so well that it just makes your heart beat faster. Especially in the so called ""action"" -parts there's this same music always playing, building up the tension when the other sound is cleverly put in the background. Even when the music's so simple in those parts, it's still so great.

This is definitely a movie worth seeing. I agree that I should have reviewed this back then when I watched it for the first time, but later's better than never, right? Anyways, if you want to enjoy a good Drama/Thriller, then this's the movie you want to watch. It is very successful when it comes to those genres, both Drama and Thriller. There's some action in it too, but it still doesn't make it an action movie, or at least in my opinion it doesn't. It's just a great movie.",8
13 February 2006,Worst Spielberg ever.,"Usually excellent director Stephen Spielberg (q.v. Saving Private Ryan) seems to have lost it with this confused and confusing mess. As a thriller there's no thrill: No surprises, no twists, no suspense, no interest, and no coherent point of view. By trying (unsuccessfully) to pander to Arab hatred and bigotry simultaneously with sticking (barely) to the basic outline of what should be a strongly pro-Israel story, Spielberg has produced morally equivocal pablum of no interest to anyone. This lousy film should act as a warning to all artists in whatever medium against lying in order to curry favor with tyrants or hate mongers, be they Nazis, Communists, Islamofascists, or any other brand of villain.

8 March 2006,"Unfortunately ""Courageous"" Doesn't Equate ""Good Movie""","After the Oscar-awarded but factually flawed ""One Day In September"" I was really curious how Spielberg would treat the subject. And judging by the media hooplah, Spielberg had apparently gone off his rocker and turned out a shlocker that advocated the complete annihilation of Israel, or something to that effect. As it turned out, ""Munich"" falls short of both counts -- it's mostly an action movie with little regard for historical accuracy that seeks to propagate an agenda that I would term ""slightly mellowed Zionism"". I would have thought that Spielberg's position is in accordance with what seems to be official doctrine, that the existence of Israel is non-negotiable and that Israel has the right to defend herself, but that she is not simply awarded carte blanche for doing so. Strangely, judging by the uproar surrounding this movie, I seem to have been out of synch with reality in that at least a large part of media commentators seems to assume that Israelis are beyond the pale of moral considerations and somehow invested with unalienable right to act with complete impunity.

But back to the movie. It's actually quite convincing as a sort of alternative James Bond movie, one in which the hero is married with children and has moral qualms, but as such it almost mandatorily falls short of its claim as a polical movie or as a truthful -- if not factually accurate -- portrayal of a historical event. Maybe you can't have both, or at least Spielberg, in this case, couldn't. The film eventually hits rock-bottom in an unforgivable scene in which Avner and his wife play a round of ""hide the kreplach"" interspersed by stroboscopic takes from the final shootout of the Munich hijack.",
7 February 2006,"How precious is ""home""?","""Home is everything"" In the midst of this tense, violent tale of retribution for the assassination of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany, is this fundamental yet poignant reminder of why there is so much unrest in Israel. Both Palestinians fight for their homeland and that supersedes all other calls for peace. Spielberg creates a film that resonates with his own Jewishness and yet is placed smack dab in the middle of the issue to the dismay of both Israelis and Palestinians. Eric Bana does a convincing job showing us the conflict between his desire to do right by his country and his need to provide for his growing family. His cohort of fellow assassins are a motley group of men who, in their quirky way, endear us to them and their cause. The movie the tense moments surrounding the 1972 Munich Olympics as the scene is juxtaposed between the actual telecasts and the movie. We then are taken to the board room where Israeli Prime Minister, Gold Meir assesses the situation and decides to send Avner (Bana) to head a team of killers to pay back Israel's woe. In her own words, ""Forget peace for now. We have to show them we're strong."" Throughout the tension of each of the killings-some comic and some close calls- the viewer is prodded to ask ""Is this really the best way to punish wrongdoing?"" ""Is this the most effective and acceptable method of responding?"" Even though the film is grounded in Spielberg's own Jewish proclivities, you cannot help but have some semblance of sympathy for the Palestinian cause when you hear the Palestinian freedom fighter declare, ""Home is everything"". As one who has visited Israel and who has grieved with the rest of the world at the horrors of the Holocaust, it is easy to understand the Jews longing for a homeland and how Israel is the best fit. However, you can also understand the plight of the Palestinians who have been forced to be refugees and who also lay claim to Israel. Perhaps it is for this reason that ""Munich"" ends in an open-ended way, leaving the viewer to make up his own mind and making a bit clearer the consequences of both positions.",9

5 June 2006,Spielberg May Be Slipping...,"Most people over the age of 40 remember the terrible events surrounding the killing of the 1972 eleven-member Israeli Olympic team by a group of Palestinian extremists. Their abduction from Munich and ultimate death pulled a shroud over the games. Because of this horrific event, security at subsequent Olympic games has been ratcheted up significantly. But that's not why we're here discussing Steven Spielberg's film. We're here to see why I didn't give it a resounding ""Thumbs Up"".

Historically MUNICH is interesting. Not only does it show the horrors mankind can inflict upon one another, but it also shows the repercussions of reacting in an equal measure of violence to such an event. When Israel decides to form a death squad and send them out to eliminate the terrorists who dealt the deadly blows to the Israeli Olympians, a message we've heard a million times comes a-smackin' us in the face: evil begets evil.

The acting is fairly blasé with the exception of the main character, Avner (Eric Bana TROY.) In fact, I can't recall a single other memorable person in the film. I remember that there's a bomb-maker, a clean-up man, and a couple of shooters, but that's all I remember of them.

The length of the film is extreme. At 2 hours and 44 minutes, nodding off was almost inevitable. Mr. Spielberg is, perhaps, spoiled in that he can do whatever he wants in Hollywood and for as long as he wants (the remake of WAR OF THE WORLDS being a prime example.) I don't mean to belittle the atrocious circumstances surrounding this true story, nor do I mean to invalidate the message Steven Spielberg so desperately wants to get across to us. It's a vital and unfortunate part of human history. But I felt the story lagged and was forced upon the viewer rather than coming across in a fluid manner.

Although I watched and enjoyed the Oscars this year, MUNICH stood out as the ""stinker"" in the Best Film category. I would've much preferred to see HUSTLE AND FLOW in the mix instead of this flick.",3
9 March 2006,smooth and wonderfully done film. A real masterpiece!,"I live in Serbia and unfortunately I got to know the full meaning of hatred and revenge. Once you enter the circle, you are lost and statements like ""They were the first to do it"" begin a never ending horror. Thats the first reason why I liked the film, the second, Mr Spielberg didn't take sides. He was above all and that's why he is not going to be much liked. A lot of them will not understand him. Once again he showed us that he is one of the greatest directors in the world. Such a smooth and wonderfully done film. Great to do it after The War of the Worlds and to remind us what a great master he is. No wonder he was not praised in Hollywood as he should be, if he had got an Oscar, maybe Jewish or Palestinian people wouldn't have been very happy. Unfortunately, everything is politics, in the end. Another film, that was maybe one of the best films ever made in Hollywood, The Brokeback Mountain, didn't get the Oscar for the best film! Are you surprised?

20 June 2007,"Polished and nuanced film, which poses tough questions.","Political extremists don't like this film because, well, this film attempts to provide a nuanced view on terrorism, and violence. This is a film that is about characters and their psychological makeup, and how they respond to the missions they are asked to accomplish and what happens to them as they move closer towards their goal. The acting is superb, the characters are real, the dialogue is sharp and intelligent, and visually the film is stunning to look at (I watched it in high def, wow).

The attention to detail with 70's era cars, clothes and hairstyles was also excellent.

This movie is about assassinations, and it does get bloody (graphically bloody), so it isn't for the squeamish, but its a thoroughly enjoyable movie, even if it is a bit long at 2:40, nothing in the film seems rushed or thrown in. I'd give it an 8.5 out of 10, and its definitely something i'd like to have in my collection.

The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

""When does it ever end?"" Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",5
3 January 2006,Emperor Spielberg is NAKED,"""Munich"" is overrated by most reviewers. I am here to report that emperor Spielberg is naked! The script is bad almost throughout the movie. The directing is sloppy almost throughout the movie. The first part of the movie looks like a low budget movie. Several scenes don't make any sense (the meeting of Israelis and Palestinians in the same room; the final sex scene of the main character with his wife). The scenes that did get more attention are the violent scenes. I find a contradiction between the main message of the movie that violence does not pay and between the extra care in directing the violent scenes because... violence does pay.

8 January 2006,Munich,"Munich is based on the book Vengeance by George Jonas. The film and book are inspired by the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany where a Palestinian group came and killed and held hostage some of the Israeli Olympic team. After this occurred a group of men including an intelligence officer are sent all over Europe to kill different men who were behind the killings that went down during the 1972 Olympics. After committing these murders the intelligence officer named Avner , has to battle some demons of his own. Munich has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, great performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. When I first went into this film it took me a little while to get into it and understand what was going on, but from there I started to love the film more and more as it went along. It is very well made and has great acting and also is really an involving film. This film captured my interest and it would not let go. I was compelled through the whole movie seeing what these men did and I found the last bit of the movie where Avner has to deal with his own demons and thoughts of what he did to be very well acted and a good character study. The film also has some thought provoking moments and lets the viewers make up their own opinion of what happened after the Olympic tragedy. Munich is a powerful film that has quite a punch and it entertained me and kept my interest the entire time. The film is directed by Steven Spielberg and I would say that this ranks up there as one of his best films ever. This film deserves many Oscar nominations for the things I mentioned above and I hope that people see this movie and that it is awarded come awards time. This is one of the best films I have seen of 2005 and probably one of the best films I have seen it quite awhile. A truly powerful and moving experience and one of the best movie going experiences I have had in awhile. Munich is a true masterpiece.",10
11 January 2006,Repetitious Gore Fest Not As Deep As They Say,"""Munich"" is a tedious gore-fest that is nowhere near as deep and complex as director Steven Spielberg and script writer Tony Kushner think it is.

If you want to watch a beautiful, young, naked woman bleed to death on screen in real time, ""Munich"" is the film for you.

If you want complex discussion of issues surrounding terrorism, there are better outlets for you.

Much has been written lately about how films and television are suffering because audiences have new media from which to get their entertainment and their information.

Such is the case with ""Munich.""

After 9-11, millions of citizens around the world began seeking out, and creating, media devoted to discussing terrorism. Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushner seem completely unaware of these media and the debates going on therein.

Just one question unaddressed by ""Munich,"" but very hotly debated by the vox populi: Is there something inherent in Islam that makes terrorism inevitable among Muslim populations?

You may answer ""Yes,"" or ""No,"" but however you answer, you have to acknowledge that it is a hot question, one ""Munich,"" if it really wanted to be an intelligent film, had to address, and did not.

While failing to fully intellectually engage the questions they adopt, do Kushner and Spielberg bring home the simple human pathos of terrorism?

Not for this viewer. The plot is simple, and tedious: an assassin hunts down and kills a series of men whose name appear on a list he's been given.

The aesthetic is the aesthetic of the most exploitative slasher flick. There are buckets 'o blood on screen, and dismembered body parts.

The depiction of this slaughter glamorizes the job title, ""International Assassin."" The crew of assassins is attractive. You'd want these men to date your daughter. The crew includes the eye candy of frequently shirtless Eric Bana, and Daniel Craig, whose tight behind and turquoise eyes are often shot in shameless exploitation.

The assassins are shown bonding, behaving powerfully and ethically, while having fantastic and exciting adventures, and eating really good meals. Just as after ""Saving Private Ryan"" young male viewers wanted to be soldiers, after ""Munich"" young male viewers will want to be assassins. So much for Munich's ""ethical"" ""exploration"" of ""issues.""

The plot is tedious. That's one guy killed; now on to the next guy. And the next guy. And the next guy. Yawn. Look at watch. Eye theater's ""exit"" sign. Think about walking out.

Does the tedious plot, the lame ""discussion,"" the vivid gore bring home the tragic cost of terrorism and revenge in a way that other media, covering the same question, do not?

I remember Munich.

I didn't watch TV coverage; I followed it on the radio. I can remember exactly where I was when the news was broadcast that the athletes had been murdered.

I was aghast. Paralyzed with grief and fear. I could do nothing for hours afterward but somberly ponder the consequences of this horrible act, and its inevitable consequences.

Another example: After 9-11, the New York Times published ""Portraits of Grief,"" a series of one paragraph biographies of the victims of 9- 11. Like millions of other readers, I found reading these brief, simple bios unendurably moving. Reading a one paragraph biography of a victim of terror moved me much more than all the whoop-de-doo fake blood splashed on the screen, and shallow hand wringing, in ""Munich.""",7
27 April 2010,Minor Spielberg: heavy sentimentalism doesn't blend well with dark real life background,"It's a long time since Spielberg has lost his primal directing skills. Not that he has become a bad director, but it seems to me that all his movies since E.T. are plagued with heavy sentimentalism. The wünder kid of the 70s benefits from almost unlimited backup and this makes all his subsequent films big clean streamlined products, and no longer lovely chiseled flicks for a wide audience. Actually I do think all that makes highbrow critics describe Spielberg as an auteur is the exact bs he revels in and develops to the point of heavy sentimentalism.

In Munich, there is the protracted hero, a good and sentimental Israeli patriot. Because with Spielberg private life or patriotic duty are loaded with the same sore sentimentalism. It's not something than tells the viewer about the hero, it's just stock Spielberg sentimentalism, meant to give the audience its fair share of base emotions. Spielberg nonetheless tries to avoid depicting Isrealis as the absolute good guys and Palestinians as the Arch Evilmen. But he is so at a loss for a firm viewpoint... All he is able to give us is this dumb ""nothing's pitch black, nothing's bright white"" tautological storyline. This is sentimentalism for dummies, no wonder the movie goes nowhere. It's just a routine spy-job movie. Munich as very little to do with this, and that's why we are fed with this protracted rendering of the Munich tragedy spliced in 4-odd parts and spilled over the main 2h30 course.

The casting and acting are really good, but the locations, sets and photography give too much of a surreal aspect to the story. It looks like a dream, never too close to a real nightmare (contrary to what the hero is supposed to experience): Spielberg sentimentalism is totally at odds with the subject matter. Interesting subject, wrong execution < wrong director.",4

24 December 2005,"All Politics Aside, This Is An Excellent Film!","All politics aside, this is an excellent film on every level. The story (mostly true events) is gripping, the acting is excellent, especially Eric Bana, and the cinematography is awesome. The time period the film takes place in is recreated meticulously. When the film started I was trying to analyze it as much as possible, shot by shot, but as it went on, I was sucked in, and forgot I was watching a movie. The scenes of violence are haunting, making you feel like you're watching a documentary. The Munich airport massacre, and the female assassin's comeuppance are especially eery. Spielberg gets political... and he does it well. This is his best work since Schindler and Private Ryan. Bravo.

7 March 2006,The Spielberg,"Steven Spielberg is an icon. I know nobody who doesn't respect him as a filmmaker, innovator or producer. In any conversation about movies, you've got to mention Spielberg, in fact, the other day me and some friends were talking about him. It's difficult to explain what ""Jaws"" was at its time, and how a director could make box office hits like ""Jurassic Park"" that were actually good pieces of cinema.

The man never did the same thing. He always changed genres and took different roads and decisions. From the extraterrestrial world and his beautiful ""E.T"", going trough dramatic love (""Always"") and children adventures (""Hook""), to profound movies that really have something to say. Here we found the double-faced Spielberg we've seen since forever; the man who did ""Minority Report"" in 2002 and had fun with Tom Hanks in ""Catch me if you can"".

Both were good movies, don't get me wrong, but one was more audacious than the other. Last year proves the same. I was talking to my friends and I said to them: ""You have to choose one Spielberg movie to watch this year; only one. If you're stupid, you'll choose 'War of the worlds'; if you want to see good stuff, you'll choose 'Munich'"". Not one of them answered, but it didn't matter; because this year it happened: ""Munich"" was a good film and ""War of the worlds"" wasn't.

It comes after long periods of years, that Spielberg makes a movie like ""Munich""; a movie with a statement that means something to him. For this reason, it is a picture he directs with a lot of commitment, playing close attention and checking every detail. Ultimately, the film is beautifully shot, the images are breathtaking, the score is accurate (to expect from master John Williams) and the screenplay (Tony Kushner and Eric Roth) is disturbing; thought provoking.

At the beginning of the film we witness the events occurred in the 1972 Olympics, in Munich. I was watching the images and thought: ""This is actually what happened?"". My dad gently confirmed my answerThe intelligent Spielberg made a subtle and right decision, leaving the paranoia off the critical scene, which was already real enough for any viewer to tolerate (you'll understand when you watch).

When a director cares about his movie, he shows things as they are, so we can reflect about them; and that's what I mean with audacious. Courage was to shoot that first scene; courage was to shoot a couple of strong sex scenes and some extremely violent, merciless killings. This is an admirable Spielberg because he has nothing to hide.

About the controversy of the film, I'm not taking sides; but if Spielberg is defending the Jews for their actions, he has all the right: he is a Jew. If he doesn't defend them; well he doesn't. Don't try to take sides when you watch it; it's something that happened years ago. Just listen, better watch, the statement ""Munich's"" director is declaring through his images. The story is so important, that the actors become smaller than it. Sadly, the movie is so perfect, that it becomes tiring, and not very good in the end. But I assure you: you will want to get to the end.",7
9 June 2020,A great historical movie that lacks details 8/10,"""Munich"" is a great and fabulous movie by Steven Spielberg. With fantastic cinematography such as long shots and camera movements, a perfect cast of actors and a good script. though while I was watching the film I checked how accurate was the movie to the real events of ""black September"" and the massacre of the Israeli athletes in the Olympics of 1972. I found out that the movie had a lot of bad critics for not being accurate to history and I agree: The real operation of the ""Mossad"" called ""wrath of god"" was a highly skilled operation in order to track down the responsibles for the massacre and avenge the death of the athletes. In the movie, the team of assassins act like amateurs which is kind of disappointing cause the story becomes unrealistic. I expected from Spielberg to make better work out of the film. With that being said, I did enjoy the whole plot and how the main character, Avner (Eric Bana) loses faith in his mission and government. The other actors were fantastic as well. I loved the idea of making a movie based on this tragic event but at the same time I think it could have been done better.

2 February 2009,Powerful film by Spielberg depicting Israeli response to terror,"I consider 'Munich', along with Schindler's List, to be among Spielberg's best films and worthy of high praise. The film is long but never boring as it details attempts by an Israeli team led by Eric Bana (excellent) to avenge the terror attacks at the Munich Olympics. It masterfully shows their confidence gradually dissolving as they come face to face with nagging doubt, and the growing realization that violence only engenders violence. Note that the film doesn't do this in a heavy-handed manner. While some have criticized him for being naive, I believe Spielberg's only motive is to step back and look at the entire conflict from a distance. Highly recommended.

Overall 9/10

10 June 2006,A balanced portrayal of the Mossad & terrorists,"Steven Spielberg has hit a rare home run with this film; an emotionally charged examination of the work of an unofficial elimination squad. Based on what the Mossad claims are highly questionable sources (which lends no small amount of credence to the story), the film traces a great portrait of the self-righteous, unreasoning ""logic"" that drives the never-ending strife in the middle east. People are killed because of what they are instead of who they are, and it is an ever escalating situation. Both sides pay for it in ways they never could have imagined, much of the time the innocent victims are found in the form of families . A great film.

25 December 2005,An even handed movie about land and revenge,"Two good, fair movies have been made this year about the eternal Israeli/Palestinian war. I prefer ""Paradise Now,"" a tense-low budget, no-stars movie, that portrays two young Palestinian suicide bombers. ""Munich"" is about the cycle of revenge and response caused by the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics. It's a compelling movie, as unpleasant and uncomfortable as is the subject.

Spielberg portrays an Israeli hit squad that gradually loses its moral certainty as assassination piles on assassination. A key moment in the film is when when a young, idealistic Palestinian terrorist talks of the need of a homeland -- much as Israelis talk -- and the dawning realization on the assassin's leader, Eric Bana, that not much in the way of moral space separates the terrorists from the hit squad.

Unlike others, I did not care for the omnipresent ""French connection"" in the movie. One is asked to believe that an old man on a farm seemingly has all the information in the world at hand, including the addresses and bios of Palestinian terrorists. This was a cheap plot trick in my opinion, a quick and easy, but hardly credible way for the hit squad to find terrorists. Better would have been a gritty search, blind alleys, and a mistake or two along the way.

The obvious message of the movie is that violence begets violence and a better way must be found. Spielberg doesn't suggest that better way. I won't bore the reader with my solution, but attempts to look at the Palestinian/Israeli problem in a even-handed manner is a good trend.

16 February 2006,one of the most powerful and thought provoking films you will ever see,"quite simply, this movie is one of the most thought provoking, disturbing and utterly human portrayal of real life that your ever going to get.

as a 19 year old, i went into it not fully understanding the subject matter, came out not really understanding all the details, but the main thing i got from this film, which was driven into my mind through the mesmirising acting of a superb cast, is that in war there is never one side to a story, no side is ever completely innocent.

i cannot possibly explain the impact this movie has. the realistic and gritty filming makes it seem almost as if your walking along with the characters. one of the group. you feel their emotion, and piece together information as they get it.

no comment is ever going to do this film justice. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT, you will remember it. this film is truly a masterpiece, and will be remembered for years to come. though the situation was based on real events, the emotions, and the concepts are easily applied to modern day.

what most upset me, was that 30 years on, and we are still making the same mistakes.

just because somebody is on the opposite side, does not make them the enemy.

i fight you because u fight me. you fight me because i fight you.

its horrific. this film is a must see.",8

3 January 2006,"A very good movie, although a bit long.","I still remember the exact time ABC Sports announced ""They're all gone"". The movie refers to the massacre by breaking it up as the movie progresses, from the terrorists receiving aid in jumping the Olympic Village gate ,unbeknownst to the unwitting helpers, through to the totally botched German commando ""rescue"", a rescue resulting in the death of every Israeli athlete and coach. With some exception, the movie pretty well covers factually how the Palestinians responsible for planning the massacre were hunted down throughout Europe and individually killed. The moral questions involved in retribution and revenge were touched upon, almost but not quite rubbing our noses in it. The acting and cast were superb, as was the directing.

3 June 2008,Munich,"After re-locating myself to Amsterdam, I have slowly developed an interest in understanding Europe, Jews, issues surrounding Jerusaleum and Palestine  listening and watching different viewpoints (mainly on CNN and BBC). I read in one of my Google searches that Munich was a movie that was discussed and debated a lot on many blogs about its stand on Palestine and Israel. With new Indiana Jones releasing this week and the commonality between them being Steven Spielberg, I decided to have a look at Munich  a movie I had missed while it was released for the first time.

The story line is simple  Avner (Iric Bana) is chosen by Israel government to eliminate the masterminds of 1972 Munich Olympics massacre done Palestine terrorists. Avner gets enough money and freedom to do whatever he wants to eliminate the people. The whole operations is planned to be done undercover without anyone knowing about the motives or purposes of the operations. Avner hires four other persons (one of them is Daniel Craig) and the movie rolls into the planning and execution parts of seven out of eight killings - one after the other. There are intermittent discussions within this group on political issues and difference between Israel and Palestine. In the end Avner finds his team being target of elimination and when he is the only surviving member of his team, he thinks they were used as a pawn in the big political game which does not help or benefit anyone.

The movie is based on the book: Vengeance  The story of an Israel Counter Terrorist Team. It seems that Director Steven Spielberg invited four script writers and collated Tony Kushner and Eric Roth's scripts to make the movie.

Iric Bana is very good in the movie; he is so handsome and has acted also well. Daniel Craig is okay in the small role.

The movie focuses more on the execution of murderous attacks rather than the Israel  Palestine issue. So it is a big let down for those who looked up to Steven Spielberg to provide an interesting and intelligent take on it. What we see is a run of the mill, commercial take by Steven Spielberg. May be that was his intention. For me it became evident that the director wanted to project human face of the counter terrorist Jew sqaud  where they delay the killings because of some humane reasons. There were also many pro-Jew statements, and a few con-Jew statements were so disguised that one can easily miss them. I get a feel that Steven Spielberg was a big scared of the Hollywood Jews lobby.

I read that many Jews who wanted Steven Spielberg to take a strong pro-Jew stand took objection to this run of mill movie. I also found last sex scene of Iric Bana with flashback of Munich killing  so corny and 'B' grade.

Overall a good entertaining movie  if one does not expect intellectual discussions around it.

20 June 2021,A spy thriller with meaning,"The horrific events at the 1972 Olympic games in Munich were documented live for the world to see, but not until Steven Spielberg's Oscar-nominated 'Munich' did we see its years-long aftermath with Israeli operatives taking up the mission to hunt down and kill the terrorists who were responsible.

At its core, 'Munich' is a story of justice that was sought for a nation that was in mourning. It comes off as part 'Bourne,' part 'Bond' (ironic given it features a pre-007 Daniel Craig), and it's about 45 minutes too long. But 'Munich' still feels very much like a traditional spy thriller that benefits from being based on true events. In an example of casting being pretty spot on, Eric Bana delivers as lead agent Avner - a conflicted man who must balance duty and honor for his country with being a husband and father. Bana brings a sense of authenticity to the character and viewers actually feel for him as he tries to do right by all who depend on him.

At times, the plot of 'Munich' is somewhat hard to follow. There's a lot of jumping around, which makes sense given the globetrotting that's required in order to accomplish the mission, but this doesn't help from a watchability standpoint.

'Munich' is one of those films that will probably be remembered as being better than it actually was, but it should be respected given the important subject matter.",7
9 December 2020,Revenge.,"Munich, despite a detailed plot and events, is about one thing and one thing only - revenge. It is about the vengeance sought after the killing of Israeli Olympic athletes during the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich by Palestinian terrorists. Indeed, the name of the operation to track down those responsible is even called ""Operation Wrath of God"". They show no mercy.

Some anti-Semites claim that Jews are obsessed with revenge if anyone wrongs them. Who knows what truth there is in this, but Spielberg does not shy away from intense feeling of vengeance that permeates the film. He embraces it fully and crafts a story around the intense manhunt for the Palestinian militants responsible for the slaughter of Israeli Olympians. The morality of the Mossad assassin's private mission is called into question many times, and no one is sure if they are satisfied with how they are handling things.

Eric Bana is an intense actor, and his performance here does not disappoint. His high energy and intensity from start to finish rubs off on the other actors throughout the film.

This film is historically relevant, I believe, to the ongoing crises between Israel and Palestine. There has been much strife and violence between two peoples and countries in such close proximity, and many people don't understand why. This film sheds some light on the relationship between the two peoples, but only in time of high conflict. Still, it provides some clues, mostly due to lack of cooperation between the two peoples, on how things out to be between them.

You will enjoy this political thriller, and people interested in the Israeli/Palestine issue will also enjoy this film as a piece to the conflict's ""puzzle"".",8
29 June 2006,Munich is an excellent treatise of a millennium old state of mind,"Munich is summarised in (I believe)the last word uttered in the movie ""NO"" I watched the movie on DVD in the comfort of my lounge - I didn't want to see it in a public place. I believe it absolutely captured the Israeli approach to their collective future. It also absolutely captured the Israeli brevity of emotion in particular circumstances. I have not read one word of commentary by anyone on this movie - i witnessed the actual Munich situation and didn't need to be reminded. What really grabbed me was the message of the movie - we have heard the message many times before. However, this movie delivered it without frills and therefore was so effective. Israelis and Jewish people generally (and I am Jewish)have a particularly strong sense of justice - as well as a strong image of self. Israel is ""our"" country and ""we"" will never be dismissed from that country - Israelis in particular see their country as an inviolate state of their right to exist after untold periods of suppression and violation. This is what Munich is about - the Spymaster's word ""no"" at the end of the film is seen as absolutely the last word to the entire world. No you will not defeat us! No we will not accept violation! No you cannot hurt us without being hurt in return! Unfortunately, to a large extent, the Arab population throughout the middle east continues to misunderstand that here is a people who would rather visit an entire middle east ""Masada"" than lose either their home or their freedom. Unfortunately, the potential combined economic impact of a united middle east may never be realised - or is that the intention?",9
10 December 2020,A necessity,"This is one of the movies that simply needed to be done. And one of the best men to direct it was namely Steven Spielberg. It has a lot of action, a lot of drama. Moments of great joy, happiness & connection - and moments of utmost despair, pain, anger, isolation, loneliness and grief. The movie has a lot going on all the time - maybe even a bit too much. This is one of the reasons I only gave it 8 stars. At some points, it is even a bit hard to keep up with everything going on. In addition, it feels like most characters look very similar to each other, also having almost identical outfits with each other, etc. Places/cities where the events take place, also change at a quite fast pace, and this creates a little confusion to me. However, I must admit that the storyline is very captivating & intriguing, and it really keeps you grabbed until the very end of the movie. Some very unexpected things & turns take place when you least expect them, and this is what will keep you hooked until the very end. Not even nearly everything will go as planned, or as you would expect. Enemies will come your way in most unexpected occasions, and not everything you trusted or thought you knew was what you assumed. People can turn out to be something totally different than what you thought. Good friends will always stand by your side, no matter what. But you can also lose friends along the way very unexpectedly. The directing and acting in the movie are just phenomenal. Another reason for only giving 8 stars was, that there is no way Mossad / Israeli agents would ever be so unprofessional in real life. At points they are very confused, clumsy, fighting with each other, and acting in every manner very unprofessionally. In real life, we all know this would never be the case. Not least importantly, this movie talks about the universal, ever-present, ultimate hate that the Jewish nation and state have faced as long as they have existed. If not participating in the terror & murder, the ones not committing it - the rest of the world - will just stand by silent watching & enabling the hatred, murder, & terror to happen. It is actually hertbreaking. It also talks about the ever-present expectations Jews and Israel face and always have faced - to not revenge any form or extent of evil or defend themselves, no matter what happened; to always turn the other cheek; to always respond to evil, hatred & murder with goodness and compliance; to be the only ""good Christian"" & rigteous instance in the world. This movie talks about the fact that this just simply cannot always be the case & just won't always work. And also doesn't have to.",8

19 January 2006,A flagrant violation of truth and morality,"Mr. Spielberg and his accomplice, Tony Kushner, using an egregiously dishonest book, Vengeance, as the basis for their film have committed the sin of moral equivalence in their naieve reading of history and of fact. Munich has done a great disservice to the cause of peace between Israel and the Palestinians as it has fudged the truth on the fact of terrorism and has neglected to understand the underlying existence of evil on the part of those who would commit terror against innocent civilians. Imagine if you will, using the same thesis in making a film about the perpetrators of 9/11, Spielberg and Kushner would attempt to humanize the terrorists who wreaked havoc on that day with those who died at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 9/11.

The cause of terrorism has been given a status of nobility by Munich that is despicable and unworthy of decent, moral people.

9 January 2006,S10 Reviews: Munich (2005),"This controversial bio-drama stars Eric Bana as the leader of a team of Israeli's sent to avenge the murders of the 11 Olympic athletes during the 1972 games at Munich.

Munich is a very good drama but just a little south of Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. Is it accurate? Probably not. But it does tell a compelling story and the acting top-notch.

23 June 2006,A mixed Bag,"I am a big Steven Spielberg fan and have seen most of his pictures that have come to Charlotte, North Carolina. So when it was showing locally I beat a path to the theater. I could not get into the movie in the first half and found some of the dialog very hard to understand. The second half of the movie was much better and I was able to get into the story. For the most part the cast was made up of unknowns with the exception of Geoffrey Rush who played the part of Ephraim in the movie. I thought that Eric Bana who was the main character was very good in his part and look forward to seeing him again in some other feature production. I cannot strongly recommend this movie so go plunk down your money and you decide.

26 November 2007,Munich shows that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict appears endless at times. It delves into the conflict on a very personal level.,"Munich attempts to show that vengeance against savage and barbaric killing does not discourage terrorism. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one of the central themes present in this film by Steven Spielberg. This film does stretch beyond this endless conflict. An underlying theme of Munich is family and the dehumanizing effect that Israli born Avner's (Eric Bana) mission of revenge has on his wife and new born baby. Steve (Daniel Craig) plays a South African driver, part of the Israeli government's secret retaliation assassinations of those ""responsible"" for the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli Olympic athletes by Black September. Occasionally they meet up with Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush),their case officer. Ephraim tells Avner that the assassinations are to just be the names on the target, and no others; especially civilians. Central to the films theme, approximately the middle of the film, Avner finds himself sharing a safe house with a Palestinian terrorist group (he manages to pass himself off as an ETA operative). The two get to talking and the Palestinian describes his pride at being part of the struggle for a free Palestine. Avner finds it difficult to keep his anger hidden to the point where the other man accuses him of being an Israeli sympathizer. This scene is crucial because it is the one time in the film where we actually hear the feelings that drive the Palestinian cause. It is also the moment at which Avner sees the human face of his enemy and realizes that, not only are they as devoted to their country as he is to his own, but they might actually have legitimate goals, even if their methods of achieving them are wrong. Spielberg has entertained us with audience pleasing films such as Jurassic Park, E.T. and Indiana Jones, however, Munich appears to be a film that Spielberg felt compelled to deliver. One of the Munichs' elements is the emotionally deep music by John Williams. It is for the most part very suitable to the central theme and overall experience. The song from the film soundtrack, Prayer for Peace, won a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition. The song is played during numerous scenes, including the ending where it is an arrangement for strings and piano. The movie was painful to watch. I would imagine this is the case for many unpopular subjects.",8

2 February 2006,The A teem on a really bad day!,"This film is so annoying to me as an Israeli, has this Spielberg dude even been to Israel? I think the answer is NO, this film is total distortion of facts, its based on a distorted book. The film ""Sword of Gideon"" is also based on the book ""vengeance"" but is much better because it is not so ambiguous.

Lets make something very clear here: the terrorist group that murdered the Israeli athletes are not spokesmen of Palestinian people! Did not ""fight"" for Palestinian people, Not all Palestinian people are terrorists but this stupid film makes it so.

This film makes the mossad look like the A teem on a really bad day, and also makes the whole ANTI TERROR actions seem like a silly vengeance of Israel, I can assure you that without anti terror actions terrorists would have an even bigger filed trip then they already do.

its stupid and irresponsible to say that doing NOTHING about terrorism is the answer to peace. On the contrary alertness and agreement to fight back when stuck down IS the answer to freedom.

Don't forget BLACK September are nothing more then terrorists! Look up the word terrorist in the dictionary!

About the film itself: quite boring and long, the ""countries"" are not really, France, Holland, UK and Israel but really Malta, this sucks because it makes the film look like 1960's ""mission impossible""

PLUS PIONT OF FILM IS - BANA YUMMY Eric Bana, that's is a very hot gorgeous man and actor,

the film was a waist of time money and made me really angry.",1
1 February 2006,"Harrowing and brutal with superb performances and amazing realism, it's a harsh but excellent movie.","Controversy around Munich has been apparent from its announcement, and the unusual move by Spielberg to not talk about it or pamper to the Press has raised expectation and the very controversy he has sought to avoid. Then we began to hear that some critics didn't like it, and that the movie was biased towards or against one viewpoint. As usual I approached this movie with an open mind, and my Scottish viewpoint.

The first thing to say is that this movie firmly belongs on the Schindler's List side of Spielbergs work and nowhere near the E.T. side. I'm sure you have guessed by now that it is a serious political drama, but by this I mean it is hard, harrowing and at times quite a brutal movie. The journey will bring you downwards, not upwards to a nice fluffy conclusion, and not even leave you with much hope. Its showing in the clear light of day how messed up, manipulative, blinded and cold human beings can be. Be warned, it's a tough movie and not an easy afternoon viewing.

One of the amazing things that Spielberg manages to attain in many of his movies is the level of authenticity. Nowhere is this more apparent in this movie with the style of filming, costume and the writing. Blending real footage with reconstructions which look as genuine as actual news footage, keeping costumes as in the period but without resorting to 70's cheese, using actual camera equipment and styles that represent those used at the time, all combine to give a harsh but very real look and feel to the movie.

That is one of the big positives of the film. It's extremely realistic and with that comes the tough and often brutal representations of events from history and the book the movie is based on. Nothing is sugar coated here for Hollywood audiences, and no better places is this shown than with the scenes of murder. From explosions to shootings, they are all portrayed openly and as they would be in real life. Fraught with tension, understated, and meeting death face on. If you are looking for an easy ride in this film, or some shock entertainment, then you are sorely mistaken.

I felt that this was quite surprising for Spielberg, even though he has tackled tough subjects in the past, this seems to push the representation of the darker side of reality even more. At times viewing the movie becomes almost uncomfortable to watch, but you're drawn to it like watching a reality show, or news footage.

Despite the subject matter there are still a few moments of traditional Spielberg creeping in. There's nothing that harms the movie, but they do illicit a groan and hurt the odd scene for me. One such moment is the where the Isreali and Palestinian argue over a radio station, and what brings them together is the compromise over American music.

This probably meant nothing when filming it, and the track was chosen because it was universally know and recognisable, and I really do hate looking for connections in other peoples work when there need not be. Yet it does certainly feel as if there is something being made of this moment, but it's twee and seemingly contrived. Thankfully, there are few moments like this, and you are returned to reality with a bang.

I have to say that I feel no bias in this film at all. Spielberg shows that all sides have their level of bloody mindedness and futility from Isreali to Palestinian, even the CIA and the KGB are shown as lost in their own types of hatred, self deception and self fulfilling agendas.

The acting is of the highest quality from all of the leads. Bana redeems his pitiful Hulk performance, and Craig shows us what a fine actor he is although definitely not a master of accents - this performance bodes well for Bond. Hinds provides another excellent performance which at times is quite chilling.

All these actors give top notch performances being strong, striking and intense. Craig, to some degree, but mainly Bana give the most emotionally charged and altogether confused performances which seem very human and with identifiable pain. Bana's slow change during the latter stages of the movie is particularly worth mentioning.

Hinds though, shouldn't be crowded out by these other actors. He brings perhaps the most grounded and real performance, and the moment of recognition of this actor when he first appeared on screen was a joy. I've seen him before and was struck by his performance, and this hits home again in Munich. His connection with Avner seems heartfelt, and his through the movie I was captivated by his character.

The movie does a great job of highlighting the futility of the ongoing and escalating acts of revenge, and how these slowly eat away at those involved, destroying who they once were. I say that thinking of all sides involved through the movie and not looking to either Isreali or Palestinian alone.

My understanding of the final events of the actual hostage taking in Munich does lay some blame on the handling of the attack on the terrorists. Yet there is no hint of this anywhere, and if I were to point any finger at this movie suggesting it was showing something or some group in an improper or inaccurate light it would be that very operation. It does not appear in the movie and indeed it portrays them as innocent victims.

However, this would have surely detracted from the belief of blame in the movie, and after all as Spielberg says, this is not a documentary it's a movie based on real events.

As I've said, this movie is tough, harsh and very realistic, resulting in a sometimes brutal portrayal of events. It's not easy watching by any means, but it is a very excellent and moving film.",9
30 May 2006,"A Strong, if Flawed, Endorsement of Revenge","What a surprise this was! I expected a maudlin, cloying tale of ethnic woe, but instead, this is an almost perfect close-in thriller where your mind is likely to be racing as quickly as Eric Bana's. As far as I'm concerned, despite all his technically wonderful achievements in Sci-Fi, this is Spielberg's best film. True, he's probably unsurpassed for his ability to scare you even as you marvel at sights you can barely take in. But this film seems so much more difficult.

I am hardly a friendly audience given the subject matter, but I was more than glad I rented the DVD. Here he is telling the story of people who are not interested in telling their story, and somehow it's believable, engrossing and almost defensible. Of course it's something of a let down that all his main characters are rather admirable, but to Spielberg's credit, that humanity is not entirely the domain of the protagonists.

And the action sequences are probably the most realistic I've seen anywhere. Where else can you sit and safely watch what seems like a real gun fight? I have two objections but they're important. In one of the scenes, a Palestinian child is deliberately protected from the mayhem. To my mind this is an attempt to rehabilitate a people known for killing Palestinian children almost without hesitation. It was a huge mistake, in my opinion, for Spielberg to pretend otherwise. THe other distortion is the argument unanswered in the film that the Palestinians have no home when Palestine was their home for more than 2,000 years, far longer than the Israelis ever had it.

Does no one remember the footage of that little boy killed by head-shot by Israelis while huddling beside a wall with his father? Or how about the countless children killed almost as target practice for doing no more than throwing stones? But the chances are no one will question Spielberg's accuracy. Only someone who uses alternative sources on the Middle East is likely to see the Big Lie so innocuously inserted into this enthralling film. Most will succumb to the deluge of counter-spin generated by the well connected Israeli PR people. Spielberg knew that this film contained these poison pills when he edited this otherwise excellent film and I, for one, lament his lapse of courage.",8
12 May 2006,"Falls short of perfect, but still a great film","I may have to see it again soon to let it sink in. As it is, it's one of the most powerful films I've seen. The horror of Munich and its aftermath are perfectly captured, as is the ethical ambiguity prevalent in the Middle East conflict. The message is not clear in either direction, and that makes it very strong. Avner's descent from proud Israeli into a paranoid murderer is very well done and incredibly realistic. The back-and-forth nature of terrorism is also captured well, reflecting the near-absence of morality that takes place. That being said, this isn't a perfect movie.

Technically, it has its faults. It's a bit long, and it does drag at the end. It also switches dramatically from an action thriller into a thoughtful drama near the end. The script is also flawed, as there are too many holes and loose ends. I suppose that could represent the cloak-and-dagger nature of the era, but perhaps a bit more could have been explained. The directing was near-flawless, but the editing could have been a bit better. The production design is perfect. The performances are solid and there isn't a weak link. Bana stands out, as he should. The music is terrific; one of Williams' best scores, I think. Whenever that haunting theme came up, you knew that something was about to happen. It's amazing that this was shot so quickly, it's so well-done.

All in all, this is a very good film about terrorism and human morality. The assassination scenes were both action-packed and dramatically striking. The plot unfolds quite well during the meat of the story, but becomes lost near the end. I know that the ending was there to present a message, but it could have been done in less time, perhaps. The dialogue is a bit hard to understand at time, but the story is never that hard to follow. Overall, a near-great film that may become great after I watch it again. For now, though, I give it a B+.",8
1 May 2013,The price for freedom,"Purposeful and insider-like, Munich comes at you from often filmed angles of guilt and revenge. But Spielberg shows us a scandalous Israeli government eye-for-an-eye reaction delivered by a thoughtful Priminister perspective. That scene set the subconsciousness of the film. The hit squad assembled was shockingly amateur, but the underlying theme takes over the film as Eric Bana, Geoffrey Rush and Daniel Craig debate the controversial choice of becoming the terrorists that they are desperately trying to destroy. Black September haunts this film throughout, drives the hunt for those responsible, but it is the viewer who's left to mull around the price for freedom.

22 May 2006,An Extraordinary Film,"An extraordinary film. I struggled with my preconception that Spielberg, conceptually, would be heavy handed against the Palestinian/Arab side of the story. Thrity minutes into the film, my amazement began to grow at the depth of this film. Half way through the film Spielberg's involvement was not even a thought in my mind. At the end of the film I was left dazed at the compelling depth of the story, the quality of the acting and the technical mastery with which the film was made. Though I have always admired Spielberg for his talent and mastery, I have never much appreciated his actual films. This is by far and away his greatest achievement. I cannot think of a better film that was made in 2005, nor really, one better done yet this century.

Unless I am utter blind and stupid, I would recommend this film equally to Arab or Jew, liberal or conservative. The story defines the situation, the predicament, the history so fully, and thought the point of view is definitely from an Israeli set of eyes, the humanity his enemies so rocks and disrupts his soul that he literally has to walk away. The symbolism of the final scene of the film is remarkable. And those two buildings standing in the background that are no longer there then tell us why Spielberg used so much Vertical patterns in his shots. Kushner and Roth's screenplay is superb. A story told and directed by Jews that is basically asking the questionwhat is all this madness and where will it end?

In our own way, we are all looking over our shoulders, we are all questioning what has happened, we must all be questioning what we have been lead to believe, we are all clinging to our identities while questioning who it is we are in the process of becoming, we are all blinded by this flash and choking in the smoke trying to resurrect some concept, some hope, some tattered dream of peace. But after watching this film few who view it can in honesty turn away untouched. I was deeply disturbed by the truths that this film exposed. My 17 yr old niece refused to watch it because it was too real, instead she wanted to watch ""Scarface"" for the 20th time.

This film should be taught in schools as a reflection of history. I hope that a similar effort exists or will emerge from a Palestinian point of view that will reflect the same depth and complexity of this dilemma, which is not exceeded by any other.

Peace be to Mr. Spielberg and anyone who watches this film with as open a mind and courageous a heart as those who made it.",10
7 July 2006,It's not really like Jaws or ET,"Knew what I was in for when hiring this, and probably was about what I expected.

The movie retells the events of the 1972 Munich Olympics, where 9 Israeli athletes were killed. The majority of the film revolves around a group of 5 assigned to track down and kill the Palestinians who executed the murders.

Spielberg claimed at the time of release that this movie doesn't side with either group, but puts the story out there for us to make a decision. I certainly feel the movie leans towards the Israelis, which is no great surprise considering Steve's origins. It certainly doesn't glorify revenge, but it also doesn't show many repercussions for the Israeli assassins.

As usual the directing was great, the cast solid, but not spectacular, and the sets were excellent. Not overly gripping but was pretty good for what it was.",7
2 January 2006,grainy thriller of conscience,"Saw ""Munich"" today between rain storms. Bloody, like its subject. Pointless? No. The movie (about revenge and reprisals after a terrorist attack at the 1972 Olympics) seems to say that all this bickering, murdering and back-and-forth escalation betrays an attachment to tribalism rather than tolerance and understanding. Its subject seems pointless for those of us who have no real say in it, and who don't understand patriotism at all costs. And I really think we have no say. How are we involved in this conflict of hate? Because no matter how we vote, it is pointless. Humanity muddles on. Many of us continue to arbitrarily choose our teams.

Because the film never concludes, and can't conclude, we can only judge it as a polished production with excellent acting and seamless editing. Even as the killings begin to seem redundant, as the sequences of plotting and execution pile on, we must admit that this is the real deal; it is exactly what we are going through--the same sequence of violence begetting violence day after day in Iraq, in the Middle East, in the world.

There are some odd sex scenes in ""Munich"" telescoped by a moment in ""Schindler's List"" that made my mother flinch; but to me, Oskar Schindler's intercourse seems redemptive in that movie, as if he is clinging to life amidst death; but in this new movie, the sex has the effect of distancing us from the main character at a crucial point, because the assassin can't get violent images out of his head while he's attempting pleasure. I don't think the moment is inappropriate, but I think it could be misconstrued as a scene of mere propagation: he is creating a new soldier for the fight. I don't think that's what's going on. His wife covers his eyes afterward. She knows he is not seeing her, so she blinds him to regain his attention.

I knew what the last shot of this movie would be. That is, long before the movie ended, I guessed what the last shot would inevitably include, and yet still it works.",8
8 February 2006,Spy thriller Mossad Style- Emperor Bush approved!,"The Mossad are a Jewish organization like the CIA, only more effective and far more murderous. This film tracks one man's descent into the world of spy vs spy Israeli style- in the events surrounding the aftermath of a terror attack on the Olympics in 1972.

While the film is very solid- it is also secretly, or not so secretly- a jew apologist film with its' subliminal anti-Arab messages, and as such is a very dangerous film to be passing off to the uneducated public as innocent unbiased entertainment.

The message of this film is that the Mossad was created for self defense only and their hand is continually forced by the dastardly evil Palestinians and it is with great regret that our noble mossad agents butcher women and children on a daily basis.

The killing must be done or the jews will lose ""their"" ""homeland"". If you have studied the intricate subjects of the israel conflict it will be obvious that this is very heavy handed on how innocent the jews are in their various mass murders. I can assure you the mossad is not a noble self defense organization, but rather the sort of organization that was behind 911.

Like many Jewish films this film is very resigned to accepting israeli violence as inevitable in relation to the Palestinian struggle against the illegal and immoral Israeli occupation. If you are uneducated you won't notice this poison barb in the script and instead be able to fully enjoy this solid thriller like a fat happy bunny.

Me, I was kind of disgusted that yet another piece of mainstream media is being produced during a confusing time of war- telling us how to think and feel about the Israeli struggles and to side with the jews because they are exercising the only option they have.

This of course is a state manufactured mentality as there are many, many other options that the Israeli's are simply too proud and corrupt to consider in resolving their disputes with the previous tenants of the land they stole.

One of the characters in the movie has a good 15 seconds of soul searching when he realizes what he is doing(killing) is essentially making his reason for living worthless and only helping to make things worse with the Palestinians. That's about all the movie has for any moments of regret or sanity for killing innocent Palestinians- about 45 seconds of film time.

So while this movie is a solid thriller and accurately portrays what it feels like not to be able to trust anyone when you are on a mission, it is important to note that this a clever deception through media manipulation during a time of war when it is important for Americans to support siding with the jews against the Arabs in order to move Emperor Bush's military stratagem forward.

Don't think for a second that the timing of this film and it's subject matter are not endorsed or encouraged by our current dictator. I haven't seen such a clever mental abuse of a media audience since the debacle about the dutch cartoons about Mohamed. Beware of your media- it's not without its brainwash attempts. Jarhead is another much crappier movie in this dangerous style of new propaganda for a new empire.",8

25 January 2006,another wonderful film by Spielberg,"At the 1972 Munich Olympics, eleven Israeli Athletes were taken hostage by a Palestinia terrorist group called Black September. The Palestinia group want prisoners of war released that are held by the Israelits. The whole situation grows horribly wrong, with all eleven hostages killed. Three surviving kidnappers were set free and taken out of Germany. The Israeli government sets up a small team of assassins, to target the people involved and constructed this attack; eleven in total. Heading the five member team is Avner, who's wife is currently pregnant. Avner, employed under Mossad head Ephraim, becomes a shadow; he doesn't work for anyone and doesn't exist. One by one Avner and his team track down the involved people across the European landscape.

The incident of the Munich Olpymics is vividly recreated by Steven Spielberg, the 1970's is meticulously detailed against the rich backdrop of the European cities. Munich is a great, thrilling political drama on the terrorist attack, blending fact and fiction. Spielberg has captured the coldness that surrounds the situation, and the retaliation taken by the Israeli government. During the scenes of the assassinations, the tension is so taunt and of such a high caliber. Its unnerving that we are shown the detail and precision of the attacks; how they construct the bombs and contraptions, and the set up to place them. It really shows the commitment they are taking to complete their task. The attacks are more unnerving and realistic with the graphic violence.

Holding Munich back from reaching a brilliant thriller is the length. It has a drawn out pace with the story. The tension doesn't keep an even pace, due to the pacing of the film. When there should have been rapid fire tense scene after one another with little breathing space, we're given to much breathing space, letting the tense atmosphere slip. Munich starts to fall towards the end, leaving the political tension for family drama. Yet there is much paranoia captured in Avner, trying to keep his family safe.

While this could have been a one sided story, we are shown both sides, hearing both the Israelis and Palestinias. We hear their argument and the commitment they hold for their beliefs. While Avner is shown as a noble man, committing deplorable acts, while we can sympathise with him, we still aren't meant to accept what he's doing.

In a career defining role, Eric Bana gives his best performance to date. He perfectly embodies Avner, showing the eternal conflict he has, yet the commitment for the task. Daniel Craig seems miss casted as Steve, though does a good performance. Geoffrey Rush shows another strong job in the minimal role of Ephraim. Completing the assassin team; Ciarn Hinds, Mathieu Kassovitz and Hanns Zischler all give gripping performances. Steven Speilbergs direction is wonderful. We are taken head first into the story, yet Spielberg's direction isn't intrusive, letting the story come out.

Though it may be drawn out to much, Munich still is a gripping thriller, on the retaliation taken out on this tragic event.",8
29 January 2006,An Almost Great film,"I was fourteen at the time of the Munich Massacre,followed the events closely, and have been interested ever since.The raw materials for a great film maker, and film, are all here:hate, fear, revenge, plotting, treachery and intrigue - Shakespeare would have loved to have had a go! Munich works best in providing snapshots of the assassins and their victims.The piano playing daughter of the Paris ""hit"", the lover in bed with one of the Beirut ""hits"", and the joy, then despair, of the families of the Munich hostages are all wonderful vignettes.

The criticism from both Palestinian and Jewish supporters reflects a tremendous story telling discipline from Spielberg.However for a long film, some essential original detail was omitted which would have added to the drama.Before each ""hit"", in reality,the widow of one of the Munich victims was ""tipped off"" to watch the news by an anonymous caller.This complicity of Mossad and the Israeli Government in each assassination was ducked in the film apart from the implicit cooperation demonstrated in the Beirut raid.Was Spielberg too deferential to the Jewish lobby in this respect?

Equally,the spineless capitulation of the West German Government in releasing the three captured Munich Terrorists following a high jacking was referred to as an incidental. In reality, this was the real driver for revenge with those three top of the wanted list.The neutral portrayal of the Arab victims consequently evokes a sympathy which does not do justice to the motivation for the assassins actions.

I squirmed when the opening shots for Paris and London were the Eifel Tower and a red double decker bus.Audiences don't need that insult.As a Brit, the ""Twin Towers"" shot at the end on the New York horizon totally passed me by until I read the reviews.

The last quarter of the film is a mess.A failed ""hit"" appears, then ends without explanation or reason.The real life assassination of the wrong man in Norway is omitted altogether, even though this was the catalyst for the end of the killing programme. So anxious is Spielberg to sit on the moral fence that he concentrates on the personal moral confusion of the chief assassin rather than the bigger moral picture.

Ultimately, that is what limits the film. Great drama examines Great Moral issues by using personal drama to highlight them. Spielberg has done the personal moral drama well, but just holds back from the big picture.A fine, but flawed, effort.",6
13 January 2006,Great but not a Classic,"OK, so it's from Spielberg, which means that it's above par. That being said, it's not one of his finest work, and not because it's controversial: there's something missing. I can't pinpoint it, but though the message comes through loud and clear, and the ca. three-hour affair goes down easier than a pint of Guiness, there is a tiny little something missing, which probably will preclude it from winning an Oscar or being remembered in 1000 years.

So the cast is not to blame in this one, Eric Bana is rapidly becoming one of my favorite actors, after his awesome performance in the pitiful Troy, he really delivers the goods here, so do Croze, Craig, Kassovitz and the rest of the gang. The acting is top notch. The cinematography and the story flow down smoothly, there is just nothing bad to be said. The final scene and closing picture is memorable and without letting any spoilers escape, I will just say that as I left the theater, it survived in my psyche for a good half an hour, and I am not even American.

Had this movie been made by anyone other than Spielberg, I probably would have built it up to the ceiling. Considering his body of work, and the expectations he now commands, (all to his credit), this is a satisfying effort, that could have been better. The message is well-taken and nevertheless appreciated in these troubled times. It definitely should be seen at the theaters and it probably should be bought on DVD as well.

Eric Bana (Avner) - 10/10 - Hypnotic work, this guy is scary.

Daniel Craig (Steve) - 7/10 - Decent work, it still is not too late to give up that Bond work. Mark my words, it will destroy you.

Mathieu Kassovitz (Robert) - 8/10 - Almost forgot that I was watching one of the best French directors alive.

Geoffrey Rush (Ephraim) - 8/10 - Unrecognizable, yet effective

Marie-Josée Croze (Jeanette) - 9/10 - Very nice performance. (And what a pair of breasts if I may add)

Steven Spielberg - 8/10 - Excellent by any standard, only very good for this gentleman.",
30 August 2020,Its a great movie,"Its great in a way that spielberg makes flawless movies. But not a movie that stays on your mind. I ended up watching it second time because I din remember it.

25 December 2007,A film only Steven Spielberg could do,"This one of the few good movies that came out during 2004 and is one of the best in last 5 years. Steven Spielberg is considered one of the best film makers of all time and this film certainly proves that he is. Spielberg is not the only one that shines also the actors play a major part in this film masterpiece. Eric Bana dose a absolutely superb job and also does Daniel Craig both should at least got Oscar noms but didn't. Eric plays a very good father away from his baby and the soldier how wants to get home.The story isn't that fillmler with a lot of people but don't let you from stopping yourself from watching this movie. This certainly a film that should not be missed and hoping that it becomes a classic.

19 April 2012,A black hole for Spielberg,"Steven Spielberg (in Munich) tells us the hate between Israel and the Arabs will never end...also....the hate between Israel and the Palastine people will never end. We all know that. He tells us that conflict is not a pretty thing. We all know that. He shows us that bullets kill people and bombs blow up...and are dangerous. We all know that. The movie Munich is like a black hole.....even time is destroyed. The film is too long...and not very interesting. Everything is so dark so very hopeless. We do however get a profound remark every 20 minutes or so...to keep the boredom at bay. The acting is O.K. but this is not Spielberg at his best. The plodding pace of Munich is (at times) excruciatingly tedious. Perhaps he should stick to action flicks like Jaws. Forget about the Jews ---for a while.

27 June 2006,Not Spielberg's best piece.,"While the first half of this movie is simply magnificent, and keeps your heart rate at all time high, by the end of the second half, you're ready for the film to be over. The last half of the film is slow, and boring. It really covers too much information, that we could have surmised on our own without having to be shown or told.

Spielberg always captivates audiences, and you might find that since this is also a film based on true events, it's very similar to 'Catch Me If You Can', which he filmed in 2002. Not that the stories are similar at all, but the way it's filmed, is in a lot of ways, almost exactly the same.

I was so impressed however, with the cinematography and how Spielberg was able to make it look like it was actually filmed in the 1970s.

If you don't know the story, you might get confused at times. I knew the story going into the film, and I was still confused. It's not the best Spielberg film for two reasons. That's one, and the other is that it's far too long. Like most of his films, he likes to take his time setting up the story before he gets into the actual movie, however, sometimes that's not always necessary. Sometimes, you can have a great film without going into a lot of detail. We're not reading a book here. This is a visual art form of story-telling, and so sometimes small details are not always necessary.

Eric Bana was excellent, and he resembled Christian Bale so much in this film, at times I thought it was the 'Batman' actor. All of the actors in the film were great, especially the team that's sent to assassinate the assassinators. A little bit of life's ironies are thrown into play, which also makes the film that much more realistic, as well as the times when you don't know exactly what's going to happen, to whom, or when.

There were times of pure tension, and other times of pure boredom. But, I think it works well for the most part, and I thoroughly enjoyed the film (at least the first half), and I would definitely recommend it to those who want to see what really happened in 1972-73. It's an amazing story. And, it just goes to show what people do to back their own.",7
27 January 2006,"Wanted to like it, but it had no soul","I really wanted to like this movie! It's a great subject and I thought that a movie that generates so much discussion would at least offer me something to talk about. However, it didn't live up to expectations. I think part of the problem was that Spielberg went for the straight narration of the story, with a strangely weak main character. Eric Bana was good as Avner, but didn't really portray his moral conflict well. The other characters weren't fleshed out well at all. Geoffrey Rush was quite good in his limited time on screen. Ultimately, the most powerful moments in the movie are the documentary-style opening sequence involving the terrorists and their hostages and the end sequence when you see what happens at the airport. Some powerful, gripping images here although the final scenes are cut with Eric Bana (Avner) making love to his wife, which completely didn't resonate with me at all..

The movie is gorgeously shot in the ""bleached color"" look by Janusz Kaminski. The detail from the 70's is amazing, production wise. I didn't look at the watch once, because I found the subject matter interesting but from an accomplished director like Spielberg, I expected a better movie. Strangely, I felt the same let down after seeing Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" a couple of years ago.

Ultimately, Munich could have been a masterpiece, but Spielberg wasted this opportunity. It's a shame because I think this was a great story and he could have done so much better than what we see on screen.",6
30 May 2006,The Answer to Violence is Surrender,"Munich is a fine piece of excellent acting, fine directing and first class ""progressive"" propaganda. It's worth seeing, just as long as you keep aware of what's going on.

Don't be fooled by the fact that the Director and Screenwriter are of Jewish background. The Director (Spielberg) is a notorious supporter of the dovish Israeli ""Left,"" and someone who wants to disarm the American people with the exception of government employees and his own bodyguards. The screenwriter has stated on more than one occasion that the nation of Israel should not exist.

I'm Jewish myself as well as an American Reserve officer holding the rank of Lieutenant Colonel so I guess nobody can point and claim that I'm an anti-Semite. But more than anything, I'm an American who knows what's needed for the survival of the world's democracies.

This movie is very well done and as with all well done propaganda pieces, the underlying themes are slowly revealed in the later half. These include: (A)Arab terrorists just want a little understanding. (B) Israeli's are a cold hearted bunch of efficient killers. (C) The only claim that Jews have to their biblical homeland is their ability to take it from the misunderstood Arabs (although few Arabs lived their prior to the late 1800's and they were mostly tenant farmers for Ottoman Turkish absentee landlords). (D) Finally, the most all consuming philosophy: ""Violence is never the answer to violence."" And with that last bit of nonsense, the movie ends and you are left to wonder why America fought the American Revolution, World War I, World War II, etc. You are left to ponder whether anything is really worth fighting for because everything is relative and there is neither good or bad. There is no difference between violence or responding to violence for self-defense or national survival.

How could such a well made movie make one feel so empty! Maybe because in spite of all it's violence, ""Munich"" is devoid of any sense of direction.",6
12 May 2020,Answering two criticisms,"Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's ""Munich"" seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. ""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, ""When does it ever end?""

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. ""Munich"" could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul. ""When does it ever end?"" Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",7

29 January 2006,finally Steven!,"Finally Steven Spielberg has made a grown up movie!

Provocative and controversial, never indulging in sentimentalism nor cheap shots and low blows... (like the one time he ruined his masterpiece by giving Mr.Schindler a grieving soul! - The ""I should have saved more"" Spiele!)

BUT WHAT'S UP WITH THE IMPROBABLE ROME LOCATIONS???? I was born and raised in ROME and the EVITA looking street locations really pulled me out of the picture for a moment or two. On one building I could even read signs in a language that was DEFINITELY NOT Italian.

Fire the production designer!

29 December 2005,Spielberg has lost it,"Another disappointing effort from the director of Schindlers List his last good movie. Private Ryan started fantastic then fell apart, Now, ALL of Spielbergs movies are way way too LONG,he has become a classic egoist and makes no attempt to edit his flms or make them taut. Although not as horrible as Ron Howard whose sugary pap and inability to restrain himself, and whose goody morality is really awful, Spielberg has become a ham-handed movie-maker who makes a point, and then with contempt for even the general audience, makes it over again to make sure they got it. If ever anybody is riding on his reputation it his guy. The movie fails even on the basic thriller level, the background of the agents is shallow, and though many boring minutes are spent doing nothing, explaining the reasons why these agents do what they do is lacking. That the main protagonist would be sent by the toughest agency in the free world to do what he is s ent to do is ridiculous. A really fake Hollywood agent. I can say do not see this fim except by rental at home--this doesn't even rise to the level of a good t.v. movie. Perhaps, after seeing the New World before this film, made by a master of wit,sensetivity artistry and of unitingsound music and picture and with real genius was too much and overwhelmed Spielbergs pedestrian skills.",5
6 November 2006,"A great thriller, let down by Spielberg's love of unnecessary nudity.","Munich was probably one of the best films of 2005 - though it may not have made huge box office grosses, the film itself was honest, powerful, moving, and shocking in parts, with a lot of character and humanity. All of the characters had human sides to them, and we really got to understand and feel for their struggles as the film progressed. It didn't pass on the gore, and when we see the athletes actually getting murdered about 25 minutes in, it is one of the most gruesome and heart-rending things transferred to film. Spiffing. Steven Spielberg has made this film for his religion, and to show us that we are fighting the same sort of things these days. This film was not made to make a load of money - it was made for a purpose, and served that purpose well.

Munich should have got ten stars, but once again, Steven Spielberg's love of nudity has brought him off the perfect mark. In Schindler's List, the nudity was necessary, but in this film, it really was plainly there for the purpose of letting Spielberg have bums on show once again. I've always respected Spielberg's talents as a director - nothing is too far for him. But the murder of the naked woman about two hours into the film is just disgusting - definitely not for family viewing. Avner and his wife's times in bed should not have been seen on this film, and though he was a rich, humane character, we really don't want to know what happens behind closed doors - even though his wife played quite a significant role in the story. The ending was the main problem - hugely powerful and artistic scenes intercut with shots of Avner heartily rogering his wife. Definite thumbs-down. Shame, really, as this film was top-hole - it was more than just a rubbish family film with talking animals, which frequent cinemas these days. But Steven Spielberg has to get this into his mind - the actors don't have to be ""au naturel"" to get you any Oscars and grip the audience, especially in a film like this.

I hugely enjoyed Munich, but it unfortunately isn't Spielberg's best - Saving Private Ryan is the best. And as long as he wants the whole world to see actors in the nude, his films won't be perfect in my eye. On the whole - Munich is a powerful, well-written film, that is only let down by one thing. A stunning job! 9/10",9
30 March 2006,Spielberg's plea for change,"All hail to Steven Spielberg for a change in direction, for not picking the usual Hollywooders and for taking a more political approach as opposed to the usual nostalgic and/or entertaining approach, here he takes no sides in the Israel conflict, but instead shows us the wrongdoings of both. That said, it is not brilliantly clever as some point it to be. Its good, but important things is left unsaid.

'Munich's merits as a movie however is a bit lacking. For realism, it's good and gory, too gory for my tastes. And for a three hours long movie it's quite tedious in a few places.

Salut to a big player that throw in a burning torch (at least for the average Spielberg-crowd) into the masses in difficult times. It's almost a hip thing these days.

12 June 2006,The event was a tragedy just like the movie!,"I rarely ever walk out of a movie or turn one off during the middle. I'll watch it all the way through to get at least something out of it, such as artistic value or acting quality. However while watching this movie within 35 minutes i fell asleep. I then woke up and turned it off because not only did it put me to sleep it also was ruining my slumber. The film starts off fast then goes to a dulling slow pace. The acting of the terrorists at the beginning was far from ""terrorific"" it was very unbelievable. I looked forward to watching this movie for a while when i should of looked past it all together. The main character is not the type of person you can really tolerate watching for the duration of the film, and is also not very believable. Do yourself a big favor and read about the tragedy instead of watching the tragedy that is this film.

24 October 2015,Hard hitting politics and emotionally distraught souls,"Hard hitting, from all points of view...

A difficult story wrought with the troubled past of two nations.. Spielberg has successfully brought about a film which explores a seemingly endless conflict where there are no winners.

It provides us with a political and personal overview of the darker elements of the men, women, families and children that directly endure the brutality and hostility of a fruitless heritage of unexplainable and impossible hatred...

Although the film uses the events of the Munich Olympic killings as it's theme I believe that it explores a much larger panoply of social,political and worldly behaviours... It is a reminder that we as a species are not quite ready to evolve...

3 December 2012,"Really boring. Not that the massacre of athletes should be exiting, of course.","I like most of Spielberg's movies.

He is a very good director and producer. But, it does not make all of his movies good. Sure.

Munich is not one of them... It is awful.

I knew the story, so I did not expect any mystery there. So it is supposed to be real drama. But where was it? Watching this movie made me check my watch many times. Honestly it made me feel like it was 10 hours long, that is how boring it was. Not that the massacre of athletes should be exiting, of course. It is real tragedy. And it is where you make drama.

But I would better watch Seconds from Disaster about the topic again than this Munich. As it has more to say, and, more important, it tells it BETTER than Spielberg (can you believe that!).",
12 February 2006,has much more depth than it is given credit for here,"perhaps some people need the subtleties to be made a little more obvious. rather than have the WTC towers in the distance at the end, spielberg should have done an extreme close up shot

also leave any baggage you may have at home before going to see this film. luckily for me i sit squarely on the fence, and have no admiration for either side on the subject of israel and palestine

that out the way, lets talk about the movie... firstly Bana's performance has to be given a serious amount of credit here. fantastic casting. Daniel Craig is also amazing. consider for one moment what this movie would have been like with george clooney and brad pitt as the leads, the latter would be trying every obvious trick in the book to steal scenes. Craig on the other hand thoroughly leaves Bana space to perform and yet still manages to grab your attention

the score is also tense and gripping. costume and makeup really capture the era and show Bana's gradual physical disintegration from tanned and healthy to gaunt and world weary

the film straddles the line very well avoiding favouritism for either side. israel of course comes of worse as a result... Banas team slowly become jaded and uncertain about who they are working for. this sets the stage very well for the real world developments that were to occur later on down the line with 911 and its aftermath. A number of questions are intelligently presented here if you allow yourself to be receptive to them. for example how many leaderless 'teams' have been available in recent years, open for manipulation? and what would they be capable?

Mixed with some exciting action scenes, this is a tight story and is presented with good length. Go see it.",10

28 December 2005,Munich is accurate to the bone of every Jew and Arab on the planet!,"Steven Spielberg broke out of his dry spell of horrible movies. ""Munich"" breaks through with numerous success and honors that achieve pride and joy, and much more it.

In a story that tells about the terrorist attacks on Israel and the retelling the hostage shooting (aka Black September), of the Israeli Olympic team. In retaliation, the Moussa (Israeli FBI) organizes a meeting to hunt down who was responsible for these wrongdoings, and kill them all.

Eric Bana (Avner), is the leader, and he's handed with 4 other man on a plot to kill, and a time for vengeance. In a span, they spend millions of dollars on weaponry and starting out on their spree to try and get them all.

Its a near graphic film, very disturbing, and it takes a lot in. However, its a terrific film, with lessons to learn and teachings to teach.

Who's the bad guy? Who's the good guy? That's all undetermined, but whichever it is, its your choice.

21 November 2020,When Patriotism starts to tear away the Soul...,"In the 1972 Munich Olympics, Black September Terrorist Group entered the village and took hostage & killed Israeli athletes. This film deals with the aftermath, when an Israeli Covert team was formed to assassinate the palestinian conspirators. Steven Spielberg's crazy attention to detail & frighteningly realistic kill scenes are amazing to watch. The team's slow descent to madness starts as their righteousness gets challenged, killings start to look worthless, other agencies begin to hunt them. The haunting music adds to the helplessness of the characters. It poses a very complex question, "" Does our Nation deserves Blind faith of ours when even the right thing to do starts to look wrong ?"". The abrupt ending and some parts of screenplay can be unsatisfactory. But its still a really important film made by Spielberg.

8 January 2006,One of 2005s Best Films!,"This is one of Spielberg's best films. The reason for that is simply that Spielberg addresses both sides of the issues between Israelis and Palestinians. Certainly he is pro-Israeli. But he is not anti-Palestinian. What we see in ""Munich"" that is even more convincing is how the leader of the Israeli assassination squad, Avner, played by Eric Bana, is that with every step of reciprocity that the Israeli's take, they lose something more internalizedtheir very identity is threatened to become everything that they have sought to prove and believed in. For example, in one scene, one member on the squad approaches Avner and says that he cannot go on doing this. He begins to weep. He says he doesn't even feel Jewish anymore and that the ones involved in the terrorist plot in Munich must be brought to justicenot simply murdered. As the film approaches its end, we see Avner, then living in New York City with his wife and child. After his mission, he has become extremely paranoid and feels that the Israeli Government may be trying to kill him to cover up any relationship to the assassination squad. One of the government officials played by Geoffrey Rush approached him and tells him essentially to calm down and not worrythey aren't after him. However, as their conversation goes on, Bana invites Rush's character to dinner at his home. Bana says something along the lines of, ""Well, you're a Jew. I'm a Jew. Isn't their something written in stone that I have to invite you to my home for dinner? We can break bread together."" Rush's character simply says no and walks away. You come to realize that everything they stood for has been lost in search of revenge, rather than justice. It all comes to bare on the most popular quote in the movie, given by the actress who plays Golda Meir, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values.""",10

11 February 2006,State funded International terrorism. The Movie,"What a great study of life in an international terrorist cell. Especially when you have all the funds that your government can throw at you.

Israel is worse than other states that actively encourages and sponsors Terrorism, they actually ordered the creation of the terrorist cell and their Prime Minister, Golda Meir, interviewed the terrorists personally.

No mention of the innocent Danish waiter that was murdered. Resulting in half the terrorists being arrested. Spielberg the hypocrite

This film says it all, if you want to find out about the people we should be scared of then watch.

I cannot fault the casting, actors or script. I just hope that the world looks at Israel and places them along side the other terrorist States we are all supposed to be watching so closely.",
2 October 2006,Not as good as the original,"In my view, Steven Spielberg has not done a good enough job with this film. Actually some parts are sloppily made, and the casting is by far perfect. Several actors are not suitable for the character they are portraying. Considering rather the original dramatization from 1986, titled Sword of Gideon, with Steven Bauer playing the lead role is by far better than this one. Of course there are weaknesses in that too, and this is where Spielbergs version gains momentum - through the special effects. However, the part about ""pffum-pffum"" is clearly lacking in Munich, which gives less depth to the believability of the story. Maybe a Directors cut with certain scenes shot over again could be a potential solution?

7 September 2019,Based On A Famous Event,"Supposedly a true event. I remember that. A series of assassinations of the people involved in the Munich atrocity. The acting is credible. Production values are good. Time tested. It is a personal journey through a nation's vengeance. It is the third time I am watching this.

5 January 2007,"Over-wrought, bordering on silly, vastly overrated.","Spielberg really overdid it. This movie borders on the absurd at times, and could really have been about an hour shorter. In the beginning you really have much potential, but three hours later you are left wondering what on earth the Academy saw in this movie. For a much more thought provoking and cerebral film, try Syriana. For it's faults Munich features a decent performance by Eric Bana, despite the somewhat contrived nature of his dialogue. Overall though I found myself laughing aloud at the ridiculousness of some of the scenes. Namely toward the end of the film, a sequence with Eric Bana enjoying the company of his wife interspersed with flashbacks to the events of the 1972 Olympics was utterly unbelievable, and to me, rather amusing. This movie has failed potential, and isn't worth the three hour investment of your time.

13 January 2006,America please watch this movie,"personally, i thought this movie was a true work of art and honestly it doesn't matter if the complete story is 100% accurate.

half of my family lives in the middle east in Iran. Not quite the carnage of Israel and Palestine but they have seen their share of what went on in this movie.

for me, what happens over there is way too close to home.

but for the American population, it's not close enough.

when my friend from Spain watched this movie, she called all of her friends and told them to go see it.

they are all American. none of them went.

and those are the people who need to understand.

also, i hate when people label this movie as either anti semitic or blah blah blah or even pro Israeli.

you are bringing your own personal opinions into the theater and using the movie as a vehicle to prove your point.

stop that. that's not what this movie is about.",10
14 January 2006,Assassins Have a Soul,"The one and only problem this film has is the nature of the subject matter. Any film made from a contemporary event will *always* be subject to criticism; making one that involves contentious issues such as terrorism, Israel, assassination, or intelligence agencies simply amplifies that criticism to stellar heights.

The best advice to give anyone going to see Munich would be to put your politics on the shelf while you watch. This is a VERY good film, with a VERY good performance by Eric Bana (he was so good I didn't even realize it was Eric Bana until the closing credits).

This film does what so few intrigue movies do: it puts a human face on those doing the dirty work. Most films, based on real events or not, portray all operatives as cold-blooded killers or soulless robots. The screenwriters treat these Mossad agents as real people with real fallibilities, real doubts, real strengths, and honest reactions to incredible stress and danger.

Above all, it's that last phrase that most aptly describes the power of Munich. Men are irrevocably changes by killing others, regardless of the justification. It changes one in many varied ways. Some collapse inward under the strain; some become more monstrous with every event; some become careless, as if they want to be killed in return; for every man it is different. This phenomenon, and the obsession of vengeance, are the two big themes of Munich.

Beyond this, the film is well shot, quite fitting for the setting. It's also well cast and well acted, beyond Eric Bana there are good performances all around. And the score is pretty compelling, too. Not your standard John Williams' fare.

I very much recommend this movie. 9 out of 10.

23 December 2005,Spielberg At His Best,"Munich, directed by Steven Spielberg is an act of bravery. This movie has to be the bravest he has ever done. It's about Israelian athletes who are killed by terrorists and it's theme fits very well with that is going on today.Steven Spielberg creates a compelling story here, he hasn't created the actual story by it's the way he tells it that is so effective and inspiring. This is a great movie, which I would think be the main contender for the Academy Awards. I think Steven Spielberg bounced back from War Of The Worlds and put all his emotion and feeling into Munich. Don't expect it to be a mega blockbuster because that is not it's purpose, the purpose is for you to go into the theater, watch the movie and become a new person.

2 February 2006,Politically it ticks all the right boxes. Dramatically it is somewhat wanting.,"Attacked in equal measures by some as being anti-Israeli and apologetic towards Palestinian terrorists and others as Pro-state terrorism, Munich is actually quite balanced in it's views, and despite all the controversy and hoopla it has already caused actually has a rather simple message: Acts of terrorism, on any surface, never serve a worthy cause, and will only encourage more acts of terror. Spielberg does his best to lecture us on this, but unfortunately gets lost between a standard thriller and a political lecture.

The opening of the film plays out somewhat like an unnarrated documentary, interchanging between the reconstructed hostage situation of the 1972 Olympics and old news reel footage. This actually works, but also underlines the problems with the film. Are we supposed to view this unattached or should we look at how this effects the characters, rather than the world? Most of the film appears to play out with a scene of people sitting round a table talking, then things blow up. Sit around talking, then things blow up. And so on. And yes there are very impressive set pieces, some engaging moments - the flashbacks to the 1972 hostage situation are probably the most impressive. Unfortunately the film has made some sacrifices - notably dramatic weight. Spielberg is torn between doing a glorified documentary - a la Andrew Niccol's Lord Of War - or a political thriller. And as such we never truly feel for the film, in the same way as I felt when I saw Michael Mann's The Insider (1999). What impressed me the most about that film is an incredibly convoluted story about a subject that would never lead to widespread interest actually made for a darn good thriller.

The film is too long. It does take it's time in some of it's scenes, and I was reminded of other films half the length with the same message. Once it gets going however you will be impressed. The assassination scenes are all done very well, and much like war movies show how anything involving violence can go wrong and end up accidentally killing or injuring innocent civilians. However, what bogs these scenes down is when it then cuts to other scenes of people talking about the benevolence of their actions. Sometimes it makes for interesting listening - Avnar (Bana) is talking to a Palestinian terrorist about why they fight - but other times it just feels contrived. Do assassins REALLY debate like this? And if they don't, why doesn't it help the film?

The performances are all solid. Eric Bana is particularly well cast as our protagonist. Although it did take me half the film to work out what accent Daniel Craig was actually using.

The subject of Munich is especially relevant in the wake of 9/11. It is no coincidence that the final words of the film ""Have you learnt anything?"" are spoken with the World Trade Centre glaring in the backdrop. Undoubtedly this is one of Spielberg's bravest films and it certainly isn't a bad one. It is an important film that everyone should see. No doubt this'll probably end up with a caboodle of awards - and whilst it does end up as an overlong - especially in it's denouement - slightly trite piece of work, you will walk away glad that you saw it. It is undoubtedly flawed, but still effecting and thought provoking.",7

27 May 2007,Quite surprisingly decent movie,"It took me a long time before I actually finally decided to watch this movie. I read so, so many bad reviews about it, journalists making the worse statements about Spielberg's intentions, that yes it did affect my choice. However, being way too curious, i decided to at least give it a chance and make up my own opinion. And, I am very satisfied I did, since it is an absolutely decent movie. May be because I saw it in its original version with subtitles i cannot read (there were in Finnish) I might have missed some of them. But I got to confess I found the characters credible, the movie very acted. Thanks for picking up excellent actors, not the ones you endlessly see on the screen. It made the movie so credible. I did not really feel any hatred, although there must has been a great deal of it, and I think this was the best way to approach this problematic without falling into some kind of extremism. The characters happened to be quite human, and I guess this could have happened to any of us who might have a sense of idealism, try to revenge such an awful act. An eye for eye ideology that does not lead anybody anywhere. The French character was a bit unusual, however credible. I also like the fact that the actors did not hesitate to look ""average"", i.e. normal. Thanks for not falling in that trap of selling a product for its aestheticism. What I really appreciated is that it gave me the envy to read about these events. I guess a movie is supposed to make you think and trigger some kind of interest and raise questions, it succeeded. I believe i will watch it again out of curiosity. I recommend this to anybody. It is refreshing to see that movies are not just evolving around cheap actions brainless scripts where the characters look so good with their 6 packs! Finally a daring movie that disturbs the audience! Monsieur Spielberg, thanks for shaking our minds and trigger the little sens of ""libre arbitre"" that is left in this extremely minds-cloned society of ours!",8

21 February 2006,MacCheese,"Although I admire Eric Bana and think he made a great interpretation of his role in this move, I can't help but categorize this movie as kitsch.

Spielberg should stay away from making movies about serious matters and movies that have something to do with Jews. He made Schildler's List into a pastiche. If I hadn't known Spielberg was a Jew himself I'd thought the movie to be a mockery of the Holocaust.

In the same way this movie, that is about national pride, revenge and assassinations of a bunch of bad guys, sucks.

When watching it I don't care how it goes for the ""heroes"". They seem no better than the crooks. One of the ""good"" guys says ""I only care about Jewish blood"". Seems like both sides follow the same rule: You kill our people, we'll kill yours. Both hate each other. So why should I as a viewer take sides? After Kingdom of Heaven this was the worst movie I've seen in a long while. Spielberg should instead of these ""heavy"" themes make movies a la Austin Powers and Harry Potter.

What a greasy MacCheese is to food, Spielberg is to movies.",1
30 January 2006,What a shame !,"As an Israeli, I feel ashamed of how shallow this movie is.

Many of the events described in the movie are based on a controversial book. Most of that book is imaginary. Spielberg and his writers took this book too seriously. Both sides are described negatively with no actual point to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - that deserved much better reference in the movie !

The movie is too long, the texts are absurd ! The scene described in Athens, the conversation between Avner and Ali is so shallow in depth ! The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is much more complicated than described in this movie. The attempt to make both side equally in any price- defected this movie's reliability. the texts on each side are absurd !

Most of the viewers that are not familiar with the Israeli Palestinian conflict will hold to this movie as actual truth. We tend to do so in movies - even if the movies are based on 0.1 % of truth. and for that I feel that this movie is a terrible miss to its purpose.

I feel sorry for Spielberg for dragging to this shameful movie, with amateuristic directing, amateuristic scripting and editing.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is tragic. both sides are right on their claims. both sides deserve to live side by side.

But my feeling is that this movie give in a way legitimation to the armed fight, and innocent athletes are compared to murderers !

During the movie itself - I kept asking myself - when is it going to end ?!

2 April 2007,"violence has no beginning, no end","I had put off seeing this for a long time, scared off by the length (2 hrs 40 min). But there are so many internal stories and so much to consider about the consequences of what is happening, it is really served by demanding your attention at length. The particular events surrounding Black September are incredibly rich and powerful, but the bigger impact is knowing that they are not isolated acts of honor, rebellion, and revenge, that the same conflict is fueling unimaginable suffering today, as it has for centuries. Not just in the Israeli Palestinian conflict, but in any clash where violence is answered with violence. Aside from being a great film, it is an interesting exercise to take three hours and focus on the cycle of violence that occurs with acts of terrorism and retaliation.

24 April 2013,"Bore, bored, boring","Spielberg has lost his touch for making thrillers. I found this film so boring. This could have been such a good film. Instead, it plods on at a snail's pace. A lot of the dialogue, particularly at the beginning is foreign and some of it isn't even subtitled. When Spielberg started his movie career, he was touted as the modern day Hitchcock and I would go along with that. His early films such as Jaws, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan etc were all entertaining films which held your attention to the end. Of late, he has concentrated on 'pet' projects personal to himself and a select few which have been mediocre at best at the box office. This particular film is based on real events and follows the 'work' of the Israeli Secret Service tracking down and eliminating the Arab terrorists they believe had a hand in the killing of Israeli Olympic athletes. But even this takes such a long time, you give up caring. As I said, it had the potential of being a first class film. Instead, Spielberg has made a mess.

12 May 2006,pretty hopeless of a movie from Spielberg,"Munich, or Black September has always remained a sensitive issue with all Jews. This effort by Steven Spielberg as we all know is a effort by him to redeem the events that happened some 34 years ago. The movie starts off as we know, Eric Bana son of a super secret agent is hired as a group leader to assassinate eleven people who were *supposedly* behind the Munich massacre. The group starts off, travels all over Europe eliminating targets, until they find out that they themselves have become the targets and their cover has been compromised. Then they start to fight for their own existence as their own people starts getting knocked off.

The brilliance of Spielberg is evident when he finishes off the movie in an abstract fashion. From start till the end we have seen Eric Bana bear a deep hatred for the Arabs and a national pride. Somewhat through the movie he meets up with an Arab extremist and he realizes that they are on the same boat. Both are killers just fighting on the opposite side. In the end, thats what happens. He learns that of the 11 targets he was to finish, only 1 was the mastermind, the rest else were either suspects with no real proof, or sum one who had been involved against some anti Jewish movement in the past. He realizes the nature of the world has made him to be a terrorist just like the Arabs from Black September, no different. He realizes the pain of the Jewsh athletes when they die, knowing that they cant do anything to save themselves and it was their own country that let them down rather than the Arabs assassinating them. An individual brilliance of Eric Bana, with some witty direction by Spielberg is all that you can expect from Munich. It's a thriller, but Spielberg has made better movies I can assure you.

A 7/10 !!",7
20 February 2006,Good but not flawless,"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILER* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*

This a good film but it has flaws. It has a fast rhythm(which makes its 164 minutes pass quite quickly) and yet if it would have been about 20 minutes shorter, it would have been even more effective. Some of characters are introduced and never showed up later(take for example the character of Mike Harari). The acting is good but not even. Some actors are shining above the others while some actors are merely there because the script required their presence.

Some people complain that the film is far from the true. The film has never intended to be a representation of the true but rather an interpretation for the events and as such it use the subject to say something that is as relevant today as it was relevant for the time it is dealing with. The obvious of what the film want to say is that violence leads to more violence. The less obvious is that in some point the hunter becomes the hunted, that there is always someone who will profit(making money) from all the violence, that there is a moral & personal price to pay when you kill people(even if you think that in the beginning it is for a just cause).

Go and see the film. It will make you think.",8
27 December 2005,Ignore the Critics and go see this movie,"I initially wanted to see this film but became more reluctant after continually hearing critics, editorialists, and Israeli and Palestinian officials complain about it. I saw it anyway and I'm glad I did. Everything about it was well done.

Any claims of it being (too) relativistic I think are being shortsighted about its point. The message I got was that violence and retaliation is and can be necessary and justified, but it will be ineffective at bringing a lasting peace (at least in this instance). Moreover, those that live by the sword find it hard to escape the life they've led.

But on a cinematic level, the acting and the screenplay were excellent. I knew it would be long, but it didn't feel like almost three hours.

So yeah, ignore the critics and go see this movie. If you see it as a rental at a later date though, I don't think you'll lose anything.",9

18 February 2006,"This is a semi-serious flick, but it's not a movie","This is a semi-serious flick, but it's not a movie. Why would I say that? Because the protagonists go around killing some guys in totally unprofessional manners - and I do mean totally unprofessional. Those guys you see on Discovery during ""murder nights"" are true geniuses compared to these guys. I find it hard to believe that Mosad was really that crazy and incompetent at the time - I think they used better people and smarter methods. So there. Except for one point, when the movie compares the killings of this small Jew group with the killings of all the Palestinian movement (in an attempt to... what? show us who the bad guys are?), the movie is pretty balanced from a propaganda point of view. Final conclusion: the facts portrayed are so childish and UNprofessional, that I can't take this as a serious movie, but rather as a flick.

22 December 2007,"Great film locations, but close to senseless","Munich is a thriller which depicts the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli Olympic athletes by Black September gunmen and the Israeli government's secret retaliation assassinations. Truthfully, I was pretty much lost throughout the film. I sat there wondering what is going on. The scenes move too quickly and jumped around several locations all around the world in a period of time too short, adding to the confusion. It did feel like an intelligent thriller, but the plot was way to complex for me to comprehend half of what the characters were trying to say.

On the lighter side, I loved the locations the film was holding which had the genuine retro theme in Old world landscapes. The explosions were done very well too, not to mention the great acting from Bana and Rush.

Perhaps I did not possess the intellect to appreciate this film, but this is certainly not Spielberg's work I've imagined to be, not to mention touching on a very sensitive issue. What happened to great shows like 'Empire Of The Sun' or 'The Terminal' which is appreciated by the larger audience and yet smartly written at the same time?",5

18 September 2006,What a let down.,"This is a film about a fascinating subject; it may not be true but fascinating all the same. A bit like 'The Day of the Jackal'  nothing to disprove it ever happened.

I remember watching the Olympic Games in 1972 on the television; these were my Olympic Games; I had the time to watch all the events, I had a great new colour television set and I knew a lot about the track and field events. This was the time of David Bedford the great British middle distance runner; he was breaking records for the 5000 and 10000 metres almost every week and he was set to show it to the world in the Olympic Games in Munich in 1972.

We turned the television set on one day and all hell had broken loose; we didn't understand what was going on; we couldn't understand why anybody could find something more important than the Olympic Games; why couldn't they, at least, let us see the 5000 metres final or even the 1500 metres? But it was serious; every time we watched the TV there was a hooded man standing on a balcony; the camera was fixed off and commentators all around the world spoke to their respective countries and filled time as we watched the fixed off shot.

We thought that the Olympic Games would be abandoned but it was not to be; one morning we got up and we were told it was all over; the entire Israeli team had been killed at the airport; it was reported that the Germans had opened fire on the helicopter, taking the hostages and terrorists to some destination or other, and that all on board the chopper had been killed.

They decided to cancel the Olympic Games for one day in respect for those killed and then they resumed; David Bedford, the greatest middle distance runner in Britain didn't win anything; the 5000 and 10000 metres were both won by a Finnish runner who, it was alleged doped his own blood.

So this film is supposed to fill in the blank spaces for us, the people who were transfixed to our television sets all those years ago; I'm not sure whether it does that or not or whether it just gives us the interpretation of a Mister Steven Spielberg.

It tells of the Israeli cabinet meeting deciding to send a crack assassination squad to kill the master minds behind the Munich massacre. ""We have 11 Palestinian names; each one of them had a hand in planning Munich. We want them all dead."" This could have been a riveting thriller but it isn't; it was directed by, arguably, the most successful director in movie history, written by maybe the most successful playwright living, Tony Kushner, and Eric Roth a successful screenwriter.

So what went wrong because this isn't a great film; maybe they should have contacted people from the other side? The film starts off okay but then goes into soap opera and propaganda; just look at some of the lines from the movie: ""The only blood I care about is Jewish blood."" ""We kill for our future."" ""We kill for peace."" These lines make you ask yourself what this film would have been like if made by Martin Scorsese; as it is it tries to be too many things.

It tries to be funny; for example; the bomb maker  and I'm not giving anything away and spoiling anything, doesn't make the device big enough for one killing and makes it too big for another killing  this is shot for comedy and nothing should be funny about it; one victim is shot as he carries a bag full of groceries  now why did they do that? So that he could be shot through the shopping bag and that the bag could leak of milk  you know the scene we have been watching it for years but this was shot by one of the most successful directors in the history of movies  just not good enough.

At one point the assassination squad are given a 'safe house' in Athens only to find that they are sharing it with other terrorists; there's a bizarre scene as if they are at a boy-scout jamboree and shouting out their troop names; IRA, ETTA, Bader-Meinhof; then they settle down and all sleep in the one room; this gives us an excuse for the two leaders to talk and philosophise about their beliefs with the leader, Avner, not letting on he is Jewish, of course, but the scene is a clumsy effort to educate and preach to us  the audience and we know how the relationship is going to end.

The film is also very annoying in its use of the zoom lens; I thought zooming had gone out of fashion since the seventies but no; it's just lazy and saves them using tracks and cranes.

There are some nice performances from Ciarán Hinds and Geoffrey Rush but what a let down.",4
1 April 2008,Mindblowing!,"Viewer's are advised to watch this movie carefully right from the starting. This flick is one of the most intense and realistic one I have ever seen. The quality of this production is pure Spielberg! It does not contain any unnecessary background music to thrill the audience. The way the picturisation is done it seems the viewers are themselves the characters. The actors played their roles perfectly to give it a fresher feeling. Their Israeli-accent English is impressive! Screenplay and direction is flawless. The violence, gore and blood made the viewing breathtaking. The ending may seem to be incomplete, but in every way it was acceptable.

15 September 2007,Spielberg's worst,"The story had potential and Spielberg dived into most of it. Maybe too much of it.

Great performance by Eric Bana, but the rest of the cast does nothing except Mathieu Kassovitz, who has a great scene, in one of the movie's preachy scenes. Spielberg, a master of re-creation, doesn't fail here. His interpretation of the Black September is terrifyingly real, aided by Kaminski's camera-work and Kahn's editing.

The movie runs too long. I usually don't have a problem with running time, but it tends to drag towards the middle. It's preachy also, which bored me more.

28 December 2005,a drab somewhat slow moving account,"...of what I'm sure is a good adaptation of events that occurred specifically after this horrific event. So in that sense, I'm sure our famous director deserves praise for his efforts in bringing ""Munich"" all together in realistic fashion and with no ""embroidery"" to it's content. I just found there was not enough dramatics, suspense or excitement in the aftermath plan, to hold me in my seat with anticipation of things to come. The men involved certainly wern't technical marvels nor did they appear overly confident in following through their mission..all which lost the spark for me in recreating the events. I guess one goes in to these pictures thinking the way Hollywood makes spy and intrigue movies with all it's special effects, huge dramatic action sequences twists and turns etc. etc. You won't find a lot of this in Munich...nor probably should you. It's an interpretation of events that took place after wards..and I'm sure this is realistically how it was. Just don't go in to the movie expecting a ""Black Hawk Down"" or ""Mission Impossible III"". You'll be quite disappointed. If it moved a bit quicker and, was 30 - 40 minutes shorter, I'd of given it a higher score than 5.",5
1 August 2021,"Still gripping, still relevant","No matter how its political stance has morphed in a world that's gotten more polarized and acidic over the years, the parallax view now more intense and distorted from every which side, 'Munich' still grips and enthralls. Based on the book Vengeance by George Jonas, director Steven Spielberg with writers Tony Roth and Eric Roth recreates (and at times reimagines) a searing account of the under-wraps Operation Wrath of God that the Israeli government launched against individuals involved in the assassination of 11 Israeli athletes during the 1972 Munich Olympics.

Following the ragged journey of the five men tasked to travel, track, and kill members of the Black September and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Munich's strength lies in its director's firm and tight grip across its running time, waxing between a pulse-pounding, blood-chilling suspense format and waning to a steady, claustrophobic implosion of its protagonists. The acting is top-notch-Eric Bana plays Avner Kaufman, who heads the operation, a mix-veneer performance of patriotic toughness that's increasingly darkened with the exploding stain of innocent blood and an ROI that's without redemption. His team's four volunteers from across the world: Steve (Daniel Craig, his act wired up and packed with gunpowder), a driver from South Africa, Belgian explosives expert Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz, in a warm performance and, under the circs, as likable as possible), Israeli 'cleaner' Carl (Ciarán Hinds, terrific and a scintillating highlight), and the Dutch document forger Hans (Hanns Zischler in a bow-tied paternal touch).

As the five keep trailing their targets with the help of French dobber Louis (Mathieu Amalric, so good as the dodgy, back-of-the-car slinker), Spielberg follows them using marvellous, tensile cinematography by Janusz Kaminski and an atmospheric score by John Williams, alternating between breath-taking countdowns to assassinations to troubling debates, using his five men to speak on our behalves. No one, least of Kaufman, can be as circumspect about the bloody mission as his handler Ephraim (the superb Geoffrey Rush in a gravelly, and well, circumspect performance). As the body count goes up parallel to the team's closing in on prime suspect Salameh (Mehdi Nebbou), Kaufman is forced to calculate the price the mission's extracted from his team and his persona. 'Munich' doesn't provide answers. To some, it doesn't even ask all the questions or even asks the right ones. But what it showcases is a world that's fuelled by money, sparked by religion, and torched by politics. Where peace is but a papier-mache. No matter which part of the globe you're reading this in, that's a frighteningly familiar scenario.",8

14 February 2006,"MUNICH : A Powerful Message, Packaged In A Mixed-Up Movie...","MUNICH

Steven Spielberg's latest work-of-passion is incredibly well constructed in many respects, but there's a lingering sense of ""something's missing here"" that kept me from ever feeling affected by what was going on in front of me.

In the aftermath of the 1972 Munich Olympics incident, an Israeli man named Avram (played with a heartfelt honesty by Eric Bana) is hired to lead a team of 5 men in assassinating the 11 men who had helped to organize the terrorist attacks. Avram and the men embark on their mission with a patriotic optimism, but as the time passes and the death toll increases, they all must confront what violence does to both them and also to further their countries cause.

To make a film that analyzes both the necessity and the pointlessness of violence is an incredibly ambitious topic for Steven Spielberg to cover. Adding to the difficulty is his approach of keeping every character in a grey area. There is no black & white when it comes to who the bad guy is. This is a profound angle to take, but in the end... isn't grey usually used to represent dull? By taking this middle road Spielberg succeeds in giving the film a clear message, and he succeeds in avoiding much controversy. It is a universal film that speaks to everyone with a virtually unbiased view. But he fails in creating a truly compelling 3 hour piece of cinema.

It is a long running time for a film that never allows you to become too emotionally involved with the proceedings. Even though we sympathize with Avram and some members of his team, Spielberg seems to be trying to minimize these emotional attachments. Avram's story is tragic true, but so is everyone's. While Spielberg's neutral approach seems to have emphasized and strengthened the power of his statement against violence, it weakens the film's cinematic strengths.

Casting was top notch, with a solid ensemble led by a subtle and moving Bana. It is surprising that Bana didn't break through with any kind of critical notices or awards nominations... however, in a year of such great male performances I would certainly not call him robbed. The rest of the ensemble is solid and fully realized, however, aside from Avram there aren't any performances which offer us great insight into the feelings of these characters. This seems to be the choice of Spielberg, who obviously wanted the film to be as neutral as possible. Nevertheless performances are great.

I also really loved the camera-work in the hit scenes. Every assassination attempt was paced brilliantly, evoking a great level of anxiety and frustration... just as they were supposed to. I also really appreciated the fact that Spielberg waited to show us what happened in the terrorist attack that started it all. By waiting to show the whole thing, and just revealing bits and pieces to the audience throughout... he managed to keep me questioning who was right and who was wrong the whole time.

The answer... no one. And it's the same general opinion I have of MUNICH. Spielberg was neither right or wrong in making the film the way he did. I agree with his approach of remaining neutral, but can't help finding the film to be less gripping. And though the message is clearer due to Spielberg's position, it's impact is weakened as well.

I respect it and am glad I saw it, but that's it.

28 December 2019,"Complicated, entertaining, emotional but action packed.","It was the first major public attack on Jewish people since the horrors of the holocaust. Munich captures the complex relationship which the Israeli people had with, not only the Arab nations, but even amongst themselves. At a time where the Arab spring was in the height of its transitional domination of some countries, this movie is an entertaining look into Israel's militant secret intelligence agency, the Mossad. Munich does its best to be impartial, or rather, it does its best to expose the shortcomings on both sides, but ultimately it fails to properly portray some of the more colossal failures of the Israelis retaliation attacks. Especially when showing the collateral damage and murdering of innocent citizens the agents were responsible for on foreign soil. Overall, the cast were great, Eric Bana is fantastic, but the stand out for me was the ""bomb maker"", played by Mathiue Cassovitz.

22 June 2006,An Amazing Thriller.,"Munich is close to beating the film ""Silence of the Lambs"" in the Suspense/Thriller genre.

Munich is one of the greatest films Steven Spielberg made. Steven Spielberg's greatest films since The Color Purple.

I think Eric Bana should deserve an Oscar nomination because his acting in Munich was strong and powerful.

Munich does deserve at least 2 Oscars for Best Directing and Best Screenplay for it's controversy to the Munich Olympics and the learning about Spielberg's dark side toward to this film.

One word for this picture...powerful. 10/10

20 January 2006,"""An intelligent film, by an intelligent Director.""","""The darkest day in Olympic history, September 5th, 1972."" The film is obviously about the '1972 Massacre'. For anybody who hasn't heard about this event, during the 1972 Olympics in Germany, 8 Palestinian 'Black September' members climbed into the Olympic Village before taking hostage, and eventually killing 11 Israeli athletes.

While the film centres more on the Israeli retaliation, where they hired groups to remove individuals thought to have masterminded Munich. Avner (Eric Bana) an Israeli Mossad Officer and four other men (including Daniel Craig and Ciaran Hinds) are hired to travel around Europe and 'take out' Black September members and sympathisers who may have helped plan the attack. Until eventually the hunters become the hunted.

I had mixed views before I was going to see this, because instantly I thought. Spielberg is Jewish, this film centres around Israeli/Palestinian relations, obviously it will be biased in some way or another, but I was dually surprised to find this film not taking any sides to an extreme point, just relaying the hard facts on top of an underlying deep moral message.

The opening sequence is typical Spielberg, a quick violently sequence showing you the horror of Munich and the hell the Israeli's viewed. Setting a harrowing tone for the rest of the film. While the ending is a confusing mixture of the events and a strong emotional period.

Eric Bana was a brilliant choice for the leading role. He projects his emotion into the audience as he struggles with the guilt of murder and the fact he has been turned from a father of a newborn child into a relentless perfectionist killing machine. Ciaran Hinds is also great as the emotionless 'cleaner' until the pressure of the job clearly gets through to him and his true colours are shown.

Credit also has to go to the Scriptwriting team of Tony Kushner and Eric Roth. A slick and thoughtful screenplay which gives the film an extra leg to stand on. While the most notable scenes are the ones involving the assassination attempts as perfectionism is trying to be achieved.

One thing that got to me was the running time. This film runs for around 2hrs 33mins and could've easily been edited to around 2hrs 10mins as some of the scenes add little to the overall story except for boredom and confusion.

This is an intelligent film by an intelligent director that portrays just one 'fight' in a longstanding battle between the Israeli's and Palestinians.

20 February 2006,A tale of moral complexity appropriate in our complex times.,"A lot of people are angry about the film Munich because it is too sympathetic to those they would prefer to hate. This willingness to see humanity in the face of 'the enemy' is precisely why this film is so very important. If everyone could see the humanity of those they hate, how much less violence might there be in the world? Many resist morally complex thinking. It is much easier to see the world in terms of good versus evil. Thinking in absolutes removes unsettling doubts about our place in the world. The problem is, everyone has a point of view, and when pushed to the limit of human experience, people can justify almost anything.

In such difficult times as these, when we all feel threatened and angry at those who engage in senseless violence, it is important to remember how easy it can be to descend into our most savage nature when we feel threatened. Every character in Munich is allowed to have his moment of doubt, even of horror, at the violence he or she commits. Even characters on ""the other side"" are shown having their doubts before pulling the trigger. Munich asks the question: Should we let the murderers make us into murderers? If we do, what in the end are we defending, and what will be the end of it? Munich wisely refrains from answering this question, perhaps because we are all still waiting to learn the answer.",9
12 January 2006,Spielberg's best and bravest film,"Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushner are taking a lot of criticism for speaking the truth powerfully and effectively. If this were not such a well-made movie, people who support Israeli state violence would not be so incensed by it. The movie makers have graphically portrayed the violence of both sides evenhandedly--too much so for those of us who believe that the origin of the conflict lies in the way that the state of Israel was founded and has expanded well past its UN-defined boundaries, leaving the Palestinians with no viable state.

The notions that violence breeds violence and that ""an eye for an eye will leave the whole world blind"" have rarely been portrayed so movingly.

8 April 2022,Good Story,"What I find terrific about this movie is how much it feels just like an actual '70s-style film. A friend recommended this movie to me as this is one of his favorites. I have some positive feedback on it as well. I thought the story was entertaining and kept you focused as the five men went to different countries for different targets. It was a little all over the place in terms of the setting which I really liked as it kept the story more alive.

This movie is also another based on true events - and I thought the movie delivered quite well. I honestly wasn't aware of this terrorist attack in Germany back in 1972, but I love history and the story had me learn something new. Another solid Spielberg movie.

18 February 2006,"Shocking, Violent, Involved","There is a definite message in this film and it's obvious to anyone who sees this movie and understands politics. It's important to point out that this film is ""based on real events"" and is not true-to-life as far as the history of Munich's aftermath. If you're okay with that, then it's an excellent story.

If you are planning to see an action flick, this is probably not for you. This film is emotional, complex and the characters spend a lot more time talking then they do killing. When the sequences of ""killing"" do occur, it is nothing short of shocking.

The acting is tremendous to say the least, and if you're thinking about seeing it, might I recommend a large screen and loud speakers for those sporadic sequences of action. They are very loud and very intense.

Spielberg shows his directorial expertise by using a type of film enhancement that makes it appear like ""Munich"" was shot in the 1970's, but at the same time couples it with the modern visual/special effects technology which makes some of the more violent scenes seem like we're on location with the actual assassins doing their dirty work.

As far as sex goes, there are a couple of mild scenes between the main character and his wife, of which the latter scene could've been omitted because of its bizarre connotation. Secondly, there is a scene where a woman appears in full-frontal nudity, but I will warn you it's not a sex scene.

I would have given this film a ""10"" except that there were some scenes that slowed the movie down and also the fact that I would have rather seen a more true-to-history depiction of ""Munich"".",8
21 May 2006,Spielberg misses the mark,"Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance?

A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution.

The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

2 January 2006,A misguided mess of a movie,"First, I really don't care how the mainstream or reactionary Jewish community reacts to this film, and I'm not interested in accentuating the positive in this movie, I thought the movie showed weak and/or bad faith and I'm still not clear on why this movie was made. Further, I'm indifferent to whether this movie is true to life or simply made up, I'm only interested in what the movie seems to be doing in a relatively unsubtle way. Oh yeah, I'm also a Jewish American

The main message is something we have all heard before, ""why do they make us act the way we do"" (WDTMUATWWD) everything else flows from this, although there is some small attempts at getting a Palestinian perspective, its mainly add on and clearly is not a part of the main ""tone/structure"" of the movie. Any details of the lives of the Palestinians, one is a poet/translator, another an upper class/refine man living in a fancy part Paris with his wife and daughter (who plays the piano in front of the bomb maker killer) is inundated by the personal life of the main Jewish assassin/murderer/soldier (take your pick). The audience has no real choice not to sympathize with this person because we learn so much about him and to a lesser extent, the other killers. And all, to a greater or lesser extent, seem like pretty okay people. So, even if you knew nothing about the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Munich, Sabra and Shatilla, etc, it doesn't matter, you would end up rooting for the main killer as a function of how much time we spend with them and how little with their antagonists.

Even if you think the actions necessary, what is the point of making the killers sympathetic? They have a terrible job to do, are probably pretty awful people to be in this business in the first place?. Unless, whether intended or not by the film maker, the terrible damage being done to Eric Banna's psyche falls under the rubric of WDTMUATWWD. This also dovetails with the mytho-poetic Israeli purity of arms, ""yes we kill but we kill because we have to and we kill only those we have to"", (there are variants on this, see Operation Iraqi freedom). Perhaps this damage was to be a microcosm of what is happening in Israeli society generally as a result of the occupation, this is unclear compared to the larger structures of the movie.

Too, there is a great deal of back and forth, as you might have heard, between the assassins which bolsters this myth of troubled/tragic/noble killers. And this isn't just a problem of the peculiar Israeli WDTMUATWWD syndrome, its a general settler colonial problem whereby the occupiers feelings, motivations and actions are always privileged relative to those occupied. We see this all the time in the NY Times, extensive coverage of a suicide bomb going off in a Jerusalem bus, lots of stories about those on the bus killed, (as it should be), but when it comes to Palestinians, we almost always only get numbers here , or, as in this movie, the most glancing reference to the fact that the Palestinians have lives too.

There is also something else quite troubling that occurs in the movie, the main assassin is always having PTSD flashbacks to the events that took place at the Munich Olympics, which doesn't make any sense at all from the stand point of the character, he wasn't there. A particularly troubling scene at the end of the movie has him ""flashing back"" in the middle of having sex with his wife. This is a the ""imperial we"" type of flash back, we are all meant to flash back, the killer doesn't flash back to all those he personally killed, some gruesomely, but to the seeming original sin of Munich so we don't forget the primal cause in all this mess. This is Spielberg at his didactic worst, very ham fisted.

On a lesser level, the idea of the upstanding assassin has him not going to bed with the comely hit woman at the bar, only to pass on this privilege to his comrade. (who she kills) This side story sucks, so I won't go into details, except to note that apparently the main assassin will kill with abandon yet not cheat on his wife, I suppose this is believable at some level, but it certainly feeds into the purity of arms idea of upstanding soldiers, pure in all respects.

And, believe it or not, Ehud Barak is mixed in, his execution of a leading Palestinian terrorist/activist/militant/family man, while dressed in drag is featured. Not clear what this was meant to show, but having an actual personage who was the leader of a country portrayed (accurately) as a close up, hands on assassin puts an extra spin on somewhat current events, particularly given Barak's explicitly racist statements about Palestinians.

The scenes with Golda Mier made my blood boil, a nice little housewife fighting courageously against all those who, for no apparently rational reason want to kill Jews. Again, it's a question of focus, if Palestinian leaders would have been portrayed thoughtfully mulling options then we would have a ball game, of course this doesn't happen. The recent movie Paradise Now was far better at problematizing the violence, it was short and very low budget. James Journey to Jerusalem was also much better in this respect, going to the core of current Israeli society. It's a question of focus, artistic vision and simply put, courage. The film maker somehow lost all of this and I'm really sorry for T. Kushner (who I admire and respect), but he got sucked into a misguided effort.",4

31 December 2022,Descent into hell,"Excellent film that shows us the baseness of the human being. It makes it very clear that no one is holy and we are all animals that care nothing about each other. It perfectly shows the descent into hell of those who believe they are good people.

The way that Jewish agents break all the laws of the countries is something that is not new either. It was done in many places. Even here in Argentina. It's those things that put them on the same level as what they want to fight. It's very clear in the movie. Where one can empathize (or not) with both sides at the same time.

A memorable film that every once in a while one watches again.

11 May 2006,Powerful - Spielberg's Best,"In recent years, ""Spielbergian"" has become a complaint about movies--movies that end too happily; films that focus only on the positive. But Spielberg has begun to change that, from Schindler's List to Minority Report to War of the Worlds, the director has gone darker than ever before, and we are the better for it.

Munich is the epitome of the new Spielberg. The movie pulls no punches--or explosion. It is at once a taut, exciting thriller, and an emotional, probing film that asks questions about the nature of violence, and the violent.

Historical accuracy aside, the story is mesmerizing. Tony Kushner's script is expectedly excellent, and he and Spielberg manage to create a convincing 1970's Israel and Europe.

Eric Bana gives a breakthrough performance in the movie, and he is well supported as well.

A somewhat heavy hand in the ending of the film detracts slightly from the excellent build-up to that point. In all, definitely worth seeing--and discussing afterward.",9
12 June 2022,Great but hard work.,"An all time great but hard work because it covers so many conflicting areas and portrays the contrast in such a way that, by the end, you see the ""protagonists"" as paranoid anti hero's.

I do understand the political and socio-political side of things but the story just doesn't make for a great film making experience for the viewer (reminds me very much of watching black hawk down and the exhausting experience it was when leaving the cinema at the end).

It almost seems like Spielberg is himself conflicted in what he is trying to portray and maybe that was his goal for us, as the viewer, but it doesn't transpose well on the screen from story to film.

With all those negatives it still remains a great film with great acting, great action and even more interesting intrigue. It just cant help feeling that it left me feeling a little deflated and confused (about the film rather than the history) once the end came. A solid 7 for me.",7

27 November 2021,Great Direction by Steven Spielberg with Good Performances by Entire Cast,"7 of 10 stars. Steven Spielberg delivers another piece of great Directing with Munich. Great Directing, Cinematography, Editing; great use of shadows, lighting, reflections; I think we know all know what a great student of Directing he is, along with being so influential on the many great Director's that came after him. If I were comparing him to a musician, Spielberg would be paralleled somewhere between The Beatles and Elvis Presley as he makes hits, but like The Beatles and Elvis, they are also really good songs. Scorsese would be somewhere between The Beatles and Bob Dylan. Orson Welles, somewhere between Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie; John Cassavetes, somewhere between The Legendary Little Jimmy Scott and John Coltrane. Without putting much thought into, I love that kinda stuff, those comparisons.

This Film is generally considered a Masterpiece by Film Historians, but I think it barely falls short; but it is an extremely good Film, no question.

It's amazing that Spielberg has now Directed over 30 good Films during his amazing career, which is still obviously in progress, and Film Historians would consider almost 20 of those Films to be Masterpieces, an amazing career thus far. If I talked to 100 of the most respected Film Historians in the World and asked them for their list of the best Spielberg Films, I would get a slightly different list from each of them, but here would be the likely Top 10 consensus from them: 1. Schindler's List (1993) 2. Saving Private Ryan (1998) 3. Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981) 4. Jaws (1975) 5. Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (1977) 6. Catch Me If You Can (2002) 7. E. T. (1982) 8. Bridge Of Spies (2015) 9. Jurassic Park (1993) 10. The Color Purple (1985)

Munich stars Eric Bana alongside Daniel Craig and Geoffrey Rush. All 3 of the stars put on great performances, which shouldn't be surprising at all as they are all 3 tremendous Actor's, and they deliver as expected in this Film; unquestionably believable performances without overreaching, but also leaving very little on the table. The entire supporting cast also delivers good performances, and if I had to pull out a couple among all of the good supporting cast it would be the performances by Ciaran Hinds and Michael Lonsdale, they simply put on performances in smaller but important roles that make me want to re-watch their scenes; but again, the entire cast is good, no one disappoints.",7
15 January 2006,Spielberg delivers yet another masterpiece!,"This film is truly, hands down, the greatest film of 2005. If it does not get nominated for best picture, best Director (Spielberg) and best actor (Eric Bana), I will be sorely disappointed.

I will not mention the plot in this review, because most people have a loose idea already, and if not, those people who haven't should really see it regardless of the story.

This film is one of the most profound, deep, emotionally compelling films of the decade. It haunted me for the rest of the afternoon after I left the theater and it is still leaving a huge impression on me.

Eric Bana's heavily emotional Israeli drives the movie, but of course there is excellent help from the supporting cast with the likes of Daniel Craig and Geoffrey Rush. It is beautifully shot: the action scenes will have your heart racing in each one, guaranteed.

John Williams also delivers again, creating a haunting, memorable score that is just one of the many ingredients that makes this a classic.

In conclusion, though this film can be quite violent and y at times, it is a must see for those are old enough to see it. I am an 18 year old high school senior, and this film changed my life. I would suggest for everyone, no matter what your beliefs. In my opinion, Munich should be the film to take Best Picture this year.",10

22 July 2006,Revenge As Boredom,"Did it really take 2 hours 45 minutes of watching angered Jews plan and execute murders of their perceived Palestinian enemies to tell a story about the cost of the endless suffering and bloodshed that constant attack and revenge, attack and revenge, brings to our world? Gandhi but it simply enough when he said: ""an eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind."" This well directed, well acted film still manages to be quite boring, tedious and predictable. The ending is really watered down and weak, the message would have been so much more powerful and devastating if Avner and his young family would have been murdered along with him and thus driving home what the real cost of the constant game of violence and revenge leads too. A film with a thought provoking message about revenge but never really embraces an alternative, it's overly long and misses its chance to really be daring. This could have been a very interesting exploration of the dichotomy between forgiving and seeking vengeance. It is not and doesn't come close to Spielberg's best work.

11 September 2015,Being Human,"It is Spielberg's correct decision to allow characters to supersede, or at least equate to, the story itself. Not with many films you can boast that ""no understanding of characters, no story"". This story is one of the most intriguing ones ever filmed. But the revealing quality is even superior. From the very first scene of some Olympics athletes ignorantly helping the would-be assassins to enter the compound and subsequently executed their horrific mission, we see human faces reflecting heartiness, positiveness, deep hatred, and incredible self-absorption. The following scenes are nothing but human hearts driving the film. The script by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth should be remembered as one of the best. It attempts to tell a murky and morally ambivalent story and turns it into clarity. The final conversation between Avner and Ephraim is perhaps the only one with intentional unclear message. His ""no"" to breaking bread is a simply a bureaucratic way of handling such an issue, or a deep sense of disappointment and disdain? Broadly speaking, we know which direction the Jewish Steven Spielberg would lean towards. We saw ""Schindler's List"" and his numerous interview of guilt complex as a Jew who did too little for fellow Jews. However, he daringly made this film to be an anti-hero story. A great doubt of an eye to an eye approach of life and religion is clearly exhibited. But there is nothing that the Israelis and Jews in general can complain about. On top of all that, ""Munich"" is an intensely exciting film to watch. Colourful and watchable. No dull moment. All words spoken are with a purpose. Political thrillers do not usually come out any better.",8

12 January 2006,"Munich, where acting is at top form","""Munich"" starts off showing how the massacre of 1972 started, and then it takes the viewers for a ride as it shows the men that tracked the men involved with the attack, and what their job was during this horrible time. Steven Spielberg rebounds from that mess of an action/sci-fi movie known as ""War of the Worlds."" He casts rarely seen talent Eric Bana (last in Troy) and the new James Bond Daniel Craig (Layer Cake) as two of his five mercenaries hired to take out the terrorists. The movie is slow at times, but I think Spielberg did this to let the audience get engaged with the men involved and not with just what they are doing, because both aspects are important in this film. One thing that I enjoyed in the movie was the violence. I thought maybe that he would cut down the violence to get a PG13 rating, but he kept it realistic and gritty. Bana and Craig turn in two of the better performances that I've seen from them. Geoffry Rush also does a good job as their secret boss, whose really not their boss, if you catch my drift. Spielberg leads us on a violent mission through these gentleman's lives, but slows it down a little at the end, however, I enjoyed the movie very much, and look forward to seeing it again.",8
28 February 2006,Remember the name Marie-Josee Croze,"*** This comment may contain spoilers!!!! *** Ms. Croze plays the Dutch assassin and is a standout with only a few scenes. As far as I remember she is the only female operative in the movie but in reality all sides of the various conflicts use women. Mossad uses many women operatives in the field because they are less conspicuous than men and many groups like the Symbianese Liberation Army (which was mostly female) and Red Army, PLO, IRA, CIA, Black September are packed with women. This Mossad unit however consists of five men and they seem less than professional at times - almost every one of their attempts to kill a target seems to go wrong. Eventually 2 of them commit suicide one is murdered and the head of the unit Eric Bana goes into meltdown. Although this is definitely his best performance to date - he does seem to overact at times which is why he wasn't nominated. Daniel Craig is also good and seems to keep his head about him while the others fail. Overall this is a great Spielberg movie who fully redeems himself after such duds as War of the Worlds (a remake of a remake of a remake) and especially Artificial Intelligence which was just plain awful. The script here falls flat from time to time thanks to Tony Kushner who is a very preachy playwright (witness Angels in America) - some scenes are excellent like the ones with Golda Meir and the French informant Papa but those scenes were probably written by Eric Roth. This movie does not attempt to be a history lesson since it says it is ""inspired"" by actual events. Lots of dramatic license is taken like the scene where the Mossad and the PLO share the same safehouse. Would that ever actually happen? Despite some flaws like that this is a great movie worthy to stand the test of time.",10
14 January 2006,Munich,"Stephen Spielberg has been elevated from Master Craftsman to Artist with Munich. The movie looks at the hard truth. The post 1967 war Israeli occupation of the West Bank was mentioned in the movie several times as justification by the Palestinians for the Munich debacle. Just as the Munich attack begat the Mossad operation; the Israeli occupation of the West Bank begat the Munich slaughter. This point was illustrated in the final sex scene. The same passion that produces the violence is as strong and unstoppable as a sexual encounter and will beget children fighting for the same cause as their parents. The violence will beget violence. The Israeli government bundled past grievances in the revenge operation and lied to the Mossad operatives. When Eric Bana asked Geoffrey Rush for proof that the people on the list were involved in the planning of Munich, Geoffrey gives him proof of their past involvement in other tragedies. In real life, there was at least 1 instance of completely mistaken identity.

14 February 2006,Spielberg does it again,"Steven Spielberg is the King Midas of the movie world. Everything he does is spectacular and even with the films that you may not like (i.e. war of the worlds) there is absolutely no denying the brilliance each film holds.

Munich is no exception to this. The casting was perhaps one of the highlights, as it was almost (though surely unintentionally) reminiscent of a crew from the original series of Mission:Impossible. At this point, allow me to say that by making that point i am not suggesting Munich is tacky or a popcorn film, (besides, the original series of Mission:Impossible will remain a classic), i am simply hinting that it was understandable why the film didn't win a Globe.

However, the film addresses some issues that some people may get the wrong idea of. Most prominent is the Israeli issue. I have read a fair number of reviews and certainly spoken to a fair few people that feel Munich is almost appraising of the terrorist actions. This is not the case. What the film does is highlight the appraisal the terrorists gave their own actions and how they did it (on TV) and how they seemed self-contained and perhaps 'untouchable' from any official prosecution.

This is where Avner Kaufman and his team come in. They are recruited to execute those responsible for the terrorist actions. This is the 'meat' of the story which touches new territory for Spielberg and like i said, he does not disappoint...",10
27 December 2005,good!,"A good movie. However, it will take you time to mentally digest all of it. I am still putting it all together. I had done some reading up on the Munich aftermath, so that made it a little easier to understand what was going on. It moves quickly so pay attention. The acting is great. My aunt leaned over and asked about Eric Bana, I had to explain who he was. He really shows himself to be a good actor. I thought he had been good in other things, even troy, but he is great in this movie. Geoffrey Rush is good as always, and Ciaran Hinds is good. I also thought Daniel Craig did a good job as well! The scenes between Eric and his on screen wife were also well played.

19 May 2006,Apathy,"My wife said this was too important an event to make into such a poor movie. But:

If your idea of a good movie is limited to gory special effects, chases, mumbling talk, arty photography, then leave your mind at the door and enjoy this movie. But,

If you want a movie that tells an important story in a logical manner, portraying an easy to follow course of events, then this is not your movie. These events happened more than 30 years ago and this overly long movie would be hard too follow even if a viewer had a good knowledge of those events. And,

If you want a history lesson which portrays the difference between good and evil then this is absolutely not your movie. This is political correctness run amuck.

Munich is Steven Spielberg's version of the story of the murder of 11 Israeli athletes by 11 Palestinians at the 1972 Munich Olympics, and the secret hit squad of Israelis who were assigned to track down and kill the Palestinians. In the movie a couple Palestinians give a brief discourse about the land taken from them and given to Jews to form Israel as the reason for their actions. The implication is that all points of view are equal and the Palestinians actions are justified, i.e., forget history.

Possibly Spielberg forgot some things since he made Shindler's List and Survivors of the Holocaust, i.e., Hitler and the Nazis murdered 6 million Jewish men, women, and children; the Palestinians bomb shops, pizza parlors, etc. and want to eliminate Israel; Iran is developing the A-bomb. Gathering Jews from all over Europe during WWII and putting them on trains for transport to Treblinka to be gassed was time consuming whereas a few A- bombs dropped on the nearly 6 million conveniently gathered Jews in Israel is all that is needed and is the goal of today's Hitlers.

Near the end of the movie the Israeli who headed the hit squad is very disturbed over killing 5 of the Palestinians and questions if his actions are murder. This is bizarre. What is Spielberg's purpose in asking such a question? Aren't the athlete killers and those who bomb pizza parlors and the Hitlers and the others who want to kill all Jews - men, women, and children - the murderers?

This movie is demeaning to the Israelis who fight and sacrifice their lives to protect Israel and equates them with the murderers who indiscriminately kill women and children, disturbing in that there was no public outcry over this history twisting film, and appalling because history void minds nominated Munich for Best Picture and Best Director.

Elie Wiesel is correct - Apathy is the greatest sin.",3
12 July 2020,"A truly great film, possibly Spielberg's best","Over the years, I keep coming back to this film more and more. To be sure, Spielberg's movies are expertly crafted, usually on point with all the components working like a finely tuned watch - some exceptions like Crystal Skull stand out. But this film is unique. It doesn't play with the usual themes he fixes upon. There is a soberness to it. The cast is indelible. I can't imagine anyone but Bana in the lead role. I can't imagine anyone but Geoffrey Rush in his role. Daniel Craig is surprising. The script is crisp. It reveals more on repeated viewings.

Ultimately, it is haunting. Yes, there are certain aspects to the perspective that seem more ""Jewish"" than ""Palestinian"". There are inferences to larger geopolitical positioning - Russia, the US and CIA, etc. But this is a human play, at the end of the day. It wants to be about them, not the polemics. There is a strain of paranoia that sets in, sometime in the middle. And it overtakes the characters in a way that changes them. Their fear is what we are left with. And that is what makes this film so memorable.

I'm not sure if that is what Spielberg was striving for, but it sure feels masterful.",10
28 December 2005,"Make No Mistake , This Film Is a Remake","Folks, if you shoot on down to your local video store you will find a Telefilm - miniseries shot in the 80's. The title is called ""Sword of Gideon"" and it was the first adaptation of Mr. Jonas' book. Steve Bauer (Traffic), Michael York, Robert Joy (CSI NY) Rod Stieger etc. In that version you will actually see what the Israeli intelligence system does to Avner to coerce him back into service.

I really don't know what Spielberg was trying to accomplish with this version other than maybe he feels his name will bring the story to a new generation. I believe that you are doing yourself a disservice if you see this film and do not take the time to view the original.

25 January 2006,Spielberg on a roll,"At first, Avner (Eric Bana) has few hesitations about his mission. Never mind that his wife is seven months pregnant; the men who killed 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics are animals. They respect no laws. Now is the time for Israel to show the world its strength, and Avner is honored to serve his country. Meeting his team members, he exchanges pleasantries. One is a doll-maker. The men marvel at Avner's cooking. The camaraderie is more appropriate to a fishing or hunting trip which, in a sense, it is.

Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"" is neither a paean to the Great Sacrifices required by war, nor a testament to the human spirit. Brilliant as they were in their own ways, neither ""Saving Private Ryan"" nor ""Schindler's List,"" his recent political movies, share the ruthless detachment that ""Munich"" demonstrates toward its subject matter. It's hard to argue against the savage brutality of the Munich assassinations, and it's no surprise, really, that Avner and his team relish their task of locating the architects of the raid. When they find their first target, on his way home with his groceries, the banality of the situation gives them only momentary pause. Maybe they were expecting to interrupt a wild-eyed Palestinian in the act of eating a Jewish baby, but what they find is a regular person doing errands. He's an animal, though, and must be liquidated. The same goes for the target whose little girl answers the exploding telephone before him, and for the PLO's KGB contact, who makes pleasant small talk with Avner on a hotel balcony before being incinerated in his bed. Yet Avner can't confidently say that the Arab world is awed by Israel's show of force, particularly when letter bombs start showing up at Israeli embassies across the world, and when his source provides him with a fresh target who turns out to be the successor to a man he's just killed. These people are replaced faster than they can be erased. The letter bombs are a PLO response to the assassinations, which are a response to Munich, which was a response to

Spielberg takes no sides here, impressive for a director with a tendency to wear his heart on his sleeve, particularly when it comes to portraits of his own heritage. ""Munich"" in fact seems less interested in the particular politics of the Arab-Jewish conflict than with the cyclical dynamics that propel people to fight savagery with savagery. Spielberg presents figures so fixated on breaking one another's will that they're blinded to the long view. Perhaps it's when his compatriot congratulates him on a successful hit and the birth of his daughter in the same breath that Avner begins to reconsider the wisdom of his course, or maybe it's when he realizes that the same source that finds him his targets could just as easily find him FOR his targets. As he ultimately says to his Mossad contact, though, ""there's no peace at the end of this."" Spielberg has reasserted himself in recent years with some of the leanest, most focused films of his career. With two hard-edged and one half-brilliant sci-fi pictures (""Minority Report,"" ""War of the Worlds,"" and ""A.I.,"" respectively), a coming of age story that managed to avoid pathos (""Catch Me If You Can""), and now ""Munich,"" I'm reminded why the guy is the biggest filmmaker in the history of the world. ""Munich"" is sophisticated and remarkably restrained by Spielberg standards. It doesn't profess to have The Solution to Middle East turmoil, or any number of other like conflicts, but it lays bare the folly of the strategies by which they have thus far been characterized.",9
15 August 2018,Too formulaic,"This film is a very good, insightful and interesting look at the aftermath of the 1972 Munich Olympics. It is informative, but does not really say anything interesting or move the viewer in the way that other films do, such as Schindlers List. The film has a very rigid narrative structure; the assassins identify a target, kill the target and then continue until they have got everyone. It is very repetitive and boring. It does not have enough to earn its almost three hour runtime. All in all, its an okay film - interseting, yet uncreative and uninspiring. 6/10

15 March 2007,"Very well done, with only minor flaws","I can almost forgive Spielberg for the waste of War of the Worlds. I would say the only flaws I see may be due to the source material. i don't know because I have not read the book. I know it is politically correct to feel bad about killing people, even if you'r'e an assassin, but hearing them whine about it all the time was pretty annoying. And the way Avner reacted to Israelis when it was over. Why would he be so upset with everyone? Why in the world would he accuse them of trying to kill him? I guess the point of the story is that if you go around killing people, and you didn't start out crazy, you'll go crazy. I guess, but that isn't exactly a universally significant insight. By the end, I got so tired of this aspect that I truly cannot even remember how it ended.

17 October 2021,Quite Unique,"Munich is a unique film that differs from the standard film format. This is what makes it memorable. It is, however, too long, especially in the final third. It also contains many strange directorial problems. For example, the close up and fast approaching armored personnel carriers (70 meters) at the beginning of the hostage slaughter scene. They would have to be there in the middle of the scene! Or the weird delay between the explosion and the breaking of the window glass. The execution of the Palestinian by Uzi fire looks comical, where the reflected bullets would have hit another team member. I don't know why Spielberg left them in. The nonsencical and unlikely psychotic breakdown of the team members harms the movie the most.

4 January 2006,"Let it go Spielberg, please!!!!!","A self serving and violent film not worth the effort. Much too long and much too violent. It's time to let it go Spielberg. Develop some different subject matter, it's all been said!!!! The implied notion that the United States interfered with Isreal's pursuit of these people was misguided and lame. At the end of Shindlers's List we saw how many people were saved,when this film ends the focus is on how many people died. I think the only lesson to be learned from this film is that sometimes things beyond our control happen and we can't waste our time fighting things that will never change. Much like our own 911 incident, it's time to move on.

13 January 2006,Excellent,"This was one of the most thought provoking movies I have seen in a long time. Spielberg makes us feel uneasy with his ambiguity. That is the point -- there are no easy answers and he is not going to give any. The interesting thing is that the critics of this movie have focused on the politics and not on the movie craft. People take for granted that Spielberg is going to turn out a quality movie. That in itself speaks volumes. The acting and camera work are superb. I especially like Lynn Cohen as Golda -- very convincing. Eric Baena and Jeffrey Rush are great and the the actress who plays his wife is wonderful. The sex scene at the end may have been a bit heavy handed, but not in a distracting way. This movie is a must see.

27 September 2006,Almost Complete Remake!,"This film is a typical victim of the modern hype Hollywood uses. While professionally shot, well-acted, and all the rest, it is at end merely a remake of an earlier flick on the same subject! The first movie, starring Michael York and others, is a little brighter than this one, but for all Spielberg's vaunted talent, the latter is more or less an episode-by-episode remake of the first.

No real insights, new vision, etc. I found the remake disappointing as a consequence, and more than a little pretentious.

What further bothers is the shamelessness of the plagiarism. He could just as well imitated Rossini when pressed to compose an opera in a short period: take an old one--the Michael York version, in this case, and appended a wimpy there-is-no-right-or-wrong message at the end.

29 December 2005,"""I prefer the world's criticism rather than their condolences""","Steven Spielberg's brings to the screen not only a difficult episode but also a reminder to all, that terrorists will kill anyone anywhere in order to obtain a platform from where they can justify their acts of insanity. The murders of innocent Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic games could have been avoided if the German authorities honored the request of the Israeli Government to rescue their own citizens. The hosting German Government did not even have a S.W.A.T team or even so much as a team of police sharp shooters as part of their police force. How could the German hosts think that they would be able to handle such an act of madness brought on by Black September? Golda Meir put it simply when it came to the security of Israel and its citizens, she stated ""I prefer the world's criticism rather than their condolences"" Enter the Mossad and it's ability to deal with terrorism anywhere in the world. Spielberg's direction of the film is fast paced and thought provoking. Those know and unknown actors bring you to the edge of your seat. I can only comment that the Mossad's handling of those that were sought for there involvement in the Munich massacre were dealt with less confusion than depicted in the movie. Mossad's in a sense was depicted as having handled the hostile targets as a group of Keystone Cops, how far from the truth. Why the Mossad was presented in such a manner is baffling. (Menachem)",9
16 April 2006,This is one gruesome and haunting political thriller.,"Munich follows the story of the 1972 assassination at the Olympic games in Munich, Germany. A group of 11 Israeli athletes was kidnapped and murdered by a group of Palestinians, known as Black September. The Israeli intelligence agency Mossad was determined to find and eliminate the people who executed the attack Therefore Mossad sent five men who were all trained professionals for specific fields, erased their entire data and provided them with large funds. Their mission was to find the members of Black September on the territory of Western Europe and eliminate them one by one.

The film is specifically marked by Spielberg's precise handling and direction. Using long shots, slow zooms and other techniques he intentionally made it look like it was made in the 1970's. The set-design really deepens the sense of being there at that time and place in Europe. As we follow the group of five men, they shortly tracked down and murdered the first one of their targets. Every time they search for someone they move to a new location. They're paying large amounts of money to a source named Louie who provides them with precise info about the identities and whereabouts of their targets. But despite the incredible accuracy of their source, certain members of the group are becoming more and more paranoid and start to doubt about the justification of their mission. Particularly the group's leader, Avner. His head is becoming fuller with horrible images and even fictions about what really happened to the Israeli hostages on that faithful day.

There are at least three parts of the film I would like to stress out. First is the incredible throat-grabbing paranoia that is rising within the group. The danger of their work becomes evident when it's clear that their as much of an easy target as their victims are. The second stress would be about the gruesome and uncompromising graphic depiction of violence. It made me feel repulsive but simultaneously related to the guilt in Avner's head. The third thing that deserves a point out is the performing of all the characters which stays sober and never goes off the tracks to the very end. One thing is also interesting, it's how Avner is unable to recognize himself with the consequences of the mission. Facts just don't matter to him, rationalizing doesn't do him any good. He simply finds no legitimate reason for what he's done. To me this makes Munich a more or less unbiased statement about the events that it described. Besides Brokeback Mountain this is easily the most touching, haunting and quality film I've seen to come out of 2005 (so far).

25 June 2006,This might contain a spoiler or two?,"I attempted to watch this movie to gain insight into the work of the Israelis after the Munich massacre. The entire movie could have been condensed to 90 minutes without losing anything. Actually it could have been reduced down to 9 minutes without losing anything. Scenes drag by filled with unnecessary ""footage"" and dialog. The movie is told from the viewpoint of a ""weak sister"" who found that killing was great fun, but then developed a conscience. There is always a whiny-ass in every group. This movie is about a war, unconventional to say the least, but still a war. The participants are merely soldiers in that war. It they turn into gutless wonders after they have been in battle, that does not change the fact that others war fighters do their job and can still function in this world.

I can't help but wonder what Spielberg's ""needs"" are to show a scene with a man having sex with his pregnant wife, or later practically raping her as he has flashbacks of something that he did not witness? Come on people, how can he have flashbacks of things he was not a party to... I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

3 January 2006,Best movie I wish I never saw.,"Hello Moviegoers, Munich blew me away, and I think knowing it was a reflection of real events is what made it so devastating, I couldn't go to dinner afterwards.

On one level it's just a thriller with a historical thread, but as with so many war movies of the last fifteen years, the degree of realism is so intense.

Eric Bana, who was Hector in Troy, is the Israeli agent tasked with killing eleven of the men who planned the massacre at Munich. He approaches it with a soldiers cold intent, but as the assassinations proceed the murkiness of his assignment and the cold bloodedness of the killings begin to take their toll on him.

This is a stunningly well done movie exploring the nature of humanity and it's political institutions. We don't come off so good. But Reality is a bitch and pretending it ain't so won't do us any good either. Munich, We have met the enemy and it is us.

This is K-PYG 94.5FM",10
8 June 2006,"terror cannot be a solution to terror--just say that and then shut up, Steven","Munich was pretty good. I don't have too much to say about the movie itself. What I will say is that I was happy to see it go beyond a revenge thriller, and I wasn't surprised that it did. Spielberg is a good director--he's very popular, and that can sometimes make movie critics and movie lovers assume that he's a sellout or whatever, but I think Spielberg is something like Hitchcock (I'm not saying that he's as good as Hitchcock, as I'm quite convinced that he's NOT): he's a good director who knows how to make audiences happy while, at the same time, producing some good cinematic art. This movie took its time, which I was thrilled to see, and in so doing it let us feel the discomfort that its protagonist felt--the array of emotions from grief and vengeance to hesitation and regret that go into a human being who's signed on to do some incredible inhuman things to other human beings. I recommend seeing this movie--it raises questions that politicians today have trouble raising without being blasted as unpatriotic or as terrorist sympathizers or whatever.

What I do want to mention, though, is the introduction that Spielberg opted to append to the beginning of the DVD version of this film. It's disappointing at best, and spinelessly cowardly at worst. I suggest that, if you have not yet seen the movie and plan to, you should skip Spielberg's intro and go straight on to the movie. You can always check out the intro afterward. You see, I tend to like artists best when they do their art and then shut up. I don't love when artists offer their own interpretation of their work, and I especially don't like it when artists engage in defenses of their work in response to criticism (either aesthetic or ideological). In the introduction to Munich, Spielberg rushes to defend himself from two charges--one: criticism of Israel, and two: advocacy of non-response to terrorism. His comments really angered me for a number of reasons. First of all, he made the movie, it raises good questions, and no intelligent viewer could possibly think that Steven Spielberg was making a movie that slammed Israel. The movie is too obviously a question, not an answer. As for non-response, I feel sick that Spielberg should make this fairly nuanced film, and then, in this gutless introductory apologetic, contribute to the black or white illogical that has framed the debate about the war on terror, as if violence and nothing are the only alternatives we have when choosing to respond to terrorist tactics. It burns me up to see a filmmaker make a complex movie and then almost take it back by issuing one-dimensional, wheedling commentary on his own fine film It's especially angering because he's so clearly responding to ideological criticism, not aesthetic criticism. I'd be less emotional in my response if he was defending his film-making or choice of cinematographer or editing, or whatever, but he's clearly defending his politics. ""No, no, no everybody, I love Israel. And of course we have to fight the war on terror, I mean, duh."" Give me a break. This is even worse that Francis Ford Coppola using his audio commentary on GFIII to defend his decision to use his talentless daughter to play Mary Corleone (talentless as an actor, anyway--my jury's still out on her skill as a director).

Munich is right to suggest that violence begets violence, and when both sides (as if there are only two sides, which is another fallacy) of a violent conflict are willing to fight for hundreds of years and countless generations of children, violence is the only tactic guaranteed NOT to solve the problem. He had the courage to make a movie that articulated that message, and I just wish he had the courage to let that message be and not back down in the face of (probably Zionist) criticism.

Bottom line: see the film, disregard the DVD intro by SS.",8
4 September 2006,A good movie but not a great movie,"The most important thing about this movie is its central message, that revenge is a circle. It is also particularly important to focus this message on middle east conflict, because as everyone knows, the rest of the world is constantly drawn into this cycle of violence. I think Spielberg has done a noble thing in going after this issue.

Also important is the criticism Spielberg makes of governments. I believe that a government should never compromise its ethics, no matter what the cause. Sadly, reality has shown us that our governments can be just as evil as the terrorists. If we become our enemy to fight them then what are we fighting for? When this happens there are no good guys, and the conflict becomes pointless.

However, the implementation of this film leaves something to be desired. I believe the violence and gore was excessive. In fact, the scene with the woman having blood squirting in a nice clean stream out of her chest was really not necessary.

Some might argue that this was realism. Of course, it might have also been realistic to have her fall backwards onto a jagged board and have her beating heart speared like an olive and spraying the whole room. Maybe we could have seen her hungry cat snacking on her liver several days later. No one could say that it probably wouldn't happen.

It appears that those in Hollywood have decided that an affective way to stimulate movie goers is to show them shocking violence. Of course, they are right, it does stimulate the mind in a primitive way. However, it is also an easy, lazy minded way to stimulate us. Much easier than actually telling a good story, making us think, or inviting us to a different reality for a couple of hours.

My other criticism of this movie, is that it moved from assassination to assassination quite linearly, and monotonously. It was like watching a long train go by and trying to read the writing on every car. After about the third one, I was loosing interest. A couple of shots of newspaper front pages for some of the killings would have been more efficient, and would have saved them a ton of money, and made the movie better.

Overall, the acting was pretty good.",7
3 January 2006,see it before you judge it,"Unlike some recent films that found themselves surrounded amongst controversy, Steven Spielberg's new film Munich does not cripple itself with a naive message or manipulative film making.

Rushed into production earlier this year, Munich could have been full of all the hallmarks of lazy film-making. Yet it shows thought, care, and passion.

As a film it is able to capture the feel of the 1970's very well. Both from the clothes to the look to the feel, this is a film that never becomes a cheap modern reconstruction. Spielberg even uses 1970's cinematic techniques, such as a frequent use of zooms, to recreate a time not so long past.

As a historical thriller this is a very modern film dealing with very modern issues. One person I saw it with was disgusted, calling it ""an awful piece of Palestinian propaganda."" Munich cuts to the nerve.

This is exactly why it is such a towering success, especially since it is a Steven Spielberg film. Spielberg often imbues his films with mega happy endings that wrap everything into a nice little bow. Just look at the conclusion from his War of the Worlds adaptation earlier this summer.

However, while Munich begins with the 1972 murder of the Israeli Olympic team and then follows the reaction afterwords (some of it of course fiction or speculation), the film ultimately transcends the entire Israeli Palestine conflict to reflect on the entire culture of terrorism begun with the Munich murders that has affected our world of today so deeply.

One thing that can often cripple ""message"" films like this is that they end with an overly simplistic message that can be summed up in a single sentence. Often times a film can become too much about the message and not enough about the characters, as well.

Thankfully, Munich has more to say than ""all violence is bad,"" or ""revenge makes us as bad as the people we are going after."" It also creates characters that are more than cardboard cutouts to be pushed through a story.

Munich never tries to justify the killing of the Israeli Olympic members, either, nor does it compare the murder of the Israeli athletes to the retribution of the people part of it. In both cases blood is spilt, but it is not the same.

Rather it examines the human side of such acts, observing how something that begins as a noble act of justice can quickly spiral out of control. Ironically, but sadly, often what is being fought for is quickly forgotten in the process of fighting.

In the last shot, a pan revealing the World Trade Center sitting quietly shrouded in the fog of distance, Munich borders on becoming a preachy indictment of modern America.

The last haunting line tempers this, though, as it does not condemn as a Michael Moore film might but rather suggests, offering something for those who know much about the Munich massacre, and for those who know nothing.

Most importantly, Munich is a human story that takes all these big issues and brings them to a personal level. Sometimes in the chaos of conflict we lose sight that what we are seeing is happening to people, and being done by people, and that you cannot examine any situation without looking at the people part of it and affected by it.

This does not mean that as a film Munich never stumbles, for it does. At points the hurried production time does rear its ugly head as certain scenes become muddled in unnecessary complexity. The main character of Avner, played by Eric Bana, could have had a bit better of an introduction to fully show his motives and the toll his job takes on his family.

There is also a perplexing and almost amusing montage near the end at a very important moment that drowns itself in murky pretension.

However, these small flaws hardly affect a film that is much more than simple ""Palestinian propaganda,"" or any propaganda for that matter. In fact, the very backbone of Munich encourages individual reflection rather than blind acceptance of an ideology or moral standard.

Critic's Conclusion: Munich reaches no absolutes because there can be no absolutes with such multi-faceted issues. It is this surprising complexity from Spielberg that makes this one of his best and most mature films to date, and a film that will bring him much controversy from those looking for a black and white conflict that is never portrayed.",8
6 January 2006,way way way too long,"Parts of this Movie were great, part terribly boring. I was put off by all the killing, but because I had no real connection to any of the characters. It was lost on me. It was like watching the news. There are deaths every day, but without a personal connection, empathy was all I could muster. I think Eric Bana did a good job with what he was giving, but was actually sad I went to the theatre to see it. I would have enjoyed it better at home on DVD, so I could pause at some point to PEE. If this were a docu-drama by some first timer, it would have been o.k. But fell way short of my expectations. I wasn't old enough to witness the actual events, or hear about them on T.V. The first 15 minutes or so, I had absolutely no idea what was going on. The heart of this movie could have been completed in a 30 second p.s.a. Definitely check it out on video, it is a movie worth watching. Hopefully the DVD will include some documentaries on what happened. I wasn't alive for WWll either, but would watch Schindler's list over and over again. This movie left me a little cold.

10 February 2006,Disappointment,"As his other movies, it's a disappointment. The idea was good, the story was supposedly good, but it's too American. I don't exactly know how to explain it but that's the impression I get. Israel made a nice movie on such a theme, of course without the unnecessary drama we find in American TV or movies.

I saw some people who give good comments are more attached to the history of the occasion in that particular Olympics--which of course is something we sympathise in. But don't forget we're assessing THE MOVIE here.

But then, Spielberg hasn't made a nice one for a while anyway. What long hours of disappointment. I'd prefer Tiny Toons.

I've got it we'll combine the 2 a union organizer trying to form the Teamsters Union on Mosses march out of Egypt and paint Mosses as a non- caring self absorbed race baiter. Come on Alec Baldwin needs work and we Haven't heard from Barbara Streisand this year either.

2 February 2006,Eric Bana Oscar Worthy,"I have now seen all five of the 'best movie' and 'best actor' category movies for the Oscars. It is my belief that Eric Bana should have been at least nominated for a best actor spot, if not actually receive the award. In my opinion, his performance was outstanding. To me, a good actor is able to make you forget you're watching him/her as a person. Russell Crowe's performance in The Insider is a good example of this (I think he should have won for that performance instead of Gladiator). Eric Bana also pulled off the same difficult feat and I applaud him. As much as I respect Phillip Seymour Hoffman as an actor, I don't believe his performance as Truman Capote was much of a stretch for him. His mannerisms as Capote have been reflected in some of his other performances and I was constantly reminded that I was watching Phillip, not a convincing portrayal of Capote. The only challenge for him would be his voice alteration since his natural voice is much deeper than Capote's. I believe that Eric Bana should have been nominated instead of Phillip this time around because I forgot I was watching a pretty boy actor from the movie Troy and was watching a man who wrestled with himself; relishing his vengeance, justifying his actions, and finally realizing the vicious cycle he was perpetuating and acknowledging his betrayal to his own moral standards.",
18 July 2008,"Typical Spielberg, for Better and for Worse","On the plus side, the cinematography is as good as it gets. Spielberg is an undoubted master of the field and as a lover of cinema, I regard him as one of the truly great exponents, a genius. On the downside, his stories tend to feature a cloying sentimentality (AI, Saving Private Ryan etc) and this aspect inevitably detracts (at best) or ruins (at worst) the overall experience. And so with Munich, we get the standard Spielberg package. I strongly feel that if a movie is to feature a series of historical events, particularly a recent tragedy such as the events portrayed in this film, then it should be factually accurate and this film is not. There is no mention of the innocent waiter who was murdered by the Israeli squad as a result of mistaken identity for example. Now I'm not trying to make a political point here. As far as I am concerned, those responsible for the murder (that word again which I use intentionally) of the Israelis at Munich (or the murderers of innocent unarmed civilians in any circumstances) deserve everything they get. The suggestion that a series of unlikely methods of killing the perpetrators was used  exploding beds and so forth  each different from the previous, is complete fiction. Without wishing to sound too pedantic, the danger with this approach is that many people believe that what they are watching on the screen is fact. One IMDb reviewer comments that 'Spielberg gives us one hell of a history lesson'. He does not. Overall then, a decent action thriller, no more and no less.",6
7 January 2006,Sword of Gideon Remake,"This movie is almost an exact remake of ""The Sword of Gideon."" The Sword Of Gideon (1986) documents Israel's subsequent counteractions against the perpetrators of Munich. Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jonas, this classic features a top notch cast (Stephen Bauer, Michael York, Rod Steiger, Colleen Dewhurst, et.al.).

""Munich"" follows The Sword Of Gideon in almost every way. In fact, short of the last scene depicting the World Trade Center to help bring home the message that violence only begets more violence, it is difficult to see what Spielberg changed to make Munich ""new."" Munich is a good movie, but I felt that I had seen each scene before.

19 May 2007,Boring,"This film never becomes interesting enough, nor riveting to justify the term 'Thriller'. A thriller is supposed to be entertaining, but this is far from that. I began to think it might shed some light, in a documentary way on a complex situation, but it merely confused and even raised questions about historical accuracy. I was never quite sure if it was trying to tell a real story about real people or not. The acting was generally very good, but the whole thing was confusing from the start, and overly long. I was not impressed by any of the set scenes,somehow it never quite got into gear. There is something unsatisfying about a film where you cannot feel comfortable with the characters, where you are not sure if to like them or not. The overall impression I got was a message that said, nothing changes, Israel brings about its own troubles. Glad I did not pay to see it.

24 May 2021,Thrilling and Tense,"This is 2hr and 45 mins and not a minute too long. It was captivating from start to finish. Eric Bana at his best and a supporting cast that shines. Tense and emotion driven spy drama that outshines many others in the genre. It would hold its own as fictional, but this non-fiction retelling of this forgotten event is always relevant and was nearly flawless in execution.

Many reviewers will attempt to give the film a 1 star review based on their own political alignments/ideology. However, facts are facts. This was a retaliatory event in response to a terror attack. Whether you agree with the way in which retaliation was carried out, this film is close to a masterpiece on how it portrays dualism and the feeing of guilt weighed against duty.

10 January 2006,"Woe be the third act (spoilers, kind of)","I may be one of the few, but MUNICH shares more similarity to Spielberg's worst film (in my opinion) THE TERMINAL than it does to the MUNICH-compared films SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and SCHINDLER'S LIST. MUNICH starts as strong as any film this year, with a sequence that illuminates the historical realities of the 1970's; Americans (supposedly Olympic athletes) help the terrorists get over a fence into the Olympic compound. It's a possibly un-aware reference to America's bumbling foreign policy of ""helping"" other countries out.

Anyway, the action picks up quickly and major players are introduced in classic Spielbergian ease. The film may be ambiguous in its politics, but it's precise in its dialogue and character setups. Everyone has their dye cast early on, so you can see their developments ahead without giving away too much. What follows the fractured sequence involving the hostage crisis is a swiftly paced action story about the Mossad hit-squad put out on the terrorist's tails. As the assassins begin to see the humanity in their targets, the film begins to lose its way, until eventually the weight of Eric Bana's guilt derails the film into its frustratingly imprecise third act.

The film is gaining praise around the world for its daring stance on an epic, historical struggle between the Jews and Islam. But where the film does attempt a more balanced look at the struggle, it misses its mark trying to defend its three hours, finished with a too-long ""you can't go home again"" sequence.

It's a noble effort, perhaps, but certainly far from the best Spielberg has done. Perhaps he was so aware at how controversial the film would be for its subject he never scrutinized its narrative arc. What starts as an action movie with a conscience ends with a boring denouement for Bana's Hero of Israel. He realizes he may have enjoyed killing just a bit too much. This has been done before in better films. I'm a huge Spielberg fan, but I won't defend this as greater than a 7, an earnest attempt but it misses its mark.",7

9 August 2006,""" home"" . a sacred word.","I kept postponing viewing this movie. Don't know why, just a feeling. And today seemed like the right time to see it. or maybe I was on ""thinking mode""... To be honest, I didn't expect to much. Actually, I didn't expect anything. But I was impressed. Spielberg redeemed himself. I almost forgive him for War of the Worlds.

""Munich"" is a well-written, well-acted, well-cinematographed, well-made movie. It's a story about history, politics, manipulation, human feelings , the definition of ""home""... ""home"" a sacred word. yet defending one's home means sometimes loosing one's humanity. and one's home means other's exile...

as for the Israeli-Arab conflict...it will never stop. but that's a different story, which belongs elsewhere.

the message is simple, though : violence will only generate more violence.",8
26 March 2006,is comment 536 worth anything?,"As an ex-American living in Israel for the past 34 years, I would like to add my personal perspective to Munich. By my standards, it's a good film in that it is not only well made technically, but very thought provoking and engaging on an emotional level. I was not bothered by the fact that it took many liberties with historical fact, since it makes no claim to be a documentary. However, two major flaws caused me a certain level of discomfort. Why portray the Israel Mossad team as mostly non-Israel and extremely amateurish? Since this was so obviously and extremely far fetched, was there a some artistic point and if so what? Secondly and far more disturbing, why was revenge or punishment of the terrorists the only and constant driving motivation given for Israel's response,when the known and obvious factor of self-defense in an on-going war for survival was and still is the operative element in trying to prevent more terror from those who have declared their intentions openly and publicly. When all is said and done, there really are two sides to every conflict. This film may have somehow,and maybe even admirably, attempted to be somewhat even-handed. Maybe that's why others could find more to like in it than either an Israeli or a Palestinean. We, who are still embroiled daily in this on-going, tragic, and complicated conflict need much more than a decent piece of entertainment to help us struggle toward a just and viable solution. So...good movie,yes...but impossible for those who are here, living the reality to really appreciate and find much value in.",7
27 January 2006,Excellent,"""It's strange to think of one's self as an assassin"". The quote that stirred me in the theatrical trailer of ""Munich"", and the dialogue that stuck with me every step of the way today when I sat down to watch Spielberg's latest venture into cinema. Where does one even begin todiscuss a film that has created endless discussion before it's generalrelease? Simply in the same way Spielberg handled the material when he set out to make such a complicated film, ""With careful hands"". In a film that follows a team of Jewish assassins requested, to retaliate against Palestinian terrorists after the events of the Munich Olympics, there is nothing but pure cinematic tension from beginning. However difficult it is to begin watching this film, without your own personal views on the bitter conflict resurfacing from time to time, you can't look away from the dilemma on screen, or reframe from feeling nothing but sympathy for both parties. The violence within the film, although you are perfectly aware is just around the corner, hits you creating a pumping after effect and never fully allows you to recover. Spielberg tops scene after scene with his handling of dramatic materiel, and while the cause for conflict slowly disintegrates as the film progresses, we are left with nothing but remorse for the violence that never seems to end. The acting is spectacular with stand out performances from Eric Bana to Geoffrey Rush. While Spielberg is renown for his ability to bring out the most within his actors, it still to this day dazzles me how well this filmmaker can dabble in the different genres and still bring, living, breathing characters to the screen. While most of us will do our up most to enter the theatre with strong feelings determined to tackle this film, it's hard to walk out not feeling that you got a taste for this films endless pain and awakening perspective. Those determined enough to sit down to it, will be inflicted with the endless discussions that are presented before them. This is important storytelling for our era that will live with you hours and maybe even days after your first viewing. Without doubt Munich is Spielberg's bravest film to date, that requires only one sitting to grasp how upsetting violence and revenge really is, how it's ability to corrupt what appears to be the most noblest of intentions, and how the darkest part of mans soul can easily live with it.",9
17 February 2006,Spielberg Back On Track,"After the disappointment of War of The Worlds, let down by some hammy acting and a weak storyline, Munich goes a long way towards restoring Spielberg's reputation. Based on Mossad's response to the siege and killing of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics, this is a near flawless piece.

The storyline is excellent, relying heavily on family/nation imagery throughout, from when Avner meets Golda Meir, the Israeli Prime Minister who remembers his father and comments on his wife's pregnancy, to Avner being disenfranchised from Mossad and missing out on the upbringing of his daughter.

The acting performances bring together some quality actors, such as Ciaran Hinds, Daniel Craig, the legendary Michel Lonsdale and the ever consistent Geoffrey Rush. Although he does not have the same reputation, Eric Bana's performance as an assassin and family man is excellent. Ruthless in his duty, his softer side comes to the fore when he hears his daughter's first words over the phone, arguably the most heart wrenching scene in the film.

But what is most impressive is the attention to detail to what is a period piece. The mixture of original ABC archive footage with reconstruction of the siege is eerily accurate. The scenes of all of the locations is truly a step back to the 70s, even down to the inclusion of the World Trade Centre in New York.

At 2 and a half hours, this one long film. But the drama is so unrelenting that the time whizzes by. And for such a violent film, the futility of violence is given considerable emphasis. Spielberg can take pride in this piece of work. He'll now have a hell of a job on his hands to follow this up. But if Munich wins the Best Picture Oscar, will he care?",8
8 February 2007,Great film!,"A lot of people are in denial of Israeli terror. The Stern gang, the Mossad to name a couple.

It was good to see that Spielburg would make such a film. The truth will come out. Great acting. When the beautiful Dutch girl gets killed I could almost feel the bullet myself. The was she dies is sensational. The truth is that Israel targeted relatives of those that died trying to free Palestinians incarcerated in Israeli jails.

Does anyone find this to be horrible?

I highly recommend this film. Please do something to bring peace and justice to the Palestinian people.

6 March 2006,"""Murder, Mayhem, Morbid Revenge, and Munich""","Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"" is a vengeful and bloody recreation of the massacre of eleven Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany and the subsequent retaliation by the Mossad, the Israeli secret service agency, in response to a day that will forever live in infamy; this day is known as ""Black September"", September 5, 1972.

Spielberg does a fine job presenting the factual aspects of the movie. Although many might disagree, I don't believe that Spielberg ever takes sides between the Israelis and Palestinians. However the problem with Spielberg's interpretation of this infamous and historic event is that he dwells too much on -in fact almost totally on- the revenge killings by members of the Israeli Mossad in response to the Palestinian terrorism and the gory details instead of telling us more about the Arab-Israeli conflict as a whole, and the events leading up to Munich. These events include the 1948 Israeli War for independence and the six day war of 1967 in which Israel captured the West Bank and the Gaza Strip from Jordan, the real Palestinian homeland. Also not brought to the forefront in this movie was the Aftermath of Munich and how it has affected Arab/ Israeli relations today- almost thirty five years later.

Spielberg the master director of such box-office mega hits like ""ET"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", and ""Jaws"", as well as historically poignant films such as ""Schindler's List"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", and ""Amistad"", misses his mark this time. Although Munich is a good film, it is certainly not a great one. If I wanted to see adventure, gore, and bloody scenes, I could have stayed home to see ""Supernatural"" on the WB network, or ""Twenty Four"" on FOX instead of going to the movies. Actually this movie reminds me more of a TV Land classic from the 1960's called ""Mission Impossible"", with all the adventure, stylish drama and espionage.

The movie stars Eric Bana as the leader of the covert Isreali operation designed to wipe out all of those responsible for planning Munich, those at the time believed to be hiding in Europe, and Geoffrey Rush as Ephraim, Avner's (Bana) case manager. Lynn Cohen gives a convincing performance as the Israeli Prime Minister at the time, Golda Meir. Members of Avner's revenge assassin team include character actors Daniel Craig, Hans Zichler, Ciaran Hinds and Matheau Kassovitz.

Besides Cohen as Golda Meir, Bana, the lead actor gives an outstanding performance, which makes up for his other highly popular but pitiful role as David Banner in the dreadful ""Hulk"" movie, a poor re-creation of the great 1970's television series. Bana, in a more poignant role really hits his mark this time. I wish I could say the same for Steven Spielberg.

The Bana is determined to succeed in his mission, yet he is guilt ridden and apologetic. His character loyally serves his country, and Prime Minister who is somewhat apologetic herself, but realizes that when civilians of a sovereign nation are attacked the way Israel was on 9/5/72, there are people who have to be held accountable. ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values"", proclaims Meir.

What Spielberg was trying to avoid which he shouldn't was finding an answer to the Arab-Israeli conflict, which usually begins with the Palestinians seeking political and ideological gain through force which immediately leads to swift and severe retaliation by Israel. The United Nations and the European Union are also responsible for this vicious cycle of violence for letting their global oil interests get in the way of a fair and just compromise for the Palestinians and the sovereign nation of Israel.

Basically I liked this movie ""Munich"" for its vast landscape of 1970's Europe and overall cinematography, and I admire taut and tense action thrillers. But this is a historical film that is missing something important, detailed history, and that is why I don't love it. 3 out of 4 stars.",8
26 May 2006,Midly entertaining,"You come to expect certain things for a Spielberg movie, namely a great story, direction and flavor.

Munich possesses few of those qualities.

Being vaguely familiar with the events which inspired the movie, I eagerly awaited Spielberg's take on the story. While not quite expecting Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan, I sincerely thought that this movie was an Oscar candidate.

The movie starts out well enough, but seems to lag at times towards the end. The lack of depth of the characters, save for Eric Bana's, is the ultimate failure here. What Spielberg did for a couple grunts in Saving Private Ryan (Giovanni Ribisi, Tom Hanks, Adam Golberg and Vin Diesel), he is unable to recapture here.

We don't care what happens. People are being sought out and executed in a systematic fashion. You almost feel bad for the targets...almost. I do not believe that to be Spielberg's intent, as the film is supposed to illustrate to Mossad's quest to bring to justice those responsible.

The movie is far too long and runs out of steam. Too little is done with locations and the only other saving grace, other than Bana, is the performance given by Michael Lonsdale (Papa). 6/10.",6

17 October 2006,"Munich: or Spielberg grows up, kind of...","I have to respect a movie that has managed to annoy both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian craziness. Some Palestinians are complaining that Munich's sympathies are more with the Israelis (what did they expect?); on the other hand, some formerly ultra-secret Mossad agents, even more secret than Maxwell Smart, have argued that the movie fudges the facts and that's not the way they did things (pray tell: just how do you do things at the Mossad?). All the carping is a fitting tribute to a movie that tries too hard to appease everybody. Good luck with that one, Steve-o! Munich is a really interesting mishmash. On the one hand, it has the directorial powers of one Steven Spielberg, a prodigy at film-making, who could not stop being entertaining and just plain freaking dazzling if a court order asked him to. On the other hand, the film was written by Tony Kushner, a playwright who likes to whip himself into a frenzy about big, hairy moral issues, and Eric Roth, the man responsible for serious-minded Hollywood spectacles like The Insider (Russell Crowe vs. Big Tobacco), Ali and the inexcusable Forrest Gump. This means that Munich is weirder than a mole enchilada with hummus and whipped cream on top. The Spielbergian magic is there in all its gripping glory, with sequences so beautifully staged, so tight with tension that they are not only a marvel, but, as in Spielberg's best work, they refuse to leave your mind long after you've left the theater. Sometimes he gets carried away and Munich feels like a spunkier, nastier version of a James Bond flick. Give him four guys with explosives and guns and watch him unleash spectacularly controlled mayhem. Yet true to form, he cannot ever let a movie happen without a completely gratuitous subplot about a father and son (it's his Rosebud), and he certainly cannot have a movie without heaping amounts of schmaltz. Still, Munich has the best writing ever seen in a Spielberg film. The movie illustrates with many intelligent twists the utter pointlessness of avenging murder with murder. As the plot unfolds, there is always a TV set tuned to another terrorist act, making it clear that the bloodbath is neither cleansing nor bringing closure to anyone. The writers give the audience a crash course on the long list of grievances of the Jewish people, and they insert the equally grievous list of the Palestinians, doing both with clunky dialog that hits the audience in the head like a ball of hardened falafel. There are several ridiculous scenes where checking your disbelief at the door is required, like one preposterous scene set up to facilitate an exchange between the Mossad leader Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana, gorgeous and fantastic) and one of the Palestinian terrorists. In it, Kaufman is extremely harsh and contemptuous of the Palestinians while the Palestinian makes his case for a homeland strongly and compellingly. The writing is sharp in a Israeli-Palestinian Conflict 101 kind of way, but the situation is absurd. It's a pajama party! Thus, I beg to differ with those who complain that all the sympathies lie on the Israeli side. Quite the contrary: you can hear the writers and the director spinning like the Tazmanian Devil on acid as they grapple with the kvetching of one side and the other (both of which I am sick of, if you must know). So even with all the cheese inside this blintz, my hat off to Spielberg and Kushner and Roth for making sure we remember that we Jews have a historical moral obligation not to behave like savages and that revenge is an eternal nightmare that turns people into murderers and the world into hell.",8
23 December 2005,Save your money - This one is really awful,"The Black September group that killed Israeli athletes at the Olympic games in Munich on September 5, 1972, gives this movie a starting point to convey a completely disjointed and confusing array of bloody murders carried out by what can only be described as an equally fanatical Jewish assassin and friends.

The scene cutting is confusing, perhaps even amateurish, with no clue or subtitle to indicate where in the world the scene is supposed to be, and Jewish or Arab language dialog should have included subtitles, but there was apparently no budget or interest, or both, to offer clues to the audience as to where a scene was taking place, or what was being said when not in English. This aspect of post production was just left out.

Basically, Munich (2005) is a long drawn out movie with repetitive murders, explosions, blood and guts with little or no discernible message except that Jewish killers are as brutal as Palastinian killers, and apparently this is supposed to be newsworthy or important, since it pretty much summarizes the entire plot.

For a movie based on real events, there was absolutely no explanation about the Black September group, who they were, and what they wanted to accomplish. This was simply an awful movie, and if you see it, demand your money back before it ends or they might claim you got your money's worth, which is impossible for this pathetic effort at story telling.

Spielberg should have watched a few episodes of 24 or Alias to get the idea about how to make use of rapid scene cutting, and action sequences, to make them relevant to an underlying story. Munich (2005) looked like a pile of film clips spliced together for only one purpose - shock and awe - with no purpose and clearly no redeeming value.

Save your money, and even more important, save your time. This movie is a complete waste of both.",1
25 January 2015,A terrific tale that exceeds normal expectations,"'Munich' is not really a movie about Israel vs Palestine, nor it is about right vs wrong, but it is, in fact, a movie about human beings in the conflict between humanity and loyalty.

Steering clear from all stereotypes and expectations, this movie soon shows that it doesn't take any side as it is neither pro-Semitism nor anti-Arabs. The main characters are never seen as heroes, and you will find yourself questioning many choices they make, while their enemies, including the terrorists, are presented with small but amazingly effective details to show their humanity and their struggle, all of which force us to take a step back, and reconsider our prejudices. I especially like the part where one Munich terrorist tells his hostages to calm down and that they will soon get released. Although that doesn't come true as the rescue effort forces them to retaliate, it still shows us that those people are also humans, but were put into the wrong environment and situation, just like the main character himself.

Another great aspect is certainly the characterization. This movie has so many impressive supporting characters, many of which only appear for a few minutes but are still able to leave big impacts on viewers' minds. Characters like Carl (Ciarán Hinds), Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush), Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen), and Papa (Michael Lonsdale) are perfectly cast, and so well-portrayed.

But then, 'Munich', unfortunately, still lacks so much to achieve the masterpiece status. Firstly, many scenes, including the ones that are supposed to be thrilling, seem so slow and dragged-out, which make them very anti-climactic. With the runtime of nearly 3 hours, the movie definitely should have been more tightly edited. Secondly, some scenes, such as the death scenes and the sex scene near the beginning, feel very awkward due to bad acting from the extras, and bad camera work. Sometimes I just can't believe I'm watching a movie made by the same man that directed 'Indiana Jones' and 'Saving Private Ryan'. And finally, I'm not really convinced by Eric Bana's performance. The actor is usually effective in other movies, but in this one, he seems quite bland, especially when put next to all those fantastic supporting actors.

Overall, 'Munich' is a very admirable effort by Steven Spielberg. It has so much depth, and it broke away from many traditions. However, it still could have been much better, had he not rushed the production so much.",7

28 September 2006,Could Have Been Great...,"This film had everything it needed to be a great film. It was insightful, entertaining, and well directed. And then it hit the two-hour mark and went downhill. The first two hours of the film were the best film I've seen all year. The film went to such great lengths to draw you in. You felt like you knew the characters. You cried when they cried. You suffered when they suffered. However, the last forty-five minutes, the film changed. I hate giving spoilers, so I won't say exactly where the film went bad. If you've seen it, then you know. If you haven't, then you will find out. Let's just say that there was nothing shown that was absolutely vital to the film. It could have all been summed up in about four lines of text and the film would have been done and it would have been a cinematic masterpiece. Instead, you have a two-hour masterpiece and a forty-five minute piece of crap.

10 February 2006,Much more depth and subtlety than I expected from Spielberg!,"Knowing that I was going to a Steven Spielberg film, I was expecting something perfected to manipulate the audience into tears: a carefully engineered drama, a bit too pushy sentimentality, and between that lots of action professionally choreographed to keep you amused. At the end, a director's message too loud and bolded for my taste.

However I was completely and totally surprised! Instead we got a realistic, serious and questioning film! Everything that the audience had to gain as a message and a contemplation was hidden naturally and subtly - in the characters' fullness.

Five ordinary recruits in the military - not the trained Mosad field operatives - have decided to give up themselves for those things that give life a destiny, a cause and fulfillment: ...duty, beliefs, Past, Future, feeling for obligation to the ancestors and a sacrifice for those to come after...

Just as any ordinary Jews would.

Yet, as they proceed with their mission, that world gradually falls apart. They loose touch with the myths that shaped their life, that motivated them to accept this mission on the first place! The ordinary men are strongly affected by the very nature of the deeds they have taken upon themselves, even if they still find those deeds fully justified. They slowly break out of their ordinarity and innocence. ...to whatever is lying beyond. In several excellently acted shots Avner, returning home and hailed as a hero, discovers the abyss that has grown between his evolved self and the eulogical pride of his peers, family and superiors. What used to make sense to him, as it still does to his countrymen, has dissolved by too many a crossing the limits. Crossing the limits when exceptions -had- to be made. Exceptions from law and from conscience. From righteousness.

For, in each murder the agents are not lucky enough ""to simply kill an enemy"" (today the laguage would be even more distanced - perhaps ""eliminate a terrorist""). We are intimately with them as they have to take the ultimate decision to convert the breathing, fleshed, intelligent, warm, human, talking in his fright with body most sincerely, human. Human, to this moment full of memory and hope - ...to convert him into a dead corpse. To choose the moment they will cut away a future: now or 2 seconds later? ...or never.

Although later they try to avoid the shock of face-to-face execution by planting bombs, the Fate (director) each time leads them and us to discover the target as a human being. The overpowering blasts are incredibly realistic, both physically and psychologically!

...

The cinematography is amazing, the cities of Europe are recreated in a feast of visuals! With slightly unrealistic beauty they possess some fairytale quality! Spielberg manages to create a mythical dream about 70's Europe! He made me wish to go back in time when the terrorists, secret services and even cities were more innocent, human and romantic. Nostalgic.

This is contrasted by the series of powerful still shots of the consequence of murder. However they are all unenforced as if slipping unintentionally in the field of view of the camera. The most symbolic ones as if unwittingly distracted the cameraman's attention from his task of filming and made him stop there for a second, on an image that in my opinion could take its place in a photography exhibition. Thus every single death makes its point to us as well as it does to the protagonists.

This achievement is mirrored in the dialogue! The film abounds with crystallized one-liners by people fully aware of the tragedy of their self-destruction. Also, remarkably, the writers did an effort in putting us in the context of Israeli and Palestinian emotional worlds, to spare us from abstract moralizing and judgement on their violence and readiness for self-sacrifice. Unfortunatey, this ""from-above"" attitude is commonly prevailing in the placated West of today when watching on TV the news from Middle East.",
28 December 2005,3rd rate Ludlum,"I had great expectations for this movie; after all, it was directed by Steven Spielberg. But from the start, I was simply lost.

I couldn't decide, first of all, whether the main character, played by Eric Bana, was Israeli or not. At one point, we are introduced to his mother (I think) who had a French accent. The main character, however, had an Australian accent. I remained puzzled throughout the entire movie whether this character was Israeli or not.

Then, we are introduced to a little old lady who seemed to be in authority. At this point, I couldn't figure out whether she was an Arab or an Israeli. (In the dim shadows on my mind, I remembered later, that Israel had a lady prime minister named Golda Meir. Could that be her, I wondered.) Next thing I knew, the main character had access to monies to be expended on assassinating those had perpetuated the Munich massacre. How did that happen; did I have a lapse in attention? Then the movie goes to Paris, Athens, Beirut, etc. I got confused. I couldn't figure out the timeline. Men appear suddenly who could be CIA or not. They shadow the main character or perhaps not.

I am sorry. I am not versed in Israeli not Arab history. I do not know any Arab or Jewish people. I mistakenly thought that I could learn history from this movie. What I got instead was just a revenge plot that was confusing to me. I would rather settle in with a good Ludlum book because, at least to me, I could follow storyline and motivations.",1
5 January 2006,"I don't believe in long reviews, so...","This movie is by far the best Spielberg since ""Saving Private Ryan"". The acting is good and does not overwhelm the story, which is the real star of this movie. The lesson of the movie, while simple and familiar to many, is expertly explored. Though you might think that a movie with this subject matter coming from a man named Spielberg might be pro-Israel in its consideration of the Munich kidnappings, it is not. It is a thoughtful and masterful exploration of the cyclic nature of violence, whether righteously committed or not. Surprisingly, it is also the story of how damaging and alienating terrorism can be to the human soul, with the embedded idea that even righteous violence is no solution at all. It's a long movie, and very violent - which underpins the lesson that all types of violence leaves blood on somebody's hands - but it was well worth seeing. Spielberg the master has done it again!

2 March 2022,The film ends in an anticlimax without the Lillehammer Affair,"Far from Spielberg's best film.

The film ends in an very slow anticlimax without the Lillehammer Affair which would have been a more action-packed and true ending to the film.

The assassination campaign did not fall apart because the agents lost their nerve, as the film suggests, but because an operation went disastrously wrong at Lillehammer in Norway July 21, 1973.

When the Israelis mis-identified their target - the Black September chief Ali Hassan Salameh they killed the wrong man.

An innocent Moroccan waiter Ahmed Bouchikhi was shot 14 times in front of his pregnant Norwegian wife. Bouchiki initially received six rounds in the stomach and fell, after which the agents shot him twice in the head. They then shot him six more times in the back.

Six mossad agent were arrested as they tried to flee the country. Five of them were convicted. Israel temporarily halts its campaign against Black September after the Lillehammer Affair, but the Mossad kills Salameh with a car bomb in Beirut in 1979.",6
11 July 2020,Spielberg´s Darkest Pick,"Spielberg wasn´t a big favorite of mine due to personal likeness, because i really think that he is a great Filmmaker and a true influence, but sadly over the years he turned to be very commercial and too blockbuster for my style, sadly his favorite film of mine, the timeless classic Jaws, was the movie to guilt about the stupid blockbuster culture of cinema that´s the reality these days

I always enjoyed dark stuff, and when Spielberg stops doing that fancy ""Family Friendly"" movies, and puts certain horrid scenes like the melted nazis or maybe even true godly movies like Saving Private Ryan, i enjoy that a lot.

If i saw Munich without knowing that it was a Spielberg pick, i wouldn´t even guessed (Except of course of obvious styles that are obviously from Steve) that it was a Spielberg film, it´s really dark, and it shows us with cruelty the true reality of spies, and not just that but the cruelty of the Jews-Arabs endless conflict

I don´t like Eric Bana, but this is the exception, he delivers a nice performance here and IMO the best of his career

Munich is a highly infravalorated film and it surely deserves a view",8
24 December 2005,Spielberg regains some dignity,"Munich is unforgettable. As Spielberg is not my favorite, he ends up here with a winner. Taking into account that this is a fictional account of real events, he delivers a straight forward film here. This is Speilbergs second ""Shindlers List"", a film that may live the test of time as ""SL"" did. It is a very heavy film that shouldn't be seen when not expecting something of this magnitude. The images portrayed in Munich really very well to the audience its intended message. Also, the film hopefully will open up the world of the last few generations of the terrible events that happened at the 72 Olympics, not to mention conflict overseas, the issue at hand that still occurs today.

18 February 2008,The same old story,"You can watch that one without getting bored and another point is; all the hairs, cars, outfits are so cool and reflecting the 70s way(except dutch girl!! Becus i couldn't feel if she was from 70s or 90s). Eric Bana and Louis(i forgot the real name) acting cool, too. However, i've seen tones of movies from Spielberg that told us the exposed-Gewish people or Gewish massacre...I wonder when he will stop making the same story. Meanwhile, there was thousands of massacres in the history and some of the have been still going on somewhere in the world. That kind of brandmark director should rise his head up and see the others, as well. If he thinks he has right to protest China about human rights, then he must have responsibility to have a look at the different nations' pains. I don't like the end of movie. It was like Kushner&Roth couldn't finish it what it really had to, although they also knew what the real end. I don't like the bed scene near the end, either. It was like to fill some space, so poor to reflect the Bana's emotion and highly ordinary to picture that kind emotional explosions.

9 May 2006,What is right and wrong?,"It is difficult to separate this film from its message and from its historical context.

This film reminds me that there are no simple answers, no right thing or wrong thing to do and that any response (or non response) will be wrong in some circumstances. This is perhaps more-so in a situation as complex as the middle east.

In one section of the film, Papa says something to the effect that history has been harsh with your tribe, acknowledging the brutal, ignorant and terrible mistreatment of Jews by other nations through the centuries and giving his personal approbation to Avner's actions. But the film reminds us that violence begets violence and as the exchange between Avner and the terrorist (when forced to share a safe house) indicates, both sides eventually end up looking something less than human.

Does this mean that a violent response to the Palestinian murders was wrong.....I am not sure, at least at that time in history. Isacc Azimov once wrote that ""Violence is the last resort of the incompetent."" Maybe sometimes we are all incompetent and feel we have no choice or no better option. had Israel decided to instead bring the perpetrators before the courts, would other countries have helped? Would they have done any more than mouth platitudes? Probably not, judging by history.

All I can say is that somehow this film captures the dilemma reasonably well without recovering old historical ground (Hitler kills 6 million Jews, and in consequence surviving Jews feel they need a home land. The UN grants Jews part of Palestine and the Palestinians naturally object and fight. Jews win and this sets the scene for a tragedy of global proportions that we are still playing out over 50 years later, and will, no doubt for a long time yet.) Perhaps what the film depicts best is the personal toll that such national strategies take. Yes, after Munich, killing Jews had a high price attached to it but there was also a terrible personal price for those who had to execute the policy.

Outside of the film, I am saddened that Israel has in some ways made itself a pariah (in some quarters anyway) for adopting harsh policies that respond in brutal kind to the Palestinians' own brutalities. I have always felt like the bomb maker in the film - that Jews should set out to be righteous, if not perfect and try to do the right thing. (But Jews also acknowledge that this is only an ideal and joke ""We are just the same as every one else - only more-so!"") perhaps thats what this film is about too.

So what to make of the film? I have not read all of the comments so do not know if anyone else has the same view as me, but I think of it as a tragedy in the true sense of the word.

Perhaps I can leave with one final comment. I was discussing Israeli policies with a (Jewish) friend, when she pointed out that in Israel we find a nation formed by survivors of the Shoah and which is in many ways still traumatized by it. In these circumstances, who can expect less than harsh responses to the brutal provocations of those who at their most extreme call for Israel to be destroyed and every Jew to be slaughtered. These words were so nearly played out in Europe that it must be hard for Israelis to know how to respond even if they wish peace, as I am sure many do. Sadly now, both sides are dancing to the tune of the extremists.",
19 February 2007,Political Drama from Spielberg,"""Munich' is a gripping drama about the aftermath of the 1972 Munich Olympic tragedy involving the death of Israeli athletes. I was not disappointed after watching the movie, but it certainly wasn't the best movie of Spielberg's career.

The story evolves around Avner (Eric Bana) who along with four other men are sent to eliminate the Palestinian culprits one by one.

At first I was hesitant that Spielberg would make the movie overly biased in favor of the Israeli perspective but I found that he did a delicate job of promoting his beliefs while never crossing the line of propaganda. There are scenes where there is Palestinian sympathy as well.

But the movie is more than just an Israel v Palestinian examination. It's about the path and development of Avner's character. From a naive, inexperience agent to a paranoid, political hit-man who begins to question the validity of his assignments and his role in the whole 'game.'

That to me was the strength of the movie, the character of Avner. However there was an ensemble cast which also carried the movie with excellence. Daniel Craig (Steve) played a great role as an aggressive Israeli hit-man, Geoffrey Rush (Ephraim) was wonderful as the Government officer relaying orders and the best surprise was Michael Lonsdale (Papa) as an engaging role of an informant providing information to any one who pays for it. These characters were tremendous additions which further strengthen the movie.

So why is this movie only rated a 7 and didn't win best picture for 2005. I believe the main reason is length. The movie is just too long. It runs at 2 hours and 44 minutes and doesn't need to be. The problem is the movie follows the group as they seek out 11 individuals one at a time. This means that there are 11 assignments and each assignments has their own ebb and flow, their own climax and downfall. However by the fifth or sixth assignment, the slow pace begins to get repetitive. I believed that this was the only weakness of the movie.

However despite its length, Spielberg created an enthralling story with some tremendous characters and that is what made the movie enjoyable.

29 December 2005,Epic ...an Instant Classic,"Went to the Loew's Lincoln Center to catch the 10:30 p.m. showing of Barebacking Cowboys. After the first 20 minutes of boredom, predictable storyline, more boredom, lame situations...got up and exchanged that ticket for the 10:40 p.m. showing of Munich.

I have not written a review in quite some time. Why? There hasn't been anything released in the past year and a half that I would pay to see or even download on Gnutella. How refreshing it was to finally have the lights go down, sit back, and enjoy a film from beginning to end -- and become thoroughly engaged without having my common sense and I.Q. insulted by lame, disconnected, illogical situations -- and bad acting from over the hill so far gone ""stars/movie actors"".

Munich is a masterpiece. From beginning to end it engages you and leaves you wanting more like the best sex you ever had -- multiple orgasms. I recommend this film highly to anyone who was old enough in 1972 to remember the tragedy of the '72 Olympic games and the political scandals and cover-ups that followed. And for those that were not around back then, this is probably the best visual history of it you will ever experience. 3 hours, but worth every second. Will leave you wanting to know more of what happened with the central character.",

3 February 2007,Excellent,"I think this movie is so important not only because it is one of the most audacious in Steven Spielberg's career, but the fact that it relays an important message about the cry for peace in today's post 9/11 world. It has some stunning images, especially the end, when it shows the Twin Towers. This movie is a definite cry for peace, and I feel sorry for the people who do not understand this movie. Many people said that this movie made them think too much. Which I think is ridiculous. Spielberg wanted you to think about the nature for killing. Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."" Spielberg tries to make this point by showing Avner as a person who has a good soul and spirit but it has been corrupted with the things that he has done for Israel. The film may have a lot of violence, but it certainly never condones violence. Everyone hould see this film, to see its wonder and beauty.

8 April 2013,One of the best...!!!,"This was by far one of the best films of 2005 and ranks right up there with Spielberg's Private Ryan and Schindler's List. However, I believe that Spielberg spoiled the film by choosing the World Trade Center as the background of the final scene. What was the message of that shot supposed to be? Since America did not do enough to stop terrorism that we ended up paying an enormous price for our lack of effort? Was it supposed to be some ironic forbearance of the future? Up until that shot I was enthralled by Munich, but I left the theater angry about the final scene. Many ""unknowns"" were answered in the movie Munich. An eye opening drama.

It's a very good story, and Steven Spielberg surely did a good job in this movie. this is a great film that shows the never ending battle of Religion. you can kill one person but they will breed more people so in the end it is a never ending battle.

21 December 2005,bad history and bad cinema,"Munich (2005) isn't Steven Spielberg's only movie about Jews, but it's by far his worst. Although Shindler's List (1193) turned Auschwitz into polish Disneyland and Israel into the Shoah's happy ending, Munich manages to make Mossad assassinations more painful for those who carry them out than their victims. Spielberg turns the idea that Palestinian guerrillas responded to the atrocities involved in expropriating their property in order to create the state of Israel into a of lame slogan only voiced by a confused ""terrorist"" named Ali (Omar Metwally). The movie starts with the events at the 1972 Olympics, effectively de- historicizing the attack and reifying the event according to our post 9-11 ideology of terrorism.

If one can usefully distinguish the film's ""form"" from what it's ""about,"" the movie adds nothing to the cinema. It's filed with cliché hand-held work, imbecilic under-cranking to show tension or emotion, lazy rack focus shots solving the seemingly impossible riddle of conversations in long take, and bleach-bypass processing that was already played out and annoying in the late 1990s ( see for example three kings (Russell, 1999). When the mossad bomb maker starts to break down the first half of the scene is played out in silhouette against the bright white roof of a train station. Cliché as that image is, Spielberg and DP Janusz Kaminski don't even have the courage to maintain it for the whole scene, cutting to ordinary exposures for the rest of the conversation between the bomb maker (Mathieu Kossovitz) and Avner (Eric Bana). Spielberg and his editor Michael Kahn stoop to imitations of hitchcokian suspense throughout the film, most annoyingly when we wait for the Mossad team to blow up a Fatah member whose child returns to his apartment to fetch her mother's glasses as we cut back and forth between her trajectory, Kossovitz holding the detonator and Bana signaling the mossad team.

In short, both the narrative and film form make revolution inconceivable by enforcing trans- historical humanism and the lamely updated stylistics of poorly remembered 70s thrillers.",

7 March 2015,"Slow, full of Israelli propaganda","Good story, good film-making and good casting, but the movie is a bit spoiled by its lengthy development and the story gets blurred by political propaganda. Instead of focusing on events or characters, the scenario likes to stray into emotional blackmailing, with some scenes awkwardly turning to be overly dramatic, adding unnecessary emphasis on the good reasons and innocence of the Israeli people and stretching the dialog to depict and justify their ""good intentions"" in borderline ridiculous ways. That and the little speeches full of political messages.. really not sure all those not-so-subtle arguments add anything to the movie, just load it with biased views and unpalatable justifications. Hollywood may like it, but Spielberg soils himself by engaging in such partisan projects.

1 January 2006,Spielberg does it again,"Wow. A great film. Spielberg does it again. The biggest controversies about the film are coming from political figures in the news and radio talk shows, not critics. Liberals are saying, ""See! We should not be in Iraq."" Conservatives are saying, ""See! Hollywood's getting involved where they shouldn't.""

Great actors. Great acting. I loved watching the characters struggle with their duties, but still performing them and then dealing with the emotions afterwards. War. The humanity felt in the consequences of war were shown so well in this movie. Excellent.

I would love to know how Spielberg was able to make this film without anybody mentioning that even though it is good it is also a remake. The book that it is based on, Vengeance, was already put to film in Sword of Gideon (1986). While Spielberg is getting the credit of a great film, which it is and he is entitled to, how can he be credited for something groundbreaking. It is a remake, and almost to the scene. I give him credit though. The movie definitely comes closer to the reality of world events, and therefor more emotional.

Great job. But, lets watch out on giving to much credit.",
8 January 2006,Food and Death,"Very very mild spoilers; but then again, I don't even like to watch the previews, so these minor, vague revelations may not be counted as giving anything away.

I went to this movie with high expectations; I thought that having made the excellent _Schindler's List_, Spielberg would have purged this serious, political film of the frivolous, shallow, sentimental, and sententious nature of many of his others. There may be nothing shallow in this film, in that it deals respectfully with both the promise of Israel, its importance to its people, and its terrible political dilemma; and it does address the flawed ideology of vengeance. But it is dull, dull, bloody, full of sumptuous meals, and dull. After the first tense revenge killing where the untrained assassins nearly botch it, I looked at my watch and thought... are they going to go through all eleven? It seemed that that was the scenario for the first hour. The second hour was hard to get through--the incredible violence and gore putting one into a state of numbness--and the final forty minutes was a torture of boredom. We hadn't eaten, and I kept focusing on all that food. What was that food supposed to signify? It may have been a powerful iconic message-- of devouring, of family, of life, of SOMETHING-- but it was lost in a plot that got increasingly confused. Food and death. The cook who kills. The toymaker who makes faulty bombs. Toys and bombs. Now this target. Now that. The main character, whom one should care about, was so insipid as to incite no sympathy. I found Louis and his Papa far more interesting, actually, than Avnan. The final spoken morals seemed tendentious and obvious. Spielberg at his worst: meaning well, earnest in his religious and political faith, but narratively naive.",4
16 February 2006,S. Spielberg at his worst.,"I saw this movie about 1 week ago, expecting to find a sort of chant or hymn to human values, an excellent screen development and a story really well told in order to keep audience's attention at every single moment. However I found just the opposite: unconnected and senseless scenes, boring argument and lots of explicit violence that sometimes changed my boredom to a disagreeable taste. I found this movie really chaotic and tasteless. Sometimes it really reminds me ""Schindler's List"", with lots of tasteless violent scenes, some scenes of documentary or similar, many stories being told at the same time (I know in real life many things usually happen simultaneously but trying to tell different stories at the same time makes the audiences loose all points and able to follow none of them). Steven Spielberg did lots of better movies and I hope he finds again his way in the future, with a movie that can really capt the attention of the audiences ""from the first 10 minutes"", as he said sometimes.

16 February 2006,Save Your Money,"I saw this last night and am strongly thinking about writing to Mr Spielberg and asking for my money back, or an apology at the very least.

Obviously the subject matter is a delicate one, and I think neutrality was the right way to go - it left me with a distinct ""a plague on both their houses"" feeling, but that is not my gripe.

Almost every scene in this film was a cliché. We're in Paris? Ah, then the Eiffel Tower must be in every scene? Amsterdam? Let's have some canals and bicycles. London? Well, it should be raining, obviously... Daniel Craig as a Jewish South African, but a strange British twang? Nobody comes out of this well - especially Spielberg.

16 January 2006,"Not a review, some background info.","The events portrayed are detailed in the superbly written and researched book by George Jonas entitled ""Vengeance"". Based on interviews with Avner, and meticulously annotated, it reads more like a top class airport thriller, with all the machismo excised.

Also this is not the first depiction of these events. The 1986 movie ""Sword of Gideon"" made a brave attempt, but ultimately, was let down by poor casting and time restrictions which bypassed many of the key events.

For a superb documentary on the Olympic massacre itself, I would recommend ""One Day in September"".

The casting is/was spot on.

The Script Writing is on the money.

The Oscar nominations the movie received, in my opinion were all justified.

This movie certainly serves to remind the viewing public of the tragic events that occurred in Munich in 1972.

24 February 2006,Bad Movie.,"This movie was terrible. I went into it thinking it was a political movie, and I came out of it wanting to shoot myself. It was unnecessarily violent and gory. The point for this movie could have been expressed in less than two and a half hours and with killing less people on screen. I don't need to see people actually die on screen to know terrorism is wrong.

Spielberg what were you thinking? Powerful, good acting, yes... but violent and painful to watch.

I just wanted to warn anyone who likes good political movies, and who doesn't like violence, not to watch it!

14 May 2006,A spectacular suspense film that is too self-conscious for its own good,"Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's ""Munich"" seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise.

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise.

2 March 2006,"""...I could go on and on ...""","With the splendid ""21 Hours at Munich"" in the back of my mind I sat down to watch Spielbergs doc-drama or perhaps fleshing out of the latter. The overshadowing question that gradually develops for me long before the first half of the movie has passed by is, where is this movie going or what is it about? Several clues might be found in the first assassination in the film of a write/translator who to an engaged audience praises the power of the narrative and equally throughout a recurring theme of a never ending replacement of 'targets/names'. The new target/name, we discover, far worse than the first and perhaps not so dissimilar to the dialog which struggles to reflect on events. As a snippet from the dialog at the end of the film sounds, '...I could go on and on ...'. And so it does only tempting the audience through change of exotic era-true cosmopolitan scenery and clockwork-carnage.

13 January 2008,Engaging drama except for a couple uber lame scenes,"Would've given it more points if someone had edited out the preposterous flashbacks to an event in Munich at which the main character was not present. I feel sorry for the relatives of the real Israeli athletes for the tacky association of their tragedy with some murder-for-hire guy humping his wife.

Also struggled with the scene of Louie's papa preparing a big family dinner at their country estate and chatting up the Israeli assassin. Having lived in France, I can say that the mere concept of a wealthy man preparing a big family meal is a joke. But the blindfolded guest and instant bonding are even more cornball.

24 December 2005,Among Spielberg's best movies,"Anytime you go to watch a movie that's 2 hours and 45 minutes long and it seems like half that, you know you've seen a great movie. I heard this movie is controversial. I heard this movie is either anti-Semetic or anti-Arab. I think that anyone who sees it will see what they want to see and there are a few points within the movie where your views will be questioned.

Before seeing the movie, I suggest that you read up a little bit on the 1972 Olympic massacre and the aftermath to help ""fill in the blanks"", as the movie does not go out of its way to spoon feed who the characters are or recent events at the time to the viewer.

Prior to seeing the movie, I had known about the Olympic massacre and the aftermath. I didn't expect any surprises, nor did I see any in the movie. I did, however, find both the murders and the assassinations to be brutally frank in their depiction. I would suggest that if you're a political nerd like me and plan to see Syriana and Munich over the holidays, see Syriana first (if at all), but definitely check out Munich. You'll be astounded by the dramatic cinematography, the locations it was filmed on, and the story will blow you away. Like I said, there's something in this movie that will step on everyone's toes, but the viewer will probably see what he wants to see.",10
24 December 2005,Munich,"Munich was excruciatingly long and BORING! Why was Kushner asked to to screenplay: ""....Kushner, who laughably stated in the Time magazine piece that he ""never likes to draw lessons for people,"" calls the establishment of the State of Israel ""for the Jewish people a historical, moral, political calamity  I wish the modern Israel hadn't been born."" He slanders the Israeli Defense Forces, snootily declaring, ""I deplore the brutal and illegal tactics of the Israeli Defense Forces in the occupied territories  Jews, of all people, with our history of suffering, should refuse to treat our fellow human beings like that."" Allowing Kushner to write what will probably be seen as the definitive movie on the slaughter of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics is somewhat like allowing Ramsey Clark to write the definitive account of United States foreign policy in the Middle East....""

28 January 2006,Were the Israilis who caused real terror ?,"After the ""War Of The Worlds"" disappointment - my opinion- we meet ""Munich"" made again by one of the Hollywood's genius directors. This time we encounter an austere and a thought-provoking theme; the unending conflict and struggle between Israelis and Palastanians. This film really fastens you to the plot and events and it makes you think hard who's side to support or blame. What's the message behind ""Munich"" ? Were the Israilis who caused real terror ? ""Forget the peace now, we must show them that we are strong and so on. (If so the Jew community might get angry.)Or the same old story where the blame is put on blood-thirsty Palastinians ? The time when Avner (Eric Bana) goes through the depressing cycle SS points out that Avner is questioning his assignment. Or does SS puts forth that the Isrealis are also human beings with emotions and sentiments like the everybody else and that they must/had to react when they are terrorized and attacked ? Or SS wants us to go home after seeing his latest masterwork and go over the events once more in our thoughts. This film certainly needs another viewing to perceive the message here. And because of the contemporary theme, it certainly is -imo- the kind of flick you'll watch it over and over. ""Oh, we are tragic men. Butcher's hands, gentle souls"" is one of the devastating statements needs to be read between the lines.

I wasn't even born when this unfortunate event occurred in the Olympics in 1972. I liked the film very much. Surely a must-get-the-DVD flick. Great acting, flawless similitude and depiction of 70's. This film's absolutely a striker ! I'm glad Empire gave ""Munich"" 5 stars. It deserves all the stars it got.",8
21 February 2006,Spielberg does it again!,"I am too young to have been alive during the Black September abductions of the 11 Israeli athletes during the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Though I did not witness these events I felt as if I was there due to the excellent achievements in Cinematography and in the all over layout of the film. Certain scenes such as the Black September member walking out onto the balcony as the others in the rooms were watching it on TV showed the realism that Spielberg was attempting to capture again...which he did. I very much enjoyed Spielberg showing the insecurity in the behavioral aftermath of the mission in the eyes of Eric Bana's character after ""the smoke clears"" added that edge of suspense that i was looking forward to. I give this film 9 stars, though a lot of people would disagree with that decision I just enjoyed the over all feel of the film and can't wait until it is available on DVD. Now most would call it a controversial film, I did not look at it that way, I just looked at is as an epic picture and enjoyed the drama, action, and heart-pounding suspense. Overall I look forward to seeing how it contends at the Oscars.

3 January 2006,the hunters become the hunted,"As far as movies go this was a beautifully filmed masterpiece. Spielberg has reembarked on great film making. The actors were great and so was the editing, in fact all aspects of Munich were well constructed. I had never seen Eric Bana before but now I have seen an actor who I really admire. This film should definitely be seen. Spielberg brings it to life, it is so real and draws its audience in so well. Although it runs over two hours it doesn't feel like it at all. The plot is interesting and keeps watchers guessing. Avner's (played by Bana) character is very well developed. Spielberg deserves yet another award for his incredible talent.

30 January 2006,Spielberg's Best film,"This is Spielbergs best film, although I have not seen Schindler's List! Of all the films that I have seen this is his best and the best movie ever to document terrorism and its effect on both sides of the equation.

Eric Bana is superb in his role as Avner, his performance takes away any Hollywood pretentiousness that is often associated with Spielberg's films. Daniel Craig is also does a fine job and Geoffrey Rush gives his usual above average performance.

This film is very well made, I have given it 9/10 because the story is good, the performances are great and there are clear messages behind the content of the movie.

This movie does justice to the Munich event and provides insight into the current climate in which terrorism is such a big issue. The message stays with you long after the film and the emotion and overall feeling of movie is not quickly forgotten.

This is best film of 2005 and a worthy Oscar contender. The individual performances also deserve recognition from the academy.",9

3 January 2006,Doesn't live up to expectations,"This is a good movie. Keep that in mind. But it doesn't hit with the same weight of other Spielberg movies. Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List both were able to reach into deep, dark, god-forsaken places inside us and twist; Munich kind of prods, trying to find those same places without comparable success. Certainly, this movie has its moments; Spielberg is a cinematography genius. But the inconsistent tone and feel are quite distracting. Munich jumps from action to romance to drama to moral screed back to action to thriller...Never does it remain constant enough to draw the audience in and finally reach that place it seeks. Go see it; it's an important film. But don't wait for Spielberg or Eric Bana to pop up on the stage for any awards.

12 March 2006,brilliant,"A dark harrowing film, that does not patronise the viewer like fellow best picture nominee Crash. The ambivalence of the films morals only heightens the cinema going experience challenging the viewer with its unclear message. I, personally had no issues with the films apparent lack of historical accuracy, but if thats your priority when you pay to be entertained then maybe you'll have trouble with this film. This is undoubtedly Spielbergs best film of the last decade and I truly believe that in time I will be rating it as one his best, if not his best ever. The lighting is superb, like the best of noir but it serves not to show a man constrained by a femme fa tale but rather the fright of becoming one of the cold blooded killers that the terrorist retaliation squad so hate. I would wright more but i haven't got the time at the moment but I cant recommend this film highly enough it truly is a modern great.

4 March 2006,Completely Tasteless Film!,"I cannot understand any of the comments that claim this is some sort of masterpiece or even a well made movie. The movie is tasteless and pointless. I was expecting to see a very high quality, well made movie, as Spielberg is capable of making (on the order of Schindler's List) and was anticipating to take a position on the ""political"" side of the movie. What I found was a really bad movie and not much more. It was completely tasteless in the ""sex scene"" at the end where Avner is passionately screwing his wife while seeing scenes of the massacre in his head. It was just disgusting. This was after a movie with no certain direction, full of really bad dialogue, below average acting and an uncomprehendable presentation of the Israeli revenge team. Why did they try to make them look so unproffesional? Why does the movie have almost nothing to do with the massacre except as a background theme? Why did they put that corny, far fetched, unnecessary scene with the Israelis and Palestinians in the same room? What did Kushner want to say and show, besides that he is a really bad story teller? Don't bother wasting the three hours on this movie that I did. Watch the documentary on the Munich massacre instead. There you see a well made, intriguing film, without any political hints and fictional settings and tasteless scenes. Shame on you Spielberg.",1
23 December 2005,"""Inspired by historic events""","It's hard to argue against the artistic qualities of this film, after all you would expect that from Mr. Spielberg. However, it is the idea and the message that is missing a point by failing, frankly, to pick a side. ""Picking sides is not what filmmaker is supposed to do"" - one might argue. Perhaps... but not when it comes to this subject. A subject so close to my heart and to the heart of any Jew, including, hopefully, Mr. Spielberg himself.

Inevitably, any human being put in Avner position would have moral doubts. But, let's look at history and observe that the main character returned to Israel and led an elite tank unit in the Yom Kipur war of 1973 that shortly followed the events depicted (see Sword of Gideon made in 1986 with Steven Bauer). Those who know, know the psychological training an elite Israeli soldier, let alone a Mossad agent, has to go through. Someone in Avner's position would not have any qualms about ridding this earth of the scum that he'd killed.

To put it simply, Spielberg picked a wrong historical example to drive the point the liberal origins of which are very clear in the modern context of the debate about civilized approach to the war on terror, in general, and Arab/Israeli conflict in particular.",6
13 February 2006,Spielbergs Masterpiece,"He directs the action throughout the movie and shows his true brilliance in the recreating a moving drama with the anti hero of avner becoming more and more real with every passing scene showing the full range of human emotions from anger and hatred and with the truth of his actions becoming more and more evident to him and also the human cost of what it is doing to his team and the fact that although he believes in avenging the death of the athletes the men he is killing although he is told are terrorist he has no remorse until someone asks what evidence have you seen in relation to their crimes and that begins to dwell on his mind more and more and when he begins to question the facts behind the murders he begins to realise that he the hunter is now becoming the hunted and with more and more of his team getting killed he becomes more and more paranoid with Spielberg highlighting the true human cost brilliantly this is easily the greatest movie he has ever made a true must SEE !!!!!!

20 November 2006,As boring as Schindler's List and as unsexy as ET,"Okay, Munich was good, but kinda overrated. Okay, I mean, it was no Lost World(what is????????:)and definitely no Color Purple. I mean, it wasn't even blue!!!!!!!lol:)Okay, and what was up with Saving Private Ryan.... that movie wasn't even believable... But starying put aside, Munich was the same movie, purely stylewise, as Schindler's list. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. It definitely wasn't amazing. ANd not that sexy And definitely not Jurassic Park.

So, I have decided to compose a list of Spielbergs greatest films....

1) War of the Worlds Unfortunately, I can't remember any others, cause the rest suck!!!!!!!

5 January 2006,A film that questions the morality of violence.,"After viewing this film, I have come to a conclusion: This is hands down on of the best films of the year and on of Spielberg's finest to date (including the remake of War of the Worlds). Upon hearing about this film, I had low expectations. I thought it was another plot-less, conventional, over-the-top, special effects movie with more flash than substance. Clearly, I was wrong. Not only is this a action thriller, but it is also well written, thought provoking, and well acting with great performances from the actors themselves. It is a story that grabs you and never lets go and the action doesn't let up until the very end. The action scenes are very well choreographed with no fancy moves that action films have. From the use of bombs to kill the perpetrators to a thrilling and exciting gun battle in Pakistan, the film has a strong sense of danger and tension on an epic scale. The political machinations of the Mossad agency gives the film a real sense of depth as the plans set in motion clearly describe.

However, beneath the film's quality aspects lies a message about the nature of violence. The Mossad agent (Bana, The Hulk) wants to kill the ones responsible for the killing of the Israeli athletes and does so with extreme prejudice. Soon, as the film goes on, he begins to doubt the nature of his actions and is about to give up. The real question boils down to one conclusion: Violence begets more violence. There really is no solution as far as world conflicts is concerned. This film sends a strong message about vengeance and its tragic and horrific results by those who believe in a ""eye for an eye"". Even in the war on terrorism, this message hints at the conflict in Iraq. Just because America ousted Saddam Hussein from power does not mean that the conflict in the Middle East isn't going to go away. Sadly, it is America and as well as the world, that does not realize that fact.

Truly, a action thriller with brains and heart. Worth seeing at the box office.",9
13 February 2006,Watch with a BIG pinch of salt,"I really cannot believe what I just saw.

Each epic film he makes has the power to write historic events into the minds of the viewer in ways beyond any experience could manifest.

With such power at his hand, wouldn't an abuse of that power be a crime against humanity itself - I ask?

This brings me to the issue I would like to raise.

The Hollywood machine has always been seen as being Jewish controlled, and when Spielberg made Schinders List - the whole world felt the pain of the Jews during those dark times. A political film? Yes. but the period was quite far into the past - and clearly enough evidence was at hand to say that the film could be an accurate story to represent that time/ events in history in a light of truth. An acceptable work of cinema art - and wonderful performances matched with a passionate effort all round.

But now, with the release of his most political film yet... Munich - it seems that his loyalties are clear. And much to my disappointment, this film goes against everything that true film makers should stand for.

Is it that after 23 films, his 24th must pay tribute to the financial forces that have helped him make the last 23 - with little or no intervention to date?... has he been pruned by the Zionists to finally show his true purpose in later life? - A cheap merchant of propaganda for the neo conservative/ Zionist world bankers, who are attempting to enslave us all into a global fascist state?

It seems Spielberg has made his loyalties clear, and they don't rest with the peaceful human beings on this planet fighting for freedom, but the evil forces at work to promote this never ending war on terrorism. He has clearly sided with the real terrorists - the establishment that hold us in constant fear to control us all and take away our potential for a peaceful future on this planet.

Artists have a responsibility at this crucial time in history. To bring us the truth, and to shine the light for humanity. - but it seems that now is crunch time - ""you are either with us , or with the terrorists"" as Bush bluntly puts it.

After seeing this film Spielberg has made his stance clear, which deeply disappoints me. It's a similar feeling to finding out that Michael Jackson was a child molester (not that it's true) and all of those memories that have become part of the person I am have been shattered.

Munich is a blatant Zionist propaganda film.

From the start to the finish, you can feel the shame in the acting - and as the controversial story unfolds.. the pro Israeli viewpoint is as clear as can be.

I accuse all involved in that film of selling their soul.... true artists - certainly not. more like mere pawns in the illuminati's agenda to brainwash us all to believe what we see and hear - and to not ask questions.. after all how could someone like Steven Spielberg tell lies... they wouldn't go to the trouble of making such a big budget film and get it all wrong, would they?

Well, the answer is not so simple. There are so many inconsistencies in that film. Too many to mention here. I assume whoever is reading this, has already seen the film and may have read some of the main points brought up against this film.

To make a film about one of the most controversial political events in history is asking for trouble. And to package it up with such a pro Israeli, and very obvious link to the 911 tragedy/ war on terror, is even more astounding.

The killer for me was the very last shot of the film showing the New York skyline (with the 2 towers in the background) and the text overlaid "" NINE of the ELEVEN terrorists involved in the Munich killings were killed"" - - Spot the Subliminal???? do they really think that we are that dumb?

If you ask me this film is an insult to the intelligence of whoever watches it... and confirms that these powerful Zionists think we are like sheep who will simply accept anything we see in the cinema.

It is also a known fact that Hollywood does screening tests on small audiences of around 200 people before releasing a film, and makes changes to the edit based on this small snapshot of people's views... do they think we are all the same (like sheep) or what???

The film Munich to me was not a work of art from the heart of a true film maker, but a reluctantly made payback to the dark forces that have funded this amazing director for his entire career.... is it crunch time now to show which side YOUR on?

Shame on you Steven Spielberg, you have turned your back on us all.. and you are too damn intelligent and talented to be excused for ignorance on this one... At least we know who's side your on now.",4

15 May 2006,As good as it accurate,"When I first heard about this movie, I had no clue what it was about. So I researched it and I found myself interested in seeing it. When I went to see it I was expecting a long movie with only partial action. But I was surprised at the action and plot of the story. I definitely think that Munich was one of Speilbergs best films. I liked how the movie was almost 100% accurate and how it had a great cast. Although it only had two real famous actors in it, I liked the rest of the cast too. I think Spielberg did a great job at showing his view of the Munich massacre. The movie also has a great amount of suspense. There are things you will definitely expect when it comes to the killings and there are things that you wouldn't expect. Overall, I think this movie was excellent, I definitely recommend seeing it. Another thing I liked is how it shows a group of five ordinary men working for a secret service, taking out the men who planned Black September, later on you will learn that these five men are not alone and that there were many groups like them trying to accomplish the same goal in taking out the organizers. I said it once and i will say it again, I definitely recommend seeing this movie, it may seem slow in the beginning but it only gets better with the action and drama. Definitely a 10 out of 10 film.",10
14 May 2006,Comparison to Sword of Gideon,"I really find it hard to believe that all the hype concerning Munich fails to even mention a film entitled ""Sword of Gideon"" that was made some 20 years earlier. That film, starring Steven Bauer, Rod Steiger and Michael York raised the same moral issues as Munich but in a much more subtle way. I found Spielberg's ""hit you over the head"" commentary on the moral of the film condescending. I also believe the acting in ""Sword of Gideon"" was much better. The story line in ""Sword of Gideon"" was more logical and left the viewer with very few unanswered questions regarding its development.

I really think somebody (hopefully an honest critic) should compare the two movies so that others can learn of the existence of ""Sword of Gideon and then decide for themselves which movie is better.

28 December 2005,Munich comments,"Unfortunately, I've lost quite a bit of respect for Steven Spielberg. The movie did not represent factual events with the exception of the actual tragedy that occurred in Munich (and that was a small part of the movie). Spielberg equated terrorists with innocent civilians and depicted the Jewish/Israeli people as cold-blooded murderers who would stop at nothing in the name of their homeland. This movie wasn't about the tragic aftermath of the the events at Munich. Instead, this movie was about the consciences of the Jews when seeking out the terrorists. The movie was about sympathy for terrorists who killed 11 athletes in cold blood. Perhaps Spielberg should get his facts straight before imposing his false view on the world. Clearly, the only murderers in this tragedy were those who devised and executed the operation to brutally kill innocent athletes. This movie was beyond offensive.

28 December 2005,"Give your viewers some credit, Steve.","I'll cut right to the chase here. This movie is, among other things, a shameless effort on Mr. Spielberg's part to cast Israelis in a positive light. He was clearly trying to send the message that Israelis kill sparingly, judiciously, and grudgingly. Anyone with a television should know that this is not the truth. I have always respected Spielberg for directing films that were believable as well as meaningful. In that respect, this was by far his poorest work.

I was particularly annoyed with the scene where the Israeli assassins made great effort to avoid killing the young daughter of one of their targets. Most of us have seen many news reports (even in the American media) of Israeli helicopters and fighter jets launching missiles into crowded Palestinian streets to assassinate a single man riding in a car, and we're supposed to believe that Israeli assassins gave two shits about one little Arab girl? The Israelis are notorious for their liberal and undiscriminating use of lethal force. Come on, Steve. Give your viewers some credit.

I did, however, very much appreciate the story's allusion to the fact that all the tit-for-tat fighting builds paranoia on both parts and only serves to escalate the violence. Additionally (and although I'm sure it falls on deaf ears in the White House) I thought the reference to the fact that killing one ""terrorist"" will only result in many more taking his place was highly appropriate.

Underlying messages aside, I give the movie a 6 out of 10. Although a bit slow and repetitive, the cast was well picked and acting was very believable. Eric Bana turned out to be an excellent choice for his role, which was surprising considering his embarrassing role of Hector in ""Troy"".",6
21 April 2013,A visit to the tragic time,"Steven Spielberg, is the most efficient director in Hollywood. It takes a classic work of art to take you back into some period and make you experience what the people would have faced. Steve has done this with perfection. The execution of the film, has been absolutely spectacular. It makes you feel as if you are in the middle of the things and makes your heart go out to them. The script has been written in a brilliant manner and the scenes of the massacre are heart tearing, I am sure a few tears would be rolling down. The music and images drill deep inside you and leave a lasting impact. From the performances point of view Eric bana stands out, has been the best suited to the role. Perhaps this can be surely called one of his best performance ever. Daniel craig looks good as an aggressive israeli, but could have been better. Geoffrey rush and other cast has done a great job too.. All in all it was an eric bana film. Perhaps, that was the only thing lacking in the film, what could have been shown as a movie for the nation with a bigger perspective, in some scenes was left restricted to a single man movie. But that definitely does not take the credit away from it being a superb movie, which should be watched by everyone.",7
22 February 2006,Over long and mostly lame...strangely hollow and unsatisfying.,"I cannot believe that something as obviously ""b"" grade as this has received as many positive reviews. It HAS to be very unlikely to win anything at Oscar time.

This film was apparently rushed out...it looks it! Is this really directed by Spielberg...it strains credulity. Israeli film students maybe? It does have some merit in it's attempt at portrayal of human weaknesses on both sides, yet it seems strangely lifeless and contrived in most scenes. Mostly hollow characters with shallow lines...terrorism and revenge are disturbing and messy business though. We get that part ;>(

By the too-long awaited end, the major point appears to be, as said in the movie, ""Don't mess with the Jews"" BTW...anybody agree that guy Bana would play a killer Jim Morrison? Save your money and wait for the $1.99 special on a rainy day.

12 February 2006,"Good first half, uneven second half","This is a heavy movie, dealing with a heavy subject in a heavy manner. The first part is good and deserves a score of 7. This part has a well told story full of suspense and great character building. Most important of all, the first part leaves some questions unanswered and as a spectator you look forward to have them answered. You have the feeling that something is going on behind the scenes? Also, some interesting ethical questions are raised about the mission and the assassinations.

Unfortunately the second part doesn't quite deliver, and ""only"" deserves a score of 5. The pace of the movie is dramatically reduced and all the suspense from the first part is killed off by predictability. Spielberg also becomes so focused on showing the view of both sides (the Palestinian and Israeli), that the story and dialog becomes clumsy. It's not exactly bad, but it wasn't enough to keep me from staring at the clock.

It is as if Spielberg wants to include everything in one movie. He wants to deliver an exciting story with suspense, some great undercover-agent elements and interesting characters. He also wants to deal with some heavy issues about the legitimacy of killing, the definition of loyalty towards one country, the problem of having or not having a home, the emotional and familial side-effects of being part of a manhunt, both as the hunter and the hunted. Additionally he tries to fit the Palestinian point of view into a story that is already full. All of the intentions are great. All of the dilemmas above are interesting, but trying to fit them into one movie results in an uneven and clumsily told story that doesn't know what leg to stand on.",6
23 December 2005,"Thoughts on ""Munich""...(Spoiler)","Just saw Munich this afternoon in NYC on 42nd street.

Like most everyone else in the city today, I got off early from work and caught the 3:10 showing of Munich, (the 2:40 was sold out) Ten dollars and seventy five cents, thank you very much...

After an endless bombardment of pre-movie videos and trailers... (Can't believe someone thought that remaking ""The Pink Panther"" with Steve Martin was a good idea..boggles the mind)..Munich began not so promptly at 3:25. Using the vintage video footage of Jim McKay (RIP) and Peter Jennings (RIP) triggered memories of the actual event for me, since I was a Spud of 16 or so in 1972.

Munich is a very compelling film, but not the best of 2005, I still prefer ""A History of Violence,"" as a superior piece of original film-making. The character studies were superb, as were nearly all of the acting performances...no complaints there..but ultimately you leave the theatre with a sense of survival and perhaps in a mild state of shock, simply because of the intensity of the story..reminds me the way I felt after seeing ""The Killing Fields."" Not exactly a ""feel-good"" experience...

But

I was fascinated to see how a ""Black-Ops"" mission would be set up and run by a small team of special contract agents...takes a whole lot of money. So although I didn't regret seeing Munich, not sure if I would recommend this movie to anyone else, only to people interested in the Historical aspects of the story. Gotta admire Spielberg though-- he took on a very tough assignment, and did a remarkably balanced job bringing it to the screen. Kudos

Eric Bana is likely to receive a Best Acting nomination. Kind of bizarre seeing two Aussies (Geoffrey Rush was Bana's ""handler"") playing Mossad agents. They pulled it off. Though Rush's accent wasn't nearly as authentic as Bana's...

Anyway, ""Munich"" is really more of an accomplishment as a mostly-truthful historical recreation, than a fun movie-going experience. And that ain't necessarily a bad thing.

Best scene: The Short Wave radio in an Athens safe-house picks up a Motown station..and the inhabitants can agree on the universal appeal of American Soul Music...

21 June 2006,Where can I get that leather backpack?,"I saw Munich last week and I thought it was great! Eric Bana is so handsome and his wife in the movie was very pretty too. They had very good chemistry together.

Does anyone know where I can find the brown leather backpack that Eric Bana (Avner) uses when he takes money out of the bank? I've looked high and low but without knowing who makes it, etc. I'm not having much luck finding one.

My husband would absolutely love to have one like it ... he loves men's bags, clutches and backpacks. I'd love to surprise him with it on his birthday in October. Please send me an e-mail if you know where I can get one. Thank You!

28 January 2006,Why Spielberg is still the best,"I haven't been too impressed with Spielbergs recent output after being left distinctly underwhelmed by WotW and Catch Me If You Can but this film is absolutely incredible. It takes a truly great director with the deftest of touches to be able to create a film that manages to get across the horror and pain of violent acts and the impact they have on those who commit them as well as the victims, while at the same time refusing to take sides or to be sympathetic to either point of view. The violent scenes are explicit without being gratuitous, shockingly real and, quite rightly, repulsive. Spielberg has said that if he does this film right, both sides will hate it and it's true - this film seems to act as a mirror in which anyone who has an opinion going in will be forced to face that opinion and their own conscience. Eric Bana is superb as the increasingly tortured soul tasked with serving his country, at first willingly - his doubt and paranoia growing over the course of the film. Compare this to the one-sided Black Hawk Down and it is clear why Spielberg is THE greatest director of our time. I am writing this days after seeing the film and it still with me, playing on my mind. A great example of how powerful cinema can be when done properly",8
30 January 2006,Intense,"This is the only movie where I cannot decide what to think of it. It started with a tense atmosphere and ended just the same. The killings of both the terrorists and the assassins were horrific; I could not stop squirming in my seat. However I thought this was a great touch to the movie; it was brave enough to show the terror of what happened. It did not protect the audience by shielding the images. It showed everything.Sometimes people need to be shown horror in order for them to understand how terrible the events were.

The movie reminded me of Black Hawk Down but Munich does not let you go home routing for the protagonist. It allows you to see why Palestinians and Israelies are raged at each other and what each wants. I could not say the Palestinians were monsters or that the Israelies were animals. I empathized with both and felt sympathy for the innocent.

This movie shows how hopeless it is to find peace if we act upon vengeance and destruction. The spite was there a thousand years ago, it was there in 1972 and it is still here today in 2006. Will it continue till 2050...it probably will.",8
24 May 2013,"Politicide is so mean. (or, (whining) ""...but~ it's~not~fair!"")","Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's ""Munich"" seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. ""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, ""When does it ever end?""

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. ""Munich"" could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul. ""When does it ever end?"" Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",9
13 January 2006,Apologist garbage,"MUNICH is Steven Spielberg's film about the alleged squad of deep cover Mossad agents sent out by Golda Meir and Israel to assassinate 11 people believed to be behind the Black September Hostage crisis at the 1972 Munich Olympics.

Either all the reviewers who saw this movie saw a different cut of it than I did, or they are simply drawing conclusions that are neither argued by the film nor realized by the main character.

This is one of the most boring and disappointing movies of Spielberg's that I have seen in recent years. And that is after THE TERMINAL and WAR OF THE WORLDS.

However, because of the wretchedness of the script and general waste of the actors (who all attempt to elevate the awful material) it is apparent that this is one of Director of Photography Janusz Kaminski's finest works.

The use of ""70s"" styles in zoom, color palette, movement are combined skillfully with more modern techniques. However, all this is in service of an apologist diatribe about why Israel should behave like animals because they're ""enemy"" is willing to sink lower. However, the film instead ended up being proof positive regarding the ""righteousness"" of the Israeli revenge.

Not a good movie. Not worth seeing. Shameful, really.",3
6 August 2006,Small glimpses of genius fade under this average film,"Steven Spielberg's Munich has been compared inaccurately with Schindler's List. I find a resemblance not with this masterpiece, but with one of the less remembered films of Spielberg: Amistad.

Why does Munich remind me of Amistad if Munich is the story of the revenge the Israeli government took after the Munich assassinations and Amistad is the story of a group of African slaves unjustly taken to America and their trial? Simply, because in both Spielberg shows how excellent and terrible he is.

Amistad has one of the best moments in Cinema History I've ever seen. Of course, I'm talking about the slaves' story told crudely as it is. Spielberg is terrific at these dramatic, overwhelming scenes. Still, the rest of Amistad is boring, pretentious and looks extremely false on screen. This is exactly the same problem Munich has.

There are two great scenes in Munich: The attack on Beirut and the different scenes of what happened at Munich. Spielberg creates memorable, crude scenes that don't let us even move. But the rest of Munich feels fake and pretentious. The dialogs sound extremely fake and overall most scenes are boring and confusing. Why? Because Spielberg is not at the small stuff: Give him tough, dramatic scenes, not two people speaking. Oh, and PLEASE...DON'T LET HIM DO ANOTHER LOVE SCENE. Munich's two love scenes are two of the worst I've ever seen.

Now, about the acting: Eric Bana can't act. His performance is ridiculous and predictable. Daniel Craig delivers a good performance but ultimately his character is shadowed by everything else on screen. Mainly because his character is poorly written. There were two fascinating performances on-screen in Munich, and neither of them got over 3 minutes of screen-time. I'm talking about Omar Metwally as Ali, an Arab terrorist and Lynn Cohen as Golda Meir, Israel's prime minister. Metwally's performance is subtle yet harsh, just what the whole movie tried to be.

I've already written about the screenplay and how it has fake dialogs. But, I haven't mentioned the screenplay's greatest fault that was accentuated by Spielberg's poor directing in most scenes: Contrary to popular belief, I thought the characters' feelings of guilt, regret and fear weren't showed correctly on screen. All you see is Avner (Eric Bana) ripping his bed and destroying his phone, but his feelings aren't shown correctly on screen.

So, in conclusion, Munich has genius scenes that are shadowed by the rest of the film.

20 January 2007,An Apolitical Comment,"Update on the below: Can no one comment on my query about this weird, baffling indoor mist or fog that appears in nearly all of Spielberg's films????

The merits and weaknesses, as well as the political complexities of this film, have been chewed over and plowed up for 71 pages of IMDb, and I do not have the time to read any more of them. Since this film is now being aired on HBO hereabouts, I'm presuming there will be 2007 comments now made. This is one of them, but I'm focusing only on one personal objection to nearly every one of Spielberg's films. Perhaps somewhere in the above 71 pages, this objection has also been raised; my apologies if so.

What I'm commenting on is the fact that in so many INTERIOR scenes of his films, including MUNICH, there is this foglike miasma drifting past the people and the furniture. Nobody ever comments on this fog. Nobody seems to notice it. There is always some source of light illuminating this interior fog, usually the sun slanting through the windows. It's present in ET, AI, COLOR PURPLE, SCHINDLER'S LIST, on and on ad nauseum, and now in MUNICH. It occurs in three interior settings of Munich. I am baffled as to what Spielberg is trying to convey with this annoying technique. Every time I witness it, regardless of the nature of his film, I am distracted from the rest of the scene. This cannot be the singular decision of Spielberg's cinematographer; it has to be at the director's order. Why? Were this dusty mist occurring in just his sci fi films, well OK. But it isn't.",
24 February 2006,Spielberg missed what could have been a great movie,"I have waited for this movie with great anticipation, and maybe that is the reason that i got such a bad impression about it. I think he should have stuck to the historical facts and just put he's genius print on it instead of trying to make out of something to prove a point with.

I kinda knew what it was about when the movie first started and those guys helped the terrorist over the fence, by which he tried to implement that thing right from the start, that you can't know who's next to you and all that. Then Avner feeling awful, doubting himself and trusting nobody just didn't fit in with his profile. Then Ephraim was pathetic the whole movie and the script had some very poor, and logically unbalanced lines.

Anyway there is a lot to tell but i never liked long reviews..

So.. if you wanna watch a movie that tells things how they were you got the wrong movie. if you want one that talks about how bad it is being a killer and what it could do to your life you got the right one.. and still i think they did a poor job at showing that.

PS This movie is 2005 right? How come the WTC where up in the last scene?",2
8 January 2006,"Good story, but a bit long","I really anticipated this film. I read the book on which it is based, as well as a well-researched book One Day in September.

I have to say I was a bit disappointed by the film in some respects. The event is, on it's own, a great story. But this movie could have been made about any sort of movie that involves murder and then revenge. Even, perhaps, about a murderer who is subsequently executed by the government.

I didn't feel a connection to the main character. I sympathized with him, somewhat, but he certainly didn't seem to be a leader in any sense of the word. What was his background?

Did this movie make me feel any more sympathy for the terrorists? No, nor for the victims.

I did find the movie good at pointing out ironies about the world and various governments.

For instance, Israel is anti-death penalty, yet marks people for assassination without benefit of a trial. And then keeps this 'hit list' growing.",
12 February 2006,Misogynists delight,"Whilst I enjoyed the the exploding telephone, mattress and TV sets,with attendant suspense as to whether they'd go off and if so with how big an explosion, Europe was far too sketchy(even the London rain looks more like NY's, and pillar box, phone box and double-decker bus in a rapid chain of frames just look ridiculous- almost as bad as all the nine-branched candlesticks for the benefit of thickos in the later mother/son farewell scene) acting was weak and it went on too long, especially the meals. The worst bit, though, was the prolonged death scene on the houseboat with the woman staggering about half-naked, having been shot twice, then left full-frontal streaming blood in a deckchair. And is it just me who objects when a whole room of nasty men all slavering to have a go can blame a woman for giving the final order? Sheila

10 January 2006,Spielberg makes another masterpiece,"This is an excellent screenplay on all parts. The acting is spot on, the writing was excellent, and the direction was astounding. Spielberg speaks out and reveals the ""war on terror"" for what it really is, a senseless cycle of violence that hurts people on both sides, and forces us to look at it from both points of view: make special note of the scene where Avner is talking to the PLO member in the safehouse in Greece. You could say that this movie drags on, but the director is simply giving the scenes room to breathe and giving the movie the closure it deserves. Also, Bullit fans will notice Daniel Craig's likeness to Steve McQueen (which I'm sure Spielberg intended). It more than makes up for his recent 2005 throwaway flick ""War of the Worlds"" ... I'm sorry, but Tom Cruise is so far overrated it isn't funny. This is quite simply one of Spielberg's best works to date.

4 June 2006,Steven Spielberg tackles a highly controversial subject with commendable tact and grace. I only hope that the same can be said of my review. Boobs! That doesn't count,"Ahoy there mateys! I'm legendary seafaring movie expert Captain Remington, but that's just what my crew calls me you can call me Sir! Hop aboard my mighty vessel and I'll take you on a wondrous voyage across the ocean of cinematic entertainment! You're about to set sail on the greatest ship ever to float around in the water, the good ship HMS Supercool! Pardon me for a moment while I address the crew.

Avast me hearties! We be about do get this boat underway! If any of ye know of any reason why this ship should not be sailed, let ye speak now or forever hold ye peace! Very well! Pull my anchor! Hoist the main sailor! Man the lifeboats! Full steam ahead! Raise the undercarriage! Let's get this ship on the road! Arr! Tis a wonderful day to sail on the ocean of cinematic entertainment. The sky is blue, the waves are blue, my sailing hat is blue. Everything is blue, which is good. Can I offer you a lime? Take one for later, you can never have enough limes when you're at sea. (Sniff-sniff) There be a salty scent upon the breeze! Must be all the hot seamen on this boat! Take a break crew! Don't tire yourselves out so soon. I don't want my hot, sticky seamen to fall all over the deck. What a mess that would make! All of you have a rest. Have a lime or two.

Arrrr! I suppose ye will be wondering why I called you out here onto the high seas today. We're sea-urchin for treasure! Ha ha, a little nautical humour there! Just the thing when you're out on the movie ocean. Look yonder - there's James Cameron, he's still on the Titanic! Let it go James! Everybody knows that your boat is rubbish. Move on! There are plenty more boat fish in the entertainment sea I hear there might be an opening on the Poseidon! Har har har! Row me hearties, row! Break time's over! Three hundred and sixty degrees starport! Swab the poop deck! It's the deck that you just can't swab enough, in my opinion. Row you wretched knaves! I want to reach port before we run out of limes! Limes prevent scurvy, and the last thing I need is the health and safety people on my back. They'll hoist me from the yardarm, or worse -they'll make me walk the plank! Then some other health and safety people will make THEM walk the plank because it was unsafe for them to make me walk the plank, and so the cycle will go on.

Arrrrrr! Curse this blasted eye-patch! It be starting to itch again! It be impressive though, I'm sure ye would agree. I fashioned it myself out of a man's jock strap that I found in the skip that's outside my house. I mean outside the boat.

Now listen up me buckos! The treasure we be seeking today in this metaphorical ocean is a fishy one! Tuna fish to be exact! I reckon we've rowed out far enough now, bring in the nets boys and lets see what we find Arrrrrrrr! I thought this might happen! Sometimes when ye be fishing for a bland tuna movie in the sea of entertainment, ye occasionally find that ye have snared a dolphin-movie in your nets! The dolphin is a more intelligent breed of fish than your average tuna: dolphins can communicate with each other, they have complex social interactions and there have even been reported sightings of some dolphins wearing monocles. When ye accidentally catch a dolphin-movie ye be faced with a tricky dilemma: do ye beat the dolphin to death with an oar and throw it back overboard, or do ye take the more difficult option? Do ye crack open the movie dolphin's skull and eat its intelligent dolphin brain? Personally, I believe that it would be a shame to waste a perfectly good dolphin.

Steven Spielberg's Munich IS that movie-dolphin brain. Not a taste that everyone would enjoy perhaps, but if ye hunger for something more intelligent than this is the one for ye. Arrrrrrrrrrrr! I bet ye thought I was never going to steer this review onto the right course! Munich is great! Eat limes! www.chipremington.com - Delivering expert movie criticism to almost 6 readers a month",10

27 December 2005,expected more from Spielberg,"All the hype about Munich got to me. ""Exclusive Spielberg's Secret Masterpiece, "" said the front page of the December 12, 2005 Time magazine. ""So sensitive it was kept under wraps, Munich is his boldest...."" I had to see it and was very disappointed. It was not much different from the original 2 hour-28 minute ""Sword of Gideon"" with Steven Bauer, Michael York, Rod Steiger, and Colleen Dewhurst (1986). Directed by Michael Anderson (Around the World in 80 Days, Chase a Crooked Shadow, The Shoes of a Fisherman, Logan's Run, etc.)

If you've seen ""Gideon..."" you've seen Munich. The wonderful musical score by John Williams was enjoyable, as was the portrayal of Golda by Lynn Cohen and Avner by Eric Bana. I expected more from Spielberg and didn't get it. This is a movie I should have waited to see for ""free"" on TV. Two, maybe three, stars for this one.

10 July 2008,Thrilling and Deep,"One of the reasons I like listening to George Carlin is because he examines big themes that encompass all of society, like war and racism, but also themes that concern individuals, right down to ""people who use quotation marks in the air while they're talking."" A similar thing draws me to Munich. Munich is about the conflict in Israel, but it is also about how a few men handle being assassins, and how one man handles having some of his closest friends killed. I really liked how there were a bunch of scenes where people died, but the death isn't dramatized or slowed down. It almost happens faster than you expect, which creates a good effect. Munich also does a good job of not being preachy. I think Spielberg said something like ""10 people could walk into this movie and come out thinking 10 different things about what it said about the Israel conflict."" Spielberg does a good job of giving a voice to a lot of the viewpoints surrounding the conflict but not hitting you over the head with any them, letting you wrestle with them. The events in the movie seemed to say ""This is real. People are going to die senselessly no matter what course of action is taken,"" but they didn't seem to be trying to pushing you to one side of the issue. Definitely a solid movie.

A minor point: The Mosad in real life is the most advanced intelligence agency in the world. The Mosad in this movie is pretty f**king stupid.",9

25 February 2006,What can I say.... few movies bring tears to my eyes,"A strong movie with quite a lot of questions asked but not always answered. A movie with over all strong performance by superb but not always ""star"" actors. Does violence breed violence?? What is wonderful about this movie is that the actors never rule the story. All actors are subdued by a story, very strong and believe it or not very non partial. I've never in my life felt 164 minutes pass with such ease. Spielberg really sticks his neck out on this one but on the other hand he raises a lot of questions that applies on 1972 as well as today. Violence always breeds violence! Doesn't it? In any way this movie in my mind clearly competes with other movies nominated this year. None of them... in my mind are as important as ""Munich"" a year as this...

2 February 2006,And the Oscar goes to...?,"Let me start by saying that this year's Oscar nominated pictures are, contrary to the popular argument, by no means weaker than the films we heard about so much last year. In fact, the opposite seems true.

Last year's battle was truly one of the giants - between Martin Scorsese and Clint Eastwood, Johnny Depp and Leo DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx and... Jamie Foxx, Hilary Swank and Kate Winslet. All relatively, most indisputably big names, and not too many surprises at the end of the day (unless one counts MDB's eventual triumph, predicted by Ebert the night before).

That being said, we all know that the Big Five are more about the issues they raise than the people they feature, and last year the issues tackled could not have made a greater contrast with the big names behind the production. The best picture candidates studied the life of a peculiar individual, individual struggle with death, an individual's quest for identity, the life of a peculiar individual, and an individual struggle with death. Of course, one might and probably should further try to differentiate - Million Dollar Baby and Finding Neverland deal with the issue of life and death in a drastically different fashion, even as Ray and Hughes were two different and distinctive characters. Yet the sight that emerges reveals more than slight a tendency for intimate storytelling, or films that are interested in one's personal struggle rather than larger-than-life issues.

This year the direction of research and acknowledgment go the other way.

Among the Big Five, only Capote appears to look inward. Brokeback Mountain, Crash, Good Night and Good Luck, Munich all study issues critical to our day and age, i.e. life in our complex world in general. BM relates a story of two American men living a lie - a tragedy readily applicable to a number of gay people in this country, Crash studies racial stereotypes, while GN&GL masterfully reapplies a past conflict in the present situation by merely retelling a modern legend and letting the viewer's mind do the math.

Which brings us to Munich. I must say that Spielberg has been a disappointment to me lately. The man has far too much greatness and vision to be wasting his time on the likes of Minority Report, Catch Me if You Can, or War of the Worlds. There are a number of directors who could have done those and fared at least as well. To complete the picture of an utter waste of talent which Spielberg the director has been for precisely seven years now we'll say that, in spite of their occasional glimpses of greatness, The Terminal and A.I. both fared rather poorly in achieving their goals.

With Munich Spielberg repeats what he had already once accomplished with Saving Private Ryan (how that movie lost the Best Picture to an amusing, but totally inferior to it Shakespeare in Love, will forever remain a mystery), and that is an unbiased look at the events that, once having touched millions of lives, continued to change them in dramatic ways beyond repair and to the point of no return.

A brilliant study of an historical event with its consequences and ramifications, Munich wastes no time on individual actors' efforts. That is not to say that such efforts are not readily encountered courtesy of Eric Bana who wears his character every step of Avner's downward journey, or Daniel Craig who seems to be warming up for his first 007 outing, but merely that the circumstance they and other characters find themselves in is one of such magnitude that it becomes simply impossible to dedicate too much attention to these more than mildly interesting individuals.

As Saving Private Ryan once was, Munich too is chalk full of scenes of sheer and utter brilliance. A dialog between Avner and a Muslim springs to mind: one of the men yet does not know that the other is his greatest enemy and speaks freely on certain matters, meanwhile the other's face is a case study of generations that have lived through a war. There is no way I will hereby spoil Avner's eventual change reflected via, in perhaps more than one way a climactic scene, but I will say this: the pain of millions of people has never been documented out in a manner as frighteningly beautiful as that single scene.

Two things need to be said about Munich, as this motion picture begins to gather pace in the Best Picture race. Unlike Brokeback Mountain and Crash, two incredibly beautiful, thought provoking, and masterfully executed films, Munich strikes one with its lack of partiality. It does not criticize, but neither does it support any single decision that we watch its characters make. While Brokeback Mountain and Crash suggest alternatives (and Crash goes as far as implement such, too), Munich has really nothing to say with regard to its subject matter. Rather, when all is said and done, the viewer is left stunned and wondering if they agree with Avner's choice, or even if Avner himself sees it as right. This remarkable impartiality is, however, not the greatest thing about Munich.

The greatest strength of this film is its status of an eyewitness of the events far surpassing the suffering of the gay people in the present day United States, or the pain of the immigrants and people of color who often find themselves subject to life-long humiliation. The pain documented out in Munich surpasses that suffered by the above groups of individuals because the movie portrays death in such an ordinary way, and human life as worth so little a price, that the viewer cannot help but wonder if the whole affair might be one giant exaggeration.

It is not. And that is why on the night of the 2006 Academy Awards, after all is said and done, Munich will emerge with a single award - but one it deserves the most: the Best Picture.",8
8 January 2006,One of Spielberg's Best Movies Yet,"The mixed reactions to this movie isn't surprising, there are few movies that balance action and psychological drama well. Unfortunately, what that means for movie views is that those that are attracted to the first part of the film may not understand or like the ending and vis versa. If you appreciate exploring social problems in the cinema, you will probably love this movie. If you hate following complex and at times psychologically driven plots, you may want to wait to see this film. The acting is excellent, the interweaving of stories through the main character is thoughtful and well placed, and the direction and shooting of the film, as always with Spielberg, is great.

I would very much like to see this movie pick up a few Oscars. I haven't seen many movies that I think accurately capture the internal struggles that have existed and continue to exist in the Middle East. Although, I don't think audiences should expect anything more then the focus on the specific events following the Olympics in Munich.

25 January 2006,very borderline,"This was a very interesting movie, it wasn't good enough for me to watch the credits and it wasn't bad enough to walk out of. Eric Bana plays the role brilliantly as did Geoffrey Rush (thats good Aussie talent)however I thought there was a lot of unnecessary violence in it. I do realize to make such a tragedy realistic you need violence but not to this extent, all through out the movie there was bits and pieces going everywhere.

and also a lot of nudity, I mean it doesn't need to be in there, this could have been a great M rated movie...instead of a disturbing MA rating. That being said I do congratulate Spielberg on maintaining a good storyline and picking good actors. A good movie, could have been better, but there is still a chance for an Oscar

22 October 2006,Three wrongs don't make a right,"The story: During the summer Olympics in Munich 1972, the Israeli delegation are attacked and killed by Palestinian terrorists, who want the world's attention for the lack of a Palestinian state. In an attempt to strike back, the Mossad (the Israeli intelligence agency) appoint a bodyguard (Eric Bana) to lead a strike-team. Their mission: To kill 11 people responsible for this and other terrorist attacks.

The verdict: While the attack is a historic fact, it's blatantly obvious Spielberg either didn't do any research or has been terribly ill informed when accepting the rest of the script. (Another possibility could be poetic license, as ""inspired by real events"" is stated at the beginning of the movie). Anyone reading this knowing anything about the Mossad, the world most organized and respected intelligence service, will probably laugh of the idea that they would use a couple of guys with regular jobs who've never killed before for such delicate missions.

With this in mind, the film becomes almost unwatchable and certainly way too long. There is some reasonable acting, some quality pictures, but never did I have the feeling of watching a film that justified it's huge budget. Spending just a few dollars more on a reasonable script could have made this okay. Instead, it's boring most of the time and has a couple of very funny moments (not a good sign for a movie about such a serious subject). The script proves it's awfulness once more near the end, showing Bana having memories of events he wasn't even near at the time they happened. Depending on your mood, this scene can be either appalling or hilarious.

8 August 2006,Disappointing...but typical Spielberg.,"I keep hoping that this talented film maker will mature and resist the urge to invent new ways to portray graphic violence. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. There are many beautiful films out there made by little known directors who understand the fine art of allowing the actors to express human drama and emotion. Enough with the splattered brains and dangling severed limbs. Full frontal nudity on corpses...more cheap thrills. This film could have been great. He raised some interesting questions. The acting was excellent but I'm tired of being beat over the head with pointless flashbacks depicting carnage, unsuitable for people of all ages. ""Munich"" would benefit from about thirty minutes of editing.

13 May 2006,Good not Great,"Munich wants to be an important film. It uses the tragedy of the Munich Olympics to explore the effects of hatred and revenge on all involved parties especially the avengers. So I really wanted to feel moved and challenged by this cinematic dissertation on the subject much like I was with Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". I wasn't. That's not to say Munich is not worth watching. It is. Just be prepared for a sophisticated version of ""Death Wish"" except here it's based on a true story with more depth. Perhaps that is a trivialization of a film that does engage. But I was getting weary of the main characters finding different ways to blow up their targets. I wanted more about the clash and conflict of terrorists on both sides. Spielberg attempts to be objective and he is to a point. But both sides here have their justifications of what they did and why. No doubt neither side are purely evil or completely vindicated. What drives these people to the desperation resulting in such horrific actions is really what we should be attempting to understand. Instead Munich shows us how Israel got even and why that was tough on the avengers generating more violence. I suppose the music score should include a track titled ""It's hard out there for an avenger""! The acting is good across the board. Technically the film is well done. But Spileberg's direction, while competent, seems almost clinical in the depiction of this very relevant and timely subject.",5
24 December 2005,Worth all $10.50,"Undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year. Munich delivers a value-neutral approach to the tragedy of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, focusing not on the ethical superiority or inferiority of the parties involved but on the ultimate human tragedy of war and violence. Eric Bana delivers what I think is his best performance in years; he exhibits a skillful balance of humanity and brutality that makes his character realistic and believable.

Accusations of anti-Semitism made against the film are, in my view, unfounded. It simply portrays the perpetuity of pain and suffering caused by answering violence with violence, without answering the question of whether such a response would be justified by either side. Don't let your preconceptions about the Middle East, religion or any other issue prevent you from seeing this film. Come in with an open mind and you will leave feeling both rage and sorrow for both sides in the conflict.

25 February 2016,Brutal,"I don't usually write reviews on IMDb.com but after seeing this, I felt compelled to so here goes. It isn't often that I come across films like this or watch them but when I do I do enjoy it immensely. Coming from Steven Spielberg, I really expected a CGI fest or some sort of other ""wow"" factor. Well label me as surprised because I can honestly say that I think that this was the first Spielberg film that I would call a truly adult film: not adult as in ""top of the shelf adult"" (you dirty minders...you know who you are) but as an adult story. Non of the directors usual sentimentality or divulging into simplistic child like fantasy here. Based on the true story of the Black September aftermath, this film was a slow build up of tension and when it was at its peak, it threw in more tension. Yes I was bored through some of the scenes but the boredom (for me anyway) added to the tension and mood. It has been a long time since I've seen a film in which the emotions of the characters carry the film like this and I found it refreshing to see. The assassinations/murders as they happen are quick, brutal and downright shocking. Even if the viewer is clued up on the history of Black September...it still is a nail biting ride. A thinking mans film that answers some questions and leaves the viewer to ask some questions. Recommended.",7
24 July 2006,I didn't like this movie,"There was insufficient character development. The scenes depicting the Munich massacre were terribly realistic, but the terrorist when shown a few years later on was made to look like a Sunday School teacher. The five Israeli assassins did not come across as being particularly serious about their profession or even care that much about the assignment. When required to shoot their first target they fumbled so much I couldn't decide whether this was deliberate direction or misdirection. The movie had the assassins using different weapons, but apart from the obvious advantage of say, remotely detonated explosives over strangulation the movie didn't really explain why the different attack methods were deployed. The movie only hinted twice that the assassins were careful enough to clean up after themselves. Not only were they not thorough, they ran away from the scene. This would never have happened in real life. The assassins handled on site equipment without wearing gloves or even trying to destroy fingerprints. The director should know that forensic experts can find fingerprints on exploded surfaces. Also if a revolver is used, there are no spent cartridges to leave behind as clues as to what weapon was used. The movie didn't show how the informer managed to get any of his in",4
19 February 2006,the other side of Spielberg's paradigm,"The Jews had always been recipient to numerous conflicts and atrocities since the ages of antiquity. They had been involved in slavery, territorial conflicts, racial discrimination and struggle, religious controversies and several other misunderstanding; and for that the Jews are considered to be the most sensationalized race in this world.

The most often miserable fate of the Jews has countlessly been re-portrayed in film and has captured considerable sympathizers. Since the Jews had been in conflict with different races and countries, their never-ending history of war is not anymore new to the world. And movies with their struggle against countries like Egypt, Greece, Rome and Germany have continually haunted every audience.

It's expected that if it's a Stephen Spielberg movie that it's always disturbing and moving at the same time. It's always elevated to 'Art' status and will never fail to influence the audience because of its natural feel and transcending direction and cinematography – cinema that gets through your veins and drags you into feeling the real experience.

While Spielberg had been fascinated in filming his kin's dreadful experiences in the past as the victims and losers of human abomination, Munich however gives us another perspective where the usual victims no longer play as martyrs but vengeful heroes of their own race. The story is a deviation to the usual portrayal of the Jews' martyrdom and exposes their innate nature for revenge.

Spielberg didn't reside on what just actually happened on the Munich Olympics hostage tragedy and its aftermath but he tried to depict the characters' dilemma on their given assignments since the predefined missions were not really clear and pure. Although the veil of nationalism and justice was the major pretext of their elders, Avner was caught between conspiracies he had no clue of and would somehow fail to understand unless his elders feed him the truth. The already sensationalized history of the Arab-Israeli conflict has smoothly shifted to the dilemma of the character and his allies, giving us a point of view that we need to reconsider and reflect.

It's again a masterpiece and one could just imagine how Spielberg was able to harmonize and give rhythm to a number of short scenes on the movie to create an overall theme of pure drama and portrayal of the effects of the Black September tragedy in Munich to the individuals related and to the world.",8

3 February 2006,Boring?,"I saw the movie last night and I think it's a complete bore...Nothing to say about the tragical historical events (which speak for themselves) but if I want to see a documentary, I rather sit on my sofa and watch it... But this movie? It has no rhythm, it is excessively long, acting is too often too bad, some scenes are excessive (blood and gore, without any reason for that) and, in the end, nothing remains of a tragedy that shook the whole world. Coming to actors, although usually good, Eric Bana is simply embarrassing (it seems like he took a ""sad and suffering look"" from the first minute to the last...no changes were allowed). Geoffrey Rush takes his role directly from Gordon Jackson's Mr. Cowley (The Professionals) and seems to have fun with it, with the difference that Jackson is better....Lonsdale is the only one saving the bunch. Honestly, I don't see any other ""real"" actor in here. According to me, a very weak movie that confirms the end of Mr Spielberg's state of grace......I hope there won't be any further Indy....

18 February 2006,Misleading Movies,"Firstly let me point out that I really enjoyed this film. I thought that Eric Bana and Danial Craig were fantastic! But...... sadly as with many historical films the facts become distorted by opinion. Seeing that Spielberg is of course Jewish he knowingly or unknowingly made Israel to be the victims of this terrible time. The facts being that both sides are the victims and the criminals. Directors and Producers should not try to sway public opinion with these distorted facts. I just ask that you all to watch this film with an open mind and with the knowledge that in war and terror there is blame on both sides, equally. However, as far as a cinematic experience goes, don't miss it! Danial Craig proves he is more than worthy of the James Bond casting and Eric Bana just goes from strength to strength.

3 June 2006,Pure Fantasy,"I hope that people do not ascribe any accuracy to the screenplay. It is ridiculous to think that a group of assassins gather at the last moment before commencing operations and get to know one another. Furthermore, the lead was completely untrained which is probably the case since they missed many opportunities to kill their prey quickly & cleanly. The foul-up in retaining the services of a bomb maker who only knew how to dismantle bombs hardly rings true, even for the CIA!

Kushner & Spielberg bend over backwards to provide ideological balance to the warring sides. It is obvious that the true nature of professional assassins do not make for good movie material...apparently there is a need for heavy emotional conflict in order to tamper down the exactitude and clarity of purpose that is actually the makeup of the professional ""agency"" hit-man.

A good shoot'em up...a Western set in fashionable European locales.",5
26 April 2006,just...PERFECT,"This movie is so perfect so you think it is not true, the perfection in photographing the Araby/Palestinians in the movie was never done before to that excellence, remember Laurance of Arabia, and Omar AlMokhtat, no one in this movies reached that level of showing the arabs as real as this movie does, also the languages, see how he shows people talking in different languages, this Palestinian with his wife and daughter, talking in English (with arabic accent) to the reporter and same time talking to his wife in arabic with some french sentences, very very real, when you see a scene like that you feel you are inside the movie, and the little girl while answering the phone (the bombed phone) when she says ""alo.."" no one says ""alo"" with this accent except arabs, of course the colors used in the movie and the customs, the lighting all are so perfect, we can't ignore how Spielberg presented the case from a very neutral point of view, although he is picturing the film from the Israely point of view, but in general it was so fair in presenting the Palastenians opinion using the same sentences used by Palestinians just....PERFECT.....",10
20 June 2006,"Good on style, highly selective on accuracy.","Did the film makers actually bother to do any research or just make this up as they went along? I suggest anyone interested in the real story behind the assassination teams dispatched around the world relating to these events dramatised in the film seek out documentaries on the subject and study the recent material now in the public domain.

I find the most risible aspect of this picture was the choice not to mention the botched assassination of a Morrocan waiter working in Scandinavia wrongly identified which brought the whole state sponsored campaign of selective targets to light and should act a warning that no matter how sophisticated your intelligence is, there is always the inevitable errors that lead to innocent casualties.

4 March 2006,"In some ways it worked, in many ways it was terrible","To begin I have to say I can see in some ways why other people may have liked this movie. The movie moves along well enough, and the general storyline is engaging.

That said I have strongly felt, since ""A.I.,"" that Spielberg is a disturbed individual. ""Munich"" did not change my opinion. In two cases I found what I felt to be gratuitous sexualized violence (the killing of the Dutch woman and the final ""love scene""). I suspect Spielberg was going for some grittiness in those scenes, but it felt hollow and unnecessary to me. Another word that comes to mind is ""exploitative.""

The lack of subtleness in the Golda Meir and the ""you look like your mother"" part, which I found to be mind-numbing, is essentially repeated again and again throughout the movie. Wait, what? We're (Americans) suppose to identify with Avner and see our own War on Terror in the same light? No way! Could the fact that all of the Israelis speak English and the final scene with the Twin Towers in the background made that point a little more obvious?

Yeah, OK, if the initial scene's dialog had been in Hebrew with English subtitles the movie would never have done well with American audiences, I can accept that part. But given the subject matter and the analogy Spielberg is making, it would've added a lot of subtlety and reduced the opportunity for criticizing the film for having a pro-Israel bias.",
12 February 2006,"Surprise, surprise....","Being no big fan of Mr Berg and still reeling from the very miscast and dull War of the Worlds I never the less dragged myself into Munich to see what a mess he made of what is a controversial and sensitive subject. I happened to have my 12 year old son with me (Sorry Mr Sensor) and he for all his tender years is usually spot on with his critique so I was looking forward to hearing his opinion especially as he had no recollection of the events on which this film was based. So, expecting the worst and almost hoping I was proved right in we went (Straight after 'Jarhead' in fact). Before the movie even started I new something big was about to happen, the 550 seat auditorium was full, not one empty seat that I could see. To the film. For me the very fact that there were no big names in this movie showed me The Berg was serious about this movie and that the subject matter was going to be treated both seriously and with sensitivity, could you imagine Cruise as Avner? Perish the thought. Terrorism, as we all know, is now a part of our lives and has been since the 60s and medias ability to bring it to us in full living color almost as it happens but what Mr Berg did here so very well was to both condemn it but give us an understanding of its purpose and futility at the same time. We all realize that as long as there is terrorism humanity will fight back. Direction was flawless, casting nothing less than a work of art, Cinematography outstanding and lighting nothing short of genius. OK there were a few continuity errors, so what, isn't there always and yes it was graphic at times but hey. As I said the real test for me was consulting my son at our usual post movie pizza joint. When I asked him what he thought he replied 'Can we see it again Dad? It's the best film I have ever seen'.",10
8 February 2006,"Unfair, one-sided movie","Acting is very good. But this is unfair, one-sided movie in which they show Palestinians as bad guys and Jews are the good one, of course. Typical Spielberg's movie that shows suffer of Jews, no matter if they are wrong or right. Even when Mossad send assassins, they (assassins) suffer, because they are a goodhearted nation with honor (yeah sure). It is WRONG to kill innocent people (like in Munich), but there are many stories of killing Palestinian children by Israeli bullets shot by Israeli ""soldiers"". Come on, give me a break: when Israeli people kill civilians - they are soldiers, when Palestinians kill civilians - they are terrorists. I would really like to see a movie that shows suffer of Palestinians and how poor they live. Why? There are always two sides of the story!

28 July 2015,An Eye for an Eye Leaves the Whole Film Bland,"Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's ""Munich"" seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. ""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, ""When does it ever end?""

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. ""Munich"" could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul. ""When does it ever end?"" Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",4
9 January 2006,Right message with a somewhat bumpy plot.,"Munich isn't the kind of movie that you walk away from feeling jolly and light-hearted. It is in many ways sickening, but I'm sure that Spielberg wanted it to have such an effect on its audience.

Munich's plot revolves around the assassinations carried out by Mossad agents against terrorists suspected of planning the 1972 Olympic kidnappings and murders of Israeli athletes. It is graphic and disturbing, but it effectively decries the violence perpetrated by both sides in the conflict.

I felt that Munich didn't do a good enough job developing characters and their relationships, but other than that, Munich was a very good movie. It's central theme was home. All any Israeli or Palestinian wants is a place to call home to share with his/her family. It also effectively showed that violence only begets more violence and that the only solution that will work in the conflict is one that does not involve revenge killings.",8
1 February 2006,A Masterful Theatrical Work,"The summer of 1972 was a very important season for Munich. The Olympic Games had set off and the whole world was watching closely, waiting for the next world record. And so it was a huge surprise when on September 4th of that same year, a group of Palestinian terrorists, better known as Black September, kidnapped and eventually murdered eleven Israeli athletes. To add to the catastrophe, five of the kidnappers and one German officer also lost their lives. It looked as if the battle was over. However, the Israeli government felt that revenge had to be taken and in retaliation hired a group of agents from Mossad, the Israeli foreign intelligence agency, to assassinate those responsible for the attack that is now identified as the Munich Massacre.

These are the real-life events which paved the way for one of the finest movies of the year, Munich, directed by none other than Steven Spielberg, one of the most notable figures in modern-day cinematography. Munich is extraordinary in its capability to reach out to the audience and also to evoke provocative questions. Highly intricate in its organization, Munich is able to manipulate the viewer and transform any feelings of ambiguity into resentment, excitement, abhorrence and sometimes even into disgust. Disturbingly graphic, mostly visually, Munich is scarring and like the scar it leaves upon the viewer, the highly controversial questions it raises linger on, even after the movie is over (the whole 2 hr 44 min of it).

The movie stars Eric Bana, Daniel Craig, Ciaran Hinds, Mathieu Kassovitz and Hanss Zischler as the five Mossad agents (in their respective roles as Avner, Steve, Carl, Robert and Hans). Bana especially does a terrific job at portraying a haunted agent, who's often torn between the two opposing duties of work and family. The astounding Geoffrey Rush plays the role of Ephraim, the Israeli representative who must lead the Mossad to the right path (if such were the correct adjective) and Ayelet Zorer plays Daphna, Avner's emotionally-charged wife. Doubtless, the acting is terrific as the performers do a great job at thoroughly expressing their character's traits. But it's not the acting that's the winning component of the movie. Munich is the result of its highly excellent parts and as a result no one component or two sticks out(that was precisely why it didn't grab any Globes).

Munich is a masterful theatrical work and is radiant in its approach at combing politics with history. As expected, it was nominated for a number of Academy Awards as it's the type of movie that will particularly interest the academy, but no wins can be guaranteed. Although the theme of the film is highly controversial(especially since Spielberg is himself an Israeli supporter), Munich will speak out to the voters as it has to the audiences. And hopefully to all future viewers it will be recognized as the phenomenal,explosive hit it is.",9
28 December 2005,"Nice Try, but...","First of all, I am a huge Spielberg Fan.

Thumbs way up for attaching himself to this script/subject matter in a shall we say 'European' style! Art direction: 10 out of 10. Cinematography: 10 out of 10, Music: 10 out of 10 !

My main criticism relates to the abundance of unrealistic plot holes throughout the film (especially taking into account that this is a docudrama!!! )

1) After Louis Dad revealed to Avner that they strictly DO NOT sell secret info to governments. Avner went ahead with his group 'and his bought info' without any concern. Even after running into the Arabs in Athens in the safehouse -which I understood as clearly arranged by Louis and company(no?) ...and then a week later Louis and Dad once again make a definite reiteration to the gang that they are clearly being hunted by the Arabs ...yet somehow Avner and crew need another 6 months to figure that out?????

2) Why on earth would Avner and crew put all their trust in their entire search for the 'Munich' Arabs in Louis' hands in the first place? Don't they have ANY other means?

3) the 'sensitive' peaceful demeanor portrayed by the Israeli gang was from the beginning completely unrealistic. These guys are terrorists too, ya know, HELLO!! Terrorists are violent motherf**kers, period.

---------

In addition, I felt that the last paragraph (at film's end) had the opportunity of giving the film closure. Sadly, Spielberg left us with a short blurb about how the rest of the 'Munich' Arabs were killed off, whom at his point I had almost completely forgotten about! I mean ...What about Avner ? Where did HE end up?

Perhaps in short form I would state the following: Great concept, amazing actors (Eric Bana), beautiful cinematography, beautiful music ! Somehow 3/4 along the way things get tedious and muddled . Eventually leaving us all quite confused... Help!",7
10 June 2021,A really good and and a mediocre movie,"A really good and a miserably bad movie at the same time. Good in the way it trusts the viewer to know the historical facts; the acting is good and the photography is excellent. Yet there are so many illogical things in the screenplay it renders the whole thing mediocre. If the main point is the major character's evolving understanding that his killing of others is pointless, then too much of the film is wasted on close-ups on bombs, guns, and shootings, as they could have been kept to minimum while allocating more room to the main character's inner life and thoughts. Everything tastes half-finished, which astonishes me as Tony Kushner, whom I otherwise deeply respect for his ""Angels In America"" is credited for the screenplay. I really expected a less superficial work from him.

31 December 2005,"Spielberg took too long to develop his message, which was unclear","I remember watching the Munich massacre on live TV. I knew that Israel had commissioned certain agents to eliminate the persons responsible. Why did it take Spielberg so long to develop this well known plot. The movie should have been cut by 1/2 an hour at least. His message was very difficult to ascertain. The only message that I perceived from this movie that there is no hope for any peace in the middle east. The killing will go on until eternity. For every person the Jews kill, the Arabs will kill a Jew. When will it ever stop? Spielberg obliterates the distinction between the Mossad, the CIA, and the KGB. According to this movie we never know whether the men assassinated were the actual perpetrators, or political killings. If that was his message, it could have been clearer.

7 December 2008,Dangerous Fiction:,"I love Eric Bana and Stephen Spielberg most of the time, but this is not history. The argument has been made that, though the history may be flawed, the film should be judged on it's artistic merits. That is all well and good, but when filmmakers, especially those with the influence of a Spielberg, adjust history to fit their worldviews, people in the real world are influenced and may suffer. The fact is that a group of terrorists, who spoke in terms of martyrdom, and in the midst of a wave of global terrorism, decided to target unarmed athletes at the 1972 ""Olympics of Peace.""

Israel's response was reasonable and measure, if not without mistakes, undertaken by professionals to target those involve in an ongoing campaign to kill its citizens. Spielberg's naked attempt to draw some kind of moral equivalence is vile. In totalitarian states that sponsor terrorism and teach their children suicidal hatred, fanciful plays on reality such as this are of no consequence. But in democratic societies, were voters are influenced by largely fictional films pushing the phrase ""inspired buy actual events,"" voters are moved and policies influence, which can and do put real people at risk.

I'm sure, however, that opinions like this count for nothing in the semi-reality that Spielberg lives in.",2
17 April 2006,Spielberg has just lost it in the end,"Well what can u say Spielberg has done it again.however the one prob with Munich is it's length and he has just lost the grip from the movie in the end.When 15mins or so are remaining in the movie u feel a bit bored. That's it otherwise gr888888888 direction. good movie.i will say that every movie lover should watch it. it's a must for them. as far everyone else is concerned whom do not watch movie very often, well they should also see it.

the story is based on the tragedy that occurred during Munich Olympics 1972.the story is about what happened after the killing of 11 athletes. government elects special squad of 5 men and they go on a mission to kill 9 people whom were in this black September case.It not only tells story of that mission but also the story of the man the leader of that squad. how he feels after killing those people.it reveals the feeling of a man too.The one whom is victorious yet not satisfied.

so people u have got a movie in Ur hands see it.",8

31 December 2005,Spielberg's best,"I think this film is better than Schindler's List, which in my opinion included a lot of extraneous footage that served no purpose other than pure sentimentality. Even at 2 hours and 44 minutes, this film doesn't seem too long.

Great performances all around, a great score, stunning cinematography.

Many people who haven't seen Munich are commenting about it. They really should see the film first. The entire Bush Administration, the Senate and Congress should see it, too.

The point is not that we should not respond to terrorism. It is simply that trying to hunt down and kill all the terrorists before they do us harm is never going to work. It hasn't worked for Israel, and it won't work for the U.S.

31 May 2006,Spielberg at his very best,"I think in this movie Steven Spielberg shows what he can do with movies. I don't usually vote very high, but after I saw this movie, I think I can recommend it to anybody who likes a long during, drama/action/comedy.

The actors are showing some real talent, although they aren't really famous I think. It proves that an actor doesn't have to be famous at all, and can still be a good actor.

The very best scene in the movie I found the one with the little kid and the telephone. Although you see what's going to happen, you don't know where it ends, and also the choice of music was very good in this scene.

There was only one shot in the movie I didn't like. It is when Avner is at the Terra's of a restaurant in Rome. The camera tilts down, and after that it's going to zoom in on the table where Avner is sitting. You just can't go to zoom in a good movie. That's my opinion.",8
2 April 2021,It plays like a series of badly connected vignettes,"Just could not find the thread that ties this movie together beyond a need for vengeance that I do not feel is even well put together.

7 January 2006,Definitely entertaining,"I have just seen the new movie ""Munich"" and found it very interesting. However, as I watched, I recognized scenes I'd seen in another film many years before. After doing some research, I see that ""Munich"" is not the only film depicting these events. I think the writing in a previous film was a little better, but ""Munich"" is definitely worth seeing. Perhaps other films should be seen as well before judging any of them unless the viewer is only interested in entertainment. The messages of both films are difficult to determine, but they are both very entertaining. ""Munich"" is based on a novel and viewers would be wise to keep in mind that these films are not documentaries. Much more independent research should be done on the subject if the actual history is of interest.

31 January 2006,A great film. Spielberg and Bana at their best.,"While being one the most eagerly awaited movies in recent times, there was also a real threat that ""Munich"" would become lost in the controversy which would surely surround it. The story deals with the Isreali response to the murder of it's Olympic athletes in Munich 1972 (i.e. to order the assassination of those considered by the Israelis to be responsible).

Spielberg deals with the story in a surprisingly unemotional manner, choosing to allow Bana to sculpt the tension in front of the camera rather than forcing it from behind. While it would have been easy to allow the story to descend into an emotional mess or an action flick, Spielberg walks the tightrope masterfully and delivers a fine movie which shall draw criticism from both sides of the conflict around which it revolves (and this in itself is perhaps it's finest commendation).

Other actors to impress are Ciarán Hinds, Geoffrey Rush and Michael Lonsdale who glide effortlessly under Spielbergs direction. The only chink in the movie comes in the form of Daniel Craig who wrestles with a South African accent throughout the movie (and ultimately looses!). Fortunately his lines are limited.

In short, a very good film.",8

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg.

A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. ""Munich"" could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul.

28 March 2006,Mr. Spielberg disappoints again,"This movie continues the trend of mediocre or outright weak movies by Mr. Spielberg that started IMHO with ""Minority Report"". ""Munich"" has quite a few technical flaws that leave an impression that the story was too big for a director to handle. Also, there were a few instances (may be more than a few, but I'm not a historian) when actual facts have been manipulated to fit the story. This is particularly wrong when author positions himself as an ""independent"" and ""not taking sides"". The acting was very good though, Bana has done a brilliant work. Unfortunately, bright acting with poor directing doesn't leave much better impression than bad acting itself. All in all, in recent years Mr. Spielberg has been far more successful producing rather than directing.

18 May 2006,OK. Not great,"I guess I expected more from Spielberg. I thought it was slow toward the end and made the Israeli's look a little bad. The story is a tragedy and reminded me of the chaos that existed at that time. I had forgotten about Black September and the assassinations and tragedies that occurred. While I hope that everyone remembers the massacre at the Olympics but it doesn't seem we have learned from this lesson. I think that the film suffered from a bit of poor editing and could have been cut from the 2+ hours that it runs. I was totally confused by the ending and really wonder whether or not the Israelis achieved their objectives in the end. Worth watching on DVD.

17 January 2006,"This is a great movie about the emotions involved in the aftermath of the attacks, but lacks historical facts","This movie is done in the vein of the countless other historical epics that Spielberg has directed, and will move anyone who sees it. While it is based on true life events, it appears as though it is mainly directed toward connecting the events in the film to our modern day struggle with terrorism, rather than simply stating the facts. Largely unknown to most of the ""Munich"" audience, another movie was made for TV based on the same novel by George Jonas almost exactly twenty years ago called, ""The Sword of Gideon."" I watched this movie about two years ago, and while it doesn't convey as much emotion as ""Munich"" (i.e. lower budget and non-inventive camera work), it does cover a larger time-line with many more facts. There tends to be definite political statement made in ""Munich"", and therefore I would recommend seeing both movies to get the big picture. If at all possible, watch the ""Sword of Gideon"" first to get a more historical background, and then watch ""Munich"". If you just watched ""Munich"", and are wondering what happened to Avner beyond where the movie leaves off, watch ""Sword of Gideon"".",9

9 January 2006,a fast paced suspense thriller grounded in real world events,"if you are not a student of history, you might view this film as just another thriller; but if you know anything about the events of munich in 1972, you will be driven to look for a deeper meaning in each twist and turn of the road.

why were the israeli atheletes slaughtered? is israel's relentless quest for retaliation justice or revenge? you might come into the film pondering these questions but soon you will be drawn to the action and the conscience of one man: avner. he is played to perfection by eric bana. strong yet sensitive, focused yet torn by doubts, he is the perfect hero for this film.

the rest of the cast and the settings are superb. only one criticism: trim about 15 minutes off the running time and this film would rate a 10.

2 February 2006,Excellent Lesson on the Importance of a Homeland,"There is a lot to like in this movie. Excellence all around. Acting, directing, writing, cinematography, pace, editing, message(s) were all at that level. One step below greatness, but still very, very good. These days you can do a lot worse when buying a theater ticket. Get a little history lesson too. I was 23 and just starting law school when Munich happened, and as a past athlete, the events were seared into my head. This movie has given me a more complete understanding of what was at stake...so far away. Both sides are shown to be doing what they do in search of a ""real"" homeland for their peoples. This, in turn, requires themselves to suspend their adherence of the ethical rigors of their respective religions, so that they may carry out those actions, albeit heinous, that they feel are necessary.

25 December 2005,Superb...,"Should be a two disk set with Schindler's List...

No one is discussing the fact that this book was filmed before, for HBO in 86, as ""Sword of Gideon""...

Same characters (more or less)...

Steven Bauer was especially good as Avner That was excellent, but this has much more depth...

The ending should strike home with a lot of people...

One of Spielberg's best...

Eric Bana is outstanding as is the rest of the cast...

Locals: A Editing: A Acting: A Length: Long but worth it...

Good to see a serious film that makes you THINK!",10
7 January 2006,Munich,"this is a bold movie to make and Steven makes abunch of bold movies like Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List but this might be one of the boldest movies of them all. Steven Spielberg i won the most entertaining directors of them all, but when I saw the movie I just though it wasn't that entertaining , the movie was to long for me be it has good directing good script and okay acting but I thought and everyone thought it was going blow everyone away, but weather you hate the movie or like it this movie has Oscar written all over this movie. This movie will not be ignored by the Oscars at all because the Oscars like these kind of movies, but this movie will probably be in 3-4 nominations at the Oscars it has a good screenplay Steven Spielberg might even get his 3rd Oscar for best director Eric Bana is not Oscar material in this movie but soon I think he will get an Oscar, the score is very pervasively and will maybe an Oscar so this was my summary I hope you liked it if you have any comments you want to say to me my email is robertbenfer@yahoo.com

23 January 2006,"Acting was impeccable, dialogue good if somewhat predictable","Seeing Munich last Saturday, I came away emotionally exhausted, my husband left feeling unresolved. I found some of Spielberg's attempts at humor distracting, such as the accountant making abundantly clear he wanted receipts!!! The tenor of the film seemed a little uneven, perhaps that was the intent, the whole situation was pretty untenable. Not sure what to make of Papa and/or Louis, who proclaim such disdain for what governments can and do do, but make a very comfortable living off of that ambiguity. Not clear why such relatively untrained people were brought in for these jobs. Amazing what they pulled off, all things considered. Are targets really that easily accessed? Eric Bana has been a personal favorite since Blackhawk Down, I thought he did the best he could with Hulk, he was very effective in Troy, or was that just by way of contrast with Bloom and Pitt? Still remember ""Papa"" from ""The Jackel""(the original one:), he continues to be convincing and effective. I thought perhaps Louis had the most difficult role of any, lacking the passions of his father, how did he feel about his ""job."" Clearly I need to view this film again. No doubt all my questions are answered. In the meantime, though, I applaud the film and Spielberg. It is the first feature-length film to take on this horrific time and crime. I remember the made-for-TV movie, of many moons ago, with Lindsey Wagner as a compassionate flight attendant who talks to one of the terrorists, I almost feel like that depiction was more evenhanded, perhaps. Of course, it stops with this event's playing-out.

It seems clear to me Ms. Meir's motivation was pretty purely revenge/vengeance, not sure she had any good alternative choice, though.

Those are my thoughts, as of this day!",8
11 February 2006,Great film,"This is a very significant film. It hammered me hard, both with its action and with its powerful message. This is a dead serious movie. It is a mistake to think of it as a documentary or history. Fiction is better suited to portray the moral morass of terrorism better than any history. The protagonist's final resolution exposes the heart of terrorist darkness: whether carried out by Palestinian fanatics or the state of Israel,the entire cycle of terrorism is dehumanizing, savage and--in the end--futile.

My only criticism is that the plot lagged occasionally, but this is a minor flaw. The biggest problems I have seen are the many reviewers who believe they have identified a pro-Israeli or a pro-Palestinian bias. These kind of reviewers need to get a life: Munich is a balanced pro-humanity work of art. Forget Arabs and Israelis: this movie could just as readily be portrayed through Croats and Serbs, Serbs and Kosovars, Turks and Armenians, Hutus and Tutsis--anywhere the cycle of terrorism, ethnic rage and revenge has shredded the bonds of humanity.",9
12 February 2006,Outline of long - ago terror,"I was astonished when I saw the first previews of Munich late last year. And I was amazed that Spielberg showed the guts to get his hands on quite a difficult plot while other directors unleash big monkeys on major cities.

However I was afraid that, despite the fact that Spielberg directed it, the movie might be a bit, too American, too Hollywoodish, too action-crammed to be informative.

But recalling Spielbergs work in Schindler's List and trying hard not to recall War of the Worlds, I found a way to the cinema. Well it does have one thing with unleashed monkeys in common: don't buy a big soda. The movie will last until the end of time.

Which is on the other hand not bad, because it passes time quite well, without being exactly entertaining. Which it of course, should not be. You cannot expect to see a work-over of a terrorist assault and walk out with a big smile on your face. It's not going to happen. So the movie does what I was hoping it would do. Display a story that makes you think, makes you wonder about terrorism, wonder about it in a serious, unarmed way.

Well sounds too good to be true if you are out to see a movie like Schindler's list, and I dare to also mention 8 mm here. And yes it is. Spielberg got the script of a children's play book, or mickey mouse, or I do not know what. Except for the perfect display of the location (even the street names are right), there is no truth in it. Surely the overall ending is still true, but the way things happen is just imagined.

That does not make it a bad movie though, as the bottom line is still kept.",8

24 March 2006,Best Movie of the Year,"In a year of really good movies, I believe MUNICH was the best of them all. It's a big movie that because it struck me on so many levels, felt very personal. While I realize that some people like to minimize Spielberg's work at times, this movie proves yet again that there is no filmmaker who can make a movie hum like he can. MUNICH is really a thrilling ride but it is not fun at all. It's exciting but it's painful. It's long and it feels like it never ends but (unlike A.I.) that was okay because it just works so well. In fact, I believe that this was Spielberg's message -- this movie is going to keep going and going, just like the cycle of violence that is represented. To make such a statement resonate, and do it in a way that sucks you into the story and the movie as an entertainment, shows just how ambitious and successful this film is.

5 February 2006,Story chewed up by too much action,"""Munich"" tries to cram too many shots and explosions per minute, leaving the characters behind. On the other hand Spielberg was obviously trying to carry a message, but the movie came out is too shallow to really immerse you and make you feel what he is trying to tell. There are a few key dialogs, but they sound a bit artificial -- maybe they could sound better, but not in this movie. Eric Bana also does not seem to keep up with the leading role, which in a way may be intended -- it is unclear if Avner is in control of the events or vice versa, but still his acting could be better. Overall, the movie is substantially worse than I expected.

A suggestion: see ""Sword of Gideon"" (1986) if you can find it, doesn't matter before or after ""Munich"". IMHO it develops better portraits of key characters, and generally gives the story a much better texture. It concentrates on people and ideas rather than the events, and that's what this story is all about. The messages in these two films differ somewhat, and you may agree or disagree with either or both, but either way ""Sword"" is absolutely worth seeing if you are interested in the subject. I would also suggest watching the documentary ""One Day in September"" (1999) before watching the movie(s), for more detailed background.

Also, don't take user ratings too seriously for these particular moves, because as someone else correctly noted here, many people pay more attention to political aspects than cinematographic.",5
14 February 2006,"Good,Good","Munich is a great film.In two hours and thirty minutes,you have a state of thrilling constant.It is not bored in any moment. Interpretations are correct.The final is the part of movie that i didn't like very much. In the technical capitol, photography and mounting are brilliant. Although, i don't have lived in those years, i think that the movie is set very well in that period.Spielberg has worked how he's in the habit. Munich is better than Saving Private Ryan's,however this isn't than spectacular. Munich will join in the selected group of mythical movies and normally, must be a favorite movie in the all international movie trophies of this year(Oscar,Golden Globe,Venecia,Cannes,Valladolid,Sitges,San Sebastian and more).

completely recommendable.

29 January 2006,True Art,"I don't remember another movie entering into my dream life. Munich did. Seamlessly constructed, one follows image upon image as in a dream and its substance seeps into your soul. The plot is carried so you do not have to use your mind to sort out the sequences. You can lay back to receive the story...the Dream. You are given enough time to digest the powerful images but none are cheapened -- sustained beyond dream time -- as artifice -- either to manipulate emotion or ideology. Each character rings true. You meet the assassins from your heart. The ruse of the word ""terrorist"" is made manifest. What empowers certain people to legitimize their violence and eschew the label, ""terrorist""? You understand that it IS a tough world out there, baby. That is starkly made manifest. This is not a film to be entertained by but to be enlightened by; enlightened, not in the sense of weight, for it is heavy...but in the sense of widening insight into the nature of Reality; to see its truth to help you walk your walk with a clearer vision. I honor Spielberg and Kushner Bana for their gift, their artistry. Thank you.

20 February 2006,astonishing,"Why astonishing? Because it learns to think, what is bad, and that is good, because it gives a choice, to see things in another perspective, because it's not just one sentimental drama, it has no happy end, it's has no end at all. We self have to decide then it;s will stop. It's us, who has to make end to it. It's not sympathize to one or other side, it just gives a lot of time to think where all that go? Where the world goes? And who has right to stop or continue all that madness? Not recommended for short-minded people with just one point of view. Because then you just will see black or white, and that's not what Spielberg wanted. I think this is masterpiece, and the most important, such a masterpiece that lets us to think. Where all this world going too?

9 September 2006,Spielberg has done it again.,"Spielberg has done it again. This film, combined with the tremendous acting power of Eric Bana and the up and coming Daniel Craig among others really comes together to create this epic masterpiece, some might complain about its length, but I have to be honest, the shorter the film (a good quality film) the worse, I love to watch the same characters over a length of time and watch them evolve and become a different character than the one they were at the start of the film. Visually this film is on par with nothing, as it exceeds every boundary while keeping true to the gritty realism that permeates throughout it. I look forward to more work from Spielberg since he seems to only get better with age.

4 September 2006,i thought it was poor,"Despite all the glowing comments I thought it was a poor movie...wet streets in London, Athens, Paris Rome etc, for me it was pure Jewish propaganda which we have come to expect from Spielberg when he makes a film about the Palestinians and there issues I may take note.

For me it was like a poor Freddie Forsythe, I felt that the whole movie was about Vengeance...no trial...no Jury...no Judge, a lot of the acting was hammy and contrived, and whilst it may be based on a true story...which I remember.......... was it really???

Spielberg best years are behind him in my opinion, without wishing to sound anti-semitic I can only assume it's Oscar nominatinos were due to the preponderence of Jewish supporters in the Academy

27 December 2005,Avoid. This is not - I repeat NOT a must see at all!,"Spielberg should not get away with this mindless violence. There is virtually no character development at all. The plot in it's entirety is known within the first 5 minutes of the film. Consequently you can easily leave your seat 3 or 4 times to get popcorn, drink or use the facilities and return having missed nothing at all. For all who loved the flying limbs of Private Ryan, there is more here for your delight. Yes we do have imaginations and we did not come to see FX. Good news is this is my last Spielberg!The movie could have used some romance to take away briefly at least from the bullets and bombs. This simply made the film even more unbearable and hastened the onset of bordem.

27 February 2006,Overly didactic,"Of the five best picture nominees for the 2006 Oscars, three are overly didactic (the other two being ""Good Night and Good Luck"" and ""crash."" However, this one takes the cake. There is waaaaay too much debate and discussion. What is more, the actual participants have stated publicly that they were NOT so ambiguous. Finally, this movie is too long by at least 20 minutes if not 45. Whole sub-plots could be eliminated and it would make no difference.

I think this movie is the cinematic equivalent of overcooked spinach - people see it because it seems like it will be good for them, but in fact its overdone to the point where it looses its value.

1 January 2006,Good Pro-Israel Propaganda Film Steve-O,"This movie is basically a melodramatic propaganda film. According to the film Israel's desire for a homeland is a noble aspiration and killing off Arabs or other innocent bystanders might be difficult for our sentimental tough guy assassin with a conscience but its worth it for 'a home.' Apparently if you are Palestinian you can go live anywhere else in the world and you will be warmly embraced. You will be given cookies, a warm blanket, and new shoes. Stevo-O made some half-hearted attempts to humanize the Palestinians in the movie but ultimately his agenda was impossible to ignore. Steve-O go make ET 2 or something and spare us.

23 December 2005,Incredible ride through Europe,"This had an excellent Bourne Identity feel about it -- something I did not expect to encounter.

The reviewers acted like this was a movie about Eric Bana's mental state, but it is in fact a very convincing account of how the Mossad probably functioned after Munich.

This was undoubtedly the best performance of Bana's brief career, and the movie's minor flaws are covered up by an incredible supporting cast.

The film borders on three hours in length, and the film features one tense moment for each of the 160 minutes.

3 January 2006,I don't want to see it again but I think it's a masterpiece,"I would like to disagree with comments that I've just read from pfarmer891 about Spielbergs Munich. I think that the main message was totally overlooked and your comments were mostly concentrated on facts that sometimes are useless. So what if the Fiction movie is not totally based on facts, but do you think you can actually get those facts straight in a conflict like this. If the movie ads on in order to created a clearer message, I believe it's not a crime. And I don't think that the message was the standard Hollywood ""why can't we be friends"". I thought it was the message of desperation and hopelessness about the situation in Middle East. And it makes the story even stronger when we look at out the same conflict in 2006 and realize that nothing has changed, because the violence has continued. If Spielberg would have taken sides, then that would've been a standard for the modern Hollywood - Israel is the victim and Muslims are all terrorists. I thought it was a very brave move by Spielberg to try to analyze the conflict from words of both Israelis and Palestinians. The ""safe house"" part of the movie might have seem ridiculous to you, but why, is it impossible now for people of those to nations to sleep under one roof? If you believe that, then the conflict is inevitable in your world. I think people who go to see this movie, should not come there trying to dissect every setting and decide if it can be fact or not, but look more deeply into the meaning of the film. Try to get rid of all the previous conceptions and just watch it from both sides and then see if you can decide who is right. I think that's the point, that it's no one. Too many people have died to naively believe that any of the allegations of the truth, be it from Israelians or Palestinians, can be justified.",10
14 November 2012,"An intelligent thriller with an important ethical question, but sometimes to kitschy","Not to lose to much words, quote Rathko: ""'Munich' is an intelligent and gripping thriller"" and offers the ethical bias and conflict that lies in the question: is it right to fight enemies, which use all bloody possible ways and methods of achieving there goals, yourself with all possible (even illegal) methods? To be judge, jury and executioner? Is this right or do I become even myself then a terrorist? And where then lies the difference between them and me? Positive: The movie asks this question and can't it. Negative: The display of the inner doubts and bias is too clichéd and superficial to be plausible and the the persistent references of the Munich-Massacrer in the form of dreams of the main protagonists are just too kitschy and overblown to be a real outstanding film.

26 December 2005,"Talky - Give us Credit, Steven","This film takes on a serious issue and one that Spielberg is obviously passionate about. At its weakest, it's preachy and excessively talky, not simply giving us something to think about -- the entire film does that -- but instead pushing us in particular ways and assuming we won't get it. At its best, it lets us, the audience, do the important work, such as weighing the morality of revenge when it seems to be costing much, much more than the bargained for price, or drawing lines, such as when is it ""terrorism"" and when is it ""making a point""? The performances are quite good (it was fun seeing ""Hector"" and ""Gaius Julius Caesar"" working on the same team!).

31 January 2006,great movie that will open your eyes,"Munich is a great film that shows incredible depth into the Israeli-Arab conflict that dominates world news these days. The mostly unknown incident at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany,was unfortunate, but the film enlightens us with the prejudice that feeds the fire of the war today. The film is completely objective, though viewed through the life of one of the Israeli assassins. When I first heard of the movie, I thought ""oh great, another biased film for the public to misunderstand"", but I was completely debased. Arabs and Israelis are both represented as great people, loving and caring as we consider ourselves, but unfortunately consumed by a never ending war. I was very impressed with Steven Spielberg, but am disgusted that the film isn't getting the attention it deserves.

2 January 2006,too long and too contrived,"Grindingly long revenge film in which the instrument of revenge begins to have moral qualms half way through. I doubt Isrealis would choose someone who doesn't have clarity on what his job is and who would have any problems carrying it out. Also, rather simplistic, but at the same time, muddled view of the conflict in the middle east. Also, the action at times seems more like a phony action movie rather than a realistic portrayal of events. Seem to be a few rather miraculous escapes. The mysterious information supplier who avner an amateur at this type of work, finds rather easily is never explained. All of Spielberg's message movies (Color Purple, Schindler, Amistad, and now Munich) have something missing.

26 December 2005,It's Spielberg - so it's Amazing!,"I went in expecting what I walked out with. This was beautifully acted, wonderfully shot. The long movie held the audience and there was not one sound all through. It was like Schindler's List. A hushed reverence. Eric Bana is marvelous in a very difficult role. The lesser known actors were wonderful - including Daniel Craig who will soon be very well known as James Bond. This movie showed his acting skill rather than as a sexy secret agent as 007 is sure to do. No matter the controversy of ""showing the other side"" - the real heroes are the avengers, it just humanizes them instead showing them as robotic killing machines. The Black September group and the Palestinians are portrayed as they were/are. The Israelies are always obsessed with revenge because they must show the world they cannot be crushed. An eye for an eye - . Spielberg continues to remind the world ""Never Again"". I laud him for this. We urge him to continue making movies in this vein.

10 July 2006,Good Movie,"I wouldn't rate this with Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, Saving Private Ryan, or some other Combat/War based films I feel are classics, but it's a solid movie.

The casting was excellent, I thought Eric Bana did a convincing job in his role. He basically gets across the point that he's a man torn between devotion to his country, his family, and his sanity. I enjoy films that focus the strain put on the mind of the warrior (or in this case assassin) much more than films that just glorify the actions of the ""hero"". The mental affects that a mission of this type, one that's so up close and personal to those targeted, they clearly should be a focal point of his character and I felt the film did a nice job of showing that stress.

The effects were nicely done and I felt that Spielberg did a good job of making sure the props and environment appeared early 70's ish. I also didn't feel a sense of political propaganda either; the Palestinians were doing what they felt was right and the Israelis were responding in a way that they felt was right. I felt that in this case a story was told rather than a justification for one side or the other.

It was definitely a solid film, in this case I only rented it but had I saw it at the theater, I would have left satisfied.",7
31 December 2005,Is this a remake of the Sword of Giden from 1986?,"I am astounded at how similar this movie is to an earlier title called the Sword of Gideon directed by Michael Anderson. Most of the scenes were identical and even many of the lines were the same. Almost all of the characters were the same names. Both were excellent movies, however I am a bit disappointed that Spielberg has not done something more original. Perhaps there is some story behind these two films that is not so obvious. Having said that, the story is excellent, the message is compelling and I would definitely recommend seeing it. I wish that Spielberg would have gone into more detail of how the Germans handled (or mishandled) the situation.

22 January 2006,Wow,"This movie is beyond remarkable. What it must have been to the men who lived it, and their families. I was only eleven years old at the time of the Munich Games, but I do remember the news broadcasts during that time. I applaud Spielberg for bringing the incident to younger generations, and filling in the memories of the rest of us. Even though the movie runs 2 hours and 44 minutes, it doesn't seem like it at all. There is so much action and keeps you pinned on every word from the opening credits until the end. Bano's performance was beautiful! And despite the very serious nature of the subject, several lines scattered throughout the movie brought giggles from the audience. Bravo!

30 December 2005,Excellent but no masterpiece,"""Munich"" is an very good movie but not Spielberg's best. I was alive at the time of the 1972 Olympics and watched the whole drama unfold on T.V. For many Americans, it was the first time we'd ever seen the ugly face of terrorism. This movie is that always dangerous combination, a docudrama, a film 'based upon real events.' In using George Jonas' 1984 book ""Vengeance,"" Spielberg makes a critical error, for the book was widely criticized as inaccurate by knowledgeable sources, including former Mossad chief Zvi Zamir. The film is up to the usual high standard of Spielberg's past work - the film is intensely interesting and has excellent production values. However, it succumbs to some idiotic B-movie staples of past Holly wood fare, such as have two opposing groups - one Israeli and one Palestinian - share the same safe house, in which they meet with guns drawn but later become pals and house mates. Ridiculous. I enjoyed the movie but Spielberg takes a surprisingly soft view on terrorism, considering that he is a Jew. The PLO and the Mossad agents come across as morally equivalent, a view I do not share. Spielberg descends - for at least part of the movie - into standard Hollywood ""Why can't we all be friends"" bathos. Pretty simplistic and not very good history either. This movie is a fine example of why it is dangerous to rely upon Hollywood and movies for an accurate view of history. ""Munich"" is fictional, but uninformed viewers may take it as fact, which is a disservice to those who died. If you want a better view of terrorism, rent ""The Battle of Algiers,"" a fictional movie but one universally praised for its accuracy. In fact, so accurate is ""Battle"" that would-be terrorists and also counter-terrorists screen the film. Of course, Spielberg's film is the better entertainment of the two, so pick on that basis. I give the film an 80 out of 100, or a 'B' grade. Nice effort but flawed. I wish he'd been willing to take a stronger stand morally. Whatever acts have been committed by both sides since then, Israelis were the victims at Munich, not the PLO.",8
2 February 2006,Spielber plays big to the Hate Israel Crowd! Oscar Time!,"Spielberg has won the acceptance of the Hollywood community at the Oscars (and the nominations) because he has made the film they all wanted made.

His argument that the Israelies are somehow ""just as bad"" as savages who killed their athletes is right where the community wants to be.

Leni Riefenstahl and Michael Moore did their best to spew nonsense on behalf of their causes, but were hampered slightly because people knew they were making documentaries, and so they looked at their work a bit critically. Even if they didn't expect the ""documentries"" to be composed of falsehoods.

Spielberg's brilliance was in creating a new hybrid ""Historical Fiction"" category, thus putting his audience to sleep, thinking they were watching actual true events.

This was smart because: He could therefore focus on the murderers as victims, humanizing them. (Not bothering to show the murdered athletes until the movie was over).

He could create a fictional ""self-doubt"" imposed on the Israeli hit men, where none actually existed.

Look for him to clean up at the Oscars as the self hating Jewish community rallies around this commercial failure of epic proportions.",1
6 January 2006,Theoretical portrayal of events to avenge murder of Israeli athletes at Munich.,"I saw this film in Boston, Massachusetts last week, but not from choice, rather doing a favor to a friend who did not want to go alone. It does have you holding your breath in places, and in other places closing your eyes.At least I closed mine occasionally, as too much explicitly detailed violence and sexual scenes distresses and irritates me. True the direction of the story was well done, as Spielberg usually does. The casting was excellent, and there were good performances put in by the entire cast.

The only positive for me about this film was the portrayal of the effect on the character(s) of the job they were doing. Would that tinseltown would learn the lesson and stop dishing it up.

25 December 2005,Spielberg tries something new,"In his political movies, Spielberg tends to polarize good from evil excessively to a point where some of the realism of characters and their feelings are lost.

Munich was a welcomed change. With all character glorification/dehumanization aside, Spielberg now takes us to a frame of time in 1972 which I haven't experienced since.. 1972.. The remarkable recreation throws you right into action and the emotional depth and inner moral conflicts that awashes these characters with genuine feelings that touch you and conflict you.

Most moviegoers will feel detached from the political message of the movie but it shouldn't discourage anyone to enjoy this true Spielberg thriller. Nudity and Violence abound... although in awkward ways.

12 August 2021,Spielberg's finest hour? Perhaps his most subtle,"Works as a thriller and as astute social commentary, teaching an example of a very under-appreciated irony: extreme nationalism kills trust between compatriots. Spielberg even ties in contemporary international terrorism of the film's day in a way that makes sense and asks serious questions without over sentimentalising, picking sides, or slipping into bathos. But none of this stops the film from being exciting and jaw-dropping as a thriller, as well as a sure fire catalyst for Daniel Craig's next assignment debuting as Bond in the following year. Just don't expect a happy ending.

6 January 2006,Bad Message,"I found the new Spielberg movie to be very well done, as would be expected. However, I found the message in the movie appalling and disheartening. To try and equate the wrong doing on those two sides is ludicrous. The Palestinians make it part of their interest to kill the innocent, while the Israelis had unfortunate victims in what can only be considered a mission for the future protection of other Israelis. I would be lying if I said that this movie did not have an expected view point but nevertheless I found it to be odd. We have no problem demonizing the Nazis for killing millions, but we fail to see that the radical muslims would do the same if they had the means to. Somehow we want to find the good in them, like some sort of pet project.Spielberg has really sold his soul on this one. But what do you expect from Hollywood?

31 December 2005,Monumental,"Very simply, truth is stranger than fiction. I feel this picture was superlative, it was real, and that's the way it was.

Three cheers for the Israelie's. Never Again!!!!!!!!!

I do not what more to say, the story was real, the acting superb,all the characters depicted where excellent.

I would certainly go to see the picture again. It was wearing but it was worth it. I have never clearly understood what happened in Munich the portrayal was entirely visible.

I went with my wife and it was tough but, real movie for her absorb. My son a daughter will be my next guest to see it.

Stephen Spielberg AND COMPANY. did a wonderful piece of work, and should be given many accolades for it.

Many thanks, I think I have covered all base and it was just great.",10
8 February 2006,"this film is biased, but not in ways many will find","contrary to some posts here, this film is biased, but whether that is a fault of its production or a biased opinion of its producers is hard to tell.

my reasons for this are simple, if you sit down and thoroughly read through the facts of the Munich siege you notice a lot of things missing from the film, and some of it is shown in a light that makes the terrorists (and sometimes the Palestinians as a whole) look like they were cold blooded animals, what is depicted in the film is for bits of the actual story, known to be not true.

also, the film is based on the book Vengeance which the author of the said book claims to be the team leader, but many people with first hand accounts of all that happened during and after Munich dispute his claims to this.

other than that the film is OK, though some bits are horrific and are not for the easily distressed, towards the end of the film though it does tend to drag and the ending was a little pointless.

this isn't a film i'll be in a hurry to watch again and I wont be buying it on DVD, I feel Spielberg has regained some of his credibility in this film after the abysmal War of the Worlds, but he still has a lot to go",7
8 January 2006,updated remake,"Over the years, I have really enjoyed Steven Spielberg movies, but this one I can only give 3 stars. Most people will find this a really great film, however, for those of us who remember the original TV movie ""Sword of Gideon"" (1986, starring Steven Bauer[""Scarface""], Michael York, Rod Steiger, and John Hirsch) you will be extremely disappointed. ""Munich"" follows ""...Gideon"" almost scene by scene. They are the same movie 85% through; absolutely no originality. This seems to be a growing trend i.e. ""Brothers"" and ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" etc.

In summation, save your money and rent ""...Gideon"". The only REAL difference is the amount of fake blood.

6 July 2006,very precise,"Overall it was a great movie. I believe that Spielberg was given inside info on how the executions were carried out. I too believe that without the sex I would have given it a 10. I feel that the men probably did not have so much a feeling of regret as they got thru with their job. Also Israel should make the point that if you commit such crimes against citizens of Israel that you can run but you cannot hide. If the USA would have done the same to the criminals that held our citizens for 444 days in Iran then there would be less idiots always threatening America. Cudos go to Spielberg for having the courage to make such a film.

30 December 2005,Spielberg breaks new ground,"This film has stirred up a wide variety of reactions, from the typical unjustified criticism provided by people who won't even see the film to the fluffier question of whether or not Steven Spielberg regains his status as film's top director from Peter Jackson. All of those miss the point. What Munich REALLY accomplishes is the deglorification of violence in entertainment through its story of a vengeance squad put together to hunt down and kill those involved in the murder of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olymkpics. And he doesn't do it by force-feeding the audience, just with Hitchcockian style behind the camera, a questioning script and an unassuming -- but brilliant -- cast led by Eric Bana.

4 January 2006,Munich: Spielberg's best film in years,"In my opinion, Munich is Steven Spielberg's best film since Saving Private Ryan. From the opening scene with a depiction of the Munich massacre to the very end in New York, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It was one of the few times that I could feel my pulse racing during a movie. Spielberg does a great job of building up the tension for each assassination attempt the Israeli team tries on the members of Black September. Each time it seems that something goes wrong so it leaves the audience guessing what will happen next. Munich moves like a thriller but also is a morality tale on violence and revenge. Every member of the team heavily risks their own lives to complete their mission. The greatest example of the toll the mission takes on the men is Eric Bana's character. He has to leave his wife and newborn daughter, almost gets killed by his fellow team member, and begins to question whether the people they are after are really tied to Munich or not. By the end of the film, he becomes so paranoid that he hardly sleeps and is always watching his back.

Without a doubt Munich is Spielberg's most provocative film yet. Schindler's List was more of a tale about one man's change of heart and Saving Private Ryan asked the question of how much is one person's life worth. But Munich asks what is the price for killing someone. It seems to show that there is a heavy price and no reward. The men they kill are replaced by worse people and each of the members of the team become physically and emotionally destroyed in the process.

Munich is not Spielberg's best film, that belongs to Schindler's List. But in my opinion it could come an easy second with Saving Private Ryan. Bana gives his best performance yet and should at least be nominated for Best Actor, if not win it. Spielberg should get his third Best Director Oscar as he proves once again that he can tackle any subject no matter how controversial. Although I have not yet seen all of the movies that have gotten Oscar attention I think that Munich is the best film of 2005. If you have not seen Munich yet, I suggest that you do and get the rare experience of seeing a movie that not only thrills you but also makes you think.",10
16 May 2006,Terrorists Sleep lightly,"I very much liked the film, although having read the book Vengeance in my late teens, I found the book better. To give a little background, I am 29 and I was in the Israeli army not so very long ago. While I did NOT commit any targeted killings or assassinations, I do not sleep as easily as I did in my youth, as there are many late nights. But regrets? - I did what I was called to do in defense of my country, and now I am proud to be able to be here in the greatest country in the world. I must admit it troubles me that many in America do not honor their sons and daughters who serve in military. Anyone who has not walked point or left on an action not certain if they would see first light, has no business saying anything. Hazak to Mr. Spielberg for a film that is relatively even in its approach. I sleep a little better knowing right now that somewhere a terrorist is sleeping with his gun, bug out bag at the ready, knowing there are hunters searching day and night.

15 July 2006,Poor at every level,"Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's ""Munich"" seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. ""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, ""When does it ever end?""

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. ""Munich"" could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul. ""When does it ever end?"" Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",
30 January 2006,"Emotionally realized, yet confusing","The film is full of emotion and interesting reflections upon real-life events. Having said this, it has its flaws. Though the film is very well realized both visually and in terms of narrative, some of the characters seem to have more significance than they actually do within the plot. For example, the old woman who seems to be the leader of the Israilies is a very undeveloped and difficult to understand character. The film can be compared to several of my personal favorites, including ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" (George Clooney), ""Catch me if you can"" (Stephen Spielberg) and ""Schindler's List"" (Stephen Spielberg). Its is an amalgamation of the above, featuring the usual ""Spielberg"" combination of seriousness and humor. In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and stayed ""glued"" to the screen for the whole 3 hours. However, I will go to see in again to try to understand the main character's involvement in the Munich Murders and the significance of the old woman mentioned above.

21 January 2006,Munich,"Munich staring Eric Bana Wow! Went to see this film without knowing too much history about the 1972 Olympic hostage taking. I was not even born yet. I learned so much about Israel and walked out of the film with a greater knowledge of what the Israelites have gone through and the plight if there forefathers. I would highly recommend this film to all who have the slightest bit of interest in History and Israel. I now have decided to take a trip to Israel and check out the Kibbutz, and learn more of their history. The only problem I had with this film was the length, I think it could've had about twenty minutes shaved off, nearing the end I found myself looking at my watch wondering if it was ever going to end. Although I understood the need for it to be the length it was. If you can't sit still in a theater, wait for it to come to video. But do see this film and go in with an open mind. I applaud all the actors for a job well done and hope that this film gives people the message that was intended. Enjoy the movie!

30 January 2006,"Excellent, but Craig a bit wooden.","Munich is a violent, gripping and provocative account of the aftermath of the 1972 Olympic Massacre. It is much less flag-wavingly patriotic than I expected and offers a well rounded view of the issues involved. I wouldn't have minded a little more insight into the civilian casualties of the vengeful attacks. The acting is quite superb for the most part, although the part of the bomb-maker is a touch stereotyped which makes him a little hard to believe. My only other moan is that one is left guessing a little at the end as to the outcomes of some of the characters involved. Craig will be great as James Bond! Overall I would thoroughly recommend this movie but would suggest that it is watched after 5 Days in September, the excellent documentary on the same topic.

22 January 2006,masterpiece? puhlease!,"What a stinker. After reading about Spielberg's displeasure with regards to his studios apparent favoritism of Brokeback Mountain over Munich I felt compelled to give it a go and what a mistake. Anyone looking to catch up on their sleep will be pleasantly surprised. This thing sucked. Political ideologies aside, it was just plain boring. The fact that Israel sanctioned the assassination of the Munich terrorists would itself seem to foster an interesting enough screenplay but Spielberg manages to take any excitement and/or intrigue and bog it down with tiresome dialogue, bad accents and contrived characters. I found myself looking at my watch repeatedly wishing this steamer would end. Spielberg, check your ego at the door next time and leave the directing to someone with a pulse.

10 February 2006,Good but different movie,"This movie will get your internal organs moving... lots of gory and very realistic scenes (not like Kill Bill that seemed like hot sauce); so watch who you bring to the theater and how their diet has been. It is based on real happenings, so that makes it very interesting to see all perspectives on how the middle east battles their internal differences, and takes justice on their hands. Be ready to bring a pillow or a electric massager for the chair, and don't drink too much pop; 'cause its a looong movie (2.5 hours; I didn't want to miss any part off it, but had to make a trip to the J :-(. Hope you like this interesting movie.

26 May 2006,Déjà vu,"I just saw the movie. BUT I have the feeling that every scene that I was watching I have seen it before, years ago. Avner's recruitment, few of the killings, the girl at the bar, her elimination, Brooklyn. Was there another movie with similar scenery? I remember one with Michael York. Very odd. In the helicopter scene, historically, wasn't there a grenade thrown inside? I remember when this massacre happened, It was a completely useless act for the Palestinians, it did much more harm to their credibility, than good. My heart goes to both sides, hoping that one day they will throw down their arms and start using their mouth. Great movie though. Vicotor

26 December 2005,Movie tells both sides of story,"This is an excellent movies that tells both sides of the story and is fair to all political factions involved. It is a mesmerizing movie, and thought provoking. It is far better the the drivel that has been coming out of Hollywood these days. Everyone with a social conscience and an interest in world peace should see this movie. Spielberg does not romanticize the events that have taken place or may have taken place. He gives us a hard look and a terrible period of our world's history. People may criticize the movie, but fair comment must come after viewing the movie and not reacting to hearsay and critics who have given the movie unfavorable press.

24 October 2006,Very intriguing film,"Spielberg has once again directed a film that not only entertains you but keeps you thinking long after the credits roll. Munich manages to tell a true story with just enough embellishment to keep it entertaining while sometimes blurring the documentary line. Sometimes in the film he reminds us we are still in the narrative realm by being somewhat melodramatic. The violence is there too making it look creepily real. The idea of squads of assassins roaming the streets waging a secret war on each other leaving civilians in their wake is scary to say the least. The film had me captured from the beginning until the end and congratulations to Spielberg for directing yet another great film that will probably stand the test of time.

15 April 2006,still crying,"This film destroyed me. Was not expecting that! I don't look to Spielberg for any kind of balanced argument. I was wrong! This film challenged me. It made me angry. It made me proud. I was never sure which was I was going with this whole thing ... good guys, bad guys. I was really affected by Daniel Craig, although Bana was great. I loved the little Truffaut-like Frenchman ... and the visit with his family. I guess I just expected to be dictated to and manipulated. Instead, I was opened up and twisted about. This is what I need from a movie. SEE IT! By the way, they make the minimum line requirement for submitting comments way too long. Way. Too. Long.

31 January 2006,Munich sucks,"Take a true tragedy and make a (bad) thriller inspired by it? Sick idea. And for me that makes any kind of argument of its political content impossible.

So I am not into it. The film is a bunch of clichés connected loosely, and it is so boring I wanted to cut my own throat 30 minutes into it. The friend I went with did not let me leave the theater saying it is my punishment for taking him along to such a pathetic way of spending an entire morning.

And sorry girls, watching Eric Bana's beautifully sculpted butt for almost three hours just doesn't make up to it.

It was the movie I wanted to see most in the last few month - I am angry and disappointed. Mr.Spielberg managed to under-perform even A.I. Time to retire or make E.T.2.

25 April 2006,Lovely,"I've watched the movie and i found it very interesting.I like films based on true stories, all i could say about the film is superlatives.Except one little thing : When Avner goes to Rome to kill the firs enemy, when hi killed him to the elevator the victim falls on his face.Aftre that Avner and his friend goes away.Few seconds after that there comes the cleaner, who takes the fired cartridge.I saw that the victim was on his back.That is little bug :).But the film is really charming.This is a fascinating story with a different viewpoints.I makes you think about the unsolvable problems between Jewish and Arabian people and makes you terrified from all the violence.

12 May 2006,Take the time to watch,"Being born in 1972 is the only thing I have to relate to of this movie. But reading about this in my high school years gave me a very great interest to see this film when it was released. I have to say this was one of the most moving films I've watched in the last few recent years due to the feel of the era itself. The intensity will grip you from minute to minute and will make you think more of this world today. The authenticity of the characters roles were outstanding, along with the reality of these type of incidents some still might ignore. From the beginning it's a roller coaster with intense moments that pull you to the edge of your seat. Even if you have had no interest in this film because of the tragic circumstances you should watch this film as a reminder of what can happen again and again to humanity when loyalty and bloodshed can't distinguish right from wrong.

29 December 2005,A movie that should be seen,"This movie should be seen by all those who are of the proper age and not of the faint of heart. It was thought-provoking and horrifying, but did a very good job of addressing the question of, is an eye for an eye really the answer. I am a teacher and will suggest that my older students go nd see the film, so that we can discuss the moral issues brought up in it and also, what else could have been done by the Israelis, after the Munich bombings, instead of what was done, if anything. The film was very violent, however, I believe the violent scenes were done in an appropriate way, if there is such a thing, so that it was more painful than absolutely, gut-wrenchingly gory--don't get me wrong, there are some of those scenes too, but the focus was more on the plot than the blood and guts. I believe this is an important movie about an incident that far too many people know far too little about. This is the best movie I have seen in years.

13 May 2006,Nine of the Eleven,"Did anyone else notice at the end that 9 of the 11 targets were assassinated, and that they chose to print this info over the twin towers??? Coincidence?? I wasn't around yet when the attacks at Munich took place, but there are an awful lot of 9's and 11's when it comes to, well to be PC about it, this type of story.If there are any of you that may have more insight, I'd love to hear it. Overall, I found the film to be fabulous! It's the type of thing that I wish I had learned in school. The only time I heard of this was when my parents or grandparents talked about it. And that was usually a french-Canadian perspective.

7 December 2006,"Israelis, STOP exploiting girls from the former Eastern bloc","In the Jan 11, 98 edition New Orleans Times-Picayune, Michael Specter wrote an article entitled ""Slave-traders Lure Slavic Women"" discussing how Israelis exploit girls from the former Eastern bloc:

""She was 21, self-assured and glad to be out of Ukraine. Israel offered a new world, and for a week or two everything seemed possible. Then, one morning, she was driven to the brothel, where her boss burned her passport before her eyes. ""I own you,"" she recalled his saying. ""You are my property, and you will work until you earn your way out. Don't try to leave. You have no papers and you don't speak Hebrew. You will be arrested and deported. Then we will get you and bring you back.""

""The Women who work there, like nearly all prostitutes in Israel, are Russian, their boss is not. 'Israelis love Russian girls,' said Israeli slave master Jacob Golan...'They are blonde and good looking and different from us.'""

In the April 1998 edition of Moment magazine which bills itself as the ""Magazine of Jewish Culture and Opinion,"" there was an article entitled ""Hookers in the Holy Land""

""A good percentage of the customers - or Johns, in the lingo - are ultra-orthodox Jews, pious men whose lives are guided by halachah (religious law), which tells them when they can or cannot have sex with their wives. So, on Thursday afternoons, (boys night out in Israel) bus loads of Orthodox JEws travel from Jerusalem, Haifa, and points beyond to Tel Aviv for a few precious moments of passion in a massage parlor, behind a sand dune, or a in an alleyway. Other customers are accountants, lawyers, policemen, and politicans. 'The entire spectrum of Israeli society is keeping the hookers in business.' Claims Detective Shachar, a cynical veteran on the Tel Aviv detail...'Tel Baruch is so very absurd and so very Israel.'""

""once the girls arrive in Israel, the crime bosses take over. The girls are usually taken to an 'auction house,' where the owners of the various 'massage parlors' can bid on the talent - each one offers a price, and the highest bidder gets the girl...The girls are virtual slaves.""

8 October 2006,Depressing,"OK - this was meant to be a serious film, but this was possibly the most depressing movie I have ever seen. It makes Schindlers List seem lighthearted. Yes it was cinematically powerful etc. etc. but it was just too miserable. Parts of the movie were also confusing and I thought it would be more factual but it appeared to cross the line into Hollywood particularly with the murders, their graphic nature and overacted scenes! This was further enhanced by the gratuitous sex scene with his pregnant wife!I can say I neither laughed nor cried once during this movie. It was like watching a three hour Panorama!As Spielberg directed, I was expecting a lot more, and the film had a lot of great reviews. Definitely not for me.

25 December 2005,Very powerful film to reflect on today's politics & media,"I would like to praise Steven Spilberg for bringing three things to the fore: a) Violence only breeds more violence; b) Jewish morals are incompatible with the needs of a State and politicians; c) Nothing disappears, but what goes comes.

The movie brings the humane inside the manipulation of politics. When the actors reflect on their Jewishness, they cannot fulfill their function.

The toy maker says in one of his lines that he is losing his soul. The revenge does not bring peace but more blood. Everybody is a loser. The French resistance is still alive since the Second World War, nothing really disappears. Violence will breed more violence ad infinitum....

I wish that this movie will bring a change in the myths created by ideologies and should allow people in the Middle East to find a modus vivendi that will suit everybody. Moreover, I wish that the sons of Abraham should reflect in their origins, forgive each other and profit from the blessings received at that time.

Thank you to Mr. Spilberg and his crew",9
8 January 2006,I have seen this movie before,"Has anyone out there seen the movie Sword of Gideon (released in 1986) Seems like Steven just did a bit of a rewrite. Similar plot. I was about 10 minutes into the movie when I realized this was a remake. My mind was telling me I had seen this movie before. The killer-babe in the bar. The explosive guys dying by his own device. Sword of Gideon is based on the novel Vengeance. Steven Bauer is Avner and does a great job. Michael York, Rod Steiger are in the cast. It was directed by Michael Inderson, who also directed two Orca movies, Logan's Run (Michael York again), Shoes of the Fisherman and the Quiller Memorandum. Seems to me that this movie deserved more praise and should have been mentioned in all the Spielberg hype.

8 October 2006,Remakes,"Steven Spielberg's remake of the 1986 Sword of Gideon is a fine production but as I watched it the storyline of the 1986 production was being replayed almost exactly. Spielberg shows little in the way of originality in his film. Too bad he didn't acknowledge the 20 year old film as a source. Sword of Gideon is a better title for the piece. The cast was a good one in this latest production of the story of the assassins who hunted down those responsible for the killing of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Although it is clear what happened at Munich it was not particularly clear exactly how all the athletes were killed nor how many of the killers were killed during the hostage taking. For dramatic effect, I suppose, Spielberg has chosen to present much of this as flashback in the form of nightmares of the Israeli assassin group leader. Detailing of this part of the story up front would have helped the storyline.

25 December 2005,Stock characters; stock scenes,"The movie is not really about Jews and Palestinians, except ostensibly. Anyone who sees it will become aware of how generic the whole thing is: just hunter vs. the hunted. The film is composed of repeated and not so inspired scenes that set up and show violence, each scene a little different, each scene a little tense, but each scene 'no name brand' action all the way. Stock characters, stock scenes. No villains. Who's a villain, the fat diplomat-guy sitting at his desk whose daughter plays the piano? Maybe he is, but from the movie's perspective we don't even know him. Not enough depth. No heroes: even Avner is not really well drawn. We got platitudes from his mother, and faithfulness from his wife. You don't ever see Palestinian counter-planning. And to think, Spielberg has been accused for being even-handed, or making the Israeli-Arab conflict into something smacking of moral equivalence. Not true. Had you seen Palestinian strategy at work you might have had a case to make for moral equivilance. But this flick was derivative of lots of other movies. ""Capone"" showed the possibility of a little girl getting blown-up in a bomb in a more dramatic way than did this movie. We got a touch of Hitchcock, a touch of the Le Carre spy who grows weary of the game. On and on. And it was all too long. And that shot of the Twin Towers? (They're coming here, too!) Scorsese did that in 'Gangs of New York.'",4

24 November 2006,"Interesting film, but not original","Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath.

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg.

A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution.

It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",
14 April 2007,Shocking -- again,"After seeing the filming of Munich, the entire story came back to me. The movie is well done, but much too long and dragged out. For some obvious reason, the anger I felt in 1972, during and after this monstrous event. What anger? Of course the terrorists, who managed to get into the Olympic compound, and carry out their dirty job. The Germans, who did nothing and just let things happen, as they did. The Olympic committee, for continuing the games, as if nothing had happened, and the uncalled for reactions of the people responsible for this lack of caring. Stevem Spielberg, for managing to put a human face on the terrorists. His excuses at the beginning of the film, were uncalled for. Those terrorists, as well as the terrorists today, are inhuman monsters. When I heard the mention of releasing 200 of their prisoners, I saw no change today, where they kidnap, kill and request releasing terrorists, which we already did and they went back to their old terrorism. At the time of the these happenings, my neighbor in Michigan, who was at the Olympic Games, took the first flight home. She was sick and disgusted. She was not Jewish, but saw the inhumanity of the terrorists and the arrogance of the Germans. Angry? Yes! The movie is excellent, but it hits home and shows the terrorism, which has lasted to this day. By the way, my late husband, was one of the people sent a letter bomb when he was on diplomatic service for the UN, in the 1970's.",7
9 April 2023,Such a fantastic if hard to watch at times.,"To start with Steve Spielberg is one if not the best in the business...every film albeit a couple of shockers (ready player one and AI being two very forgettable films) Munich however is what Spielberg does best, a story teller which sadly was based on true events. The cast was perfect, Eric Bana played his character so well, Daniel Craig again couldn't fault him, cirain hindes and the rest played this film out brilliantly.

Comments on here suggest factually the film was inaccurate but I for one really enjoyed the film, again as I commented earlier tragic and hard to watch at times but Spielberg does this so well... excellent film.

1 January 2006,definitely worth seeing,"This was certainly one of the best movies that I have ever seen, I enjoyed the more 'realistic' and personal view of the Israeli retaliation against the Palistinians' terror attack on Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Also, the tension in the movie only builds as the end nears, outlining the dilemma that a person in any comparable or metaphorical situation must face when making such a decision. The dilemma is whether or not 'action' will solve anything, will make the situation better off than beforehand and in retrospect, be worth it in light of what might happen as a result. Anyhow, I think that it is unfortunate that King Kong has grossed twenty times more than Munich so far, Kong was good, but Munich was definitely better. So any of you who have not seen it yet need to get on it.

27 December 2005,Great Movie+ As if Spielberg can do anything else,"MUNICH is an excellent movie and deserves every award given. Having said that it could stand to be a little shorter. At 2 hours and 44 minutes one starts to notice the time past by the numbness in the butt. The story is the aftermath of the 1972 Munich Olympic Games terrorist attack. 11 Isreali hostages were taken and killed. The story revolved around what the Mossad (Isreali version of the CIA) did to those who funded and planned the attack. Eric Bana is surprisingly good in the role. He shows the guilt of an assassin as well as the determination of person doing what he believes is the right and true thing to do. Ciran Hinds is equally good and deserves award nominations as the cleaner This film is action packed and very thrilling. It does not shy away from blood and gore. Bombs are detonated and you see the true aftermath. People are shot and don't just grab where they were supposedly shot and fall over. You see the blood. Definitely earned the rating of R. Spielberg cares for the material and is shown in every minute of the movie

1 January 2006,Too Detail/Not Too Detail,"First of all, I remember seeing this movie before. Almost 20 years ago I saw ""SWORD OF GIDEON"" starring Steven Bauer (Scarface) and Michael York. Both movies are based on the same book, but there are significant differences. The movie was a little long, some parts were too detail while others skipped passed details you may have found useful. The problem most likely is that only so much of the actual events are known. There are some mysteries that remain to this day I suppose. The movie gets a bit into the ideologies to most likely humanize the Mossad and the Terrorists. I think that since we are bombarded with the events of the middle east every day it wasn't important to include the discourse. There is something insinuated almost at the very end of the movie that I was surprised by...truth or theory I couldn't say.

5 January 2006,Great Film,"i saw this movie last week with my best friend. each week (friday mostly) we go to see a movie. last week it was Munich. and i have to say that this has been one of the best movies i have seen in a long time. it had a bit of everything. I'm the kind of movie buff who likes all types of movies and i judge them all differently. i was sketchy about seeing this because one of my friends told me it was a waste of 3hours. but hes the type of guy who likes mindless meaningless movies. so i decided to go and see it. first off. it wasn't at my local movies. so then i drove 30mins to see it. when i got there i found out the showing (7:30pm) was sold out. so i then decided to wait till the 11:30pm Showing. and after the movie was out. it was worth the drive and wait. i would recommend this movie to pretty much anyone. its worth the 2hours and 45mins. and worth a drive and wait if u have to. i give this film a 9/10 if not a full 10/10.

ps: sorry about my spelling and grammar. I'm on a school computer typing this.

28 January 2006,Don't waste your time,"I can't get over the terrific reviews this movie got and all the positive comments in this site. I found this movie to be ponderous. Way too long. Way too heavy. Way too repetitive. Way too boring. It's depressing, dark, hopeless, and pointless.

Watching Bana struggle with his angst for over 2 hours was almost more than I could take. I hung in there to the end, though, hoping for a satisfying ending. Instead I got a ridiculous sex scene where our ""hero"" is envisioning gruesome murders while in the act. Sure, I know it was symbolic of something or other, but by the time we got to it, I was too bored to care.

Also, our ""hero"" is a glamorized murderer. He knows it, even if Goeffrey Rush does his best to justify it in the name of national security. Sound familiar?

Then we have the cinematography that everyone is raving about. I found the washed out, grainy texture, and artsy lighting totally at odds with the realistically gruesome death scenes that littered this movie. After you've seen the first few heads blow apart, and smoke rising from the bullet riddled bodies, it gets a bit old. It wasn't as drawn out as in Saving Private Ryan, but you can tell he used the same special effects people.

I guess I'm just not hip or cool enough to really appreciate this movie, but I wonder how many of the people who are gushing over it would do so if the director's name wasn't Spielberg. Spielberg has been taking himself way too seriously ever since he had such success with Schindler's list. That was a masterpiece, and I have the feeling he keeps trying to equal it or better it with his subsequent films. It just ain't happening.

One final note. There was a much better take on these events in the 1986 movie ""Sword of Gideon"". It was based on the same book with the same characters and story, but without the preaching.",3
25 January 2006,Not Worthy of Spielberg...Boo,"I'll give this a 5 out of ten and I'll tell you why. As great a filmmaker as Spielberg is, and I count one of his movies in my Top Ten, this is not worthy. He is basically making a remake or a slight altered version of a the film that has been made. This film based on the same novel by George Jonas is called ""Sword of Gideon"" and was made in 1986. Partially in Canada I might add. However, regarding the authenticity and budget of this film (""Sword of Gideon""), it shows a vision that is far superior due to the restraints of the production, cast and crew team. I respect what Spielberg has done in the past, but I would like to see what he could make on a shoestring budget in the present day. ""Sword of Gideon"" is a far superior film.

A note to our friend, Michael from the States. ""Saving Private Ryan"" was another miss by Spielberg. The first 15 minutes were totally interesting, then it got boring. How can you disrespect the works of other great directors you've mentioned??? Stone, Coppola and Minghella. I suggest you familiarize yourself more on film before you criticize it. Read some of the interesting posts on the ""Sword of Gideon"" page!! It just goes to show you sometimes Money Talks!!.....NuffSaid.........",5
26 December 2005,some flaws,"here are some of the flaws that I saw. 1)Unlike Schindler's List, it didn't draw in the viewer. The acting was excellent but Avner remained emotionally unattached to the AUDIENCE. He was not someone that we (or I) could identify with. 2)the subplots weren't developed. Who were the different people? Why were the Israelis chasing them (besides being terrorists)? The role of some of the terrorists was unclear. 3)In conjuction to #2, there were too many (yes, I know that it was a global net work)who just were mentioned or appeared and just as quickly disappeared without much explanation...including the Israelis 4)The safe house scene was confusing 5)Was anyone also confused about the roles of Papa and his son? (yes, they were selling info, but why and why did Papa remain aloof from son? The garden scene with Avner: what was that about? 6)Avner's mom/ima? Why was she even IN the film? 7)it was about 45 minutes too long, it dragged in parts.

All that to say, a little on the boring side. The real event affected me profoundly.

8 January 2006,Great Piece of History!,"Steven Spielberg has just scored another triumph following War of the Worlds which was a huge box office smash! Eric Bana is so lucky to work with Steven along with many of the other actors including the always talented Gefforey Rush who was remarkable as the case officer. A true piece of world history brought to life by one of the most influencle filmmakers of all time! It is brilliantly shot with good use of archival footage of the real Munich event. The cast was so into the world around them as if they were actually experiancing it for themselves. The score was chilling. John Williams made a good use of a singer making the score more effective than some of his other works. The film was a fantastic piece of history brought to life!

14 May 2006,"Not bad, but lets face it, sloppy film-making","So who were these French guys and why are they connected to everyone? How did Avner's high school buddy's girlfriend happen to know them? Why was no one angry with the Frenchies after the safe house fiasco? Why was Salaami's house so poorly guarded and why would Avner and Daniel Craig be able to get that close and have a clear shot, and then be able to run away from gunfire. This film, while trying to make a statement, simply required too many leaps of faith for me to really take it seriously. Several times I was thinking that it seemed fake. Sorry Mr. Spielberg, you can't expect people to overlook these ""trivial"" matters, regardless of the films message.

26 December 2005,Spielberg's greatest work,"This movie was a delightful surprise for me. It is my tentative vote for best picture of the year. It has all the elements of a great movie. There is a good amount of violence, a good amount of nudity, great dialog, great acting, great directing, interesting plot. The length was a little less than three hours, and I was never bored. Although at some moments this movie was visually disturbing (graphic violence) I walked out of the movie with a great taste in my mouth. Eric Banna captures the fear of being hunted by unknown enemies perfectly, and all of the rest of the roles are cast perfectly. Much of the movie was shot in Europe, and these scenes are beautiful and do a good job of capturing European daily life. I can't think of another time when I was more pleased by a Spielberg film.

30 January 2006,Not disappointed,"I've seen this movie 3 days ago, with a friend. I'm neither a Muslim nor a Jew. I went to see the movie because it was the only one i hadn't seen yet, i wasn't especially looking forward to it, neither was my friend, but we were at the cinema, and it was freezing cold outside. So at first, knowing Spielberg 's a Jew, i was a little afraid the movie might be pro- Israel, not really showing both sides of the conflict. U know, mean Arabs, poor nice Jews, that kind of thing. But happily, i realized -but once again i want to repeat i'm not especially involved in the conflict and i surely don't know much about it, except from what i read in the newspapers which i don't think is reliable- that Spielberg, didn't only show Jews as victims and Arabs as terrorists. To me, the meaning of the movie, is that in both sides there are terrorists and victims at the same time. When i see the reaction of people in this very website, i simply cannot understand how religion which is supposed to be all about love and respect can still lead to so much hate, and i mean, it's just a movie. Another message of the movie i agree with, through all the many wars mankind has lived, why haven't we learned the lesson yet : killing human beens shall never be a solution to any problem at all. I know i'm not saying anything new or really clever. I'm just a young woman, living in a world i mainly know by what some books or papers say about, i don't live in the place where the fight is going on, but from my point of view, which is certainly very naive and simple, it seems no god who requires children, men or women to be killed in his name deserves anyone to believe in him anyway.",
30 January 2006,Munich: long but good,"Munich is about the actions taken after the murder of 11 Israeli athletes in the 1972 Munich Olympics. After watching it I have to say that it has earned itself a place in my favorite spy movies. The plot moves along fast enough to keep you interested and at the same time they still make progress with how much time they spend on a certain aspect. two thumbs way up for the filming done, not just because of the good portrayal of the true brutality of the nature of murder, but also when elements of the storyline are mixed together. Another element that adds to the movie is the fact that it is based on actual events further adding to the surrealism.

28 January 2006,Is this popular,"I've just seen this movie today, as it was only released in Australia on Thursday (Jan 26, Australia Day). Despite it being a bit too long, I really thought it was very good, better than I expected.

What I would like to know, is this movie popular in the US? I'm confused because it has only appeared on the US Box Office Top 10 three times and has since dropped off. Was it well received there, is it popular? Just curious.

I'm sure it did veer from the facts, as all movies do, but I thought it was very interesting. (N.B. I do not know enough about the situation to comment or take sides, so please reserve those opinions for another thread).

23 December 2005,"Good Action/Suspense, Intriguing Story, Unsatisfying Finish","Munich is a great action/suspense movie, which unlike many films of its genre also has a very intriguing storyline and conflict. The problem was the movie's resolution. Munich does indeed ask very tough (and good) ethical questions, but provides answers that are WAY too easy. In case anyone is wondering, the story is not actually about the 1972 Olympic Incident-thats just the backdrop. Rather, the movie is about revenge in general, and whether violence justifies more violence. Without providing any specific plot details, my main problem with the ""easy"" answers is that Spielberg presents a whole complicated world with many shades of gray, then takes a black and white stance supporting one side at the end. Note: NOT for the faint of heart (there are some VERY gruesome death images).

1 February 2006,Spielberg deals with reality once again to good effect,"I have to confess to not knowing as much as I think I ought to about the continuing problems in Israel. The events of Munich 1972 were previously unknown to me other than the basic premise that there was a terrorist attack. For someone who may not grasp why even today Palestine and Israel are at each other's throats Munich provides some of the ideals at the core of the problem. The film, as with Schindler's List, doesn't hold back from showing you the realities of events that have happened, which perhaps adds to its impact.

The film as a form of entertainment may not hold the attention of some but instead is more of a case study into terrorism and counter terrorism. Eric Bana provides a really good performance as the central character helping form a human connection to the story. It is also not a specific side driven piece even if it is told from one point of view it doesn't sugar-coat everything. The reality is quite shocking and Spielberg's direction as usual is excellent, it is also helped by a good script that only begins to lose its pace by the end of what is quite a long film.

I would recommend people seeing this in order that, as with the holocaust in Schindler's List, it becomes more than just history, even with fictional characters and events mixed into the actual events. This makes it more real and increases your understanding and perception of what could otherwise just be events happening a while ago in far off places. The atmosphere is tense and is heightened by the music of the ever reliable genius that is John Williams. Along with Bana there are also good supporting roles for Geoffrey Rush and Ciaran Hinds who added two very interesting characters.

Munich may have caused controversy but you have to really try to fault Spielberg as a film maker. Whether its dinosaurs, terrorists or alien invasions he somehow finds an extra level that most other directors don't reach.",8
29 January 2006,Watch it on DVD not in a cinema it is just not worth it.,"The cast is great, by the way. But the film just took to long and dragged some scenes to the point that I thought I am going to just walk out of the cinema. Spielberg could have made a great film and the story was good but it just wasn't what I expected from it. The hostage of the athletes had only a minor role in this film. Well the main characters some kind of flashbacks of the hostage situation but how can he know about those details while he just wasn't there. I thought the cast was great especially the main character and Daniel Craig was good to but it just wasn't worth the money and I recommend to watch it on DVD when it is released.

My regards, JuX

27 December 2005,Look at comment,"WOW..This movie was so much more than what I was expecting. The movie shows the angst of each of the main characters as they question whether their loyalty to their country and religion is worth killing men with loving families. Though I will not discuss what I believe to be the film's underlying theme, their are poignant scenes which underscore the futility of violence. While I do not know Spielberg's politics, anyone who says this movie takes sides is simply wrong. Like ""Requiem for a Dream"", this is a movie I believe many people with experience in the subject ought to see. In my opinion, this movie is the year's Best Picture so far.

30 December 2005,Excellently directed and performed but lacking in direction,"As the synopsis says, the movie focuses on Avner and his team of untrained assassins trying to take out the Palestinians involved in the 1972 slaying of Israeli Olympians. Steven Spielberg, as expected, did an excellent job directing the movie and both the performances of the ensemble together and Eric Bana individually were outstanding. The movie brings up thought-provoking ideas about terrorism and vengeance, however, it is not until the last twenty minutes of the movie that they are explored. Most of the movie is spent following the team through its attempts to assassinate the members of Black September. Although there are brief images and references to the themes explored later in the movie, I felt that the movie was more thriller/drama than the drama/thriller as which it has been billed. This is not to say that the movie missed the point, but it was not until late in the movie that the viewer was shown the moral consequences faced by the characters and the ramifications of their actions.

I feel that this is the only problem with the movie however. As stated above, the movie is excellently made and well presented, but I feel that the screenplay was lacking in substance, which takes away from the excellence of the other aspects of the film. The movie is very good and is definitely worth seeing, but was ultimately a disappointment, considering who worked on it.",7
1 January 2006,Munich - didn't like it,"I just left Spielberg's Munich, and found it to be a waste of time. It was too long, too predictable and quite boring. Plots and subplots were just so much rehash of many other stories and styles. Very disappointing.

This certainly was not Spielberg's best work.

Acting was minimally acceptable, too many scenes were contrived and kept me from being swept into the film's characters and plots, which I deem the sign of a good work.

Despite the subject matter, I found a significant lack of political and social intensity. Perhaps my expectations were too high.

At least I got to see some beautiful European street scenes and architecture. For that I gave a score of 3/10. But this alone can't make up for a long and tedious time spent in an uncomfortable seat.",3

This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work.

""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, ""When does it ever end?""

This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg.

The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. ""Munich"" could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul.

It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",9
26 December 2005,Excellent review on Munich,"Read this wonderful review on Munich.

http://www.idlebrain.com/research/ramblings/ramblings-munich.html.

It is impossible to ignore the burden of history involving Israel and Palestine, in any act that involves these two constantly warring sides, with one fighting for a right to survive and the other fighting for a right to exist in the same few thousand square miles, which is ironically considered to be the most sacred of lands to all the major religions involved - Islam, Judaism and Christianity. With the world polarized about the issue of taking stands of one against the other, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict almost took the shape of a morality issue, where one man's freedom fighter became another man's terrorist.

8 January 2006,"Long, confused, boring but well acted","I found this film unnecessarily long (2 3/4 hours)which made me wish that I could have edited it. I could have cut at least an hour out without damaging it in any way. The flashbacks were choppy and in some cases unintelligible. More time should have been given to the actual massacre up front and the flashbacks would have been unnecessary. The picture felt very propagandistic to me and I can see why Spielberg was accused of being anti-Israel.

I will say however that the acting was excellent and the use of lesser known actors was effective. Somehow, I could not have seen Tom Cruise taking the part of Avner. I would give this film 2 stars at best.

8 January 2006,A Great Movie,"Munich is a great movie, definitely one of Spielberg's best films. Munich shouldn't be looked upon as just as a drama, thriller, or action film, but a piece of history that everyone should know about. Spielberg tells the story in a violent, brutal and mature fashion. More importantly, he makes the film feel more real than any other film inspired by true events. The events that take place after the murders of the athletes in the film are intriguing. You will be tuned in, and at the same time feel uneasy. This is much on the same level as Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, but this time around the main characters aren't portrayed as heros or monsters, just men on mission in which they aren't entirely prepared for emotionally. The performances are great, especially Eric Bana who i hope gets recognition this time around.

While the mood and tone of the film is perfect, the films editing has a few problems. Some scenes could have gone/been shortened. The sex scene intercut with the Munich killings bothered me the most. Even if the intercutting had its own message, i still feel Munich killings shouldn't have been intercut at all. The editing also creates some confusion and it is at times hard to follow whats going, sometimes feeling like you've been left out some important points. You'll have your gripes, but certainly not as much as you did with War of the Worlds :) Its not perfect, and some of Spielbergs decisions may be controversial, but its still an important film and its problem hurt the experience little. Highly recommended.",9
9 January 2006,Uninspiring,"I have seen better and expected better work from Spielberg. Munich offers several great performances, like those of Eric Bana and Geoffery Rush. However, while the story is influenced by the actual events that follow the Munich massacre, it offers very little to movie goers who are looking to be entertained. Munich drags along while making generic and exhausted points on Middle Eastern politics that anyone who is even remotely familiar with the Arab-Israeli conflict would already be tired of seeing. If you're looking for an engaging political thriller, go see Syriana. If you're interested in the Arab-Israeli conflict, I would recommend that you borrow a book from your local library, and not watch Munich. The only thing that saves this movie from a lower rating, in my opinion, is Eric Bana's performance, which is certainly Oscar worthy. The only good part of the movie was the 15 second conversation between the bomb maker and Avner in the airport, before Avner and the other men leave to find the Dutch assassin. Finally, the movie ends without resolution, much like the nature of the Arab-Israeli conflict. This story would make a good documentary, but not a good feature film. If you're annoyed by the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict, you will be annoyed by this movie also.",7

18 January 2006,Average,"I took 6 18- 20 year old to see this and to them it was awful, i have to agree compared to his other work this Spielberg film was poor. The plot is good as are the actors, but the most important thing is it takes too long to tell the story. The build up to each action scene diverted into irrelevant areas. There are two sex scenes that are just not relevant. The shock horror moments are shocking because the volume in the cinema is too loud and the gore is too visible, he needs to go back to Jaws to remember about suspense. I would also question why they put subtitles in for some dialogue and not others. This film could loose at least 30 mins and it would perhaps flow a little better. I have tried not to give the plot away so that people can judge themselves.

23 January 2006,simply heist,"i never really understood what happened at Munich. Simply because i just didn't read into it, but after watching this movie,i was captivated. I'm not saying either that this movie is perfect. No one was actually there. But the people that were are dead,and of course there simply too many sides to this tragic event to actually have 1 extraordinary movie.I saw it as just the both sides without being biased about it.What they did as vengeance .Eric Bana ,must say this film is his finest yet. I love movies that keep me anxious.This was Exactly it! I felt connected to these characters. i felt i was part of the Entente. The most captivating part that sensed like ""the fall of superman"" was towards the end when he really became ""the man who slept in his Closet"". After that scene i was completely in love/already lust with Avner. He definitely has that intenseness about him.That makes him a real actor. According to me...

25 January 2006,Quality movie,"In spite of what some people might say, we (my husband and I)love the movie. It gives a nice view on the stupidity on both sides. Spielberg doesn't take sides, but had to choose from which point of view to show what happened then and what is still going on at the moment. In Belgium a lot of Jews en Arabs live in the same neighborhoods and are trying to live peacefully together.

The movie had beautiful screen-shots, extraordinary music and the cast was well chosen. This is a high quality movie with great potential of letting people thing about certain things. I was surprised to see how well Spielberg captured certain situations and succeeded in keeping the viewer chained to their chairs. The movie is showing in Belgium from 25th January. We were two of the lucky ones to see it in premiere.

I would love to see more quality movies like this!

29 January 2006,Spielberg has made a mess by trying to criticize US indirectly,"It's a shame this pro terrorist film uses the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians to actually criticize THE US and Bush without doing so directly, because Spielberg is too scared to lose over 50% of his US paying customers he sacrifices Israel instead, blurring the lines between terror and anti terror. He wants to say to president Bush what he really thinks of his policies and actions after 9/11.

Why do I say this? In the book ""vengeance"" Avner comes back to Israel and goes back to being an officer in the army ( his pre mossad job ) and in Spielberg's film Avner stays in NY city, and the twin towers are seen in the background as if to confirm and make all the movies statements on violence true.

In the book ""vengeance"" the idea of anti terror is explained: to buy time, when a well established terrorist ring is whipped out it takes years to reorganize and lives of civilians are saved.

Another thing that didn't ring true is making ""black September"" terrorist ""freedom fighters"" they never represented Palestinians and should not be confused as fighting for the Palestinian people, black September kidnapped the athletes in order to get 200 More terrorists out of Israeli prisons.

Spielberg has made a mess by trying to criticize US indirectly; as a result he offends many sides",4

1 February 2006,Hearted film,"whereas any critics about the equalization of contra- and terrorism, this picture set a remarkable idea. the world won't be secure if the people ain't got a home. i think Bana's performance needs the Oscar. it's about violence, not so about murders, but about your life been used by the militaries that ""protect you"". and there is a brilliant point when Avner is thinking about his loyalty, where he belongs to? the french militia are even more trustsworthy than the army of his country. he belongs to his wife and daughter. about jews and arabs in the little country of palestina, about one by one and one by millions of deaths, the chaotic war beneath the news.

1 February 2006,the purpose of the film,"For any movie,there is always a target that a director and screenwriter want to hit? what was it in this film? If it was to achieve suspense and action movie ,they did. If it was to convey that the aim justifies the means ,they also did.If it was to condemn violence ,they hardly succeeded.And if it was to look at the events of the struggle between Palestinians and Israelis with a neutral eye ,they failed. Despite the conversation between Ali and Avner which included hints on the homeless Palestinians , it was not enough to convince the audience of the fair case that the Palestinians fight for. What the film did was depicting the Israeli team as heroes and Palestinians as terrorists.Nevertheless,Ephraim's words :'kill for peace' raises the question: which kind of peace built on others'bodies can the Israelis achieve?

2 February 2006,Just seen the movie. It has re enforced my feelings that violence achieves nothing but more violence,"I am a British nurse who has cared for civilian victims in Vietnam ('67-70) Cambodia (79-80),Lebanon(83-85)Saudi Arabia (88-93). After 16 years in the Middle East I have come to understand how people see things in Egypt, Lebanon, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Saudi.) Munich was a brave film for Spielberg to undertake, and he did not pull any punches. It highlights the futility and heart break of vengeance. It will take politicians of courage, vision and initiative to draw a line under this tit for tat violence. Where are the world leaders with this courage? We need you now as never before, and this film illustrates that clearly. The old way of thinking is just that - old.Outdated. If we are to move forward in this world, we have to ditch the old idea of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. There is still time.

4 February 2006,Terrorism is the preferred weapon of the strong.,"Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's ""Munich"" seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. ""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, ""When does it ever end?""

At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book ""Vengeance"" by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, ""Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values."" Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.

In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a ""good soldier"". Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, ""When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything""

Nothing about ""Munich"" is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. ""Munich"" could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul. ""When does it ever end?"" Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. ""Munich"" is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",8
25 February 2006,despite the film,"i have watched the film.i should say it is very clever way see events in Hollywood.i would not talk about Spielberg or Jewish way of making film.but i would like to know why is the source of ""black September"".why these ""Arabs"" are willing to kill Israeli's. the way of film is to make us to be absent for the killed assassins of Israel.but don't forget there is a sentence after Munich event that Israel's killed 200 civilians in palest.so assassination didn't begin with Munich.read about Israel history.if you read real history you would see this is a political act of Israel today truth is lost in middle east.because people are fighting for so many years.but shouldn't person like assassin leader(Eric Ban) think before killing people. if you have no change to say you are in bad condition you cant talk about ethic.so Arabs have no channel to say what they live in that region.i am not in the part of terrorists but, we should decide what the terrorism is. a nation cant be a terrorist.character that Eric Ban playing is terrorist or not.if it is who supported and educated him to do this.so if you want to (and willing to ask) questions , you will find real answers and fell lonely in my opinion after this film search for real events. if you don't this film takes you to the wrong place",5
12 February 2006,a serious look at the cycle of violence,"An excellent but gruesome window into the world of terrorism, how it affects innocent lives and how retaliation just leads to more terrorism. Innocent lives of victims but also of loved ones of those involved, from all sides deeply affected by these acts. Eric Bana is brilliant as the lead character, starting off so confidently and then living in fear as the tables turn. Also, interesting how real assassins work and had to cope with lack of technology such as cellphones etc which we have today. Having to be so close to the targets to set off devices made it hit them harder emotionally whereas today, assassins can be really far away from their target and achieve ""neater"" cold-blooded results. Scenery of European cities is touchable and the reconstruction of various memoirs from the 70's is well done, such as the fashion, transport, technology etc. A must see, gripping, serious movie. Could have been a little shorter but excellent. (PS: to Daniel Craig (Steve) - South African Jews sound more English in accent than Australian! We look forward to seeing you as 007!)

21 February 2006,"Yeah, a fun fiction film....","I saw the film in the cinema with my sister (she didn't know nothing about the Munich massacre and still doesn't, but that's OK), to be honest I enjoyed it... It was a nice Hollywoodian film. I mean, I can compare this film to 007, Mission Impossible, or Men in Black...A nice plot, very interesting but definitely unreal .It's a fiction movie.

In the beginning its written ""Based on real facts"", I can say that the only real fact was the Munich Massacre. It's not reasonable to believe that Mossad (one of the world's best-known and most highly regarded intelligence agencies) actually contract non-prepared people to their missions, their agents are known as the most prepared ones. The best proof of it it's in the Operation Wrath of God, which was accomplished professionally.

But Steven Spielberg's inspiration it's the worst thing: the book ""Vengeance: the True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team"" known as being not accurate and exaggerated, not a really good source. But I had fun watching it, and that's the important!!!!I recommend it.",7
23 February 2006,A fictional movie..,"I always liked movies by Steven Spielberg. He made me look in my car mirror for a killer-truck. He made me weep when E.T. was a pale crying puppy ...and don't get me started on the Indiana series. But, when it comes to a 'facts-based' movie like ""Munich"", he should have changed the title to ""N.Y."", ""Cairo"", ""Moscow"", ""Berlin"" or any other irrelevant name. The most appropriate name would have been ""Munich - My own interpretation"".

This movie is not based on historical evidence. This is history re-written by Hollywood motivation. Looks like truth is not relevant in the 20th (21st) century.

7 March 2006,just what i think,"hello everyone. I tried to watch this film ignoring the fact that is based on a true event. Why?. Spielberg is confusing me very much. I don't know if he wants to make a movie to get more money or if he really wants to narrate a very important event. the formula of Spielberg worked really well in ""SAVING PRIVATE RYAN"" but since then with movies like ""WAR OF THE WORLDS"" you can notice that the formula can't work all the time. So he mixes drama-adventure-action to get all the audiences, get recognized and money. But try to look the movie as just a movie and you will see how the characters repeat themselves in previous movies and the plot is so simply that when you remember that is based on true events what you can think it's: ""Human race is so stupid"". Revenge that's the secret of the movie. And some people are proud about it. I do not support any kind of killing and surely i do not take side, i just fell sorry for the families of the people who died. the movie don't deserve any award i think, it's just another movie. Besides the people who lived that event must remember it really well and a movie like this, i think, can't make a deep change on the things that people believe. IT's too personal.",5
29 March 2006,The best film I have seen this year!,"This film was absolutely outstanding! It had a terrific base for a plot, and the way this was put on to the screen was brilliant. It had amazing acting in it, and i thought that they handled a delicate issue well in making this film. I have to say i am thoroughly glad i went and watched it, it is the best film i have seen this year! It was intricately put together and although it seemed complex, you were able to follow it throughout and wouldn't get lost. I would recommend that anyone who is thinking about watching it should definitely watch it. Wooo, what a film! I am absolutely astounded, i am lost for words by how good it actually is. I am definitely buying it when it comes out on DVD.
