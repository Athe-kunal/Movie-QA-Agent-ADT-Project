2 July 2017,The Kaiser in exile in Holland,"The Exception (2016) was directed by David Leveaux. The movie was produced in Belgium, but the dialog is in English.

The film is not meant to be a documentary, so we can't take it at face value. However, the basic outline of the story is true. Kaiser Wilhelm II was forced to relinquish his throne after World War I. He spent his remaining years at a secluded mansion in Holland. When Holland was invaded and conquered by the Germans, Wilhelm came under the direct authority of Germany.

In the movie, a previously wounded German army captain (Stefan Brandt, portrayed by Jai Courtney) is sent to be the commanding officer of the Kaiser's guard. Brandt is a loyal officer, but he is disgusted by the SS atrocities. He falls in love with one of the maids, Mieke de Jong, portrayed by the beautiful Lily James. She is Jewish, but Brandt isn't anti-Semitic, so he pursues his romance with Mieke.

Historically, Heinrich Himmler, the Reichsführer of the SS, did, indeed, visit the Kaiser in Holland. That visit is the lynchpin to the plot. (If the visit had been invented for plot purposes, we wouldn't believe it. However, Himmler really did visit.)

The key role in the film is that of Kaiser Wilhelm II, played brilliantly by Christopher Plummer. Plummer is a consummate actor, and he makes the role come alive.

I think that the manner in which the Kaiser is portrayed takes the movie the furthest away from historical reality. In the film he's shown as a more-or-less kindly old man who loves to feed his ducks. According to Wikipedia, he remained a harsh, haughty aristocrat. However, the movie will only work if we believe that the Kaiser also has a softer side, so that's what we see.

I want to alert IMDb readers to watch for the work of Janet McTeer, who portrays the Kaiser's wife, Princess Hermine. She has no great love for the Nazis, but she is willing to go to any lengths to see that her husband returns to Germany and is restored to his monarchy. She is a German Lady Macbeth--cold, calculating, and decisive.

We saw this film at the wonderful Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It will work well on the small screen. The movie carries an anemic 6.8 IMDb rating. It's much, much better than that. The plot is interesting, the acting is outstanding, and the direction is excellent. Don't be fooled by the low rating--this is a movie that I highly recommend.",10
7 July 2017,Christopher Plummer,"This is the main reason to see this picture, an old-timer at the top of his game at the ripe old age of 87. Acting skill and impeccable timing still at its best as he enters the character of Kaiser Wilhelm hoping to make a comeback as the ruler of his beloved homeland. He gets scant help from the two principals, Lily James and Jai Courtney, and you find yourself waiting for Plummer's next appearance.

The story which has been recounted in other reviews is good and is basically a love story between James and Courtney. There is little action in this character study, but mention must be made of Eddie Marsan, who gives a hypnotic and creepy performance as Heinrich Himmler, Hitler's Gestapo Chief. His portrayal is chilling and repulsive and he is an arresting presence on screen (no pun intended). ""The Exception"" is interesting and absorbing - especially when Plummer is front and center.

6 May 2020,Christopher Plummer Is One Extraordinary Actor,"Christopher Plummer is in his old age one of the finest actors the silver screen has ever known. Here he play Kaiser Wilhelm, German emperor in exile in Holland at the onset of World War II. As the suspenseful plot unfolds, his performance draws us into the plight of Germans, including the Kaiser's wife, who began to recognize the evil intentions of the Nazi regime. Reviewers need to remember that this is a movie, the characters are invented, but the point of view is clear and beats the ridiculous premise of films like Inglorious Basterds. Yes folks there were thousands of people who resisted, Germans among them.

28 June 2017,Spy drama comes to life in the second half,"As ""The Exception"" (2016 release from the UK and Belgium) opens, we are told it is ""Berlin, May 1940"" (the Nazis have just invaded Belgium, Holland and France). For reasons not yet clear, the Nazis decide to send Captain Brandt to Utrecht, the Netherlands to guard the exiled Kaiser Willem II. As Brandt settles in, he starts a passionate affair with Mieke, one of the local maids working for Willem II, and she reveals to him she is Jewish. Along the way, we also start to know the thinking of Willem II and his wife, who both still are hoping for a return to the throne. Then the news comes that the Nazis have intercepted morse code transmissions made from the nearby village that an English spy is trying to infiltrate Willem II's entourage. At this point we are 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the feature-length debut of British director David Leveaux (best known for directing theater plays). Here he brings the book ""The Kaiser's last kiss"" to the big screen. I have not read the book so I don't know how closely the film's script stays to the book. Given that this is a spy-related drama, one mustn't say too much that could give clues about how it all plays out (biting my tongue!). Let me just comment in general that the movie drags a bit (for me, anyway) in the first half, but really comes to life in the second half. Christopher Plummer continues his recent streak of great performances (check out last year's ""Remember"" if you haven't seen it yet!) in his role as Willem II, and Jai Courtney is fine as Capt. Brandt. But for me the movie was stolen, in the best possible way, by up-and-coming (and stunningly beautiful) British actress Lily James in her role as the local maid Mieke. Surely we have not seen the last of her. Bottom line: this is a fine movie, bringing a mix of spy drama and romance.

""The Exception"" has been available on VOD since early June, so imagine my surprise when this recently showed up at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at was attended quite nicely (about 10 people in the theater). If you are in the mood for an ol' fashioned spy-romance movie, you could do a lot worse than watching ""The Exception"", be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",7

21 June 2017,A pleasant surprise,"This film tells the story of an army official in Nazi Germany, who is responsible for finding out the spy in the Dutch royal residence. He develops a romance with the Jewish maid, and he is forced to choose side.

I normally do not have high expectations for films I have not heard of, therefore I was pleasantly surprised by ""The Exception"". The plot is engaging, as it makes viewers care for both the German soldier and the Jewish maid. The production is good, and the sets are convincing. Jai Courtney is charming as the army officer, and I think he attracts adoration, sympathy and respect for his character.

6 May 2019,"It was 1940, a German Nazi officer falls for a young Jew.","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. It is beautifully shot and acted.

It helps to know a bit of the actual history, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany abdicated and exiled himself to Holland after Germany was defeated in 1918. Having lived quietly there for about 20 years he is sent a military presence to find if there is a british spy in his midst. Also it may be that some Germans may want to assassinate the Kaiser. This story here, a fictional one based on a novel, takes place mostly in 1940, during the last year of the Kaiser's life.

Jai Courtney is Nazi Capt. Brandt, selected to head up the military protection. When he is given his assignment he was told, ""If anything happens to the Kaiser you will be shot, and I will shoot you.""

Christopher Plummer shows us why he has been so successful all these years, as he plays Kaiser Wilhelm II with appropriate charisma and devilish charm. One of his newer service staff is Lily James as Mieke de Jong. We see all of her at 13:26 into the DVD when in her first encounter with Brandt he says ""Take off all your clothes"" and she does without question or complaint.

This is a well made movie of an interesting story set against the backdrop of real events of 1940. A story of forbidden love and the need to betray one's loyalties to do what is right. Can they find each other after the war? The inscription in a book she sends him may provide the clue.",

22 June 2017,"Delightful war fluff, well acted!","I'm giving this an ""8"" simply for the fine acting and commanding presence of Christopher Plummer (I keep wanting to say ""Sir Christopher Plummer"") as the aged but sprightly and opinionated Kaiser Wilhelm II. I'm torn between calling this the most enjoyable silly film, or the silliest enjoyable film, I've seen in a while, but I found it captivating, even though it's almost certainly sheer fiction regarding any historical accuracy. Although I relished the early and frequent appearance of nudity and rampant sex, what I really wanted more of was extra screen time for the Kaiser's extensive wardrobe of military and imperial uniforms. Notable acting props also to Janet McTeer as the Kaiser's consort, and to Eddie Marsan as a glum, coldly business-like Heinrich Himmler.

25 February 2022,The Kaiser in Holland,"Not many people realise The Kaiser outlived Neville Chamberlain. Barry Foster (of all people!) gave a towering performance as him in the TV series 'Fall of Eagles', which ended the day he arrived at his new home in Holland; where the old boy apparently mellowed considerably (in 1937 he actually wrote to Herbert Wilcox to tell him how much he'd enjoyed his recent film about his grandmother).

This fanciful postscript set in 1940 provides the pleasure of seeing Christopher Plummer as the Kaiser in old age, sporting a white beard that makes him look like Don Quixote and portrayed as jolly but indiscreet and with a hair-trigger temper.

According to this account a toad-like Himmler played by Eddie Marsan paid a personal visit to Hoorn after the fall of Holland; at which point it becomes more and more unbelievable by the minute.

26 June 2017,Extraordinary Christopher,"The film is a typical euro meager budget co-production with a nice little plot and the substance of an eclair, but the delight here is viewing Christopher Plummer showcasing his pure love of acting. He has reached legendary dimensions in his ability and he joyously devours each part he gets these days regardless of the material. He has become in many ways someone he played: John Barrymore. Same love of tricks and hypnotic magnetism. But what a joy to behold. If you want a master class in the study of a near 90 year old acting magician see this!

16 July 2017,An underrated movie with great acting.,"This is a movie and in my humble opinion is totally underrated. Yes, there are a few flaws but don't most movies have them? The story starts off slow but soon picks up and keeps you interested to the final credits. Christopher Plummer as usual plays the part to perfection. As do most of the characters in the movie. I really enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it.

19 August 2017,"If You Enjoy WWII Movies, You'll Definitely Enjoy This!","Much like most of the people who will watch this movie, it caught my eye simply because of my obsession with films based around the war, and this time in history.

This film is not very historically accurate, so if that is important to you, you better stay away. HOWEVER if you do don't much care for historical accuracy, and you are looking for a Nazi War Film with superb acting, then this is DEFINITELY the film for you!

The Acting, wardrobe, and cinematography were all excellent in this movie!

(7/10) - The only reason i am giving this movie a 7/10 is because this movie is somewhat predicable, as is the case for most ""Romantic Movies"", but it is still an amazing story that i would recommend anyone to watch!

24 September 2017,A rollicking good yarn,"The Exception works a good premise into a rollicking spy-romance that, once it hits its stride, delivers on both the suspense and the action. In that sense, it's an old-fashioned movie - one that hooks you in, stays just a step ahead and doesn't out-stay its welcome. Christopher Plummer gives a bravura performance as the former Kaiser. Janet McTeer is typically excellent as his wife. And the two young leads are attractive, in and out of their clothes, if no threat to Streep and DeNiro. Okay, so the story doesn't entirely accord with historical fact. Yes, Wilhelm never quite gave up on a restoration of the monarchy. Yes, Hermine actively petitioned the Nazi's on his behalf. But that's about where it ends. In truth, Wilhelm was as much an anti-semite as the Nazis. And the Nazis thought him an old fool, not worth bothering with. Still, it's worth the suspension of disbelief for the duration of the movie.

13 June 2018,More of a wartime drama than a war film,"A thoroughly enjoyable semi-historical drama. Although set in Holland in 1940, you can't really call it a war film, since there is no combat shown. More of a wartime drama. Excellent acting, photography, and unobtrusive direction. The only cast members I recognized were Christopher Plummer as the Kaiser, and Janet McTeer as his wife. Excellent performances also turned in by Jai Courtney, Ben Daniels, Eddie Marsan as a creepy Reichsfuhrer Himmler, and the lovely Lily James as Mieke de Jong. Plummer's Wilhelm II was a joy to watch, even if he wasn't accurately portraying the Kaiser's personality. For those who are annoyed by German characters played by actors with English accents, well, maybe it would have been better in German and Dutch, and only subtitled in English. There are compromises in making films for, hopefully, a mass audience. Anyway, I recommend this movie

6 October 2018,The Exception - Just Misses,"What might have been a reasonable plot tends to be reduced to a somewhat implausible outcome. Several challenging situations are set up, then all solved in equally farfetched proportions - too often stretching the believability factor towards being laughable. Sex scenes are set up too quickly and with crude gratuitousness - leaving no time to develop into any form of believable relationships. There are good looking costumes and sets- but ultimately, it shows up as superficial gloss - without enough substance to sustain its length. Performances are OK, photography is slick, music score is good, just a pity about certain elements of the script.

24 August 2019,Plummer steals the show,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, the story, photography etc. Once more, I realised what a magnificent actor Christopher Plummer is. This time, however, he had the power to move me to tears. I am not sure whether Kaiser Wilhelm had the same sense of humour and, on the whole, was the same sympathetic character Plummer impersonated. In any case, a magisterial and touching performance.

5 August 2018,Not exceptional,"Don't be fooled into believing this story, it is entirely fictional! Yes, Kaiser Wilhelm II was exiled in Holland but the Mieke and Stefan affair never took place and indeed these characters did not exist and there was no spy!

For a minute I thought that I missed this part in history as I knew nothing about it, but right at the end of the film it confirms that it is a work of fiction.

With that out of the way, it is an interesting movie but not exceptional. Had the producers indicated at the beginning of the movie that it is a work of fiction, I would have enjoyed it much more.

25 June 2018,Some tense moments but...,"The Exception (2016) was directed by David Leveaux. The movie was produced in Belgium, but the dialog is in English.

The film is not meant to be a documentary, so we can't take it at face value. However, the basic outline of the story is true. Kaiser Wilhelm II was forced to relinquish his throne after World War I. He spent his remaining years at a secluded mansion in Holland. When Holland was invaded and conquered by the Germans, Wilhelm came under the direct authority of Germany.

In the movie, a previously wounded German army captain (Stefan Brandt, portrayed by Jai Courtney) is sent to be the commanding officer of the Kaiser's guard. Brandt is a loyal officer, but he is disgusted by the SS atrocities. He falls in love with one of the maids, Mieke de Jong, portrayed by the beautiful Lily James. She is Jewish, but Brandt isn't anti-Semitic, so he pursues his romance with Mieke.

Historically, Heinrich Himmler, the Reichsführer of the SS, did, indeed, visit the Kaiser in Holland. That visit is the lynchpin to the plot. (If the visit had been invented for plot purposes, we wouldn't believe it. However, Himmler really did visit.)

The key role in the film is that of Kaiser Wilhelm II, played brilliantly by Christopher Plummer. Plummer is a consummate actor, and he makes the role come alive.

I think that the manner in which the Kaiser is portrayed takes the movie the furthest away from historical reality. In the film he's shown as a more-or-less kindly old man who loves to feed his ducks. According to Wikipedia, he remained a harsh, haughty aristocrat. However, the movie will only work if we believe that the Kaiser also has a softer side, so that's what we see.

I want to alert IMDb readers to watch for the work of Janet McTeer, who portrays the Kaiser's wife, Princess Hermine. She has no great love for the Nazis, but she is willing to go to any lengths to see that her husband returns to Germany and is restored to his monarchy. She is a German Lady Macbeth--cold, calculating, and decisive.

We saw this film at the wonderful Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It will work well on the small screen. The movie carries an anemic 6.8 IMDb rating. It's much, much better than that. The plot is interesting, the acting is outstanding, and the direction is excellent. Don't be fooled by the low rating--this is a movie that I highly recommend.",6
28 November 2018,Cool Kaiser,"""The Exception"" is a little like ""Allied"" inasmuch as it's a romantic WW2 drama made 70 years after the war. Like ""Allied"" it captures a little of the flavour of Casablanca, a romance set against momentous events. Although Ingrid and Bogie didn't burn up the bedroom quite like Jai Courtney and Lily James do in this film.

When German officer Captain Stefan Brandt (Jai Courtney) is sent to guard the exiled Kaiser Wilhelm II (Christopher Plummer) at his country estate in Holland, he is ordered by the Gestapo to investigate if a British spy has infiltrated the home. Despite being warned not to have intimate relations with the female staff, he throws caution and uniform aside to engage in a hot affair with a young Dutch woman, Mieke de Jong (Lily James), who also happens to be Jewish. When a creepy Heinrich Himmler (Eddie Marsan) turns up, things come to a head.

In a story where the hero is a German soldier who has been wounded invading Poland, you have to sort out his Nazi credentials early and still keep things believable. Captain Brand obviously doesn't like the Gestapo but he is not a committed anti Nazi - at the beginning anyway.

However there is a decided distaste for the Nazis in the air especially from the Kaiser himself. He tells how he didn't approve of Hermann Goering when the plus-sized Nazi chief turned up to dinner wearing the wrong duds.

Christopher Plummer makes a cuddly Kaiser, but it's a show-stopping performance. Ripped Aussie actor Jai Courtney creates an officer who has seen a bit too much of the war and it's only 1940. Lily James, one of the current crop of beautiful, polished British stars that every generation produces, is a captivating Mieke.

Eddie Marsan makes an evil Himmler. He projects a man who rules by terror rather than charisma. The tension ramps up whenever he's around. It's a pity his visit is so brief.

""The Exception"" gets more far-fetched as it goes along, but intense performances, great locations and a suitably romantic and dramatic score from Ilan Eshkeri make ""The Exception"" exceptional.",8
20 May 2017,A semi-fictional account of the last days of Kaiser Wilhelm II,"Though this movie is not based entirely on factual events much of this movie is based on true historical data on the last days of German Emperor Kaiser Wilhelm II. The house in Doorn, Holland is accurate as is other historical events such as the Nazi troops stationed at his manor.

For students of World War I or German history this movie is a must see.

Unlike Hitler, the Kaiser did have morals and religious views that he held until his death despite being largely responsible for unleashing WWI.

28 December 2018,The Exception,"German army captain (Courtney) is assigned to protect the Old Kaiser (Plummer) during WWII where he falls in love with maid (James). Matters are complicated as a spy is believed to have infiltrated the inner sanctum plus Himmler is due for a visit which sends tension running even higher.

Good solid performances all around, particularly from James and of course uvuncular Plummer who tends to steal most scenes he's in. Whilst the romance doesn't quite jel it remains a compelling story which is often quite tense in the will they, won't they get found out, will the spy get to the Kaiser way.

Worth catching - don't be put off by the naff title

4 February 2018,A look at the German Royal family during the WWII.,"A book based film, partially inspired by the real, but I really loved. In the backdrop of the world war two, it focused on the German royal family, Kaiser. An officer sent to protect him during the nazi Germany's invasion of Europe, possibly from the spies. So during his stint, all events that unfolded were revealed to us with a twist at the end. The twist was predictable, so they did not hide it for the perfect moment and to make the film entirely rely on it. What's important is it was more a straightforward narration. Though there were some tense moments.

Overall a great drama. I did not know what to expect, whether a thriller or romance, but it mixed them all together nicely. Of course, Jai was good, and so Lily James, but I was very impressed by Christopher Plummer. This film was awesome because of this 88 year old Canadian actor. Directed by a newcomer, and he did his part nicely. One of the fine addition to the world war two related dramas. It has a strong sex scene, otherwise would have been fit for all. Definitely I suggest it if you're interested!

14 April 2022,An attractive and decent film that was actually shot at the mansion of the exiled Kaiser masterfully played by Christopher Plummer,"It is 1940 , Germany has just invaded invaded Holland . A German Wehrmacht officer named Stefan : Jaime Courtney attempts to determine if the Dutch resistance has planted a spy to infiltrate the home of Kaiser Wilhelm II : Christopher Plummer in Holland during the onset of WWII . Things go wrong when an imminent arrival takes place , ReichsFuhrer Heinrich Himmler : Eddie Marsan . The he falls for the housemaid : Lily James . One duty . One desire . One decision . It takes just one to change . The code of war .

Nice film , partially based on actual events , set in Holland when Hitler Army invaded Holland and Belgium , as in a Holland lived exiled Kaiser Willian II who was expelled after WWI . This is an interesting film containing suspense, thrills , intrigue , plot twists and an exciting final . Handsome duo of protagonists are pretty well , Jai Courtney as upright and honest officer and Lily James as the stubborn and brave servant . Special mention for Christopher Plummer who steals the show as as the proud ex-emperor of Germany . Along with other nice secondaries , such as : Janet McTeer as Princess Hermine , Ben Daniels , Mark Dexter and Eddie Marsan as the extremely villain character Heinrich Himmler .

It displays a colorful and evocative cinematography by Roman Osin. Equally , a thrilling and moving musical score by Ilan Eshkeri .The motion picture was well directed by David Levaux at his film debut . He's been nominated to Broadway's Tony Award several times: as Best Director for a revival of Eugene O'Neill's A moon for the Misbegotten , in 1993 for a revival of Eugene O'Neall's Anna Christie in 2000 for a revival of Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing and in 2004 for a revival of Nine The Musical .And Levaux has also put on stage other plays and Musicals : in 2017 Rosencranz and Guildenstein are dead and 2018 JesusChrist Superstar . Rating : 7/10 . Better than average .",7
18 October 2018,Pleasantly Surprised,"This German Axis/Allies love story is above and beyond better than Suite Francaise (2014) where Matthias Schoenaerts was such a bore in that movie. The Exception is in league with the heartbreaking Le Silence de la Mer (2004).

When I found out that Jai Courtney was cast as Brandt I was so against it since I found Jai bland/miscast in his previous films, excluding Suicide Squad where his Captain Boomerang's entertaining in that. But Jai won me over with his Captain Brandt and he shares a nice chemistry with Lily James. I loved their eventual love story. Plummer and McTeer were good in this too and shared a nice/sweet moment towards the end that had me teary-eyed.

Overall I enjoyed this movie; it had me glued in from the 2nd act until the end.

19 December 2018,Not an Exception...,"But it's Ok

Plot is a bit far fetched, but it kept my attention span for the duration of the film.

Thought Lily James was good, and better than Courtney. But star turn for me despite little screen time was Eddie Marsan who was very convincing as Himmler

21 November 2021,The Kaiser's final choice,"The presentation given here of the Kaiser's exile in Holland during his last years with his wife is perfectly compatible with Bruce Lockhart's documentary account of his impressions of the Kaiser in his latter days. Although the film is slightly sugared in depicting the romance of the investigating security officer with the Jewish maid in the Kaiser's home, it is also very realistic and straightforward in showing the Kaiser's weaknesses and less sympathetic sides, like his bad temper and rampant bitterness, which all adds up to a very convincing almost documentary of the Kaiser in his last days. Lily James also makes great performance as the maid treading carefully on a razor's edge of political difficulties and just resentment, while the most shocking realism is the over-convincing portrait of Himmler. Jai Courtney makes the best of it adapting to ever changing circumstances demanding constant shifts in his strategy, and also Ben Daniels as the Kaiser's adjutant makes an impression in his honesty. In brief, this is a great drama and film about the end of the Kaiser and his last hopes, while also the music by Ilan Eshkeri is adorable. It's a film about shadow play excepted from the war but of maximum human interest.",10
14 April 2022,an undeserved rehabilitation,"'The Exception', the 2016 late debut and by now the only feature film ever made by theater director David Leveaux, is based on a novel written by Alan Judd, whose hero is Wilhelm II, the dethroned kaiser of Germany, in the last years of his life. Historical novels and films inspired by them have no formal obligation to strictly observe the historical truth, especially since truth itself is often foggy or relative. In the case of this film, whose action takes place in 1940, the second year of World War II and the year in which Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands where Wilhelm II had taken refuge for over two decades, the relation with the historical truth has its importance. This film that combines an intrigue of war and espionage, a romantic-erotic story and a historical docu-drama rehabilitates - intentionally or not - a historical figure who had a huge responsibility in the outbreak of World War I and persisted in ultra-conservative conceptions, revanchism and anti-Semitism until the end of his life. Cinematic it's not a masterpiece but a rather catchy movie, well filmed and played, enjoyable to watch. It's historical approach, however, I think, would be worthwhile to be accompanied by a disclaimer.

The main hero is a German officer who is entrusted with the task of guarding (in fact also supervising) the exiled Kaiser, after the invasion of the Netherlands by the German armies. The old man lives a comfortable life in a castle, together with his wife and a small group of servants, plus an aide-de-camp officer who informs him about the course of the war and political developments in Europe. Disconnected from reality and ignoring the suffering the people had gone through after the disaster for which he was responsible, a return to Nazi Germany and even a return to the throne are possible in his mind. His fantasies are encouraged by a surprise visit from Heinrich Himmler. Wilhelm II's eccentric personality is targeted and monitored not only by the Nazis but also by English intelligence agents. The most memorable scene in the film depicts a dinner in which the former emperor discusses politics with the Nazi leader. Himmler shocks his interlocutors with the cynicism with which he describes the 'ineffectiveness' of the methods of exterminating those considered 'inferior', but the Kaiser does not seem to realize that the source of the Nazi regime's criminal violence lies precisely in his own imperialist ambitions and openly expressed contempt for Jews and other 'enemies' of Germany.

Some of the actors' performances are remarkable. I was not a fan of Christopher Plummer in his heyday, but he was one of those actors whose prestige and charisma grew and improved over time. In this role, one of his last on the big screens, he is gorgeous. I could only reproach him for humanizing the emperor's character too much, giving him a nobility that the real historical character probably lacked. The character who gives the title to the film, the German officer who is the 'exception' in relation to those around him, in whose soul awakens the conscience that separates evil from good, is played by Jai Courtney, an actor who in my opinion fails to enter the depth of the character of the one he interprets. The romantic relationship with the Dutch housemaid, who turns out to be much more than just a housemaid, is credible only on an erotic level, despite the efforts of the beautiful and talented actress Lily James, because of too many contradictory biographical details. Instead, I enjoyed the appearance of Eddie Marsan, the actor who creates an unforgettable Himmler, who combines sarcasm with repulsion, a corrupt, demented, rational in crime character, ridiculous and terrifying at the same time. The cinematography by Roman Osin manages to locate the story in context, to authentically reproduce the historical period and to place the characters in it. 'The Exception' combines a romantic and an espionage story set during World War II, giving plenty of reasons to watch, it is a film inspired by history and its characters even if it is not exactly true to them.",6

29 March 2020,A tepid romance,"I tried to like this movie, really did, but I just couldn't do it. The history is all wrong, the romance is tepid, & the conclusion is rushed & unrealistic. Many other reviewers have also commented on the historical inaccuracies and I totally agree with them. My biggest problem was that I didn't believe in the love story. Also, for the purpose of romanticization, the basic nature of the Kaiser was altered. So, we got an eccentric yet good-natured grandfatherly figure who takes a deep interest in the protagonists' love story. Why should a deposed king, whose every wish was to get his throne back, care about a romance between two people who were both his enemies in a way? I realize that liberties need to be taken to move the story along & to make the whole situation seem prettier to the audiences. But, in that case, why not call the characters fictitious & then play around as much as you like? The saving grace of the movie is the spectacular performances by the cast. Plummer, McTeer & Daniels are phenomenal. The cinematography is good too.

Even the little bit of sex and violence in this film was gratuitous, though the film takes place during WWII. Were all Wehrmacht officers rapists? I'm no expert, but I don't think so.

20 June 2017,Another fairy tale for children,"This movie is an absolute trash. It's like a hammock, having more holes than ropes. The creators of that drivel definitely think that the moviegoers are illiterates about the past, so they will swallow all the absurdities of this ""historic"" fake. Any script writer is allowed to add invented details to a historic event. However, those details should be at least authentic and logical, but in The Exception they are opposite of that. The Exception may be a good romantic comedy. But it is not, because it has absolutely no humor, like the Inglourious Basterds,for instance. Anyway, the brilliant performance of Christopher Plummer as Kaiser Wilhelm somehow saves the movie. Plummer is the only actor in the entire movie who behaves like a real historic figure would behave. Jay Courtney is laughable as a Nazi officer. He's authentic only in the sex scenes when he doesn't wear the uniform. Eddie Marsan is even more laughable as Himmler. Apparently the creators of this movie cared only about the box office, and they knew that youngsters will be their major clients. So why to bother about details? The Exception is a kind of movie that you forget next day after watching it.",3
7 August 2022,Not a Rom Com,"The Exception is a fictional story but based on historical times surrounding the abdicated German emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm II, the last monarch of the country. In this movie, Nazi Captain Stefan Brandt played by Jai Courtney is assigned to protect the Kaiser from a spy implanted in the Manor in the Netherlands. The Captain ends up falling in love with one of the servants who is a Jewish Dutch played by the beautiful Lily James. The late great Christopher Plummer acted as the Kaiser, he was just as brilliant as ever. The film was very well scripted with a great cast and with a love story. I would highly recommend this film.

This is historical fiction, so the Kaiser didn't come off as historically nasty as he was, but he was no Cap Von Trapp 🙂 this is no Sound of Music!

Sr actor Christopher Plummer who plays kaiser the II gives a heartwarming performance and brings in some light moments. all supporting actors did great job. the background music was also very good. do watch this film...Its R rated so not for kids. Rating- 4/5

6 October 2019,My kind of War movie.,"The Exception (2016) was directed by David Leveaux. The movie was produced in Belgium, but the dialog is in English.

The film is not meant to be a documentary, so we can't take it at face value. However, the basic outline of the story is true. Kaiser Wilhelm II was forced to relinquish his throne after World War I. He spent his remaining years at a secluded mansion in Holland. When Holland was invaded and conquered by the Germans, Wilhelm came under the direct authority of Germany.

In the movie, a previously wounded German army captain (Stefan Brandt, portrayed by Jai Courtney) is sent to be the commanding officer of the Kaiser's guard. Brandt is a loyal officer, but he is disgusted by the SS atrocities. He falls in love with one of the maids, Mieke de Jong, portrayed by the beautiful Lily James. She is Jewish, but Brandt isn't anti-Semitic, so he pursues his romance with Mieke.

Historically, Heinrich Himmler, the Reichsführer of the SS, did, indeed, visit the Kaiser in Holland. That visit is the lynchpin to the plot. (If the visit had been invented for plot purposes, we wouldn't believe it. However, Himmler really did visit.)

The key role in the film is that of Kaiser Wilhelm II, played brilliantly by Christopher Plummer. Plummer is a consummate actor, and he makes the role come alive.

I think that the manner in which the Kaiser is portrayed takes the movie the furthest away from historical reality. In the film he's shown as a more-or-less kindly old man who loves to feed his ducks. According to Wikipedia, he remained a harsh, haughty aristocrat. However, the movie will only work if we believe that the Kaiser also has a softer side, so that's what we see.

I want to alert IMDb readers to watch for the work of Janet McTeer, who portrays the Kaiser's wife, Princess Hermine. She has no great love for the Nazis, but she is willing to go to any lengths to see that her husband returns to Germany and is restored to his monarchy. She is a German Lady Macbeth--cold, calculating, and decisive.

We saw this film at the wonderful Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It will work well on the small screen. The movie carries an anemic 6.8 IMDb rating. It's much, much better than that. The plot is interesting, the acting is outstanding, and the direction is excellent. Don't be fooled by the low rating--this is a movie that I highly recommend.",8
2 April 2021,Give us a break.,"Movies are fundamentally made to entertain the watching audience, so why do the know it all reviewers insist on TOTAL accuracy of everything?

If somebody gets shot they haven't actually been shot, a sex scene is simulated they are not actually having sex, and on and on. A particular scene might have many takes to get what the actors and director want to show in the movie as part of the entertainment.

That's exactly what we get here and in 99.9% of most movies, and it's entertaining and well done and can be recommended, of course you will get the over the top reviewers pointing out that the tyres used on one of the vehicles wasn't introduced into production until much later than the time scale of the movie, so what?

It is not a ducumentary to be taken as historically accurate on every minute of the the movie. It is a piece of entertainment based around an historically actual event. Watch and enjoy and don't bother with the tyres.",8
24 April 2019,Enjoyable war drama,"Whilst it's not the best I've seen it was thoroughly enjoyable throughout and highlights the depth Christopher Plummer has to offer with an exceptional performance. If you like war dramas rather than war actions you'll almost certainly enjoy this film to some extent.

5 May 2019,Engaging story with a satisfying outcome,"How nice to watch a war movie and get a warm feeling! Those German army uniforms are dead sexy, let's face it, and it's nice to be able to admire them on a ""good"" German. And he looks equally good with his uniform off! The heroine also shucks her servant's uniform to good effect. Everyone acts well with characters being well delineated. Provided you can suspend your disbelief about probabilities, the story is engaging with fiction and historical fact deftly combined. The settings are attractive and the whole thing well done, on a limited budget it appears, which is a lesson on how to get a first class result with no over-the-top special effects. I recommend it to other viewers and my opinion is that the average rating is lower than it deserves.

29 July 2023,Mostly fiction but well made.,"Before you watch this movie, it's important to know that it's NOT meant as a true story but was based on a novel written by Alan Judd in 2003. In other words, it's NOT true...and you shouldn't assume the story is based on facts. While it IS true that ex-Kaiser Wilhelm II was in exile in Holland in 1940 when the film begins AND he had hopes that the Nazis would restore him to power, the rest is from the mind of Judd. In particular, the film shows Wilhelm as a decent guy who, when push comes to shove, isn't an antisemite.which he WAS in real life. He never would have acted in real life the way he did in the latter portion of this story.

Despite the story being placed at the ex-Kaiser's Dutch residence, the story mostly involves a maid working there who is a Jew as well as member of the Underground as well as a German Captain stationed there to guard Wilhelm. The pair become lovers and soon all sorts of intrigue begins.

The story looks good and the acting is very nice. The fictional story is also very engaging and interesting. However, there is a LOT of nudity...and rather graphic nudity. I think it actually was not a good thing, as it seemed to distract from the plot at times. Additionally, as an ex-history teacher I naturally didn't love the way the film toyed with the facts. Still, it is worth seeing...particularly is you love historical films.",7
25 October 2017,"Totally underrated--touching, gripping, and perfect acting ensemble!!","I watched this film on Amazon Prime, and it's a total surprise. The acting of all main and every supporting actors are nothing short of perfection, especially, of course Christopher Plummer, his role as Kaiser Wilhelm II in this film is my favorite of all of his performances. It is a beautiful romantic story that is also gripping and kept me at the edge of my seat from beginning to end. What a great job for the first time director. This does what a good movie does, lures you into the story and don't want it to end.

28 September 2020,Historical revisionism,"""The Exception"" is a WWII-era romantic and political drama with a cast full of talented, great-looking actors and a lush setting on an elegant estate in the Dutch countryside. The story, however, is out of touch with reality. I could have bought the idea that the two young leads would have fallen in love or at least in lust, because one, odd pairings happen all the time, especially in wartime, and two, they're both extremely good-looking (and eager to disrobe). The way the film shows the two characters' relationship unfolding made absolutely no sense and ruined any romantic tension that could have been portrayed by these two appealing performers. But the character of Kaiser Wilhelm II, played very elegantly by the wonderful Christopher Plummer, seems far nicer than the man was in real life, and far, far more sympathetic to and concerned with the well-being of lowly servants or minor military officers. I just didn't buy that at all. It seemed too far out of character for an exiled royal of the very old school, a grandson of Queen Victoria, to have had much interest in the common folks' pursuit of happiness.

My issues with ""The Exception"" lie with the script. As one might surmise from its title, ""The Exception"" is focused on Stefan, the lead character, portraying him as a German military officer who was horrified by the mass exterminations he witnessed in Poland after the '39 invasion. He's meant to be exceptionally humane for his profession and time period, almost evoking a 21st-century-style woke/anti-racist attitude. I could buy the idea of an ordinary German Wehrmacht officer who is a nice guy at heart, and not an anti-Semite or a racist, and someone who just wants to do his job, fall in love, and get along with everyone. Clearly, when Mieke, played by Lily James, stresses that Stefan is the ""exception"" while hateful, monstrous behavior is ""the rule,"" the audience hears the loud, insistent message of the movie. But it felt a little forced to me, maybe historical revisionism, which seems all too common in period films made today. Wishful thinking, perhaps? I prefer a 2006 Dutch film with similar themes called ""Black Book"" starring Carice van Houten.",5

8 September 2020,awful,"In the very beginning of the film, there is a scene between the Brandt character and Mieke character that made me nauseous. I will leave it at that, because I am trying to keep out any spoilers, but it set a tone that made the remainder of the movie kind of a dark ridiculous. So much of the essence of the movie depended on a trusting, caring relationship between Brandt and Mieke. After that first awful scene, there was no way that I could be convinced of such a relationship.

The only reason I gave any stars is that I did learn a bit more about the nineteenth and twentieth century German aristocracy. Other than that, I am shocked that so many big names were a part of such an awful show.

28 September 2017,Plodding WWII drama with varying quality of performances,"Since World War Two was still being fought there have been a plethora of films about the subject, covering almost every side of every angle. Thus to justify another in 2017 the bar must be set high, and while The Exception might be a reasonable way to while away a Sunday afternoon it's debatable as to whether it does enough to justify its existence.

Based on the novel The Kaiser's Last Kiss, The Exception focuses on disgraced Untersturmführer Martin Krebbs (Jai Courtney), being sent from the front lines after a confrontation with fellow SS officers in Poland. He is ordered to guard the exiled former Kaiser of Germany (Christopher Plummer), who now resides in the Netherlands. As Krebbs begins a relationship with a maid at the Kaiser's home (Lily James) there is talk of a British spy in the town, as well as German plans to restore the Kaiser to the throne.

I'm unsure of the film title, as The Kaiser's Last Kiss feels much more evocative. This relates to my overall problems with the film, as it was often hard to feel sufficiently invested in proceedings. The lack of explosive confrontation and finality relating to the Kaiser himself doesn't justify a meandering build-up. Krebbs and the maid feels more like a tryst of convenience, not the explosive passion that would justify their increasingly erratic actions.

This relationship of the officer and the servant girl is as old as time, and reminded me strongly of the 2014 film Suite Française. Coupled with a standard aloof Gestapo agent and the hunt for a spy the whole drama was often formulaic.

This is a British cast playing German or Dutch characters, yet some actors have tried on clipped Queen's English, or Allo Allo attempts at German accents, or English with a Dutch lilt. It's so uneven as to be at times hilarious.

Accents aside, the performances are a mixed bag. Jai Courtney brings his thumping ordinariness to the British prestige picture, and it would have been preferable to have had an actor who could really delve into the moral maze that Krebbs has found himself in. Lily James drinks up the screen both clothed or otherwise, and any issues with her performance are more to do with a somewhat underwritten character. 

The film does not shy away from the virulent anti-Semitism that leaves the Nazis so scarred in the Western consciousness. It is an achievement of Plummer to both inspire sympathy as an elderly man the world has passed by, and revulsion as a naive peddler of ugly conspiracy theories. The absolute standout scene of the film features a dinner party with the Kaiser and Himmler (a memorable Eddie Marsan), reminding all of the horrors committed by those who took this nonsense seriously.

The whole thing has a sound production design, though the casting left me no doubt in my mind that for all the swastikas and uniforms this was a peculiarly British film. A German language production could have added a level of legitimacy, and a plot with more twists and turns could have led to a greater investment in the Kaiser's last days.

23 September 2019,Well mounted production of a very predictable tale,"The Exception (2016) was directed by David Leveaux. The movie was produced in Belgium, but the dialog is in English.

The film is not meant to be a documentary, so we can't take it at face value. However, the basic outline of the story is true. Kaiser Wilhelm II was forced to relinquish his throne after World War I. He spent his remaining years at a secluded mansion in Holland. When Holland was invaded and conquered by the Germans, Wilhelm came under the direct authority of Germany.

In the movie, a previously wounded German army captain (Stefan Brandt, portrayed by Jai Courtney) is sent to be the commanding officer of the Kaiser's guard. Brandt is a loyal officer, but he is disgusted by the SS atrocities. He falls in love with one of the maids, Mieke de Jong, portrayed by the beautiful Lily James. She is Jewish, but Brandt isn't anti-Semitic, so he pursues his romance with Mieke.

Historically, Heinrich Himmler, the Reichsführer of the SS, did, indeed, visit the Kaiser in Holland. That visit is the lynchpin to the plot. (If the visit had been invented for plot purposes, we wouldn't believe it. However, Himmler really did visit.)

The key role in the film is that of Kaiser Wilhelm II, played brilliantly by Christopher Plummer. Plummer is a consummate actor, and he makes the role come alive.

I think that the manner in which the Kaiser is portrayed takes the movie the furthest away from historical reality. In the film he's shown as a more-or-less kindly old man who loves to feed his ducks. According to Wikipedia, he remained a harsh, haughty aristocrat. However, the movie will only work if we believe that the Kaiser also has a softer side, so that's what we see.

I want to alert IMDb readers to watch for the work of Janet McTeer, who portrays the Kaiser's wife, Princess Hermine. She has no great love for the Nazis, but she is willing to go to any lengths to see that her husband returns to Germany and is restored to his monarchy. She is a German Lady Macbeth--cold, calculating, and decisive.

We saw this film at the wonderful Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It will work well on the small screen. The movie carries an anemic 6.8 IMDb rating. It's much, much better than that. The plot is interesting, the acting is outstanding, and the direction is excellent. Don't be fooled by the low rating--this is a movie that I highly recommend.",4
23 March 2020,Excellent WWII Drama/Romance,"I wasn't sure about this movie as it started out with a somewhat distasteful first encounter between the lead male and lead female, but as the story unfolded, you get pulled into the drama of all of the characters. The gray area it shows about WWII and Nazis and spies and leaders is well done. By the time the climactic end comes around, you are on the edge of your seat.

11 November 2017,"Great story, bad history","Great story line, casting, acting, directing, cinematography. However for the Kaiser, the part is played as a dapper, charming man who likes to feed ducks, by the superb Christopher Plummer, rather than as the actual narcissistic, bellicose, disruptive monster who was the real Kaiser Wilhelm (if you've read any history at all). The agent is played engagingly, but somewhat unrealistically (esp. the when she naively and unnecessarily volunteers, to an SS officer, the fact that she's Jewish). But all of the characters portrayed are well done. McTeer stands out. As does the actor playing Himmler.

27 September 2023,Can we not sympathise with fascists?,"Yikes. Honestly, yikes. YIKES.

The only good thing to come from this movie is the gifs of Jai Courtney on the internet which incentivised me to watch it in the first place - but with the memory of 'Come & See' still thankfully raw in my mind (providing a fresh & sobering sense of perspective this just naively doesn't seem to possess), what 'The Exception' (somehow, with no self-awareness or even a single shred of intentional irony in the title) fails to realise is there are none.

Truly, it beggars belief for me to even have to state something so plainly obvious to the vast majority (forgive me for optimistically over-estimating the abilities of some to think logically for themselves), yet despite the film's bewilderingly tone deaf attempts to ignorantly romanticise a toxic sham of a relationship formed from deception & an imbalanced power dynamic, that staggeringly misplaced attempt at romanticism does nothing to humanise the literal Nazi at the heart of it. For instance, decency shown towards one individual in private doesn't absolve him of responsibility for playing a part in everything else despicable, during or thereafter (because decency should be ideally shown to everyone, regardless of circumstances & cruelty is cruelty, in & of itself - not something negated by kindness?). Again, I'm aghast such a point needs to be made (or laboured as hard as I feel the need to make it, here) but for clarity, he isn't sympathetic & neither is his Nazism somehow ""more acceptable"" & ""less bad"" if he's portrayed as somewhat less intentionally complicit in the extreme horrors committed by the Third Reich; occasional revulsion in response to brutality & inhumanity does nothing to lessen the crimes committed if he knowingly stands by & lets them happen, which he repeatedly does. Furthermore, keeping Lily James' character's Jewish identity a secret isn't valiant or heroic either for his choices are entirely motivated by selfish reasons; don't mistake his unwillingness to part with the information as the sudden development of a redeemable conscience; no, he bites his tongue, purely because it's beneficial for him to do so & never actually makes any potential sacrifice (endangering his own well-being) in order to demonstrate (through action, not meaningless words) the apparent affection he harbours for her. She's still lesser to him - he simply doesn't care in the moment, due to the fact that acknowledging it at the time (whilst they're in bed) would be inconvenient. Her being oppressed & he remaining as her oppressor is inexorably unchanged.

Basically, this isn't ""love"" (it's a stupid person's idea of love - that comes easy; real love is hard) & you're an idiot for thinking it ever could be. Wake the hell up.",4
12 September 2022,Worth Watching,"A good wartime thriller, although it gets to the tense action rather slowly.

Everything surrounding Christopher Plummer's performance as Kaiser Wilhelm II is absorbing with a chilling performance by Eddie Marsan as Heinrich Himmler.

However, I found the whole relationship between the German Captain and the maid unconvincing, particularly the inception.

This rather spoilt my overall interest in the film.

Based on Alan Judd's 2003 novel The Kaiser's Last Kiss. The film stars Christopher Plummer, Jai Courtney, Lily James, Janet McTeer, and Ben Daniels. The plot is a fictionalized account of the life of exiled Kaiser Wilhelm II (Plummer).

27 October 2018,The keyword is: Christopher Plummer,"Despite that the movie is a bit slow, but the performance of Christopher Plummer is astonishing. All the other actors did their job pretty well as well, but the performance of Christopher Plummer remains exceptional.

The movie in genera is great, a light drama around love and war which I enjoyed watching. It has been a bit slow as mentioned, but the acting, music and script made me enjoy it nonetheless.

16 August 2017,"An intimate, simple movie with a message","What movie mogul said that if you want to send a message, contact Western Union? Regardless, this small-scale movie--while chafing at the bit of plausibility-manages to work owing to the fine cast, laconic dialogue, and beautiful, understated art direction. But back to the ""message."" Without it, this would be a mediocre film, but with it, it is something of a parable. What's the message? I'll let you figure it out. Christopher Plummer is wonderful, and the casting in general is superb--it's evident the director worked on finding complementary and contradictory characters whose roles and personalities are extended by their appearance, stature, and clothing--making it quite apparent that a theater director created this film.

6 August 2023,Extraordinary cinematic masterpiece!,"This gripping historical drama takes you on a thrilling and emotionally charged journey through the complexities of World War II.

The exceptional performances by the cast, especially the lead actors, bring depth and authenticity to their characters, making them truly captivating to watch.

The film's attention to historical detail and the intricacies of the time period adds a layer of realism that immerses you in the story even further. The compelling plot unfolds with unexpected twists and turns, keeping you on the edge of your seat until the very end.

The exceptional cinematography and production design create a visually stunning backdrop for the gripping narrative. The film beautifully balances heart-wrenching moments with moments of hope and resilience, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.

The Exception is an exceptional film that deserves all the accolades it has received and is undoubtedly a must-watch for anyone who appreciates a thought-provoking, intense, and expertly crafted piece of cinema.",8
5 November 2020,Excellent Casting (with one exception) and a really enjoyable story of love in war,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this superbly well-acted WWII story with 'action' that occurred well behind the lines. I was unexpectedly pleased to find that Jai Courtney was convincing as the Wehrmacht Officer assigned to command the bodyguard for exiled, abdicated Kaiser Wilhelm II (played superbly by Christopher Plummer - this has become my favourite of all his many roles because he played it so naturally that one would be forgiven for forgetting that he is not a grandson of Queen Victoria with a withered/damaged left arm). The direction and script writing was excellent in leaving the viewer for perhaps half the film to query the true character of this German Officer from a family of German Officers. The chemistry between Kai Courtney and Lily James (playing a Dutch woman apparently compelled to enter service in wartime to survive, and with a secret she dare not reveal) seems genuine. The story revolves around two threads - Kai Courtney is tasked to keep a watch-out for a Dutch Resistance worker active in the area of the Kaiser's Country House/Castle (perhaps intending to assassinate the Kaiser), and Janet McTeer (again, superbly cast as the former Empress of Germany) believes - so we do too - that the monarchy may yet be reinstated in the new Germany of the Third Reich. Ultimately it seems there is deception from every quarter but Jai Courtney finds himself falling for the servant-girl who reads Neitzsche and questioning where his duty truly lies (and he is unexpectedly helped with this by the Kaiser's Aide-de-Camp, brilliantly underplayed by Ben Daniels). This is not an adventure story, but it is an engaging tale of very different characters adjusting to a very different type of wartime than any had originally expected, some with an hidden agenda and - I have to say it again - brilliantly acted by a superb cast (with one exception, but as that is my personal opinion I shall not share it with you!)",8

3 June 2017,romance between 2 gorgeous people.....,"Personally I don't care if the movie is 'historically accurate' as some people point out. I don't think they advertise it as that. The acting was good. They had chemistry which is most important. Someone also said 'this could never happen' well I think when 2 good looking people that are emotionally damaged anything can happen. Now this point is stupid I know but it did keep happening. While sucked into the movie I suddenly got pulled out by how big Jai was in this movie (I suspect he was getting ready for Suicide Squad or had just done it) because he was huge. Don't get me wrong he is sexy AF but I thought 'would a soldier in the era be that big? I mean he is 'beefcakey'. Then I thought how would a soldier keep that body with his shrapnel injury? See I told you dumb thoughts but they did jerk me out of the movie experience but only momentarily.

27 June 2017,A generally good movie,"I've watched the movie with pleasure and excitement, mostly because i thought Plummer would make the movie great. His acting was really good something i cannot really say about Marsan (Himmler), Courtney (captain) and James (Mieke). In general, i really enjoyed the detail in uniforms and photography's historic environment. I believe music was appropriate, lighting was nice but the whole plot was commonly used in such historical/drama/romance movies. I also believe that in some particular scenes, the fear and disrespect could be slightly more intense.

In general good movie, enjoyable but not an unforgettable or a ""muct watch"". My rate 6/10.

2 September 2021,Better than the IMdb score gives credit for now in 2021,"I loved this movie. The low scoring is probably based on viewers seeing it some years ago but in 2021 as i write, some things have changed. True, there is an implausible romantic plot line, but it's so well handled, both by director and actors Lily James and Jai Courtney, that I never really noticed it was implausible, it was so entertaining.

Courtney is tasked with looking after the exiled Kaiser played by the late, great Christopher Plummer. Whether or not his role is romanticised as being a kindly soul, Plummer is so compelling to watch I couldn't take my eyes off him and I felt such a loss now that he is no longer with us. This is one of the changes since it was made. Another is the beautiful Lily James, who in the intervening years has become a solid actress, particularly good in war films as she showed in The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society and Darkest Hour more recently. An exceptional actress who can not only act well but sings and dances as well, as she showed in the Mama Mia sequel which she saved from being just a repeat of the first one. Jai Courtney, an Australian actor, I had only seen briefly a few days ago in the Suicide Squad superhero film, is impressive I thought in this, the longer I watched. There is real chemistry between all the actors and Janet McTeer as the wife of the Kaiser is superbly cold and calculating in her support of her husband. Well directed and photographed, it also had another more ruthless performance from Eddie Marsan as Himmler who pays a visit to the exiled Kaiser and around this meeting the final drama explodes. 9 stars from me.",9
13 June 2017,Beautiful film,"There are many WW2 movies and many others based on Hitler but I think this is one unique movie that touches upon what happened outside the world of Hitler's Germany. With a starcast that performs brilliantly the storyline is pretty taut to keep the viewer engaged throughout. A must watch.

9 July 2023,A battle of conscience on different fronts,"Based on a fictitious novel, the story is about former Kaiser Wilhelm II's exile in The Netherlands during WW2. Whereby the exile is a true fact, the story about the spy drama however isn't.

This movie is however a worthwile watch! It is literally a ""battle of conscience on different fronts"". It amongst others challenges not only some facts of the Nazi regime, but also with regards to loyalty. As such, I found this movie interesting to see an would rate it 7.0/10. This also based on solid acting.

The movie also triggered my interest in finding out more about the facts surrounding Kaiser Wilhelm II's reign, his involvement in the first world war and what happened to him afterwards.

26 August 2022,Plummer Saves,"Instead of creating a close portrayal of Kaiser Wilhelm II, with one of the absolute best acting performers in the business in a true leading role, The Exception makers got carried away into making a romantic soapish kind of secret agent, and not particularly exciting WW2 thriller, where the actual historical events play a very diminshed part. The result is that the total just ends up with quite a lot less of both, neither good history or fiction, typical modern rubbish. Nevertheless, though it didn't really become one of his last great film roles, Christopher Plummer still stands out and saves the day.

Historically, Heinrich Himmler, the Reichsführer of the SS, did, indeed, visit the Kaiser in Holland. That visit is the lynchpin to the plot. (If the visit had been invented for plot purposes, we wouldn't believe it. However, Himmler really did visit.)

The key role in the film is that of Kaiser Wilhelm II, played brilliantly by Christopher Plummer. Plummer is a consummate actor, and he makes the role come alive.

I think that the manner in which the Kaiser is portrayed takes the movie the furthest away from historical reality. In the film he's shown as a more-or-less kindly old man who loves to feed his ducks. According to Wikipedia, he remained a harsh, haughty aristocrat. However, the movie will only work if we believe that the Kaiser also has a softer side, so that's what we see.

I want to alert IMDb readers to watch for the work of Janet McTeer, who portrays the Kaiser's wife, Princess Hermine. She has no great love for the Nazis, but she is willing to go to any lengths to see that her husband returns to Germany and is restored to his monarchy. She is a German Lady Macbeth--cold, calculating, and decisive.

We saw this film at the wonderful Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It will work well on the small screen. The movie carries an anemic 6.8 IMDb rating. It's much, much better than that. The plot is interesting, the acting is outstanding, and the direction is excellent. Don't be fooled by the low rating--this is a movie that I highly recommend.",7
1 February 2022,"Marsan, Plummer and the Kaiser Reich","The Exception (2016) was directed by David Leveaux. The movie was produced in Belgium, but the dialog is in English.

The film is not meant to be a documentary, so we can't take it at face value. However, the basic outline of the story is true. Kaiser Wilhelm II was forced to relinquish his throne after World War I. He spent his remaining years at a secluded mansion in Holland. When Holland was invaded and conquered by the Germans, Wilhelm came under the direct authority of Germany.

In the movie, a previously wounded German army captain (Stefan Brandt, portrayed by Jai Courtney) is sent to be the commanding officer of the Kaiser's guard. Brandt is a loyal officer, but he is disgusted by the SS atrocities. He falls in love with one of the maids, Mieke de Jong, portrayed by the beautiful Lily James. She is Jewish, but Brandt isn't anti-Semitic, so he pursues his romance with Mieke.
