It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.

I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

Viva Clint Eastwood, viva Morgan Freeman, viva Madiba.

PS. I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.

Of the films Eastwood has directed, my favorites, in no particular order, are ""Unforgiven"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Gran Torino"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"",""Bird"" and ""Invictus"". Yes, it's really that good. ""Invictus"" is another winner from Clint. He just seems to get better with age. What a creative roll he is currently on.

PPS. ""Invictus"" is one of the best sporting movies I have ever seen. But it's also about more than sport.",8
4 December 2009,One of Clint's Best...,"In surely one of his lightest and straight-forward works of his career, Clint Eastwood has achieved one of the most inspirational films of the year with his new film, Invictus.

Starring Academy Award Winners Morgan Freeman as South African President Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon as Rugby Captain Francois Pienaar, Invictus is a picture full of emotion, magnetism, and revelation. What critics and audiences may be deceived by is belief that this is THE Nelson Mandela biopic which it is not. It is the story of Nelson Mandela's first years as President of the culturally separated country South Africa in 90's. In a way to unify his people, Mandela used the country's love for Rugby to connect the whites and the blacks. As their record has been less than impressive, no one expects anything notable from the Springboks. Mandela taps the captain of the team to rally his troops and surge into battle for the greater good of his country.

Everything about Invictus works on so many degrees of the medium based on the book ""Playing the Enemy."" The film never comes off as too pretentious or egotistical; it requires nothing more from the viewer than an open mind and heart. Eastwood directs the film perfectly, laying back when he needs to, never pushing the subject matter or shoving it down our throats. He utilizes all the skills we've come to love about his earlier works in Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River, and Letters from Iwo Jima. The use of light shows a character' s vulnerability inhabiting their souls or a score by Kyle Eastwood that offers both zeal and subtlety during a rugby match.

Cinematographer Tom Stern hits another one out of the park, catching all the fury and apprehension of all the different elements of this strenuous time. Joel Cox and Gary Roach edit the film with the perfect amount of precision and friction.

Morgan Freeman as Mandela is a wonderful charmer, showing the man's most hostile yet tranquil behaviors. Not necessarily the most engulfed characterization seen on film this year as Freeman's accent comes in and out of remission, but it's a tremendous performance worthy of an Oscar nomination.

Matt Damon, showing himself as one of the best working actors today, doesn't have enough of the character depth and arc to carry the picture. Damon's performance doesn't allow him to really go anywhere. It's a superb turn, with a great accent inhabitance, that warrants credit where the credit is due. However, Damon requires nothing more than a little motivational speaking and responsive humility.

Invictus, is one of the best pictures of the year, standing in the ranks of one of the best sports films of the decade. This is the type of film that Oscar will likely be all over and fall in love with. I concur.

****/****",9
11 December 2009,Inspiring and uplifting!,"Originally, I thought this movie was going to be a biopic on the life of Nelson Mandela. To some degree, it is a biography on Mr. Mandela, but the film's main focus is on his idea of inspiring a country that is drawn to crime, violence, and poverty (after years of Apartheid) to a glimpse of hope via the nation's rugby team.

Without a doubt, this is the perfect role for Morgan Freeman. I will note that his accent comes and goes throughout the film, but he nails the role down. He is not overly dramatic nor does he just read the script. He becomes the man. Morgan Freeman is easily one of my favorite actors because he never plays himself. He always makes himself into the character he's assigned to. He'll definitely receive the Best Actor nom, and hopefully, Morgan can finally win the Oscar he so desperately deserves.

Regarding Matt Damon as the rugby coach (Francois Pienaar), he too immerses himself into his role. He even maintains a solid accent. However, the sympathy of the film is aimed towards Mandela than it is to Francois. The other cast members (none of which I recognized) also gave decent, believable performances.

As with the plot, it is predictable, something we've seen beforeunderdog overcomes impossible odds, yet screenwriter Anthony Peckham throws in many important themes that may seem all to familiar, but is nonetheless eye-opening such as: forgiveness, unity, and determination to do what is right. Racial tension between the whites and blacks is dominant in the movie, particularly between the black and white security guards, but the film's point, as well as Mandela's goal, is to put our differences aside and work together as one.

The movie isn't just about a rugby game, but rather organizing a nation to a success. It may be considered a wise political move on Mandela's part, but as Morgan says to his aid, ""It is a human calculation"". People need inspiration in order to change and to do good. These themes are what make it a good film. It also makes it a different kind of sports movie.

Tom Stern's cinematography is wonderful, and this time, he doesn't make the movie all sepia tone like in ""Letters of Iwo Jima"" or ""Changeling"" and I congratulate the editors Joel Cox and Gary Roach once again for making each shot beautifully seamless and well structured for the storyline. The music by Kyle Eastwood and Michael Stevens is not just a pretty tone that plays along with the movie, but it adds some oomph and emotion. I particularly love their choice of African vocals, for it not only makes the film feel more real, but it is absolutely beautiful to listen to.

Clint Eastwood has done another great movie. Not only has he captured the themes of the story, but also the poverty of South Africa as well as the intense rugby sequences. There are some powerful scenes in this movie, as well as some intense and suspenseful ones, and even ones that'll make you smile. For the first time in a movie for this year, I actually cried. Not because of sadness, but from joy.

""Invictus"" is an inspiring film. Some back-story could have been added to the characters and the first act could have been faster, but overall, I enjoyed this film. ""Invictus"" proves that it doesn't take special effects and big action sequences to make a great film. It is excellent to see one of our great old directors to recognize this, and display it so wonderfully without being preachy about it.",10
11 December 2009,Just one great film,"People forget that Nelson Mandela came to power at a time when his country was bitterly divided. There was the bitter experience that white South Africans saw in their neighboring countries,i.e., Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe and other nations where the White colonialist had been replaced by Black African politicians and a stable government had been replaced by corrupt, self-serving regimes where those in power feathered their nests after seizing the assets of their former White citizens and placed all their friends in positions of authority with the result of the country going to the dogs. The scene where the Afrikaaner newspaper remarks, ""Mendela can get elected but can he run a country,"" and the superb Morgan Freeman remarks to his bodyguard that the headline raises a good point.

In a sense, this film is about Mandela. The rugby team becomes a metaphor of what he faced when ascending to the presidency, a nation divided. Noting that the Black South Africans were cheering for the opposition in the face of the old Apartheid guard whose love of rugby unified them. It's easy to forget that there was a great division among White South Africans, i.e., the descendants of the Boers, Afrikaaners, and the rest. There was even a middle ground with the ""Coloreds,"" Asian South Africans, being caught between these two worlds and there were bitter rivalries among the competing African political interest groups as well.

Mandela's focus on reviving the national rugby team and making it a symbol of a new united nation homes in on the role of Matt Damon, an Afrikaaner who's the captain of the team. Francois is the catalyst that makes this story work and Damon, the rugged Mick from Boston, does a fantastic job showing the transition from hopelessness to hope as many White South Africans felt at that time. The wonderful thing about this film is its touching on all the levels. It goes beyond being merely the story of a single man or group of men. Sure, we love a ""feel good"" movie and of course we love an ""underdog can win"" flick, but this film works works because its about people working together to rebuild something new for everybody.

The film reeks with great moments: Pienaar visiting the cell where Mandela spent more than 20 years of his life, thinking and planning; The New Zealand Rugby team doing their Maori threat dance before the match; the jet buzzing the field before the game-- and so on. See it. Enjoy it. And, don't forget, it's a bit of history. Romanticized? Somewhat. Mandela wasn't able to solve all of South Africa's big problems, but he did one bang-up job for the Springboks.",10
12 December 2009,Inspirational,"Clint Eastwood manages to top himself with this true story of how the new president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, used the national rugby team foray into the World Cup to unite his country after years of apartheid. Eastwood’s soft touch provides a timely but not heavy-handed message about hope and change that probably won’t be lost on American audiences. The result is beautiful, exhilarating, and wholly inspirational.

Mandela, played with effortless dignity by Morgan Freeman, is fresh out of prison and desperate for a way to rebuild his country, which has been torn asunder by the heinous policies of apartheid. Mandela comes to believe that the most sensible way for this to be accomplished is not by making speeches in faraway lands but to give his countrymen something they can all cheer about. His solution is to galvanize the national rugby team, which to date had not been a particularly successful club and had been given very little chance to compete on an international stage like the World Cup. Mandela pins all of his political hopes on the club’s chances; should they fail, he will appear to have behaved frivolously in paying so much attention to a sport, and the black people and the white people would be even farther apart.

The odds were decidedly against the Springboks of South Africa. The team was a certified failure, so much so that the coach had just been axed. Captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) is frustrated. Times are so bad in South Africa that during the team’s matches, the white audience members cheer for South Africa – but the black audience members cheer for the opposition, because the team itself is almost entirely white, with only one black player. Indeed, after Mandela’s election as president, South African groups vote overwhelmingly to drop the traditional rugby nickname “Springboks” as a way to shed themselves of all reminders of the apartheid era. Mandela realizes that such a action would instead drive a further wedge between the two races, so he countermands the local votes and maintains the nickname and the traditional green-and-gold uniforms.

Sports movies in general are expected to follow a particular formula, more so than other films. That is, if we’re met with a ragtag band of sandlot players, we expect them to somehow persevere by the end of the movie. This is one of the few genres in which such predictability is a major plus. Sports movies are meant to manipulate you shamelessly, and you’re a willing, permissive participant. Invictus certainly plucks all the heartstrings it can, but the bonus is that these events actually happened. This isn’t The Mighty Ducks beating the bad guys or Henry Rowengartner’s Cubs winning the World Series, this is a real-life rugby team gaining strength, wisdom, and inspiration from their newly elected president to triumph over steep odds.

That said, this is less a movie about winning the championship and more about unification. Mandela, who had been imprisoned for 27 years, had steep odds of his own to contend with. Although democratically elected, there were still plenty of people throughout the country who really didn’t trust their new leader at all and were convinced that he would lead them all to ruin. (Sounds a little familiar, and I assume that the timing was intentional on the part of Eastwood.) Mandela had to unite everyone, beginning with his own staff, in order for the country to move forward and have a seat at the proverbial international table.

Because of this grand vision, Mandela takes a personal interest in the fortunes of the rugby team, even to the point of rescheduling events so that he can watch the matches either in person or at least on television. He is careful not to intrude too much in the training and management of the team (particularly Pienaar).

Now, granted, this is an American movie made for American audiences, so there are some concessions. For one thing, the rules of rugby have to be mentioned at least once (and not enough, as far as I was concerned); for another, the focus isn’t just on the political machinations and aspirations of Mandela but rather on how the team itself reacts to its new success and the attempts by its captain to inspire them to ever-greater heights. What this slight sleight of hand does is present the idea of postpartheid attitudes in the framework of an athletic event, something American audiences can always care about, no matter the sport. Excellent decision by the director, I think, because the overall message is enhanced, rather than obscured, by the experiences of the Springboks.

Even with the political subtext, and even among sports movies (which themselves are usually very evocative), this is a highly emotional film. The rugby scenes are so well done, so fantastic to watch, that nonfans like me – who don’t know a thing about rugby – can’t help but let down their steely resolve and cynicism. This is a happy, optimistic movie, but it’s not a funny movie. There was hardly a dry eye in the theater today, thanks to the powerful rugby scenes, and I have to admit I haven’t teared up that much at any movie in a long, long time. Eastwood’s strong direction pushes the audience into the right direction, but we go willingly and happily. Freeman is commanding in the role he was always meant to play (Mandela himself wanted Freeman to portray him), and even Damon is excellent as the South African rugby captain. This is a true winner in all aspects of film.",10
9 December 2009,Strong themes overcome predictable plotting,"Morgan Freeman's made a career out of playing inspirational second fiddles who always steal the movie. Now with Clint Eastwood's ""Invictus"", we finally get to see this amazing actor take front and center and run with it. The movie, based on a John Carlin novel about the event that changed South Africa, fits Freeman like a glove and it's hard to imagine he's not a front-runner for that lead actor Oscar he has so deserved for so long now.

He plays Nelson Mandela as a born leader, an authoritative yet empathetic uniter who preached forgiveness and looked for common ground when elected president of South Africa. His election caused unrest among whites, and blacks still had hard feelings for years-worth of oppression. The one thing he saw that could unite was the Rugby team, a shamefully rag-tag bunch facing extinction because many still saw the team as a left-over from apartheid. Mandela knew ending the team would mean more unrest among white Rugby fans so instead he presented a challenge to team captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon); win the world cup,unite us.

Do they? It's all predictably plotted and there are times where you wish Eastwood had employed an announcer to explain what's happening on the Rugby field but the great themes of forgiveness, unity, and determination make this a sports movie well worth seeing. There are really wonderful elements here. The relationship between Mandela's white and black security detail. The Rugby team reaching out to the community by going to the slums and teaching kids how to play. Pienaar's visit to Mandela's prison cell to understand the man's courage. The people of South Africa rallying into something of a community. And the bond between Mandela and Pienaar, very well played by both Freeman and Damon, of two men looking for their country's pride, it's center, and it's heart. By the final Rugby match, the movie has built up such good-will that any predictability or confusion on screen becomes an afterthought to the joy and excitement on display. Eastwood's film shows how sports can unify people, a simple yet inspirational and lovable message that should leave audiences cheering.",8
12 December 2009,Freeman is great as Mandela,"Invictus is an enjoyable film, Morgan Freeman is great as Mandela and it's an inspiring story. The movie revolves around the 1995 Rugby World Cup and Mandela's attempt to unite South Africa behind its rugby team. Mandela develops a relationship with team captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon)playing the role of mentor and motivational coach.

Although it's well-made and worth watching. As a rugby fan I was a little disappointed with the action on the field although most ordinary film-goers may not notice. I am not convinced the director (Clint Eastwood) really understands the game and the actors hired to play the Springboks didn't really look the part. At 5'10"" Matt Damon is a little small to play the 6'3"" and 240 lb Pienaar. Pienaar was a popular charmer with a ready smile and a real ambassador for South African rugby. Damon still seemed to be playing Jason Bourne. It was an intense performance but it wasn't how I remembered Pienaar.

South Africa had not been allowed to play in previous world cup tournaments and the years of isolation had left the Springboks uncompetitive. They were seeded ninth coming into the tournament but exceed expectations by reaching the final. The action focuses on the final match with New Zealand. New Zealand had an amazing wing (running back) in the 20 year old Jonah Lomu who at 6'5"" and 265 pounds seemed unstoppable. South Africa really were the underdogs. It was also the only time that the All Blacks have managed to reach the final since 1987. They usually get beat by the French (1999, 2007) or Australia (1991 and 2003)in the quarters or semis.

Overall it's nice for rugby to finally receive some recognition from Hollywood, because it's a major global sport. It's a good film.

I discovered that ""Invictus"" is a short poem by the English poet William Ernest Henley. The title is Latin for ""unconquered"". It was first published in 1875.",8
12 December 2009,Morgan Freeman shines in Clint Eastwood's solid drama,"Set in the early to mid 90's, Clint Eastwood's ""Invictus"" covers the first year of Nelson Mandela's presidency and how he pushed the nation's rugby team, led by captain Francois Pienaar, to achieve World Cup glory. However, Mandela's backing of the rugby team splits many hairs, as the ""Sprinboks"" have come to be a symbol of apartheid for millions of South Africans, making Mandela risk the very base that pushed him into office. He must also deal with personal security, his exhaustive schedule, and the strains on his personal life.

As much as I respect Morgan Freeman, I was concerned that his presence would be distracting, that I would be seeing him instead of Nelson Mandela. I shouldn't have worried. Freeman completely immerses himself into the role and gives one of the best performances of the year. Not only are his accent and tone of voice quite good, but he brings a true 3-dimensionality to the role. Compare, for example, him having tea with Francois, to talking with his family, and to making a political speech. Freeman nailed every facet of Mandela's life.

Damon also excels as Pienaar, the solid enough rugby player who must do more than just lead by example for his team. The screenplay, adapted by Anthony Peckham, doesn't offer many narrative surprises, but it does do a good job examining not only the strife South Africa was in when Mandela was elected, but also the value of the team to the entire nation. Eastwood wisely plays the material straight. Though the material may seem familiar, the performances by Damon and especially Freeman are what elevate this tale into a solid and even uplifting drama.",8
17 December 2009,"Well Made, But Completely Forgettable","Nelson Mandela has been released from prison and was voted as the South African president. Wanting to unite his country, he found a way to do so with rugby and in the South African team captain, Francois Pienaar.

Morgan Freeman was born to play this role, he knew so, and that's why he produced this film. A dream project of his, waiting for someone to take the job of directing, his old friend Clint Eastwood steps in. Who says no to Clint? Especially Freeman, who under Eastwood's direction won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Invictus, William Ernest Henley, which is read by Mandela in the film, is well crafted and has a strong lead role. Unfortunately, the film is a by the numbers product that you seem to forget once you leave the theatre.

My main problem with the film is the lack of emotion. I couldn't care for any of the characters in this film, save for Freeman, who as I stated does an excellent job. Matt Damon, who is shown on the poster, has the supporting role here. But he is given absolutely nothing to do except play rugby. His character has no story to him, but aren't we suppose to believe in him? After all, Mandela does. He gives him inspiration to win the world cup. Matt Damon does an alright job, but nothing worth mentioning. The same goes for the rest of the cast, they seem to be there just because the story is based on real life.

Eastwood knows how to direct a film, the Academy seems to think so too, so you know going into it that it well be well crafted. This is Eastwood's first step into a semi sports movie genre. The sport is rugby, and after watching the film, I still have no idea how to play it. The final act of the game is in slow motion as well, clichéd? You know it. You can hear every grunt from every player. It is elongated to the point of annoyance. The rugby sequences did not pull me in, nor did I care for who was going to win. It doesn't feel like he is trying to step out of his comfort zone either. It feels like an Eastwood movie, take that as you want.

The best parts of the film, are when Freeman commands the screen. His presence is more interesting and entertaining than any of the rugby scenes. Speaking of a rugby scenes, I must say that every 'epic' shot of the fans in the stands looked horribly fake. At some points I thought I was watching a PS3 game. It really took me out of the experience of the film.

If the film were a bit shorter and more focused (is it a sports film or character driven film?) than I could maybe invest my interest. It seemed to balance both as nice as it could, but ultimately gave out to one more than the other and unfortunately it's the weaker part. Eastwood chooses to sidestep more important things in the film. Is this because of the script? Are we suppose to want to keep watching Mandela inspire a rugby team to unite nation? The racial undertones are there at the beginning, then completely forgotten. In the end, I wanted more from this film.

The film is not bad, it's moderately good. Some scenes are actually inspiring, but that's more because of Freeman and not the generic script. I guess I wanted a little bit more from this one. Everyone involved made it seem like it should have been a great success, instead it comes off as something that everyone just decided to throw together. This is another film that belongs in that category of good, but not good enough for me to want to recommend it to you for theatre viewing.",6

28 January 2011,Reconciliation and Forgiveness,"On 11 February 1990, Nelson Mandela is released after twenty-seven years imprisoned in Robben Island. In 1994, he is elected President of South Africa and he tries to unite his nation that is divided by the apartheid. Near the Rugby World Cup 1995 in South Africa, Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) invites the captain of the Springboks François Pienaar (Matt Damon) to come to the government palace for a tea and inspires François to win the championship with his team.

""Invictus"" is a pleasant movie about the integration of people through the sports, in a country racially and economically split, by an enlightened man that preaches reconciliation and forgiveness. Morgan Freeman, as usual, has a great performance in the role of the great South African leader. However, this film should be shorter and spends too much time in sequences of rugby, a sport that is not popular in my country and therefore boring and uninteresting to me. My vote is six.

Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

Viva Clint Eastwood, viva Morgan Freeman, viva Madiba.

PS. I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.

Of the films Eastwood has directed, my favorites, in no particular order, are ""Unforgiven"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Gran Torino"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"",""Bird"" and ""Invictus"". Yes, it's really that good. ""Invictus"" is another winner from Clint. He just seems to get better with age. What a creative roll he is currently on.

PPS. ""Invictus"" is one of the best sporting movies I have ever seen. But it's also about more than sport.",10
23 March 2010,The power of symbols,"For years, the process of putting together a film about the icon of a man that is Nelson Mandela(and yes, Freeman completely becomes him in this, the manner in which he talks, the tenderness, the way he walks...) that does him justice has been going on. How to cover a man who struggled for literally decades, almost three of which he spent incarcerated, without leaving something out, glossing over things? It would be necessary to focus on a specific event. The World Cup of Rugby in 1995 was found to be ideal; indeed, by the man himself. Yes, to an extent, this is a sports movie(although that is by no means what it first and foremost is). It is a product of Hollywood, with some of what comes with. However, it is also an accessible picture that captures and communicates the essence of the inspirational man(and his cause) whom it is about with immense skill. Anyone can sit down and watch this, and few will miss its beautifully stated(with no manipulation and only minimal romanticizing) message: That we have to break the cycle of violence, that mutual understanding and respect, not hostility and suspicion, is the way to go. I hope that the former President of South Africa is happy with how this piece turned out. The acting, every single performance(including the extras), is amazing. This is gorgeously shot and edited. There isn't a boring or unengaging moment to be found in this. The dialog is well-written, clever and impeccably delivered. Other than one particular instance, the music is fitting and great. Eastwood, please don't directing stop until you simply cannot do so anymore. You're too damn good at it. There are several instances of intense violence(the games) and brief strong language in this. I recommend this to everyone. 8/10",8
1 May 2010,This is the greatest inspirational movie,"I must confess that I am a great fan of Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman an Matt Damon (not necessarily in this order), but what impressed me most in this movie was the story (and if it was real, much better!). We can learn from this story that not revenge, but forgiveness is the most powerful weapon of our beings. Seeing this picture movie I realized how difficult was for Mandela to prevent a civil war or even a riot on such a drastic change of regimes. For those who lived under hard circumstances (like apartheid, communism or so called socialism) is much easier to understand the subtlety of the story, and more than that, this movie is a must see. That's one of the reasons I rate it 10 out of 10.

1 April 2011,His Unconquerable Soul,"Invictus is one of those sports films that is more than about sports. It transcends athletics and delves deeply into world politics and human rights. Nelson Mandela who learned so many universal truths to heart in his long prison exile, learned another in that nothing on earth can unite people like sports. He may have learned that by knowing something of the life of Jackie Robinson who when he integrated American Major League Baseball found that racial differences could be bridged easier than you would imagine by fans with the common interest of seeing that Brooklyn Dodger team win.

If such for a borough of the City of New York how much greater for the South African nation ruled so long by an evil doctrine of separatist White Supremacy. The black majority was now asserting itself, but Mandela did not want to preside over a nation of vengeance. The previously all white Springbok Rugby team, now integrated could unite the nation if it won the World Cup in that sport.

So Mandela personally interested himself in that idea and recruited the Springbok player/coach in his crusade. Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon who played Mandela and the coach Francois Pienaar made a dream happen and had blacks and whites behind the Springboks in their quest.

Two things that American audiences might have trouble grasping is that in the Mandela cabinet as in many other countries there is such a thing as a Minister of Sports. Our athletics in America are far more a private institution, that is unheard of in the USA. We might have a State Athletic Commission for boxing and other violent type sports that are mostly concerned with athletic safety. But that wasn't even always the case.

And of course Rugby football is not played here. I have a young friend from South Africa who just scoffs at our National Football League and all the protective gear those guys wear. American audiences weaned on Monday Night Football seeing these Rugby players in sneakers, shorts and team jerseys playing it as rough as the NFL might get a bit of culture shock.

Clint Eastwood as director had a marvelous eye for the time of history he was filming and for the culture of South Africa. But he was best at handling his actors as Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon received Best Actor and Supporting Actor nominations for their roles. If there is a fault with Invictus it is that these two so dominate the film that no other characters really develop. But these are two who can hold an audience's attention.

For a really compelling film about one of the great men of the last and current century and the time he lived in, you must absolutely see and be informed and educated by Invictus.",9
12 December 2009,"The Master of His Fate is given a decent, corny sports movie","In Invictus, Morgan Freeman doesn't have to act like Nelson Mandela, since he basically *is* Mandela (more God-like in demeanor and in his kindness and reserve than his God in the 'Almighty' franchise). His poise and speech and way of showing immense pain and conflict buried underneath a strong demeanor is perhaps reason enough to see this movie. Seeing him on screen, acting intensely even when sitting calmly in a car with his sunglasses on, is seeing a tremendous actor doing service to a marvel of a human being like Mandela. I just wish this Mandela, who is what he is and is alongside Matt Damon as a likable-tough South African Rugby captain, was in a movie less corny and more political. The story is the tale of the 95 Rugby World Cup, but it's also the story of Mandela in this context, and the balance between the two becomes, shall we say, 'sappy'.

With all due respect to Clint Eastwood, it comes off here like all Nelson Mandela did as president was worry about how South Africa was doing in whatever Rugby game was going on, even when doing President-things like meetings and speeches. It's meant to be a stirring sports movie - how the underdog triumphed against the odds - more-so than a politically-charged screed, which is fine, on paper. But I wish the sports scenes were less corny and we saw more of what Mandela did as President. His tactic is clear, to be sure: get the Rugby team to win the world cup, and unite the nation. This, too, is fine, on paper or in theory. But we only get very slight glimpses of this nation's strife, and people going into the film without knowing the history of the aftermath of apartheid will be getting a story that is half-cooked around the facts and pablum of victory.

It is watchable, don't get one wrong: the scenes where Mandela projects his influence on people is magnetic to see. Mandela in front of a crowd can be just as moving and interesting as in front of one person, be it that sports organization he comes to as a surprise visit (""You chose me as your leader - let me lead""), or his cool rationale for focusing so strongly on Rugby (""It's a ... human calculation""). One wishes for more of that in some part to Freeman's presence and control of the role, but also because the scenes with the Rugby team, frankly, aren't anywhere near as compelling. We've seen this story before and even without knowing the true story know it's outcome minutes before it's presented, like, as they say in sports movies, ""destiny"".

Again, some of the predictability would still be fine, and is tolerable, but Eastwood also doesn't really do enough to give the Rugby matches real uplift and energy. He does try in the climax, but in, again, a corny aspect - he cuts between the various fans watching in bars and houses and in the sold out arena New Zealand/South Africa are playing in, and then with a little boy who may/may not be getting ready to do something with an object in a bag, only to stop by the awesome power of the game on radio. Perhaps if one is a sucker for such inspiring stories, this will come as the treat of the season. For those wanting something more from its iconic filmmaker, or to see a side of President Mandela outside of being a hardcore Rugby enthusiast, it disappoints. But, at the least, it has that embodiment of a great figure at its center, the best one's seen since the days of Henry Fonda as Lincoln.",6
7 March 2010,"That film takes you by what you have most private, your soul","As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning, I can tell you you the entertaining, inspiring and enjoyable ""Invictus"" exceeded all my expectations.

It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time.

17 December 2009,"Great work from Freeman and the story, but everything else feels average or amateur at best","While not exactly a biopic per se, Invictus does tell an important piece of Nelson Mandela's (Morgan Freeman) life as President of South Africa. With the country's rugby team losing horribly match after match, he looks to Captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to help unite the team in time for the country's hosting duties of the 1995 World Cup, and in turn, unite a country still reeling from apartheid.

Clint Eastwood continues to defy all Hollywood conventions with Invictus, his ninth film of the decade. The man is going on 80, but he is pumping out more movies than heavyweights like Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. And with each passing film, he continues to up his craft and his scope for what he is capturing on screen. While Invictus is nowhere near the epic undertaking of the twofer of Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima, it still stands as a very accomplished work. But much like Flags, it is a very flawed work.

The story itself is fairly well done. It is predictable of course, but is sappy in some wrong places. It is not quite Remember the Titans for adults like I heard it described as, but it borders on feeling much the same way. I find it interesting that the first real story we get about Mandela dramatized on screen is more about rugby than it is about the man, but Eastwood presents it in such a fascinating way that it manages to work as a depiction of him. There is a great reverence on display from the beginning, with actual TV footage digitally manipulated to add in Freeman over the real Mandela, and at every turn, the story stays consistent with these early images. It jumps around in focus between Mandela and Pienaar, but it never feels bothersome and always feels like a well rounded tale. Unfortunately, that tale does not always stay as interesting as it could.

But while the story is not bad, the editing is all over the place. After really beginning to hit his stride, Eastwood seems to be falling back and looking more amateur in some of the scenes on display here. Some run too long, others too short. Others are left far too open ended, and some too preachy. Even worse, some scenes have characters fading in and out like ghosts, pushing a heavy handed message about the unfairness of the system too far. Having seen his previous work, it is clear Eastwood knows better than this, so why allow these elements to take away from what could be a fantastic piece of work?

The ending rugby match that seems to run on forever has a lengthy period of time where everything runs in slow motion. While this is typical for a sports film, especially for the team playing, Eastwood makes everything run in slow motion: the team, the fans watching in the stadium, the fans at home and at bars, Mandela himself. And it runs for more than five minutes like this, overkilling and destroying any suspense or tension the film has going for it because the audience begins to laugh at how ridiculous the scene looks. It reminded me a lot of what I can only explain as the 'Gatorade' sequence from Spielberg's Munich, where one of the most intense scenes in the film is ruined by a goofy slow motion sequence. It takes you right out of the movie; the last thing any filmmaker wants to see happen.

The music fares even worse. While the African inspired songs that play throughout the film are very well used in their sequences, there are a few English-speaking songs that are just wrong for the film. Thankfully Eastwood does not sing any himself (unlike the hilariously bad tune that nearly ruins Gran Torino), but the lyrics are just awful. Again, they took me right out of the film, and made me laugh more than anything. They may help describe what is going on, but in the forms they are given to us, they do nothing but take away from everything. While I was a little disappointed to hear another similar Eastwood score in other cases, the addition of an African influence causes the score to sound all the better and more original. The man can only use a similar score for so many films before it becomes stale, and thankfully it is altered to sound all the more unique.

While his accent is not perfect, Freeman delivers another fabulous performance. The man may be ageing as quickly as Eastwood, but his technique never wavers. His soft spoken and generous nature is only complimented by how easily he slips into the character. He has just the right amount of power and gravitas in each scene that it is hard to realize it is not actually Mandela playing himself on screen. It is a very personal performance that is just as inspiring as it looks. It is not the performance of the year, but it comes really close to competing with it.

Damon on the other hand, does not fare so well. He just does not come off as believable as the rugby team's Captain. His accent falls somewhere between Freeman's great accent here and Nicole Kidman's horrible attempt at Italian in Nine. But even despite that, his character is just not compelling enough to make us really care about his struggle to help Mandela achieve his goals. When he does make it work, he does well for himself. But those moments come too few and far between.

I wanted to like Invictus more than I did. Freeman delivers, and the story is fairly well done as well. But the rest just feels either average or amateur at best. The film is not bad, but it could have been significantly better edited.

14 November 2012,A routine look at a legendary man at a critical time--it works by appreciating Mandela,"Invictus (2009)

It helps to have Nelson Mandela as your main character. The inspiration he provided his country for decades, in and out of jail, is transferred here through a single focus--the national rugby team. In the form of Morgan Freeman, Mandela is made to be as profound and humble as he truly seemed to be, at least as a public figure.

So even if you have troubles with Clint Eastwood movies (they all seem pretty decent, you have to admit, whatever the repeating clichés in them), this one rises above in enough parts to warrant the good attention. Eastwood, to be sure, never appears. This is mostly Freeman's movie, though the other big name is Matt Damon, who is good enough (as usual) in a role that is minor and fairly straight forward, the captain of the team.

The best of the movie is the interpersonal mixing with the political. We get a glimpse (if only that) of post-apartheid South Africa, and of how fractious the scene was. And how Mandela used the mostly white rugby team to represent a new, tolerant country with its new, tolerant black president. It's a clever, clear way to get into that world in a heartbeat.

Where the movie gets most outwardly exciting it gets more ordinary--at the Rugby World Cup. Then it becomes a kind of sports movie where the underdog seems like it really might win. It helps to have the larger themes of reconciliation and Mandela's presence mean so much in it all, but eventually it's all about getting the goal. I was cheering for the S. African team but I was also losing respect for the movie's more interesting (and important) intentions. I know, that makes me seem mixed up, but you might see what I mean when you get there.

Does this sentimentalize the situation? Oversimplify? Make Hollywood and far more interesting and complicated and sometimes unhappy affair? Probably a loud yes on all accounts. But in that sense, it really is a Clint Eastwood film. Well made stuff, but not half what it might have been.",7
3 January 2010,Sadly disappointing,"I'm very sorry to say it, especially because this film was created by talented folks such as Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood, but ""Invictus"" is terribly disappointing.

Nelson Mandela is a tremendously important figure in 20th Century history. His inspiring story affects not just South Africans but all of us. He deserves a film of the same emotional caliber as ""Ghandi"" was for Mahatma and ""Kundun"" was for the Dalai Lama. But ""Invictus"" falls flat and fails to live up to that standard. This is an incredible shame, too, for if IMDb Trivia is to be believed, Mandela himself believed that the world cup rugby story sums up his history, charisma, and leadership quite nicely and would make for a good film.

There are multiple problems with this film. First and foremost is the pacing. This movie is so dull, so lifeless, it clumsily plods along from one meeting to another with barely an emotional center at all. The script and the direction are the culprits here: too much idle chit chat. The biggest problem is the focus on the security detail. Fully 1/3 of the film is devoted to these chaps for no reason! There's little payoff for all that time investment. They should have been relegated to the sidelines, providing their one redeeming quality in this film: much-needed comic relief.

Next is Matt Damon. Now I am far from a Matt Damon basher, I think he's a fine actor and never find him to be an ego distraction like so many other stars. But he adds very little to this story, his character could also have been sidelined. It seems like the producers wanted star power to get this project off the ground so they fished around for a big-name white star to give the film some cred and hopefully an audience.

Then there's rugby itself. This has to be one of the worst sports movies ever made in terms of not engendering interest in the sport itself. I think ""MIghty Ducks"" did more to promote hockey than ""Invictus"" did to promote rugby. A sports movie should engage and excite the viewer. This one simply showed the stereotype that rugby is a brutal, pointless sport. I doubt there will be many kids lining up to learn rugby as a result of this film.

Most aggravating is something the film LACKS. One of the most inspiring things to ever come out of Africa is the music. Where are the great African rhythms? This soundtrack, and the use of music throughout the film, is terrible. There's even this full-blown American pop number in the middle of it. None of the great, traditional, powerful, inspirational African music is in this film at all, and that really bothers me.

This is a crying shame. Nelson Mandela's story needs to be told. ""Invictus"" fails to tell it well.",5
28 December 2009,"Wonderfully well acted by Morgan Freeman, and Matt Damon, and wonderfully well directed by Clint Eastwood.","Is Invictus a story about race or is it sports movie, well it's both, and at the same time it's neither.

Based on a true story. Set in the mid nineties, Nelson Mandela(Morgan Freeman), is elected President of South Afirica, and still hopes to hopes to end hatred, so in doing that he decides to help a Rugby team that is on a losing streak. He calls to meet the team captain Francois Pienaar(Matt Damon) in hopes to inspire him to start a winning streak. But the question is will he ?

A truly great film, well acted by Freeman,and Damon. And perfectly directed by Clint Eastwood. It had great scenery, and an intense Rugby match. And look for Clint Eastwoods son Scott Eastwood has one of the Rugby players. It's just a truly great film.

27 December 2020,Inspiring film,"A great great film. I had resisted it cos my protest against the springboks from the 1981 tour in NZ had left me anti rugby esp. re South Africa. All those people at the time who said politics should be kept out of sport, like that was possible under apartheid! For me, this film drives home the fact of what South Africa has achieved & what so many of us around the world helped create by standing against apartheid & forcing the change. This film shows how sport can be used to bring people together & how smart as well as compassionate Mandela was in embracing rugby, the game of the Afrikaners. It also reminds me why boycotting rugby was so important at the time, cos it really was the game of the white South Africans. Amandla x

23 December 2009,My 295th Review: World In Union,"As someone bought up on rugby and a strong anti-apartheid supporter - and those two things could go together - I was always going to love this.

With Eastwood at the helm we get a wonderful performance from Morgan Freeman, who really dominates this film, and a very solid performance from Matt Damon, who obviously took his rugby training very seriously.

This is a film whose central theme is inspirational leadership - Mandela had that wonderful ability to inspire people with his humility and drive - and this is bought out wonderfully.

This is a great film to simply enjoy - it is at its heart a film about inspiring a people through both sport and healing a nation - and Eastwood captures that.

This film deserves to be a real success in those countries where rugby is still a major sport, but deserves a much wider audience - it's a great film for anyone who enjoys an inspirational sports movie and good politics and is a glimpse of the best that humans can achieve when inspired to do so...",8
29 May 2010,Locker Room Lockup,"To my mind, this is less about South Africa, sport and Mandela than about another man.

Oh, the drama was really there. It doesn't matter that it was not as significant in uniting a nation as depicted. How could it be? How could it?

But the dramatic form is there because it works. We like to show the sweep of the large by embossing on an individual. Here at least we don't have love. And we like to illustrate a personal struggle by showing masses in huge movement. Masses and mass excitement are cinematic, and human internals cannot be. So we show internal struggle by external means.

What I celebrate is another man, Clint Eastwood. Now here is a man well past the time he could relax, making significant films. This is not complex like ""Mystic River,"" nor as cheaply mawkish as ""Million Dollar Baby."" It is in between. But it is — if I recall — the first time Clint has shown mass movement. Here he uses Morgan Freeman in ways that Morgan has a hard time cheapening the thing.

Photographing moving team sports like football, soccer and basketball is something of a challenge. You have to make decisions about what role the camera plays. Dance is a similar challenge, but you have more flexibility because the tradition in theater is to break the walls and engage. In sport, the barrier between player and watcher is sacrosanct. The drama depends on you investing in the game; the fiction that the players represent you is tangible.

But it equally depends on you being remote, whether in a stadium or in an upholstered chair in your home. That distance makes the business work. It allows representation without inclusion, because the viewer gets the pleasure of having someone else do his work for him. It has to be explicit that it is someone else.

So the camera cannot take the viewer into the game as a participant. It has to always be a watcher. But how to do so, staying within the carefully evolved confines of watcherdom and still give us some greater immediacy? Eastwood finds a balance. He relies a bit too much on the camera on the ground, looking into the locked players for me. But he strikes a better balance than say Oliver Stone does in ""Any Given Sunday,"" which is basically a war movie without death.

Eastwood. Building a legacy, one small but well crafted film at a time. Who among us ever suspected that this fellow, with no film school, no real musical training, would become one of our most practiced directors and film musicians.

Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",
4 February 2012,A powerful story,"This is the story of how South Africa came together. After the Apartheid and years in prison for roughly 20 years Nelson Mandela comes out then gets elected to President. But instead of trying to get payback against his enemies he puts the past in the past and tries to bring all the people of South Africa together as one. To do this he believes that having the Springbosk the nickname of the South Africa national rugby win the Rugby World Cup that was being hosted in their country that year.

The rugby game scenes are truly well shot and put together scenes that really make you sit on the edge of your seat with anticipation of what'll happen next.

4 August 2010,Dripping in Good Intentions; Lacking Anything That Would Actually Make It Entertaining,"An example of what happens when good intentions kill a movie dead.

Clint Eastwood's ""Invictus"" is tasteful, reverent and serious, all qualities that would make for a great funeral eulogy but which do not necessarily make for riveting filmmaking. Morgan Freeman plays South African president Nelson Mandela capably and actually manages to avoid turning him into a wax-work version of the real-life figure, a trap another actor might have fallen into. But Eastwood's film is thuddingly boring, not translating one ounce of the inspirational vigor this story should.

The final half hour or so of the film depicts a famous rugby match that saw the South African team win the world cup, a victory in which Mandela had the foresight to see an opportunity to unite South Africans in a moment of national pride. But the game itself is edited poorly, simply showing random bouts of action interspersed with reaction shots from spectators, so that we never know where we are in the game, what any one play means, or even that the game is close to being over until it actually is. And Eastwood should have his rights to use slow motion revoked forever -- the device is used so relentlessly during the film's climax that it almost becomes a parody.

Matt Damon tackles a South African accent as captain of the rugby team. Damon is a fine actor, but how he managed to get nominated for an Academy Award for this performance is beyond me.

""Invictus"" has all the excitement of a high school civics textbook.

13 October 2010,Inspiring. A country wishing for greatness.,"As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning, I can tell you you the entertaining, inspiring and enjoyable ""Invictus"" exceeded all my expectations.

It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.

I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

28 February 2010,Inspiring and entertaining,"Invictus tells the story of how Nelson Mandela (Freeman) join South Africa's rugby team captain Francois Pienaar (Damon) to help unite their country through Rugby's World Cup and making them world champions. This is a very enjoyable movie. It has the exactly amount of drama without falling into something corny. The story is quite interesting, it catches you from the very beginning and the plot is very well developed and the addition of original footage gives the movie a sense of reality. Although the rhythm is a bit slow, the film never turns tiresome or boring. Directed by Clint Eastwood, he really manage to tell us an inspiring story without to much pretensions The cast is just wonderful. Morgan Freeman is Nelson Mandela, his performance is simply flawless, Matt Damon in the role of Francois Pienaar is very convincing and the secondary roles of Tony Kgoroge (Jason Tshabalala), Patrick Mofokeng ( Linga Moonsamy), Matt Stern (Hendrick Booyens), Julian Lewis Jones (Etienne Feyder), Adjoa Andoh (Brenda Mazibuko), Marguerite Wheatley (Nerine) and Leleti Khumalo (Mary) were of very good help to the development of the movie.

22 December 2009,A superb movie about the power of personal character to influence a nation,"Don't miss this inspiring movie! The acting is superb. Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon become their characters. The attitudes of Damon's family help to exemplify the resistance to change. The attitudes of the South African blacks toward the mostly white South African rugby team reflects the deeply held anger of people who have suffered repression for generations.

The movie is a testament to the power of courageous personal character, when it is grounded in respectfulness and pragmatism, to inspire others to change attitudes that are deeply held.

The use of rugby as a tool to effect change is most appropriate. Clearly, everyone in the country cares deeply about the sport. The sport itself is quite brutal. Clint Eastwood does a superb job of conveying this element of the sport, as well as the importance of attitude in influencing a team's performance.",10
13 March 2023,"""Invictus"" divides its forces into two fronts and, unfortunately, becomes less potent than it could have been. if only one side of the coin was chosen (preferably Mandela)","The plot takes us back to the early 1990s, when Mandela was released from prison after being incarcerated for over 30 years. The opening scene is a competent summary of the Apartheid years, showing the division between whites and blacks, the latter playing football in a vacant lot, while the former, rugby in a green field. The progression of facts is fast, but quite explanatory and even exciting. Mandela's speeches, delivered by Morgan Freeman, are of a poignant intensity, and the first few minutes already catch the viewer with a lump in the throat.

Four years later, presidential elections take place in South Africa and Mandela is elected. The first point that the new ruler wants to change in the country is the separation between whites and blacks. Not with small revenge on the people who oppressed them for so many years, but with the idea that dialogue and understanding can make everyone live in harmony. One of his first actions is to assemble a multiracial security team, which will accompany him in all his appointments. This idea is rejected by the head of security, Jason (Tony Kgoroge), who, however, ends up being persuaded by the president himself. Realizing that rugby is a game very dear to the population, but that the crowd is divided between whites, Springbok fans, and blacks, fans of any other rival team, Mandela decides to ask the captain of the team, François Pienaar (Matt Damon), for a special attention with the World Cup, an event that will be hosted in the country soon. Mandela believes that a championship victory could bring the population together at last.

From a political point of view, ""Invictus"" is frighteningly naive: summing up Mandela's political initiatives to his involvement with the rugby team (his other commitments as a statesman, including a speech at the UN, are always viewed with disinterest by Eastwood), the film resorts to crude contrasts between the beginning and end of the narrative in order to try to demonstrate the effectiveness of the President's strategy. Thus, if at the beginning Mandela is booed by part of the public that is in the stadium, later he is received with shouts of ""Nelson! Nelson! Nelson!"", while a boy who refused to accept a shirt from the national team is eventually seen cheering for it - and if these examples already sound terribly artificial, they don't even compare to the embarrassing shot in which we see several white police officers carrying a little black boy as they celebrate a South African victory, in one of the film's most pathetic scenes. The script signed by Anthony Peckham (Sherlock Holmes, 2009), which completely forgets all the other attitudes that Mandela took to make South Africa evolve as a country. It wasn't just support for rugby that caused the population to let down its guard to racial prejudice. Certainly, other measures were taken, but never shown on the scene. It is true that the film is, after all, about sport, but certainly more details about the politics of the wise Mandela would enrich the narrative, giving a better portrait of that time. But that wasn't the point, apparently.

In any case, ""Invictus"" at least has some moments of subtlety that, if they don't balance the artificiality of most of the narrative, at least avoid major embarrassments: it is interesting to note, for example, how François speaks in Afrikaans with a white maid of Mandela not realizing that this is an insult to the President (who, in turn, pretends not to notice) - and Eastwood is to be commended for not trying to draw the viewer's attention to what is happening, leaving it up to us to perceive for ourselves (or not) the gaffe committed by the athlete. In the same way, when one of Mandela's black bodyguards finds himself facing a white colleague he doesn't know, his initial impulse (asking if he ""is under arrest"") is revealing and touching, demonstrating his conditioning to decades of oppression and injustice. Finally, the sequence involving a tour of the national team through an impoverished region of the country is something that moves without exaggeration, while at the same time illustrating the President's intelligent double strategy, which shocks the athletes with reality while bringing the population closer together. Of team.

As for the cast, it's no surprise that Morgan Freeman, Matt Damon and the rest of the cast are so inspired by their roles. Freeman, a friend of Mandela, had been trying to bring the life of the former president of South Africa to the cinema for years. After many unsuccessful attempts, the actor decided on the cut of the Rugby World Cup. Knowing this, it is easy to understand the vigor of an actor when interpreting Mandela, given the preparation and anticipation of his desire. An actor more than used to playing authority figures and characters whose wisdom is notorious (from God to the President of the USA, he has embodied all kinds of leaders), Freeman lends his immense charisma and his powerful and evocative voice to Mandela, pronouncing the words in a careful cadence that not only refers to the enunciation of the man he is incarnating, but also suggests a fundamental caution and intelligence for that man to be able to carry out his difficult functions of guiding a country divided by prejudice and poverty.

At the same time, the actor seeks to avoid deifying the subject, also portraying his loneliness, his sense of humor and his occasional insecurities. To emphasize this effort, by the way, another character goes so far as to comment that Mandela ""is not a saint, but just a man"", which seems to be an obvious attempt by the film not to become a hagiography - which would be commendable if the script itself do not take it upon yourself to, in the scene immediately following this speech, bring Mandela waiving a third of his salary because he considers it too high. Still, Freeman manages to create a figure that, while not being multidimensional or particularly complex (which is a shame), is far from caricature due to his restrained and balanced performance.

Matt Damon, another talented performer, is less fortunate, as his François Pienaar is never satisfactorily developed by the script - and it becomes even difficult to understand why the role required a star of Damon's stature, as it offers no opportunity to prominence, revealing himself as a lackluster athlete and a captain without much leadership ability. Anyway, the actor does what he can, deserving credit at least for his physical transformation and his accent. It is curious to observe how the star understands each different moment of that character, showing a shy silence in his day-to-day life, but abundant strength and determination while on the field. Pienaar's place is in the stadium, playing alongside his teammates. Any other location makes you uncomfortable. The interpreter's body expression represents this, especially if we notice how out of place he appears to be at home and how much master of himself he feels when commanding his companions.

The production gains real strength in its second hour, when it turns to clashes between the Springbok and their opponents in the World Cup. Eastwood is competent in managing to mix the brutality of the matches with the emotion and beauty of a game in the stadium. It is impressive to watch the players' movements so closely and to witness, on the big screen, emblematic moments of the matches - as is the case of the New Zealand Haka, a Maori ritual that precedes each All-Blacks game and that is captured with all the importance it deserves by the film-maker. On the other hand, Eastwood practically limits himself to some panoramic shots and mid-range shots, always opting for more closed shots that favor interpretations. He ends up exaggerating the use of slow motion - especially in the final game -, also making mistakes in the inorganic flashbacks that seek to do the unnecessary job of sending the viewer back to the period in which the protagonist was imprisoned. As if that were not enough, the filmmaker is dishonest when trying to create a cheap suspense in two specific moments: when accompanying a van that moves towards Mandela and when focusing on the somber expression of a pilot who commands a plane over the stadium in which the President is found - and the impression we get is that, lacking a real threat present in the script, Eastwood felt compelled to artificially include it through the direction.

The film's intentions are the best. And even though some of the most impressive/remarkable sequences were filmed in a stadium like Ellis Park, one of the most traditional and important in the country, the film lacks a better exploration of Mandela's story. The positive point of this story, and what it serves for us, if we consider football, or for other countries, taking into account their outstanding sports, is that of showing the ability of athletes to overcome themselves and, with their struggle, inspire and move to others. However, the film ends up getting a little tired due to some rugby sequences that are too long - which, probably, will only completely please fans of the sport. By seeking this balance between the ""heroism"" of a political leader and the act of bravery of athletes who knew how to reflect their quest for the union of a country, Invictus divides its forces into two fronts and, unfortunately, becomes less potent than it could have been. If only one side of the coin was chosen (preferably Mandela). Unfortunately, it is these small sins that put Invictus a notch below the filmmaker's previous works, such as Gran Torino (2008), Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) and Mystic River (2003). Those who think that Invictus is a biography of Nelson Mandela are mistaken. The protagonist of Invictus is the South African people demonstrated through rugby, and of course, a small part of the life trajectory of the Great Man that was Nelson Mandela. Too bad it didn't have as big an impact as it deserved.",6

13 December 2009,Political Football,"Greetings again from the darkness. I have said many times over the past few years that Clint Eastwood is the classiest filmmaker working today. We can always count on his films to be technically well made, interesting and entertaining. Invictus is no exception. What it's not is a classic film, or even one of Clint's best. Nonetheless, it is worth seeing from a historical standpoint as well as for Morgan Freeman's fine performance.

The dialogue is sprinkled with many of Nelson Mandela's own words and the story is based on the book by John Carlin. Without a doubt, the best parts of the film are those showing Mr. Freeman portraying Mr. Mandela ""behind the scenes"" ... whether in his office or spouting his amazing philosophy to his security crew. Whatever your politics, Mr. Mandela was a fascinating man who survived an excruciating ordeal (for almost 30 years). For his mind, body and spirit to survive is reason enough to learn more about him as a man (warts and all).

The weakest part of the movie is the enormous amount of rugby time we are forced to watch. Most of the scenes/plays are staged and filmed in tight shots so as not to expose the weakness of the game or actors. Unfortunately, this makes up a huge portion of this overly long film. Obviously the rugby story line is historical and a story worth telling, but the film would have been more impactful with more Mandella musings and less fake Matt Damon rugby.

As always, Clint's film score is perfect. The only shocking moment was the terrible song playing as Mandela's helicopter lands on the practice field. It was an inexcusable MTV moment from a master. Otherwise, a film to see, though not necessarily one to adore.",7
20 December 2009,Good Enough Sports Pic; Good Enough Political Bio-Pic,"""Invictus"" is a good enough sports movie and a good enough political bio-pic, but not more than that. Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman. I really need to see him play against type at least once. Maybe a male prostitute or something. Here he does what he always does, lately: play the stately elder who mentors usually white youths. Matt Damon is surprisingly good as a real life rugby player, Francois Pienaar, who, as a google image search quickly reveals, was much larger and more ferocious looking than Damon. Damon's South African accent is good, but, in the end, he's given little to do. The rugby scenes are appropriately inspirational.

The film's weak points are many. There are too many scenes of Nelson Mandela being handed paperwork by his lovely aid, signing the paperwork, and handing it back to his lovely aid. There is no appreciation of the South African landscape, or even Cape Town, one of the most spectacularly situated cities on earth. Nothing new is achieved in the field of filmed sports. If Clint Eastwood wanted to create a film with no memorable, arresting visual images, he certainly did. The film presents the situation in South Africa as black or white, and it's much more complicated than that. For example, Afrikaner settlement in predates Zulu settlement; and majority vote has been followed by very high crime rates, including utterly horrendous rape rates.",7
22 January 2010,"Clunky, chunky, cliché... I had to turn it off","I didn't begin watching ""Invictus"" with any hopes of seeing something unique, edgy or original -- after all, a bare sketch of the plot tells you this is another of the ""Can-the-sports-team-make-it-against-the-odds? Oh-it-will-be-tough-but-in-the-end they'll-all-be-better-people-because-of-the-struggle"" genre.

I had hopes that with Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, it might rise above the cliché formula. No, it didn't. They are both OK, but not nearly OK enough to save this clunker.

The level of Hollywood formula is off the charts. Every camera angle, every scene, you can predict with startling accuracy. That doesn't necessarily have to doom a movie (although for me, it pretty much does, because I hate nothing so much as predictability, especially scene by scene), but here it's just so pat you wonder if Clint Eastwood was sleeping through the whole thing.

What really sunk this film for me, though -- I mean, I rarely ever turn off a movie, and I could only handle this one for 20 minutes, after which I used FF and skimmed a few scenes along the way to see it through to the 'exciting' conclusion -- was the incredibly awful dialogue. Awful. Stilted. Ham-fisted. Sounded like a bad Hallmark afterschool special writer had come up with it. Really really bad.

I like Morgan Freeman a lot. In fact, in the past, I had jokingly said to friends that I could listen to him read the telephone book because I like the way he delivers lines. I am reconsidering that joke. ""We must (pause) work together (pause) if we are (pause) going to (pause) rebuild our country."" Repeat that line about 80 times in the first 15 minutes. With the same awkward pauses. Maybe this was Freeman capturing Mandela really well -- I don't know. What I do know is it was awful to try to watch.

In any case, let me submit for your consideration that you save your time. If you read the plot synopsis and look at the poster, you'll already have as full an experience as this movie is capable of delivering.",2
28 January 2010,It is so much more thought provoking and politically aware than it may seem on the surface,"As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning, I can tell you you the entertaining, inspiring and enjoyable ""Invictus"" exceeded all my expectations.

It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.

I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

Viva Clint Eastwood, viva Morgan Freeman, viva Madiba.

PS. I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.

Of the films Eastwood has directed, my favorites, in no particular order, are ""Unforgiven"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Gran Torino"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"",""Bird"" and ""Invictus"". Yes, it's really that good. ""Invictus"" is another winner from Clint. He just seems to get better with age. What a creative roll he is currently on.

PPS. ""Invictus"" is one of the best sporting movies I have ever seen. But it's also about more than sport.",8
25 June 2010,Inspirational!,"This is a really fantastic film made right by the amazing Clint Eastwood and the amazing Morgan Freeman. They both add a classic to their already legendary film careers. Matt Damon deserves some kudos for this movie too. This movie is very inspirational. This movie should inspire other people to be like Nelson Mandela in this film.

This movie takes place when Mandela is released from prison and takes office as President of South Africa. He supports the Springboks rugby team when no one else does. He tells them to win it all at the World Cup. He wants them to win so the country can unite with each other.

The acting is fantastic. I wanted Morgan Freeman to win the Oscar so bad but some girl won instead. Matt Damon proves that he's a great actor.

I am not a fan of rugby but I saw this film just to see Morgan Freeman and the brilliant directing of Clint Eastwood. This is an amazing film. I rate this movie 10/10.",10
30 December 2009,"Outstanding Film, High Standard entertainment, Clint Scores a try Here!","this for me is clint eastwoods best ever film as director. this film is a real winner, great performance by Morgan Freeman as mandela and indeed by matt Damon as Francois Pinaar the South African Rugby captain. This is a classier version of another sporting movie I saw a year or so ago (Goal II) which deserved something but got nothing. There is so much about this film that you will enjoy and you don't have to be a Rugby fan to enjoy it (or to understand the rules of Rugby because they are explained for you (and mandela) briefly in the movie.

I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.

I have seen this movie shortly after seeing (End Game) (about how mandela was catapulted into power)and The Blind Side (which has nothing to do with this movie at all except it deals with blacks and whites in sport and has a sporting theme re American football).

The PLAYERS trip to mandelas cell on the eve of the big match and the plane flying over the stadium are great moments and even the little quieter moments of the coloured maid in the Pinaar family household was dramatic and well handled.

There was nothing bad in this movie, lots of predictability but those who knew the result of the 1995 Final wont be in any way disappointed. We all love Lomu, even the English. The mixing of the real and alternative action smacked of Goal II, hence my reference to that and Eastwood must have got his ideas from that film to use the filming and the commentaries etc.

I lost the film a bit on the new South African anthem which the players rejected to sing and I certainly would have liked to have seen scenes of how patriotic the players really were in the build up to the matches, especially the final. what we saw and focused on was mandela greeting the players.

Clearly, as mandela was used in 'End Game', mandela himself was using the World Cup and Pinaar as a political vehicle to unite his country and sport. If there was a weakness, it was that pinaars character was not researched enough and was too shallow and perhaps Freeman overplayed the Mandela intentions, but the film works and it is a wonderful film to watch, even when the credits are coming up, stay till the very end because the very end is as important as the beginning.",9
20 September 2010,Not much to say about such tame film-making.,"INVICTUS is a major disappointment from Clint Eastwood, and the film doesn't add much to his great achievements of his latter directional career. It's sadly tame, and doesn't seem very inspired, and all of the rawness and emotional impact we've befriended Eastwood with lately is all gone. Morgan Freeman plays it straight as Nelson Mandela, and as he's become one of the modern world's ""untouchables"" we never get under his skin much more than we'd get from watching another news clip of him, and when it comes to Matt Damon's stale performance, there's really not much to say. The film is all done with an assured hand, and it's all neat and comfortable, and so it feels like it's directed by Ron Howard, and that's not a good thing.

20 February 2010,"A ""solid"" film that condenses the tournament and the importance thereof, but nothing more than that","I read recently an article that had Eastwood talking about the Oscar ""snub"" in regards best film and best director for Invictus. He talked about having been awarded loads so it was just not his time and the article also included Freeman saying his chances of winning off his best actor nomination as being ""slim to none"". At no point during the article did anyone involved say anything like ""you know what, Invictus is a sturdy film and a decent enough way to spend two or so hours but in terms of saying it is the best anything then that's really pushing it and if we're being honest even the best actor nod is a bit of a joke – although if there was an Oscar for best rugby film then yeah, we'd have that in the bag"". Although that would have made for a terrible sound bite, at least it would have been honest because this is perfectly true and the lack of awards should surprise nobody – Invictus simply isn't a film that deserves to be held up for time as the ""best"" at anything it tries to do.

At this point let me stress that it is not a bad film – not at all. It is a solid attempt to do a sports movie that sums up the rugby world cup while also capturing the cultural significance of that event; and being able to pull off even one of those would have been impressive. As it is, it makes a good fist at both, good enough to be able to make for a study and pretty entertaining film but at the same time it doesn't do either well enough to hit home or to be worthy of really sticking in the memory as a film (which to me is more of an accolade than whatever they happen to give a little statue to this year). On the sports side I thought that the film did a pretty poor job of conveying the excitement and the tension of the tournament. This was perhaps understandable in a two-hour film and the focus was rightly put on the final with New Zealand. However this game was then delivered without a great deal of passion of heart (or at least not much that translated well to the viewer in the way great sports movies do). What it seemed to be doing is using slow-motion and music to hark to the great importance of the game rather than the specific tensions of the moment, and this puts the onus on the other side of the film to deliver.

In this regard the same is true – close, but not cigar. The task of summarising a sea-change in a county is not easy one and Invictus makes as good a go at it as one could fairly expect. However this is not the same as saying it gets it, because it doesn't quite get there. The script really has to boil stuff down to the essentials to make it fit into a film and in doing this it really has to simplify things to the point where there is lots of explanatory dialogue, which is forgivable about the matches perhaps but it does get a bit much to have the political challenges in South Africa treated this way. These two short-comings (for this is what they are rather than failings) both combine to produce a film that is ""OK"" and is about as good as it is fair to expect given the subject matter and the approach.

In terms of DVD sales, the film now has its ""nominated for Oscar"" heading for the cover although I half agree with Freeman in his summation of winning – I agree they are none. His nomination is for his character more than him because his performance is weak. His accent is OK at times and awful at others and his attempts to get Mandela via body language and the famous smile doesn't come off because both feel a little forced, like a man doing an impression. Funnily enough this is good enough for the material but it is only an ""OK"" performance. Damon is better in terms of accent and performance although he has the same material and there is only so much there for him. The cast beyond these two are solid and nobody is ""bad"" by any means. Eastwood directs in a solid and professional manner but, like the material, it is perhaps all too obvious and predictable. The only really bad aspect of the film I thought was the selection of soundtrack – the songs used are regularly either ""stock African music"" or some awful ballads designed to try and wring emotion out of the viewer when the film itself is not – I thought the music was terrible throughout and had the opposite effect of what it was aiming for.

I sound very negative but I did actually like Invictus – but note the choice of word in ""like"". It is good enough to ""like"" and it is good enough to quite enjoy while it is on. It falls short in all it tries to do and while it sort of does a sports movie and captures the importance of the sport it doesn't do it that well and it really fails to translate this to the audience. Solid enough to be worth a watch (you won't curse the time you spent) but not good enough to be more than a ""likeable"" film.",
30 December 2009,This South Africa story kicks (u know what)!,"I invite everyone to witness the inspiring human factors of the brilliant film ""Invictus"". The narrative is based on real life events in South Africa during the mid 90's. During that time, newly elected South African President Nelson Mandela tried to pull the rug out of the carpet by taking a keen interest in the country's mostly-white Rugby team in hopes of uniting a post-apartheid South Africa; and that is as clear as black & white during the movie. Mandela unites with the team's captain Francois Pienaar to fulfill this, and their scenes together is the apex of the film's supremacy. To this day, Nelson is one cool rocking fellow! Morgan Freeman's superb performance as Mandela was not an imitation but a personification of one of history's most respected leaders. Freeman plays the recently freeman Mandela of the 90's with precise authenticity. Matt Damon was captivating as Pienaar, and his Mandela-inspired capitan character scored high points thanks to Mr. D's brilliant work. But the ultimate human factor of ""Invictus"" was the exceptional direction of the legendary Clint Eastwood; it never ceases to amaze me how he continues to be so good, so baaadass, but never ugly in his career's twilight time. The Richness of Eastwood strikes again. Anthony Peckham's screenplay was infiltrated with typical sports & humane clichés, but it did not peck away from the film's central goodwill focus. I will also not evict Tom Stern's cinematography and Tom Hannam's art direction from the ""Invictus"" cinematic goodwill house anytime soon; I was dazzled by their meticulous efforts on the film's look. So unite and free yourself from the oppressions of boredom and visit ""Invictus"" today! ***** Excellent",9

3 January 2010,An amazing journey to touch everyone's heart,"This film is about Nelson Mandela and his ques to unit his country with an unconventional but winning method.

""Invictus"" is astounding. Through an excellent plot and strong story telling, it is very engaging throughout the entire film. The first half of the film focuses on the devastating effects of racial segregation, and I am happy to see the changes of these people shown at the end. It feels like no loose ends are left, every single scene in the beginning is catered for at the end. And I do not recall any sports scene that grabs my attention like the final scene, as if I was experiencing the match passionately in the venue. Only Clint Eastwood can make a rugby match last for 30 minutes and make it suspenseful all the way. Even the minutes of cheering at the end does not feel a bore, bu help to consolidate the mighty high emotions. I am very touched by the ending, as it is so well made. Sound and visual effects all help to lift viewers' spirits to the highest level. Clint Eastwood excels again at making and uplifting and touching drama.

15 January 2010,Eastwood hits another cinematic homerun,"Since the movie tells a true story, no need for me to go into the detail here, as all roads lead to a culminating World Cup event... in Johannesburg and including the South African rugby team. It's fabulous and uplifting, even a bit of a tearjerker. Eastwood is so good with little directorial touches, such as when a tough security guy for the De Klerk regimenow a welcome member of the Mandela security staffslaps on his sunglasses to conceal moist eyes... or as the World Cup final proceeds, a little black street boy, who would formerly be chased away by white police, is seen sitting on the car of the police, everyone intently listening to the car radio. And musically, the film is one of the more interesting you'll have the pleasure of hearing. As many realize, Clint Eastwood is quite an accomplished composer himself, having written and in some cases performed the scores for some of the movies he directs. I think with Invictus, he's a kid in a candy store. The melodies and rhythms of the native South African music are so rich and fluid, they roll out naturally without blasting you into the balcony. Whoever did the scoreno doubt Eastwood had a sayskillfully weaves sound with sight. It's great... and I don't generally pay much attention to movie scores.",10
16 June 2010,A Class Act on a Grand Scale,"Based upon a true story.

After almost 30 years of imprisonment, Nelson Mandela (Freeman) becomes President of South Africa and makes it his mission to forgive his suppressors and to unite the country, both black and white, through the sport of Rugby.

Rugby. Almost like American football except there don't appear to be many rules, no pads, no helmets, no instant replay, no forward pass and no cheerleaders. Bummer.

Invictus is a poem by William Ernest Henley and the last two lines sum up everything: I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul. Mandela used the poem to not give in or give up to anything while he was in prison regardless of the hardships he endured there.

This is a class act on a grand scale and may be Clint Eastwood's most important film. Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon deserved the Oscar nominations as they and the entire cast were outstanding.

Maybe the concentration on Rugby was too much and nothing was mentioned about the other duties of the new South African government, but President Mandela needed to unify the country before he could feel confident the whole country was behind him on other matters. It worked. He and the South Africans win. Wouldn't it be nice if nations could use sports to vent whatever they feel they need to vent. And, if they lose, well, there's always next year.

We didn't get any insight into Mandela's daughter who couldn't get over the white South Africans as also part of the new government. She kept remembering that they were the ones who threw the Mandela family out of their house. After the Rugby match, did she see the wisdom of what President Mandela accomplished with Rugby? This was not addressed.

Nevermind playing Rugby, watching parts of a Rugby game in a movie isn't easy either, you know. I did some damage to my knee and right elbow watching some of the hits. I could become a Rugby fan if they had more rules, pads, helmets, instant replay, the forward pass and, of course, cheerleaders (but, Bob, that's American Football). Exactly.

Violence: Yes, Rugby is a violent game. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Believe I only heard one F-bomb",10
21 February 2010,Deserves a second glance,"Two-time Oscar Best Director winner Clint Eastwood (Million Dollar Baby, Unforgiven) adapts for the screen John Carlin's book ""Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation"" with ""Invictus"".

In another Oscar nominated role as Nelson Mandela, Oscar Best Supporting Actor winner Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby) portrays the South African President who, in his first term, starts a curious campaign to unify the country torn apart by racism by supporting the mostly white national rugby team to win the 1995 World Cup. Oscar Best Screenplay winner Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting) is also nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar for his role as rugby team captain Francois Pienaar, who becomes Mandela's unlikely partner.

Eastwood tells this story like he's told his other movie gems: deliberately, bordering on overlong. He takes his time to explore each character and he often appeals to great emotion. Mandela is presented as 'a man, not a saint', touching painfully on his separation from his wife and estrangement from his daughter.

It's difficult not to like an underdog plot for a film, especially as a Filipino moviegoer such as myself who immediately latches on to parallelisms with South Africa's poverty and need for a strong leader, how rugby has served as an inspiring metaphor for unity just like our own boxing champ Manny Pacquiao has decreased crime rates whenever a match of his is on.

""Invictus"" isn't something the average escapist moviegoer will camp out to see; frankly, it sounds boring. After all, the title is of a poem most highschoolers have had to memorize and so may regard this as a 'required viewing' sort of flick. But whether or not you still remember the lines to the poem that aptly inspired Mandela's 'unconquerable soul', revisit it in context with a glimpse of the actual cell where Mandela stayed for almost 30 years and marvel how despite that experience, he is able to forgive his oppressors, something that is crucial to his goal of unity for his country. (If that still doesn't grab you, at least watch out for Eastwood's son Scott, who delivers the final kicks for the Springboks in their game against New Zealand.)",8
3 November 2010,The Rainbow Nation starts here. Reconciliation starts here.,"Directed by Clint Eastwood, and starring the incomparable Morgan Freeman, with outstanding support from Mat Damon, this is the tale of you unite a country.

Mandela (Freeman) was not focused on the past. he wanted to create a new nation. A nation united. Sports is one way to go about it. He felt that the country could unite behind a winning sports team, in this case Rugby.

Sport will not solve all the country's problems, but it can unite the people to work together and forget the past. Mandela knew this.

An inspirational film by Eastwood that is one of the best sports films ever.

2 January 2010,"Seriously, the movie is mediocre...","I think the movie didn't tell a story more than what we could get from reading its screenplay, which means the editing, the cinematography, the acting and the direction are lousy, if not meaningless...

The lines were poorly written, and some of which were so plain that they could sound so similar to a speech made by Japan's Emporer...I don't know why Morgan Freeman was nominated as the best actor (drama) for Gloden Globes, but I surely know he won't get it...His performance loses what we expected to see in his past movies, especially that sense of humor. He tried to make his role a complete and true one, but this endeavor possibly gives him too little room to exert his acting skills and instead makes him talk, stand and sit like a puppet...

Clint Eastwood, though always somewhat politically correct, failed to make an ""artistically enjoyable"" movie this time. He should have added more personal understanding or critical argument in the movie, but he chose to make it something that you can read from a textbook. Why should people go to buy a ticket to read a textbook? People expect to see more of the famous figure in a movie, to know more than being told...It is the director's responsibility to achieve the goals, but Eastwood apparently forgot this...

Matt Damon is good for his performance, generally...I mean at least no fault could be found. But also, when everything turned to be so plain in the movie, for instance the editing, the cinematography and the lines, an actor's performance really didn't matter so much...

I truly doubt, when judged on Oscar level, that this movie could get any nomination...even including the best actor...",4
16 March 2011,"It's not about winning the game, it is about how you play it that really counts","In ""Invictus"" Clint Eastwood takes us back to a divided South Africa of the post-Apartheid after Nelson Mandela's being elected President and making a new government, the first one elected by the people. And it is in this fragile nation with enormous tense between South-Africans and English South-Africans that a political game and a rugby game will be decisive for the country's union.

Morgan Freeman, perfect as Mandela, is the elected leader trying to unite a divided country by making a unconventional choice by supporting South Africa rugby team during the Rugby's World Cup, at one time known for its racist songs while playing during the Apartheid; and now they are a failed team led by captain François Pienaar (Matt Damon) and a team composed in its majority of white players, and where the only adored star of the team is a black player loved by many fans.

Mandela knows that only changing the laws and building things are not enough to make a different and better country, opposite to the one he only knew behind bars for almost thirty years. He needs to join forces and show to everyone he's the right guy on command and that things can be worked for better. His alliance with Pienaar is a brilliant strategy, he teaches to the captain of the team valuable things on the importance that rugby has on the country (but only if they win because that brings a little bit of closeness between people, everyone together for one cause, and Mandela is promoting a new country to the world showing that a black President is as much as good as a white one) and Pienaar tries to risen up the moral of a broken team, playing his game efficiently.

The positive, different and unique strategy used by Mandela worked perfectly, and not only his ability in working with the team and the results they got in the nation, but also he calmed the tension between the former members of the secret service (white), and his personal security (black) who didn't get along right from the start of the new government. In the end, it doesn't matter winning the game, whether the political game or the rugby game, it's all about play it and stick it to the end that really counts, that really makes the difference. Many other politicians used of weapons and false propaganda's to spread terrible messages or evil ways to built a better nation, but here we see a man, almost alone, that used his power and presence to bring together something that was faded to be shattered forever.

Two spectacular performances by Damon and Freeman made of ""Invictus"" a really great picture, that also has a magnificent screenplay joining together a real event story with a sport themed film (with a exciting final match in the last part). Eastwood's unusual choice of film to direct proved to be a excellent and beautiful choice, an nice inspiring film these days, very very rare to find. It is a outstanding work but it should have gather more audiences, it looks like that people turned their backs from this precious gem. This is a example of what movies should be, giving some great, positive and realistic examples without preaching or selling an idea. It speaks higher and shows much more than you can think of. 10/10",10
19 December 2009,"Eastwood, Freeman and Damon equals BOREFEST","Not only does this movie lack excitement of any kind, it dumbs down the apartheid issue, among others, to some silly game that nobody cares about. What on earth is Eastwood thinking here? It's like he has become a preacher, it's a total sermon instead of a story, one could not find this interesting even if it had Eastwood come out at the end running across the field with his .44 magnum shooting at Freeman while he blocked the rounds with Damon's ball. Just a waste of over 2hours. If one is going to tell a story, tell it like you mean it. This is a movie about sports, not life! Very disappointed, the ending was like a long drawn out conversation with a dirty wall. One of Eastwood's worst! How this is getting ratings of 7.5 I have no idea.

26 December 2009,"Good and effective, great performances, but generally run-of-the-mill","For the past decade or so, Clint Eastwood has had one of the most consistently high-quality outputs out of any director working today – and aside from Robert Altman and maybe one or two more earlier in the decade, he is also the oldest one of the bunch. It was an absolute treat to see a director reach the twilight of his career and bloom with the vitality and energy of a young director just getting his big break. Eastwood's films this past decade have been big, potent epics of emotion, from the Shakespearian characters in Mystic River to the down-and-dirty determinists in Million Dollar Baby to the subtle honor of the stars of Letters from Iwo Jima. Eastwood was always so careful in selecting his powerful, dramatic subjects over the past few years – which is why the vanilla-coated glossiness of Invictus seems completely out of place in his oeuvre.

The strongest aspect of this film is without a doubt the cast. To Eastwood's credit, subject matter like this – big, epic historical biopics – do usually tend to ham it up when it comes to acting and very often enter the level of theatrics and over-performing. Luckily, Eastwood is at least too smart to fall into that trap, and both lead actors in the film – Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, who actually plays more of a supporting character, but no matter – deliver quite subtle and yet totally effective performances, despite the fact that they are playing larger-than-life characters with real-world counterparts. This renders the performances less bombastic and showy than what has come to be expected from these types of roles – I especially expected Freeman to turn this into one of those ""roles of a lifetime"" things – but they are still emotionally powerful and admirably subtle turns from two of our greatest actors, especially Damon who is most effective and one of the most underrated performers working today.

As to the film itself, it's not that it's bad in any way; it's a really good and effective drama that depicts an important event in world history and covers a lot of emotional and political ground in a very simple and concise premise. There are some truly powerful scenes – such as the first time Freeman's Nelson Mandela steps onto the Rugby field and is met with a pretty noticeably equal mix of cheers and boos from the crowd. My one real problem with the film is that it takes a very important and complicated political atmosphere – post-Apartheid South Africa and the reconciliation efforts on the part of Nelson Mandela to bring the blacks and the whites together and to unify his country – and just blatantly over-simplifies it and sugarcoats it. And I think that the screenplay is to blame: its lack of harmony and emotional balance is really noticeable. I felt that scenes depicting the racial tension suffered from the ""Crash"" effect: put the problems so dead center – and solved them so easily and without too much suffering – that they never really got the heart of it. I also felt that something was a little off in the rugby scenes: Eastwood has shown a newfound energy and vitality in his recent films, but the scenes depicting the rugby games in the film just felt stiff, and lacked the immediacy of better-edited sequences in the likes of Friday Night Lights. To sum it up, I think that when a science fiction film manages to deal far more seriously and deeply with the same themes as an important historical drama such as this one, something is definitely lacking.",7

26 December 2009,Politics and sports come together decently,"I don't like many of Eastwood's emotionally cloying films like ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Gran Torino"". Emotional harp strings are played frequently in those movies.

Invictus is quite different. The movie is a biopic but it's not a biopic, it's about one part of Mandela's life. It's a very small part, the 1995 Rugby World Cup which was held in South Africa. This is a risky move, but this is in fact better than doing a complete biopic of Mandela's life. I would compare this movie to last year's Frost/Nixon, it's a glimpse of the man's life, a part of his life deemed important not by the man himself but by his biographers.

Freeman is quite good but his accent is a bit flaky at times. Damon is alright as well but he doesn't have much to work with here as the captain of the South Africa Rugby squad. A lot of it is working up his teammates and convincing them that there is a political purpose behind their team winning.

There is still some manipulation here as there always in Eastwood's films. A plane flies over at one point and the music gets all ominous and tense. Your first thought is 'OH MY GOD, IT'S THE TERRORISTS' but it's subterfuge on Eastwood's part, as usual.

The musical score is also quite bad in a few places. Instead of going with a traditional instrumental score, there are bad pieces of modern adult contemporary music.

Overall it's a pretty decent movie and I liked Freeman in his role as Mandela, I can't imagine anyone else really taking on this role. Maybe there is a South African actor out there who could do it. There are South African actors in this movie and it's really quite hard to understand their accent at times.",7

1 April 2011,Sport as a metaphor for life on the largest of stages,"Whatever the problems of modern day South Africa, and there are plenty, the progress that the country has made in the twenty years since Nelson Mandela was released is pretty astonishing. A once pariah nation has taken its rightful place in the community of Nations - not least in sport with its hosting of the three main World Cup tournaments - Rugby, Cricket and Football. The first of these, the Rugby World Cup in 1995, was an act of faith on the part of the international Rugby Union authorities - it could have gone horribly wrong. ""Invictus"" shows why it didn't - from an organisational and security aspect and, more parochially, from the perspective of the new ""Rainbow Nation"" itself.

The premise of the film is that the event was a success because of two men - Mandela himself and the South African rugby captain Francois Pienaar. The former extended the hand of friendship to his once bitter enemies in the rugby mad Afrikaner community. The latter, an Afrikaner himself, not only grabbed his President's offered hand but fought the institutionalised prejudice of his family, his team and his people to argue for the maximum co-operation with their country's first and greatest black leader. Mandela had not only his former jailers to deal with - he also had to persuade his own African people that retribution against the Afrikaners would be counter-productive. For example and well portrayed in the film, he had to convince them that it would be right to continue with the Springbok name and colours for the South African rugby team.

Rugby, as shown in the movie, was a metaphor for the challenge South Africa faced post Apartheid. The game in the republic was exclusively white, elitist and predominantly Afrikaner. It was in many ways a symbol for oppression and separate development - the blacks had soccer on rough ground in the townships. The whites had rugby on manicured grass in great stadia in the cities. Rugby was played behind well-guarded gates of the elite schools. Soccer was played on any old piece of dirt. If the black majority was aware of rugby at all it was to cheer on whoever the Springboks were playing - better England than the hated racists of Afrikanerdom. Nelson Mandela knew that if he was to succeed with the highly sceptical white community post democracy, a community where he was still to many a ""terrorist"", then he needed an ally. This is where Pienaar came in.

Francois Pienaar had inherited, as Captain, a South African rugby team that was low on confidence and despite being the hosts was seen as having little chance in the 1995 World Cup. The media was highly sceptical of the team's prospects and the team itself was struggling to come to terms with the new world of South Africa. When asked to do some coaching in a township they dismissed it as a joke - and were openly contemptuous of the idea that the blacks could even play the game. Pienaar knew that the motor for change could be the charismatic President and Mandela genuinely moved him with his decency and lack of rancour about the past. Asked about his philosophy of leadership Pienaar said that it was ""by example"" - on and off the field. Rather a Mandelan philosophy as well. This approach combined with some astute selections, including Chester Williams, the first black Springbok, meant that South Africa entered the tournament with a fighting chance. A win over favoured Australia in the opening match set the tone and the Springboks made it to the Final. Here they faced a New Zealand team who had eased effortlessly to the Final - not least because they had the awesome giant try-machine Jonah Lomu in their ranks.

The match sequences in ""Invictus"" are arguably the best ever seen in a movie about sport. Even the most knowledgeable rugby aficionado will find nothing to quarrel with about the portrayal of the matches - and the Final, which goes on for five minutes or more, is wonderfully portrayed. It was one of those matches where afterwards the cliché ""You couldn't make it up"" was frequently used. Even though we know the result the tension is extraordinary and the moment when President Mandela appears in a Springbok shirt before the match is surely an iconic moment in history - and not just rugby history. South Africa's win with a drop goal in extra time seems now to be pre-ordained. But that is certainly not how it felt at the time! Whether there is some poetic licence in ""Invictus"" I don't know - perhaps there is. But it has an authentic feel to it throughout from the portrayal of the interpersonal challenges that Mandela and Pienaar faced and overcame through to the match sequences it has the ring of truth about it. It is an uplifting film in every way with truly remarkable performances from Morgan Freeman as Mandela and Matt Damon as Pienaar. These two Americans, along with Director Clint Eastwood, might not know much about rugby, but they clearly knew someone who does. And they certainly know a great story when they see one - and they tell it with sensitivity, feeling and drama.",8
14 February 2010,Political genius!,"Diane and I were both moved by all that we saw during Invictus. I congratulate Eastwood for attempting, what to me, was an unlikely story in that rugby is a sport that few Americans know anything about although it is hugely important here in Australia as well as in New Zealand just across the Tasman. To select a film about a man who is truly the savior of his country and then form the story around an international game was a tremendous gamble but because of Eastwood's command of the film art form, the movie was an amazing visual, emotional and intellectual package. The story of Nelson Mandela is in and of itself easily one of the greatest stories of humanity in and then to wrap that story around something as unlikely as South Africa's participation in a World Cup rugby game speaks volumes about the director's competence as well as that of the script writer, the actors and the original novel from which the story was taken. Very early in the film you are struck by Mandela's political genius; we in the modern world are unused to seeing a person so sensitive to the needs of his country that he can rise above his own needs. We are unused to a person that is so sensitive to the greater movements around him that he can act for that greater need. When you remember that Mandela spent 16 years of his life in prison making little rocks out of big rocks then the enormity of this man's genius is almost beyond comprehension. When he sees what needs to be done and then goes through the motions of trying to make people who can only, because their mind is not equal to his, see their private histories rather than his embracing human view then one is involved in the tension of all that has been reduced to one game of rugby. This movie is transcending and must be watched.",10
25 December 2009,Oscar Time For Morgan Freeman,"Morgan Freeman's poignant and gentle portrayal of Nelson Madela will surely earn him at least an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, if not the Academy Award itself. Having spent most of his career being typecast as, you know, that black detective in all those mystery thrillers, or perhaps the president in a disaster movie, Morgan Freeman finally proves that he can act, and then some, with his rare performance in Invictus. Matt Damon, well, he is right for the part but he might as well be an extra in this Morgan Freeman film. I didn't find out until the closing credits that Invictus is directed by Clint Eastwood. Clint is a brilliant director, no doubt about it. The last half hour or so turns into a sports movie cliché but this is so easily forgiven after receiving the enjoyment of Morgan Freeman's performance. You will laugh; you will cry. Most of all, you will cheer.

22 January 2010,no apologies for the gush,"Today, I overheard someone saying 'I would go to a movie about a door opening if it was directed by Clint Eastwood'.

I feel the same although I am relieved Mr Eastwood has larger ideas, so it won't be necessary.

I almost chose to stay away from 'Invictus' because I have a natural aversion to rugby even though I have a Kiwi background steeped in All Black history. This is not a story about rugby. Rugby is part of the story.

Its a difficult story to tell to those uninformed about complex South African politics, the unique strength of Nelson Mandela, the strange game of rugby union which historically has created division & fanaticism.

The story is about a man who used divisive forces to bring about a sense of joy & hope. Its a movie about change and possibilities. Its about a man who thinks outside the square because of his own personal journey, using his power in the best way he can with a dignity and encouraging many to understand forgiveness & reconciliation.

For those who bemoan simplification; this particular movie demands specific, simple guidance for those unaware of this historical moment, but, I feel, many would be swept along in the current of a fascinating story in the steady hands of Mr Eastwood.

Clint Eastwoods development as a creative person is such a pleasure to watch, it will be the saddest day to lose his touch.",9
23 February 2013,Infectious.,"Invictus picks up where 2007 Bille August film Goodbye Bafana left off; the man himself, South African political prisoner turned international beacon for peace and prosperity Nelson Mandela, has been released from prison and walks down a makeshift aisle of people forming in a public street to applause and apparent joy. Where we freeze frame and leave that particular picture, a film depicting his time inside Robben Island jail and the bond he struck up with one of the ruling supremacist guards, we kick things off again in Eastwood's 2010 film Invictus: a conclave of jeeps; police vehicles and an everything-proof car harbouring the man himself rattling on down a road as he formally begins his first day in office as the president of South Africa. If you're a tad scant on your contemporary South African history, or if you're just a fan of those rare times when two completely different films that happen to cover similar ground just seem to ""fit"" when viewed together, then the two would make for a pretty decent double bill.

As it is, I have very little knowledge of said subject but I probably know more of it than the sport of Rugby. Ah, yes – the subject of Rugby. The film depicts the short burst of time during Mandela's five year reign as South African's first black president wherein he united a nation previously divided over the colour of one's skin. From his inception as its leader up to the conclusion of the 1995 Rugby World cup, which South Africa has been selected to host, we observe the true story of how the man tried to use what was a predominantly white pastime (and the presence of which, to some, still epitomises the old racial government) to build a sense of unity, patriotism and new order during this early stage of his reign. The film is a winner, an awareness piece and a sports movie you've already seen that depicts a somewhat incompetent squad of sports stars coming-good, this is true, but a really engaging piece of drama told eloquently and reassuringly as if it were some kind of bedtime story.

Morgan Freeman plays Mandela, a man taking control of a shattered nation coming out of decades of oppression guided towards the black population, and with troubles so deep that they extend to the petty squabbles within his own bureau between white security guards and black security guards. When we watch him driven during that opening scene, we observe the lush green turf and spanking pavilion the whites have access to for their rugby juxtaposed with the blacks, and their groggy looking football pitch fit for no one. Not a million miles away is Matt Damon's Francois Pienaar, the true-to-life rugby player and incumbent captain of the South African national side, nicknamed the Springboks. His team's in a mess, they can't win; he's the leader to whom everyone looks; he's got a shattered group of whoever in need of a kick-start – Mandela's just inherited a shattered nation, few things are going right in this fascist aftermath and he's got to rebuild things too: they've BOTH got to troubles. If only there was some sort of compromise that could help both of them...

The film does indeed go on to depict these two men bound by their respective responsibilities of leadership in wildly different fields, but a pairing of racial and sociological binaries in the sense Pienaar is this rugby player and rugby represents everything old and nasty. An early couple of instances at a rugby international against the English encapsulate both issues: the South Africans are trounced at home by a northern hemisphere team, while South African fans wave both the old and new South African flags-alike in disparate parts of the grandstands epitomising imbalance. We enjoy watching Mandela, away from his political duties that his peers around him deem far more important, become more and more transfixed by this game and the build up around the global event due to arrive on their shores. Drawing on inspiration from narrative film building blocks of the sports genre, as well as arriving with that sense of freshness inherent with sports films that depict people non-synonymous with the sport their undertaking (or not overly synonymous with success AT it), the strand revolving around the South African team and Pienaar's leadership works surprisingly well.

Those obligatory scenes, when we recall the film has been made with the widest possible audience in mind, do not grate as much as usual in films of this ilk. When Pienaar makes the customary visit to Mandela's cell, he draws on the influence of how small this space is in comparison to his wide open, spacious domain of the rugby pitch. Furthermore, expositional lines reiterating Mandela's position of being in prison for so long but coming out again without the malice felt towards those responsible for the imprisonment are instances those who know a bit of history, or are familiar with our aforementioned Goodbye Bafana, do not need. Regardless, we are behind the film; we care, and we care because we've been presented with these characters and their problems in a manner more than competent enough in a film making sense. When the 'Boks thrash the Samoan team early on, the opposition are shot as faceless and anonymous: Eastwood really forcing our eye to meet with the South African team in their rugged and workmanlike glory as they do the job as convincingly as they do. The film is a powerful and engaging drama; another one of those 'gentle' Eastwood entries into the directorial canon of his, as he sways against his acting 'type' of the 1970s and 80s with another film dealing with violence; bigotry and such rather than use as a means to propel stuff. It's worth a look.",7
11 December 2009,80% of the usual Eastwood fare,"As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning, I can tell you you the entertaining, inspiring and enjoyable ""Invictus"" exceeded all my expectations.

And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

18 December 2009,"An odd genre for Eastwood, but very glad he visited it!","Eastwood's first good movie since Gran Torino (Changeling i found was very dull and boring (due to Jolie being in it)) captures the image of Mandela's first acts as president of South Africa. The inspiring true story of how Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) joined forces with the captain of South Africa's rugby team, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon), to help unite their country.

Newly elected President Mandela knows his nation remains racially and economically divided in the wake of apartheid. Believing he can bring his people together through the universal language of sport, Mandela rallies South Africa's underdog rugby team as they make an unlikely run to the 1995 World Cup Championship match.

7 September 2010,Inspiring,"Clint Eastwood did it again, He again makes a powerful movie and it looks like He did it without trying too much, but off course it looks easy when a mastermind is doing it. Anyone else would've made it just another sports cheesy movie, but not Eastwood.

This movie is about the icon Nelson Mandela and certain point in His life when He became a president of a burning South Africa and how He managed to rose to the challenge, and to tame the burning hate, through a sport event, against all odds. We are honored to have a small look in the life of one of the greatest man humanity has met, the courage, the perseverance, the excellent sense of humor, the uplifting words, and the actual cell in which unfortunately He has spent big part of His life.

In the end, I must say, masterful performance by Morgan Freeman.

12 December 2009,A film that shows how becoming inspired can change a nation when you connect up with forgiveness despite racial and political tension.,"As always Clint Eastwood does such wonderful work probably better as a director than an actor. And it's no different here as Eastwood directs ""Invictus"" a good film not just of historical meaning and terms, but it's interesting how it connects with people of a once fractured country to inspire the will to be happy all thru forgiveness. This film is not just about the release of one Nelson Mandela but more of how he transforms the country thru of all things it's white rugby team.

Starting in 1990 when Mandela(Morgan Freeman as always is his classy and spot on best from expressions to even the cadences) is released from South African prison to a country that's still split by racial tensions and transitional violence. As for years the blacks have always had problems with the whites as the popular rugby team the Springboks are detested by the blacks. Yet Mandela thru his love and learning about forgiveness surprises his people and supports the team as this is his way to springboard the country to be more loving and compassionate.

The rugby team lead by captain Francois Pienaar(Matt Damon who's chemistry with Freeman is good)meets with Mandela and he becomes inspired to work harder so they can win the World Cup and prove to all South Africans that peace and love is possible for all as all of them no matter what color are the same and the team represents everyone. True this film is an inspirational one that's connected to athletics yet deep underneath it's more about the changing times of a nation lead by forgiveness and inner working of politics. The film moves along well as Eastwood paces the action field shots well as the rugby scenes are entertaining as you cheer for victory even though you know the Springboks are gonna be winners.

Still I really don't call this a sports movie even though it's connected to it. The film has a much more deep meaning proving that a leader can inspire a nation and change their thoughts thru a winning team as he learned forgiveness and that a nation should be one. Really good to show when inspired attitudes change hard times even like racial tensions as it's always important that cultures and things change in society. Plus with this strong performance by the class act Freeman and it's themes of nation changing, forgiveness, inspiration ""Invictus"" is one film that makes a person happy after they see it.",8
1 March 2011,Very inspiring but no surprises,"While I am a history teacher and know much more about South African history than the average American, but as an American I am still woefully ignorant of this far away country's history. Most everyone here knows almost nothing about Mandela and South Africa---so we are usually unable to critically examine ""Invictus""--only to enjoy it. So I have no idea if Nelson Mandela is as wonderfully kind and wise as he is in the film or more just an ordinary man. In other words, is this an accurate biography or is it hero worship...I just don't know. And this movie gets me to thinking that perhaps it is time I do get to know more about the man and the nation--especially as I am planning on visiting there in 2013. I mention all this because usually when I review films I am VERY critical of the historical accuracy of a movie but in this case I am just not the best person to be doing this. It also makes me feel bad that I just don't know more about the country--especially since our news stories pretty much stopped on South Africa following the collapse of Apartheid.

""Invictus"" is an interesting film because it's like a biography and history lesson combined. At times, it focuses on Mandela as President of the new South Africa and others it focuses on the divided nation--and bounces back and forth between this. This is NOT a bad thing, as using the metaphor of rugby to represent the nation is a clever way to tell the story. The only problem is that although it's quite inspiring and well made, the viewer is never surprised--not even once. What you think will happen, happens. And, oddly, there isn't even a plot device to bring in any tension or make the viewer doubt the outcome in the least. As a result, it's easy to see why ""Hurt Locker"" beat out ""Invictus"" for the Best Picture Oscar and I think other nominees I've seen (such as ""Precious"" and ""Avatar"") were better films. However, I COULD see how ""Invictus"" won acting Oscars, as this was top-notch. Oddly, however, Morgan Freeman played a much smaller man (Mandela) and the opposite is true of Matt Damon playing a much bigger man than he really is.

While it's almost completely unlikely to ever happen, I'd sure love to be able to watch this film with a mixed group of South Africans--to listen to their insights and comments on what is occurring. I did not see this on DVD, so perhaps the DVD has some similar sort of commentary--it would be most enlightening if there is such an option.",8
18 February 2010,"Straight up with no frills, Eastwood-style","Clint Eastwood has got to be my favorite director. No one can tell a narrative like he can. A good story, straight up with no frills in direction or extravagant special effects, and actors giving it all they've got either because Eastwood tells them how to or because they know they're working with a legend. Man, I hope he doesn't retire.

I can't believe I teared up in a movie about rugby! Okay it's not all about rugby but still!

The movie's about Nelson Mandela and the significance of the rugby world cup in that first term of his presidential tenure. I've heard of the man but honestly, before this movie I couldn't even tell you who he was and what he did. Eastwood provided sufficient background to the story of Mandela and South Africa without dragging the movie down with too much history, and he kept a good pace so that I wasn't never bored.

I can't say I know more about rugby now, but with a sports movie, you don't need to know the sport to feel the emotions that a good movie captures from the athletes and spectators (hence my tearing up at the big finale).

Having never seen Mandela on TV, I can't say if Morgan Freeman did a good imitation, but no matter - he's a consummate actor who embodied the character. I wonder if Matt Damon got nominated because this is his least showy role ever. It's pretty cool how he almost disappeared into the performance but I don't think that the role is substantial enough to warrant an Oscar win.",10
1 January 2010,Freeman IS Mandela,"Morgan Freeman is Nelson Mandela. The only question is whether he actually had to act the part or whether he really is like that. Sheer perfection!

Matt Damon - good job, maybe better than good. Damon, plus 40-50 pounds still looks small for the role - thank goodness for camera angles that give him a bit more stature.

South Africa - the politics - the geographical scene - all well rendered. The distrust between the races is palpable throughout the film - yet is always believable and not pandered to.

Clint Eastwood, the director, may be the one least praised by the masses for his effort; yet his direction is subtle and easy and makes the film so much better - his should be the Oscar nomination...

20 June 2010,Invictus An Excellent Drama Based On A True Story,"Invictus is an excellent drama based on a true story with great performances by the two lead actors who really bring their A game to this movie. Director Clint Eastwood continues to show audiences and critics that he's one of the best filmmakers in Hollywood with this one. Morgan Freeman is superb as always as Nelson Mandela who after being released from prison soon goes on to become the President of South Africa. Believing he can bring his divided people together through the universal language of sport, Mandela enlists the help of South African rugby Captain Francois Pienaar to make a run for 1995 World Cup Championship Match. Freeman is so convincing as the newly elected president Mandela. He turns in another great performance among many proving his talent as a veteran actor. Matt Damon is equally impressive as Pienaar the rugby Captain who rallies his teammates to achieve what seems impossible. Damon may not be as tall as the real Pienaar but like Freeman he becomes the character and turns in a solid performance none the less. Damon and Freeman played off each other very well in their scenes together making the growing friendship between their characters believable. The rest of the relatively unknown cast are also very good as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. I can't think of too much I didn't enjoy about this film because Invictus was much better than expected. I mean I heard it was supposed to be good but Invictus still impressed me with how well Eastwood put it together which like many other films I'm sure wasn't easy. The pacing is fine except the 134 minute running time did seem a little slow at times and the satisfying ending I sort of suspected but those are two tiny flaws because the good more than outweighs the bad in this one. The real locations they used added a lot to the film making you feel for the characters and their situation. The movie in the beginning had a documentary type feel as well which worked in it's favor. So overall if you're looking for inspiring drama based on a true story, Invictus is the movie for you. I plan to see this again sometime because I believe it's worth seeing more than once. It's a film about how the power of hope and forgiveness can unite country. Invictus has a similar compelling story, drama, a little humor, and exceptional performances by the cast (especially Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon) who make this movie worth the time to watch.",9
10 December 2012,"""Predictable,"" ""forgettable,"" ""inaccurate""...","Those are some of the criticisms leveled at the movie.

Forgettable? I don't think so. I rewatched this picture three times in the space of eight or so months, and am sure to do so again. I love politics and anthropology, and this movie goes a decent way toward depicting the transition-South-African psyche and events.

Inaccurate? Maybe. But, then, this is not supposed to be a documentary. For dead-on accurate features one usually goes to the History Channel.

Predictable. Aside from a few tense moments, yes.

However, none of the above detracts in any way from this movie. It is interesting, fast-moving, does not contain gratuitous violence or sex or C.G.I. It is thoughtful and thought-provoking. It is also very poignant. Though not a fan of the A.N.C. and having reservations about Mr. Mandela himself, I have no shame in admitting I was moved to tears a number of times. Pres. Mandela is rightly portrayed as a statesman and a mensch who averted disaster and bloodshed upon the dismantling of the reprehensible Apartheid regime.

The message conveyed through this picture gives hope, particularly to those of us in the Middle East. If the bitter enemies of decades of turbulent strife can get along, there might be hope for us yet, too!

P.S. The musical score is also excellent!",10
24 December 2009,Excellent Film!,"Not only did I love this movie, but so did my wife who knows little about rugby and hates sports movies. It's not really a sports movie but rather an example of political leadership. With Clint Eastwood directing it's historically accurate and makes its points quietly and without over dramatization. Someone unaware of the history of South Africa during the 1980s and 1990s might struggle to understand what's happening but the movie will quietly answer all your questions although it might make you wait awhile and it will make you think. Morgan Freeman commands the screen while underplaying, the kind of trick that brings award nominations. Matt Damon is brings immense tension to a quiet part. The star of the movie is the simple idea of reaching across to black/white divide to bond over what had been a sport mainly for South African whites. This movie is yet another reminder that Clint Eastwood has become the most dependable and most accomplished American director.

14 December 2009,Don't believe the hype!,"""Invictus"" is the Disney version of apartheid -- shallow, simplistic, and very disappointing. There is little suspense, and worse, next to no acknowledgment of South Africa's heroic efforts to face down its past. It's all rugby and Mandela all the time. The screenplay, with its ""Attaboy"" dialogue, reads like a 1940s baseball movie. Morgan Freeman's Mandela is stirring but Matt Damon's character is a cipher. And everyone else is just a face in the crowd, including the beautiful country of South Africa. This feel-good approach will no doubt play well in the multi-plexes, but Eastwood's fans deserve more nuance and more thought.

12 March 2017,Don't Expect Past Eastwood Greatness...But Still Okay,"Whenever I see the name ""Clint Eastwood"" associated with a new moving coming to theaters, I automatically think of such incredible films as Million Dollar Baby, Changeling, and Gran Torino. Perhaps I am just spoiled by Eastwood's spotless track record, but that is the reality of the situation. With that in mind, Invictus does not live up to the billing...but it still is a very honorable effort.

Basically, the film takes place primarily in the country of South Africa, where Nelson Mandela (played superbly by Morgan Freeman) has come to power and is striving to bridge the gap between blacks and whites after decades of apartheid rule. Mandela seizes upon the country's terrible rugby team, stocked primarily by high-brow, burly white men, as a symbol of unity for the country. He tabs Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to captain the team and make them respectable (if not a whole lot more) heading into the World Cup. The rest, as they say, is history.

Now, I can't say that this film was outright bad in any way. The race-relations message is one that resonates, the rugby team is certainly inspirational, and the acting is pretty good as well, led by the remarkable Freeman as one of the world's most storied leaders. Yet, unlike ""Torino"" or ""Baby"", the word I would use to describe this film is ""understated"". Instead of walloping viewers over the head with such heavy topics as euthanasia, religion, or death, in this effort Eastwood takes a much more low-key approach. There is drama, yes, and plenty of inspiration, but it just doesn't feel as epic as it could have been. Whether this was Eastwood trying to ""follow the facts"" as much as possible, or the real-life story just not providing the high drama of a fully scripted film, I'm not sure.

Thus, if you are heading to the theater expecting utter greatness like I was, you will likely leave disappointed. However, if the topics/events/times in the film are of significant personal or cultural importance to you, then Invictus will automatically garner a five-star rating for its factual portrayal of the events that transpired.",6
28 July 2010,well intentioned but miscast,"From a historical point of view it is interesting to see the transition of power from the white to black. But in the end it doesn't quite show how a mostly white rugby team winning a game helped to unify the country as a whole. The game just looks trivial compared to the problems of the country as a whole. Also the screenplay is simplistic in that Mandela's wisdom and saintliness is exaggerated here. He is unrealistically good here.

Clint's direction is as usual a little indulgent. The game at the end is too long.

Miscasting is the worst fault of this movie. Morgan Freeman's accent isn't that good - in fact it distracts from the movie. Maybe they could have found an African actor for the part. Matt Damon's accent is better but he is too small sized for a rugby player - it looks like they are trying to make him look bigger by using camera angles etc but it doesn't work.",3
7 February 2010,Rugby ended racism in South Africa?,"The film made up of one half showing the problems Mandela faced during his presidency and how he tried to unite the county after apartheid and one half showing the actual rugby games.

The scenes with Mandela (Freeman) were very well directed and the portrayal of Mandela was close to flawless (as expected from Morgan Freeman). However the focus was on the rugby and it seemed Mandela spent more time watching the games and talking to the players than doing anything else. You are left with a strong feeling of not having enough insight into Mandela's presidency.

This isn't helped by the rugby scenes being filmed akin to a live televised sporting event. You see the same angles ad nauseam and the camera is generally so wide you have no idea what is happening. The director also seems to refuse to use a shallow depth of field at any point - you have no idea what you should be focusing on even on close up angles.

It can be argued all this is intentional as you're not supposed to focus on the game, but should rather focus on the crowd and see just how much impact the game had in uniting the country. However this premise was hugely overplayed in my opinion and the movie makes it look like rugby single-handedly ended racism in South Africa.

With over an hour of rugby footage, it's hard to justify just how poorly the action was filmed and with an overplayed premise, even Morgan Freeman's fantastic acting can't save this one - 2/10.",2
15 December 2010,Beautifully crafted film..Not enough to watch with two eyes,"Client Eastwood can touch the peoples heart with his movie , Invictus is the best example..

Invictus is a beautiful film , with excellent star cast ..

It is well crafted & flawless..

Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela done justification to his part...

No one can be imagined in madiba character except Morgan..

Matt Daemon acted well..

High levels of adrenaline will flow through your entire body for the entire film...

Two eyes aren't enough to watch the scenes in stadium with 62,000 people..

Every frame is beautifully crafted...

If you want a fantastic movie with excellent drama and sport then this movie is for you....

Highly recommended...

6 January 2010,Freeman shines as Nelson Mandella leading a nation towards unity,"As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning, I can tell you you the entertaining, inspiring and enjoyable ""Invictus"" exceeded all my expectations.

It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.

I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

Viva Clint Eastwood, viva Morgan Freeman, viva Madiba.

PS. I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.

Of the films Eastwood has directed, my favorites, in no particular order, are ""Unforgiven"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Gran Torino"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"",""Bird"" and ""Invictus"". Yes, it's really that good. ""Invictus"" is another winner from Clint. He just seems to get better with age. What a creative roll he is currently on.

PPS. ""Invictus"" is one of the best sporting movies I have ever seen. But it's also about more than sport.",8
2 September 2010,An understated classic,"Film reviewers in their self-appointed omniscience, occasionally tend to forget the obvious; for example that Invictus, Eastwood's 30th feature length film in 38 years isn't a study of south African politics, but a mere adaptation of a book about a political leader and a rugby game. New light through the old windows then Here is a film, magisterially constructed, stately executed, of course, about a man's political insight and the dedicated seriousness with which this insight must be served. Nothing frivolous or ""likeable"" about great Mr. Freeman's interpretation of the Man. Instead he builds a thoughtful diplomat, a passive aggressive person of gentle manners and obsessive persistence. Mr. Eastwood's only arguable decision – if I may – is his conscious attempt to portray a situation in its almost pedestrian, at times, reality, relieved of any real danger of things going the wrong way. For a director who never indulged in the suspenseless, this comes as a surprise Yet, on second thought, the game itself is not the issue at hand. Yes, it may occupy the grand finale and, plausibly apply the upbeat feeling, but Mr. Eastwood's cinema almost always is elsewhere: In the reintegration, understanding and affirmation of the Male, of the one who makes the necessary decisions to solidify the social web. And under this light, Invictus is one with the director's unmistakable canon.",7
11 December 2009,Brilliant !,"Normally I am a bit skeptical when it comes to sport movies but when I heard that this one was being made I hoped to myself that Clint Eastwood does it justice as many of us South Africans that were alive at that time (and also like myself went to see the final match at Ellis Park) still have very fond memories of it. This film does not fail. It doesn't even come close to failing. But what the film did show is that sport and politics can be used to bring people together. And yes Morgan Freeman, in my opinion, did not fail as Nelson Mandela. Matt Damon was good (his South African accent is probably as good any American can do it, and the best that I have heard in any American financed movie) as Captain Francois Pienaar but the real scene stealer is Freeman. The rugby being played in the film was real. The 'plays' in the film were real. Everything about the film was about as close to the event as it can be. Don't watch it on a small screen, it literally begs to be watched on a HUGE SCREEN!!!

14 December 2009,Standard feel-good story infused with Oscar-caliber talents,"I think there's actually a proverb somewhere that says ""On one of three things a film contends for Oscars: Clint Eastwood directing, Morgan Freeman acting and a compelling historical figure as the lead role."" The person who first uttered this saying would take one look at ""Invictus"" and say: ""well that's not fair."" But despite being predestined for Oscar glory, ""Invictus"" amounts to a simple feel-good sports and human interest story in the hands of exceptional talent.

The main source of antagonism in ""Invictus"" is the fear and embittered attitudes of its characters: the people (both black and white) of post-Apartheid South Africa during the beginning of Nelson Mandela's presidency in the early '90s. That might be poetic, but it's not exactly the stuff that great drama and conflict is made of. The only suspense created is by the posing of two questions: Can South Africa can win the rugby world cup and can it begin mend and rebuild itself under Mandela's wise guidance? Interesting, but not exactly riveting stuff for a two-hour and 14-minute film.

Still, Clint Eastwood directs the heck out of this only slightly compelling script by Anthony Peckham based on the John Carlin book. Eastwood turns the mild events of the film into microcosms of racial discord. He creates similar black and white imagery to echo these intentions too. Mandela's security staff are the best example. At first Mandela's black guards are furious they have to work with white men, but we watch them grow closer and Eastwood slides images of the guards traveling in cars by race at one point then showing them mixed toward the end. Subtle and effective, this milks the story for all it's worth.

You also won't find an inspirational sports story that manages to avoid cliché better than ""Invictus."" Eastwood keeps the focus on the people and the symbolic meaning of rugby while still bringing us into the action. There aren't any banal last chances, miracle plays or excessive celebrations. Some of those techniques are used, but you won't roll your eyes at ""Invictus"" and you'll truly understand what the cup meant to South Africa.

Freeman and Matt Damon as South Africa rugby captain Francois Pienaar are two other towering forces working to add depth and emotion to the film. After this fall's ""The Informant!"" Damon continues to impress with his versatility. The combination of tough-guy and emotional leader makes Pienaar a role that suits him very well. He continues to become one of the finest actors of his generation, even if this role is understated.

Freeman gives us as much as he can muster in a script that drastically undercuts his complexity. Needless to say, however, the role is indeed perfect for him. He gives us hints of inner tensions and personal problems along with the colorful personality and pristinely delivered inspirational quotes. It's important to note this is not a biopic of Mandela, but a brief history of what times were like when he came into office and how he saw rugby as a way to erase the cycle of hate and unify his country.

Although it starts to burden its audience with a lot of rugby footage toward the end, ""Invictus"" is an excellent feel-good movie. Where it falls short is in being constantly engaging and complex. Having a triumvirate of Oscar-caliber talents in this case is more an instance of putting forth the maximum effort to lift a pleasant story as high as possible. As producer, Eastwood saw a lot of likable stuff in this story and he made it better than anyone else would have. Palate-wise, ""Invictus"" is like glorified homemade cooking as opposed to the layers and intricacies of gourmet.

24 December 2009,A letdown,"I love sports movies. I like political movies. I should love Invictus, right? I didn't. The message of the movie (Don't hate others b/c of the way they look, exceed your own expectations) could've been told in half the time. Actually, I just told the message in 1/800th the time. The reason this matters is that the movie was just really boring. The message is a good one, but it was delivered so poorly that I wish I could've just had someone read my own paraphrase to me. At least I would have given a point for succinctness. A major example of the poor delivery - when the final competition happened, I was surprised since the buildup was really weak. I thought it was still a qualifying match. I was really looking forward to the grand final and then the movie was over.

I don't like being so negative, so here are some positives: Matt Damon did a good job, and it was interesting to see him looking so muscled (PEDs?). Morgan Freeman has a nice voice. The jogging suits the team wore looked nice and flashy. I now know a rule from rugby.

One major positive of the film is the music. Anytime you can hear Serengeti music with the beat of Africa shining through, it's a great thing. AAAA-BA-DEEEEENG-AAAA!!!!! I plan on buying the soundtrack.",4
23 September 2015,"I'm not generally a fan of sports films, but...","Sports films usually leave me cold; I never watch sport in real life so watching it in film holds no appeal for me. However, this story of rugby in South Africa in the early 1990s holds plenty of appeal, thanks to expert direction from Clint Eastwood and an excellent performance from Morgan Freeman who embodies the spirit and persona of Nelson Mandela. It's the political backdrop that makes the sport interesting, and INVICTUS is a great film to watch as a result.

The cinematography is particularly proficient here; I had the pleasure of watching this in high definition and it's a beautiful film to look at. Eastwood is on top form. The material is a little weaker, failing to explore the complexities of the situation and sinking into schmaltz at various points; Eastwood can't avoid evoking some sentimentality in scenes of stirring music playing and whites and blacks working together. It's not as bad as in something like VOLCANO, but it's there, and it's a bit condescending. Still, Matt Damon's on board and delivers another solid turn, and even the hardest of hearts will find much to enjoy here.",6
28 December 2009,Political sports movie. What did you expect?,"Sure Freeman was good, but whatever. I was hoping that ""Gran Torino"" was an aberration for Eastwood, but this is actually worse. Even for those who find inspiration in films like ""Rudy"" or ""Big League"" this may be a stretch. OK, the Springboks surprising win was a unifying event for SA, but why make a big budget movie out of it? For a sports film, the rugby scenes are shot well and the stadium crowd is believable. However, somehow there is little reward in rooting for the underdog. Rugby remains foreign to North America and to set a political drama around it, is not engaging. Considering the Hollywood heavyweights involved, the story of South African racial tensions of the last 40 years could have been addressed more poignantly than through a whimsical sports drama.

29 December 2009,"Great performances, but keep your remote in hand","As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning, I can tell you you the entertaining, inspiring and enjoyable ""Invictus"" exceeded all my expectations.

It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.

I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

Viva Clint Eastwood, viva Morgan Freeman, viva Madiba.

PS. I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.

Of the films Eastwood has directed, my favorites, in no particular order, are ""Unforgiven"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Gran Torino"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"",""Bird"" and ""Invictus"". Yes, it's really that good. ""Invictus"" is another winner from Clint. He just seems to get better with age. What a creative roll he is currently on.

PPS. ""Invictus"" is one of the best sporting movies I have ever seen. But it's also about more than sport.",6
4 March 2011,"From a Checkered Past, to World Cup Glory","You need know nothing about rugby, and you need know nothing about South Africa. Clint Eastwood directs, as Matt Damon, perhaps for the first time in career, acts so well that you forget you're watching Matt Damon.

Damon portraits François Pienaar, the captain of the South African Rugby team; a team that is talented but in a wholesale state of disarray. The team's players are listless and unmotivated, while their level of play is evocative of the Bad News Bears. Meanwhile, the nation's black rugby fans cheer not for South Africa but for England.

At the same time, newly elected Nelson Mandela wrestles with the task of running the government and uniting the country while reconciling black aspirations with white fears.

With South Africa hosting the soon-approaching World Cup, the rugby team's management is fired while the new black government coalition tries to change the team's mascot and team name, The Springboks, in attempt to erase all memory of Apartheid.

Mandela quietly calls on captain Pienaar to reset the tone of the team and prepare the Springboks for the unlikely feat of winning the World Cup at home and uniting the nation.

Invictus gets its name from a poem by William Ernest Henley that Mandela holds dear as something that made him stand up when, imprisoned for 26 years, ""all he wanted to do was lie down"". Like the poem, which speaks of the ability to take responsibility for one's destiny, the film tells the story of South Africa's steps forward in the work-in-progress of setting free the nation, both psychologically and socio-politically from its checkered past.

Invictus has so many important facets at work in a brilliant, exciting, but well-tailored storyline, that you'll digest it for days. Do yourself a favor, and go see it.

31 August 2015,fine historical drama,"Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) wins the election but faces a divided country and questions about his governing abilities. His bodyguard Jason is dismayed at the white presidential security hired by Mandela. He notices that the whites are cheering South Africa's rugby team Springbok but the blacks are cheering for the opposition. He has to fight back efforts by black activists and recruits captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon). The team is losing but they make a historic run in the 1995 Rugby World Cup Championship hosted by South Africa.

Director Clint Eastwood makes a perfectly fine historical drama. Freeman has the sense of the wise compelling leader. The only drawback with Matt Damon is his size. I don't see the physicality of the captain of the national rugby team. It's a minor quip. The drama is limited. It doesn't take full advantage of an underdog sports drama. This is more of a political drama but not a very daring one. The actual events may not have enough drama.",7
20 June 2010,Eastwood Continues to Impress,"Invictus (2009)

*** 1/2 (out of 4)

Another marvelous achievement for director Eastood tells the true story of the 1995 South African rugby team who went into that years World Cup, in Africa no less, and tried to pull off one of the biggest upsets in sports history. Recently elected President Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) asks captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to try and win the event not only for the upset but to bring the racial tensions of the country to an end. Eastwood has had a rather amazing run over the past couple decades and he certainly has made a name for himself among some of the greatest directors of all time. INVICTUS is what you'd call a political thriller, social drama and sports movie and we've seen each of those types of films countless times throughout the years. Even though we've seen them countless times, under Eastwood's direction we still get some fresh and original and in the end it's yet another winner for the director. What really caught me off guard was how Eastwood decided to tell the story. Yes, we get a few cliché moments but for the most part this comes off very original. You could look at all of the sports footage and say there isn't much heart or energy in the scenes. Eastwood even makes the brave decision of not explaining how rugby works as I'm sure many people watching this film have no ideas of the rules. I think this was done on purpose so that we can enjoy the sports stuff but the real heart and energy are with the people of South Africa. It's the non-sports stuff where we really feel the passion in the material and this includes a wonderfully handled sequence where the rugby team goes to the prison where Mandela spent most of his life. The scene with Damon inside his jail cell was very haunting. Even the stuff dealing with the racial tension is handled in a rather fresh and original way as the film kicks off with four black bodyguards being upset that Mandela has hired four white bodyguards. The way this sequence plays out is a fresh way of showing the racial tension and this short sequence pretty much tells us all we need to know. Another great sequence is when the rugby team is going to teach some children about the game but all the black children immediately run to the sole black player on the team. What really drives this movie home is the Oscar-nominated performance by Freeman who really does turn in one of his greatest performances here. I've heard a few people complain that he doesn't look like Mandela and that he does sound 100% like him but to me this is a mute point. What matters if the power, message and emotional power of Mandela and that's what Freeman nails. Each time he opened his mouth I couldn't help but be drawn into the power he's displaying in sheer energy. There's no screaming or shouting yet the power of the character still comes across with Freeman constantly giving off this invisible energy that will strike viewers as raw emotion and power. Damon is also very good in his role, another quiet one, that the actor really digs into and makes for a memorable character. The supporting players are all pretty much in the background but all done nice jobs. As is usual with an Eastwood film, we get a great music score full of South African music but that typical and beautiful cinematography. In the recent documentary THE EASTWOOD FACTOR, the director explains what keeps him moving and why he continues to make movies. The way he pretty much put it is that he looks for power in non-typical ways and that's pretty much what he has delivered here. We've seen countless race movies and countless sports movies but none have been quite like this. That's probably why this didn't do overly well at the box office while junk like THE BLIND SIDE wins awards and brings in cash. A shame really but this is a class act film that doesn't go for one bad cliché after another or some sort of fake drama to bring a tear.",
31 July 2010,Bland Retelling,"Having read extensively about the situation in South Africa and being a great admirer of Mandela, I was disappointed in this film. Yes, Morgan Freeman looks like and acts like the great president. Yes the events are portrayed in a relatively accurate way. It's just that there doesn't seem to be a great dramatic question. Nothing is portrayed on the edge like they need to be. The racial issue is there but it is pretty sanitized and almost cute at times. There are also some silly tricks that I won't mention because they would be spoilers. There are two ways to go with this biographical stuff. You can go all the way and get down and dirty (like the issues in Coetzee's ""Disgrace""), or you can make it a moral tale with little taking place. The Rugby team needed some life and some real tension. There had to be more internal strife than that portrayed in this film. When it was over, my response was, ""OK! Apartheid ended. What is the aftermath?"" It isn't even quite there when it comes to sport. I also would like to have seen a little more explanation about the tension between Mandela and his daughter.

20 February 2010,Leadership for reconcilation,"This is a movie about reconciliation and leadership. In South Africa of the apartheid era, unbelievable outrageousness and tyranny against black people was the national policy. Nelson Mandela was a leader of the guerrilla against the government, who was arrested in 1962. Mandela was released in 1990 by then president de Klerk. The movie starts from that day. White people feel fearful about the release. The fear had reason. Most countries where black took over white ruling in the past, white got South Africa revenged and their land and properties were striped down, and those uneducated black people could not run the country. Mandela, however, adopted reconciliation as the principle to run the country, and he got the idea to make the rugby World Cup Game as the chance for the national reconciliation. An outstanding leader ponders and considers deeply how to achieve the final goal of the organization, and once he decides to do something, he works unflinchingly without hesitation. The movie clearly portrays how Mandela, acted by Morgan Freeman, appealed the people for reconciliation and forgiveness, and made the people around him, particularly the team captain, work for it. Freeman perfectly acted this actually existing person. I recommend this to everyone around me.",10
21 September 2015,The game defining a nation,"I once was lying on a beach in South Africa and noticed a bunch of white school kids jumping off the school bus and heading towards the waves but they were not there to swim or surf.

They had a rugby ball with them and one of them was running with the ball while others tried to tackle him. It was a beautiful sight.

It just shows how popular and important rugby is to the whites in South Africa. To the blacks, soccer is more important. To them rugby was the game of the oppressor.

Invictus mashes up the early months of Nelson Mandela's Presidency of post apartheid South Africa and the Springboks preparation of the Rugby World Cup to be held in South Africa in 1995.

The ending of apartheid meant that South Africa were allowed to compete in international competitions and the hosting of the rugby World Cup was their swift reward.

The film therefore has two threads. Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) treading carefully in a country where the white minority are fearful of the future.

As shown by the distrust with his own security personnel which now includes the black ANC members and the white security team of the former president.

At the same time you have the national rugby team lead by captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) whose team is almost all white. It has little support from the black majority who want the team renamed and worse they are on a losing streak.

Criticised by former players and pundits. It is a team lacking in confidence and support.

Invictus is a film of how the country and President gets behind the team and how the team responds.

It's a true story which resulted in a South African victory against the All Blacks who had the fearsome man mountain, Jonah Lomu.

The abiding image of the final was Nelson Mandela appearing in the final to greet the team wearing the green and gold of the Springboks.

The film is directed by two times best director Oscar winner, Clint Eastwood. A criticism of Eastwood is that he is the epitome of an efficient director lacking a signature style.

Invictus is a good example of this. If you missed the starting titles, you would actually think that it's made by a solid British director than an American legend.

It is a dependable film with some substance. How can you not fail with such a true story.

You have the inspiring Mandela played by Freeman with a twinkle in his eye. Damon is more earnest as Pienaar realising that he needs to lead more than just a sub-par team to the Rugby World Cup. He needs to reunite decades of racial divisions in the new South Africa.

However the film never goes above such platitudes. I imagined this film in the hands of a younger Richard Attenborough who would never had stooped to use CGI to fill the stadiums.

He would had got 60,000 extras and made the film soar and given it a harder edge. I do not mean just in the rugby scenes which seemed a little off to me, lacking the blood and guts of the actual game. Eastwood leaves you with a soft centre.",7
8 September 2010,Scratching the surface,"It's almost a shame, that we only get to see such a short part of Mandelas life. Matt Damon never really convinced me either in his role (his accent seemed to fade away at times or get thicker). But it's of course Morgan Freeman and his role of a lifetime (leaving his ""Bruce Almighty"" appearance aside that is).

And Morgan plays it as good as it can get. There are really strong themes here and some very interesting points get touched. Well more scratched that is. Because we never dig deeper. And while it is impossible to really capture a human and all his facades into one film, it still leaves a bitter taste, when you don't know what exactly drove him to do some of the things he did. While I'm for not over-explaining things, it seems that the movie oversimplifies some things.

It just feels that something is missing. Or maybe it is, that Clint spoiled us and we expect every movie to be a masterpiece. Whatever it is, this is definitely worth watching, though if you really are looking for some insight into Mandela, I guess there will be some books out who will be more helpful",6

9 January 2010,That Rousing Second Half is Well Worth the Long Wait,"Running for over two hours, this film really felt long especially at the beginning. You really need patience to watch this movie. The first 45 minutes about various political meetings was so boring I almost gave up! Not even Morgan Freeman's uncanny portrayal of Pres. Nelson Mandela was enough. Then came that scene where Mandela met up with Springboks Captain Francois Pienaar (played by Matt Damon) to encourage them to win the Rugby World Cup in order to promote unity for the newly united South Africa. Thankfully, after that scene, the movie finally woke up and picked up the pace, and became an entertaining film.

As with any inspirational sports film like ""Mighty Ducks"" or ""Rocky"", you know how this would end. Yet I found the rugby scenes engrossing, even if I did not really understand all the mechanics of the game. I wish they had included more information about the game or had play-by-play of the matches for better appreciation of the action. That last match of the Springboks vs the New Zealand All Blacks was very exciting. I liked the details, like the plane that mysteriously flew above the stadium, and the Maori Haka dance of the All Blacks before the match began.

As director, again Clint Eastwood had his excesses, as he did in his other flawed films like ""Flag of our Fathers"" or ""Changeling"". He should have decided which film he wanted to make. The second half of the film could have stood on its own as a very good focused sports film. Too bad, Eastwood also delve lengthily on political issues in the beginning. Honestly, this movie succeeds more as an inspirational sports movie, than an inspirational political film. I must emphasize though, that rousing second half is well worth the wait.",6
24 December 2009,A film about inspiration that genuinely inspires.,"In what is sure to be one of those films that is widely acclaimed but little seen, Clint Eastwood has crafted one of the most hopeful and inspirational films of recent times that rises head and shoulders above all around it on the strength of good writing, great performances, tight direction and above all, an honest to God brilliant story.

After 27 years in prison, the newly elected president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, has inherited a country where racism, bitterness and vengeful hatred could send the land into civil war. Armed with little more than his charm, wit, humility and intellect, he must somehow unify the deep divisions in society and knows he must do so by example; his quest, so to speak, is to discover the strategies that will inspire his countrymen to share in his dream of a rainbow nation.

When he sees the dreadful national rugby team get beaten, something that emotionally hurts the white South Africans whilst pleasing the blacks, he spots an opportunity to create an iconic focal point in which all South Africans can take pride. So he telephones the team captain, invites him for tea and recruits him into his thinking. All they need to do now is get the support of millions of blacks who hate rugby.

The movie could have fallen into familiar sporting drama territory, by showing the underdogs in a training montage, or having a crisis of confidence; but this isn't your usual sporting drama. This isn't Rocky, or The Mighty Ducks. Instead, Invictus is about Mandela providing as much inspiration and positive leadership to unify his country as possible. As we marvel at his humility in the face of adversity and his courage to make difficult choices we become invested in the story and start cheering. The rugby is just a sideshow, the real sporting hero is Mandela.

The heart of the film is to show that when you lead by example, that when you keep pushing hard to inspire goodness in others, when you encourage the bitter and the angry to allow themselves hope, then ultimately, with perseverance, you can move mountains. It is here, as you watch those mountains crumble to dust you become overwhelmed by the power of the story.

Mandela wanted to unify black and white through sport and Eastwood has crafted some joyous storytelling moments. In one beautiful vignette, a young black boy tries to listen to the big game on the radio of some white security guards. At first the guards shoo him away but he hovers close by, pretending to pick up trash. As the match progresses and the tension mounts, the boy gets closer and closer until eventually he and the guards are living the moment together. He ends up sitting on the car bonnet and sharing a coke with the security guards as they chew their fingernails with the stress of the match.

As for the rugby, there's a perfect balance between the sport and drama. Eastwood obviously knew that Rugby isn't played everywhere and very skillfully squeezes in as much as you need to know. But the scoring and rules don't matter; the stunning slow motion action with bone crushing sounds on the tackles are just eye-candy between the emotions.

Invictus is a modern day morality play that shows us what can be achieved by kindness, forgiveness, humility and diplomacy. It is made all the more poignant by being a true story. In fact, directly after seeing the movie I started watching the real event on youtube and I would strongly recommend anyone who has seen this movie to do so. When Matt Damon tells a sportscaster ""there aren't 60,000 people cheering for us, there are 43 million cheering for us."" its an immense moment fitting of a Hollywood movie, but to then watch on youtube, the real Francois Pienaar say it, you will be moved to tears.

Invictus is an inspired and inspirational heart warming movie that is truly refreshing to the soul and spirit. The writing, performances and direction are sublime and the overall experiences is truly uplifting. Expect it to do deservedly well come awards season.",9
14 January 2010,Powerful movie (Highly recommended),"After reading the reviews at IMDb, I was very skeptical about this movie. I thought it would be boring and draggy. But I was very curious. So I go for this show expecting it to be a documentary style movie. My expectations were low and had an open mind. But when the movie began, it gripped so much that I was fully immersed into the scenes. I felt I was amongst them, the South Africans. This movie has a soul which haunted and inspired me even after the show is over.

It is not an action movie but a drama about a chapter in South African history. In this chapter, Mandela tries to unite the blacks and the whites through the South African Rugby team.

12 July 2010,Apartheid's end meets the World Cup,"Since the World Cup just ended - and it was held in South Africa this year - and since this year marks the twentieth anniversary of Nelson Mandela's release from prison, it seems like a good time to watch Clint Eastwood's ""Invictus"". The movie focuses on Mandela's (Morgan Freeman) goal of using the 1995 Rugby World Cup to unite South Africans of all colors. Freeman plays Mandela perfectly, showing how the leader aimed to balance the wishes of both blacks and whites.

Even if, like me, you know practically nothing about rugby, this movie is still very enjoyable. The point is that Mandiba (Mandela's tribal name) did what he thought was the right thing to do, even at the risk of alienating one side or the other. Another focus within the movie is Springboks captain François Pienaar (Matt Damon). Having been raised under apartheid, Pienaar is not used to having a black leader, but he understands that it is his duty to help unite South Africa.

Admittedly, the movie is a little simplistic in the sense that it makes it look as nothing bad ever happened again after the 1995 World Cup, while crime, poverty and unemployment persist in South Africa to this day. But it is important to realize the role that the tournament played in showing how Nelson Mandela was serious about bringing together his entire country in a common cause, so I definitely recommend it.",8
15 February 2014,Morgan Freeman's finest performance yet,"This movie was a true masterpiece with Morgan Freeman perfectly portraying Nelson Mandela. Co- starring Matt Damon as the captain of South Africa's rugby team the Springboks, Under the Oscar level direction by the great Clint Eastwood. I totally didn't understand why Morgan Freeman didn't win the 2009 Oscar for Best Actor because i thought that he totally deserved it. Matt Damon gives a great performance as well,And i really liked the costume design for the movie. And i don't get why Clint Eastwood wasn't even nominated or even won the Best Director Oscar.I loved this movie and those of you who did not watch this movie yet i recommend that you should watch it but trust me it won't waste your time because of how excellent this motion picture really is.

13 December 2009,Awesome movie,"As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning, I can tell you you the entertaining, inspiring and enjoyable ""Invictus"" exceeded all my expectations.

It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.

I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

8 January 2010,Inspiring and wonderfully directed...,"Clint Eastwood is back with another inspiring and wonderfully directed film. Invictus takes place in 1995 South Africa, a time when President Nelson Mandela was trying to bring his country together. In the movie he accomplishes this through one of the nation's favorite sports - Rugby.

With cast like Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, and a director like Clint Eastwood, we can expect a great film. Invictus doesn't disappoint. The story is well told and there are some wonderful performances by all the cast members. Whats also great is the sound and visuals in the movie. They really captured the sport of Rugby quite well and in doing so they are able to get you into the sport whether you are familiar with it or not.

The sport isn't the main theme of the movie though. What we see is a country that has been torn and aren't ready to accept their new leader. To overcome the apartheid in his country, President Nelson Mandela attempts to unite it by helping it's Rugby team win the world cup. This is a truly inspiring story and shows what people are capable of when they put aside prejudice and work together.

25 January 2015,Good docu-drama,"Good docu-drama on a seminal event in South African history.

Not as good as it could have been though. Clint Eastwood is the master of subtle sentimentality, and here it is overt, and overdone. In addition, the rugby scenes aren't that realistic. More particularly, the thinking appeared to be that bodybuilders make good rugby players, and casting were made accordingly.

Morgan Freeman is great as Nelson Mandela, capturing his mannerisms well. Matt Damon is atrocious as Francois Pienaar, especially in physical appearance. Other than the rugby players, the supporting cast put in good performances.

Not quite a classic, but a very good attempt at one, and Clint Eastwood is allowed to miss every now and again.

24 December 2009,Inspirational and Powerful,"This is what I love about Clint Eastwood's films.In my opinion they're not made to be action blockbusters, they're not made to break records in gross revenue; they're made to inspire and educate. ""Invictus"" tells the story of Nelson Mandela trying to unite an oppressed and divided nation through the South African rugby team. I have to say that the football is not the most engaging piece of work in the film (this is coming from a rugby player and avid rugby fan), but it's the themes derived from this film that make it worth watching. Forget everyone that criticizes Morgan Freeman, he was exceptionally brilliant, one of his best performances to date. The film's title is derived from an old English poem, and it's connection to the film's story only strengthens the true message of one's strength, and him/her fighting for it, to help not only him/herself, but others in the process also.

10 March 2010,"At the age of 79, Eastwood proves he is still a master filmmaker.","Clint Eastwood is not only my favorite hero, but one of my very favourite movie directors. There is a certain way that he uses to direct his films. It is slow-paced, subtle, but concentrated and focused. He doesn't rely on visual effects and smash-cut editing to get the ball rolling for his movies. He doesn't rely on Parkinson's afflicted cameramen during slow moments. No, he does it the good ol' fashioned way. Conservative he may be, but it's that method that distinguishes his craft from others. It's a very recognizable and refreshing trait after seeing giant robots smash each other from screen to screen.

Having said that, Eastwood's latest film ""Invictus"" is a masterpiece. Yes, I mean that. Why? Not because it is a simple story that is not always original, but it is a simple story that is executed beautifully. Eastwood's directorial traits are seen here, and it brilliantly shows. Like Don Siegel and Sergio Leone before him, Eastwood manages to bring out the best, sharpest and most humanistic performances out of the actors in the movie. So what if they all spoke in English? The same thing happened in Schindler's List, did anyone complain?

Moving on to the performances. I swear I was watching the real Nelson Mandela on the screen instead of Morgan Freeman. It is proved that he did not get chosen for this movie based on his uncanny resemblance to Mandela. Here Freeman IS Mandela, he nails the performance, he owns the movie, he is the driving force of the movie. Freeman shows depth as Mandela, as well as wit, dry charm and a huge humble side to him. It's a performance which is nothing short of phenomenal and is really Freeman's role of his career.

Matt Damon is also noteworthy as Pinear, the rugby captain. His South African accent is very convincing, his performance is full of vigor and confidence, and it further solidifies the fact that he is a great actor as well as a great action hero, a fact proved in the ""Jason Bourne"" series. Damon says that working with Eastwood makes him want to emulate Eastwood's career I would love to see that.

With fine performances (even the supporting actors), the simple story is fleshed out in a solid fashion. It may not be original, but it is VERY inspiring to see the Rugby team giving their all to win. For their country. For peace. Eastwood wrings out the richness in such a simple story but since it is true the screen flows strikingly with the brilliant theme of hope and courage.

Not forgetting the jazz-inspired (another Eastwood trait) music and the strikingly beautiful cinematography by Tom Stern, Eastwood, like PIXAR Animation Studios, shows class and versatility as one of Hollywood's most gifted filmmakers and storytellers, and he shows no signs of slowing down or weakening out. This is a must see, for everyone; men, women and even children to see. I give it my highest recommendations.

Overall rating: 10/10.",7

1 March 2010,A Lesson in Leadership,"Allow me to lead you, says Morgan Freeman quietly but authoritatively to his band of party men who are voting for scrapping the Springbok label for South African Rugby team. It is a powerful and defining moment of the film. After taking over as the President of South Africa in 1994, Nelson Mandela sees a huge opportunity to project his country as a multiracial democracy to the world during the 1995 Rugby World Cup. The film, based on John Carlin's book 'Playing the Enemy', is a very poignant delineation of how he goes about this task. Much to the chagrin of his close aides, he invests not an inconsiderable amount of time to befriend the Rugby team captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon). In a very memorable sequence of the film, the President invites the Captain to his office for tea and the two exchange notes on leadership. Invictus offers totally credible lessons on leadership, without even a wee bit of pontification. Winning the World Cup becomes a metaphor for uniting a fractured nation.

Invictus (Latin for invincible) is a short poem by William Ernest Henley that Nelson Mandela had with him when he was incarcerated for 27 years. He hands over this inspiring poem to Francois before the start of the World Cup.

The game sequences, and there are plenty of them, are shot and edited with the right amount of tension and clutch your eyeballs completely.

Morgan Freeman plays Nelson Mandela with great dignity and compassion. Matt Damon as the overawed captain is excellent. Director Clint Eastwood has extracted powerful, yet unobtrusive performances.

Invictus is a little gem of a film. It is hard to stay unaffected during its two odd hours. You are not human if you are unmoved. If I had my way I would make Invictus mandatory viewing for all the politicians of the world.",10
23 January 2010,Another winner for Clint Eastwood,"Is there anything Clint Eastwood can't turn his hand to?

My husband and I saw this movie yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed it. Both Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon were excellent in the film. Matt Damon's accent was totally believable. I personally felt as though, throughout the movie, I was there at the time these things were happening and felt the highs and the lows.

Whilst this movie won't go down as the greatest movie ever, do yourself a favour and go and see it. Morgan Freeman should get an award for his role, and I would even go so far as to say so should Matt Damon. They both did justice to this film.

4 January 2010,"This film will be nominated for some Oscars but won't win, fyi.","At age 80, with 30 films under his belt as a director and scores more as an actor, Clint Eastwood isn't slowing down. He makes almost a film a year, and in recent years, those films are more often than not front-runners come Oscar time. It's not hard to see why he maintains the pace that he does: his films belie not only his talent, but his love of the craft of film-making. When he makes a film that he doesn't star in, as with this year's Invictus or last year's The Changeling, what's surprising is how transparent his hand is. For a man with such an enormously weighty cultural history, for a man whose artistic strides are all over the last half of the last century, his films often contain no ""Clint-ness"". There are few nods to previous films. Each film is made according to the needs of its story. Once the film starts, there's no trading on past achievements. Eastwood rarely revisits the same ground, the way a Scorcese or a Spielberg will, seeming to prefer instead just the work itself. And why not? He gets to tell great stories, working with great people. Why would he stop? Invictus is set in the time leading up to the 1995 World Cup of Rugby in South Africa. The Springboks, the South African national side, are allowed to compete for the first time, having been banned during the Apartheid years, but are far from a favourite. They're not given much of a chance internationally, and they're not loved at home, as the newly-free black population sees them as green-and-gold symbols of Afrikaaner domination. Sensing the unifying potential of a victory on their own home turf, president Mandela (Morgan Freeman) invites captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to tea, and politely asks him to win the World Cup.

What a story to tell – a true tale that would be dismissed as clichéd and obvious, were it a fiction – and what a responsibility for those telling it. Invictus is a rather ordinary film about an extraordinary true event, world history transformed or distilled into a standard sports-redeems-a-man-and-a-community story. The performances are average, for the actors playing them. Damon isn't given much to work with: he is asked to win, and he does, he is asked to hang out with Mandela, an icon, and does. Freeman's Mandela is exactly our conception of him: the kindly, almost doddering father of a people. While there are some few peeks at the more politically calculating side of him, which are interesting, he eventually is swept up, as is everyone in the moment, in the sheer joy of sporting victory. Both are solid, both are about what you would expect.

But what joy the victory brought to the people of South Africa! This joy is communicated to us is through 10 or 12 sweeping shots of jam-packed stadiums, full of people waving flags, jumping, leaping and shouting, done in just the most appalling CGI I have seen in years. It wouldn't be worth mentioning, normally, these few bad shots, but they're so bad that they're jarring. This is also the case with some other choices, including some of the horrendously on-the-nose songs in the score, and the inclusion of some paper-thin back-patty subplots about how Mandela's security Learn to Overcome Their Differences Because of Sports. There's a handful of nettlesome bad choices in the film, enough that they drag it down a bit, and take the joyous edge off of what's otherwise a fine if bog-standard semi-inspirational kind of eye-rolly sports movie. 6/10.",6
19 May 2010,"A One-Note Song or Short Story: Good Thoughts, Undeveloped Movie","Clint Eastwood seems absent from this little movie until the credits at the end. What could have been a powerful little drama ends up being a volley between a hero president of South Africa and a Rugby Field. Granted we know a lot about the extraordinary Nelson Mandela and his surviving imprisonment to be released and form a government that through his inspiration brought an end to Apartheid. This little story about how he focused on encouraging a Rugby team's determination and success in winning the 1995 World Cup for Rugby and for bringing together a splintered country into a unified whole is well worth knowing, but little else happens here - we discover no insights into Nelson Mandela's character or that of his chosen inspirer François Pienaar. Clint Eastwood is usually far more sensitive and dramatic.

The name of the movie is taken from the 1875 poem that inspired Mandela during his years of imprisonment. And it seems appropriate to quote that full poem here: Invictus Out of the night that covers me, Black as the Pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll. I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.

William Ernest Henley

Henley may not have become a poet known for anything else but this poem, but he will always be quoted when it comes to stories such as this one. The superb actor Morgan Freeman endures denture and facial make up and a shaky new accent as Nelson Mandela, but this is a flat performance - OK, but not memorable. Matt Damon obviously buffed up for his role and learned a new accent as François Pienaar and seems to know his mission, but again the performance is flat line and not impressive. The entire cast is adequate for the little they contribute. Yes, we want to love this movie and the ending does make us swell with admiration, but it is the getting there that seems an overwrought and excessive 93 minutes! Worth seeing if only to applaud once again the achievements of Nelson Mandela.

27 February 2010,"Well made, emotion-evoking ""bio-pic"", supported by two outstanding actors","Clint Eastwood has done, once again (but it was highly predictable), a great job, in this unusual bio-pic, in the way the story of Nelson Mandela, being now the president of a country which had kept him prisoner for 24 years, is seen through the adventures of the national rugby team, now become the binding element of whites and blacks.

Morgan Freeman is one thing with Nelson Mandela, reminding him in his physical appearance so perfectly, and he manages to convey the temperament of a man ready to forgive so much, but also self-confident, knowing exactly where he wants to lead his country, and that South Africa will have to become one nation. Matt Demon is always believable, perfectly fit, both physically and psychologically, for his role, and offers moments of deep emotional involvement, mainly when he sees Mandela's former cell and thinks of his suffering past, when the leader's moral inner strength was his only weapon to go on. The movie flows with increasing pathos, bringing to light a strong consciousness of need for fraternity through forgiveness and respect for everyone.

The genius of Clint Eastwood delivers another deep portrait of solid, true, honest men, and in a world always lacerated by false myths, leaves a message in favour of those universal, and ever founding values of human life, so taken for granted in words, but so difficult to find in real life.",
16 October 2015,Union of the State,"Appropriately, this dramatisation of South Africa's famous Rugby World Cup victory in 1995 in their own country, just a few years after Nelson Mandela's release from prison and the nation's re-admission to international sport, was shown while the present competition is occurring (Come on Scotland!). Actually I'm no rugby buff and so without a full working knowledge of the events of the time, bar the conclusion of course, let myself be swept along in a green and gold wave of sporting triumph and nation-building under the aegis of Mandela's benevolent presidency.

The three narrative viewpoints centre on Mandela himself naturally and his transformation of the hard-line body politic in South Africa, the national rugby team captain Francois Pienaar and his evolution from relatively ignorant white Afrikaner to an inspiring one-nation sports idol, inspired by the humanity of Mandela and as a counterpoint microcosm of the new South Africa, the fractious, grudging melding of the established white security detail with Mandela's new black team which naturally goes from mutual dislike and mistrust to eventual respect and cooperation if not outright affection.

In truth there wasn't too much drama to get excited about, as there usually isn't in sporting dramas and I have to say that while I enjoyed the triumph of the underdog and the respected the magnanimity of Mandela's conciliatory vision for his nation, director Eastwood didn't exactly rouse me out of my seat in so doing. I also never quite believed that I was watching Nelson Mandela, as Morgan Freeman, game as he is, just always looked like Morgan Freeman in the film. Damon benefits from being based on a less widely-known character although I understand that physically he resembles Pienaar just about as little as Freeman does Mandela. As ever he engages totally with his role, especially physically so that you believe in his part.

The crowd scenes, especially recreating the stadium-full atmosphere of the Final and the later euphoric street celebrations of black and white alike are well done, even if you don't quite get the full blood and guts effect of fully engaged sport in the matches itself. Eastwood also, as ever, takes plenty of time out for reflective silence and rumination with some obvious exposition inserts too, no doubt with the American viewer in mind (say, how does this extra-time work again?).

Still, it had to be said he does a relatively good job with an assignment which must have been somewhat alien to him and pays proper respect to one of the more notable sporting and national triumphs of recent times.",6
20 April 2011,Invictus,"The truth of why I didn't watch this film until now is that politics and sport are literally the two things attract me least, nevertheless after a second thought, I would like to give Clint Eastwood another chance, anyway, how worse it could be?

So, the after effect is that it does make me apathetic in spite of the fact that technically speaking, Clint Eastwood may not deserve a standing ovation, but actually he did a decent job to strive for a lesser poignant affectation in viewing of the vast backdrop story of a world- famous ex-president of South Africa.

One thing I do enjoy in this film is the cinematography, reminds me of MYSTIC RIVER (2003) and MILLION DOLLAR BABY (2004), my favorite films of Mr. Eastwood (thanks to the same DP Tom Stern). The scene where the plane flied over the stadium is the eureka moment for me, otherwise I must admit that I have seen better.

The two Oscar-nominated leads Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon are surely watchable but way overrated in my own opinion, especially the latter, Matt is physically not a rugby player no matter how hard he tries, also his character is in lack of a deeper excavation. As for old Morgan, his imitation of Mandela is worthy of some compliments but does not make my top 5 list of 2009.

The biography genre usually is Clint's masterpiece, the upcoming biopic of J. Edger has raised my expectation to an utmost peak (finger crossed for Leonardo DiCaprio, Naomi Watts, Armie Hammer and Judi Dench). Hope it will get Mr. Eastwood another culmination as personally I show more respect towards those late bloomers.",6
16 June 2010,Top of His Game,"Clint Eastwood is one of the greatest directors in the history of film making. Invictus is another fantastic movie in the Eastwood resume. Invictus is not about Rugby, but about pulling a nation together with Rugby being the catalyst that helps to heal and unite South Africa. Morgan Freeman is perfectly cast as Nelson Mandela. Freeman is once more at the top of his game and brings heart and character to the performance. Matt Damon is very good as Francois Pienaar. Eastwood brings the best out of Damon and we see more of Damon's acting chops than we have seen in previous films. Invictus is a great film with wonderful direction and storytelling. Invictus is indicative of Clint Eastwood and highly recommended.

16 October 2010,An event that helped shape a nation,"As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning, I can tell you you the entertaining, inspiring and enjoyable ""Invictus"" exceeded all my expectations.

It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.

I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

Viva Clint Eastwood, viva Morgan Freeman, viva Madiba.

PS. I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.

Of the films Eastwood has directed, my favorites, in no particular order, are ""Unforgiven"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Gran Torino"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"",""Bird"" and ""Invictus"". Yes, it's really that good. ""Invictus"" is another winner from Clint. He just seems to get better with age. What a creative roll he is currently on.

PPS. ""Invictus"" is one of the best sporting movies I have ever seen. But it's also about more than sport.",9
6 June 2010,A Gem...,"Clint Eastwood brings us 'Invictus', a inspiring true story. Based on events in South Africa before and durning the 1995 Rugby World Cop, hosted in the country following the dismantling of apartheid. Nelson Mandela eyes are haunting, his sacrifice is haunting, his power and his deeds to it are haunting. Eastwood beautifully brings out a successful dream of this Legendary Man! He sets inspirations in you, he makes a terrific film that is hosted with emotions.

Some films are memorable and 'Invictus' is one of those GEMS. It's so fascinating to see someone reach it's goal with success, so much of belief and intelligence. Your gripped, moved and inspired in those 132 minutes. Eastwood elaborates beautifully, this easily ranks amongst his best efforts.

Morgan Freeman becomes Mandela, he takes us to the journey as being him. The Legendary Actor delivers a knock-out performance after a long, long time. Matt Damon is superb, playing a real life character with a perfect South African accent. In fact, These 2 actors make 'Invictus' a much more over-whelming experience.

'Invictus' is a must watch... such gems are to be witnessed! Two Thumbs Up!",8
16 June 2018,"It's not about making people happy, but uniting them in happiness...","FIFA World Cup just started providing its share of thrills, joys, and deceptions. While I was watching the Moroccan team yesterday, my right foot was uncontrollably trembling, my heart pounding at the national anthem and everyone was glued to the screen with the kind of frozen expression that that only Sports can draw on faces.

And tough memories resurfaced, twenty years ago, we had scored three goals against Scotland in one of ""these games""; I was tying my shoes, everyone was getting ready to celebrate our qualification to the quarter finals in the street... but Brazil that had previously beat us with three goals against none, the World Champion and team of Ronaldo (bald Ronaldo, not Cristiano) lost against Norway in what should have been an open-and-shut case. A penalty kick at the last minute destroyed all hopes. My brother cried and I took off my shoes.

Twenty years later, history, cruelly again, decided to repeat itself, at the last minute, in the worst possible way, one of our players scored against the team, earning Iran the precious victory and filling our hearts with bitterness. See, one can also understand the power of Sport from defeat, sport unites and brings back positive energy for a brief but exhilarating period. It also creates extraordinary bonds between people who had nothing in common except quivering for the same colors. Sports mark a truce, awakening feelings whose negative counterparts are nourished by war and political conflicts the rest of the time.

Sport is essential to one country; it is essential to the world.

And as I watched Clint Eastwood's ""Invictus"" one day before the kick off, I felt like I could read in the mind of Nelson Mandela, played in all nuance and depth by Morgan Freeman. What an ironically fitting name for an African leader who was quite the opposite of a ""free man"" for ten thousand days of his life.

Indeed, some iconic artists achieved greatness and died in 27 years, for Mandela, it was the time spent in jail that allowed him to free his mind from hatred and resentment, to achieve his personal greatness through humility, forgiveness and humanity. The film starts at his release as he's cheerfully welcomed by black people while the whites expect the worst. ""End Apartheid"" was the slogan that the majority of today's population wouldn't remember, not even South Africans... but the miracle happened and Mandela, Madiba as he's respectfully and affectionately called, almost rhymed with Messiah.

""Can he run a country?"" asks a militant newspaper, Mandela's bodyguard sees a hate campaign but Madiba lucidly says ""it's a legitimate question"", he's already approaching his role as a unifier not a divider. Coming to office, he invites the skeptical whites to stay unless they think there are irreconcilable differences, what he does is giving them a choice, a freedom, a gift only a man of his experience could value. He also hires white bodyguards and their interactions with the previous team plays like a great microcosm of the reconciliation built up throughout the film, with the power of Sports. Because ""Invictus"" isn't a biography film as much as it's a Sports film.

Mandela has great scopes of achievements... and failures as well, his prestige was a double-edged sword that can earn him hostility from the Afrikaners and when facing unemployment, poverty, and criminality, sports could be perceived as the least of the priorities. The genius of Mandela is to take sport damn seriously, he watches a rugby game and discovers that the Blacks support any team against the Springboks, he's booed by supporters who proudly brandish the old flag and concedes it's a constitutional right. But when he learns that the ANC is going to replace the team with a new name, new colors and hymn, he asks everyone to reconsider the vote, taking time to explain why they're wrong.

Mandela wasn't just that all-smiling icon; like Gandhi, he was a natural-born leader. Warned by his secretary about the risk of losing his power, he reminds her that a true leader should be guided by his principles, not fears, he knows reconciliation is impossible without the Springboks. As much as the Whites must forget, the Blacks must forgive. It's not political but human calculation (one of the film's great quotes). Mandela then meets the team captain François Pinaar (Matt Damon) and the two men realize they speak the same language, François always wanted victory but after his pivotal encounter, he understands that the country, hosting the 1995 World Cup, needs the victory, sports don't just make people happy; it unites them in happiness. It was twice a miracle because because South Africa had to play against the iconic All-Blacks whose haka could scare enough to guarantee a victory.

""Invictus"" isn't just an underdog movie, it chronicles every single effort that made a miracle possible, because the miracle-maker was a miracle by himself. Visiting his cell, François realizes that he could touches two facing walls by simply spreading his arms. Anyone can survive 27 years of jailing, but can any soul? Mandela was the Captain of his soul as he was master of his fate and overcame his demons. François spreads the good word to the team, and like an apostle to a saint (but the film doesn't over-sanctify them) meetings are arranged with young Black kids from the poorer areas. And for once, they forget about soccer and learn about rugby not just from Chester, the only Black player.

The team also they learn the hymn ""Schosholoza"", that haunting melody that reminded me of that magical World Cup in Africa in 2014. The team had to win, and they won, the rest was history. Mandela understood the magic of Sports and used it as a political tool but a human miracle.

Maybe Morocco should watch this film before their next game against Portgual... after all, it ain't over until the referee blows his whistle.",9
15 August 2018,An interesting mix of sports and politics,"Invictus is an interesting mix of sports and politics, but it lacks the passion of either subject. The film feels flat even though the subject matter is intriguing. Also, it's hard to get caught up in a game that you don't understand.

27 June 2010,A Very Inspiring Story,"Nelson Mandela is one of the very few people I can think of (and certainly the only one living today) to whom I would be willing to apply the adjective ""great."" His personal story of rising from imprisonment under apartheid to becoming the first black President of South Africa is a powerful testimony to perseverance and forgiveness, as instead of using his newly acquired power to take revenge on those who had oppressed he and his people, he chose to use his power to promote reconciliation. The world would be so much better off today if there were more Mandelas! ""Invictus"" offers just a small part of that story. Shortly after the advent of majority rule, South Africa hosted the World Cup of rugby. South Africa's own rugby team was (with one exception) all white, and had been hated by the black majority during the apartheid era. Mandela chose to use the team as a way to promote unity in the country. The disunity was shown in many ways - Mandela's own presidential bodyguards (some black and some white) were highly suspicious of each other, and in a match against England before the tournament the black spectators cheered for England. By publicly supporting the team, Mandela brought other blacks onside as well, and brought blacks and whites together as they all rallied around the team. It was really very moving to watch the barriers come crashing down in so many ways.

Morgan Freeman was very good as Mandela - as good as anyone could have played the difficult part of a man who is truly a living legend. Matt Damon was excellent as the captain of the Springboks (the name of the South African team.) His family were suspicious of Mandela, and yet once he actually met Mandela, he quickly bought into the desire to unify the country around the symbol of the team. Damon seemed to capture the essence of the character well.

I'm not a rugby fan, so the actual scenes of the matches meant little to me (although they were very well shot, and did offer an sort of ""you are there"" type of experience.) There was some beautiful scenery shot in the course of the movie and you do feel moved as - so to speak - the walls come tumbling down.",9
6 September 2010,"Another competent, polished Eastwood effort","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

In 1990, after nearly thirty years incarceration, Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) is released and becomes ruler of South Africa, signalling an end of the apartheid era and a new, more democratic nation setting in. However, there is social unease, as the national sport, rugby, is still under the moniker of the Springboks, a symbol of the pro apartheid era. However, Mandela hopes his nation to embrace a new notion of forgiveness, hopefully learning from his example towards his captors. After a series of meetings with celebrated Springboks captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) he sets a chain of events in motion that sees the team on course to victory at the 1995 Rugby Championships.

At a time in his life and career where he prefers to be behind the camera rather than in front of it, Clint Eastwood is always very surprising in the choice of tale he brings to the big screen. Here is yet another surprising but effective story, brought to life with the professional standards you can always expect from Eastwood.

In the lead role, Freeman, always an actor Eastwood gets the best from, plays Mandela in his sleep, but is blessed to capture his accent and mannerisms just fine, too. Likewise, Damon is well suited to the role of Springboks captain Pienaar, with the physical presence and stature to convince, but also evokes emotion by delivering a moving portrait of a man startled by another's ability to forgive and overcome. As the two lead stars of the film, they have even better chemistry than you might originally have thought.

Director, stars and pretty much everyone involved have come together and delivered something fine. ****",9

26 October 2010,once again Morgan Freeman proves he's greatness,"After watching this, I'm surprised Morgan Freeman didn't win the Oscar. I guess because he's won before is why they didn't give it to him. He was great, but I would only say the movie was average. Mainly because the movie was too long and the final half hour was just the rugby match. It went on too long. Plus, as someone whom knows nothing about rugby, it just made it boring watching all those scenes. That should have been cut down to make the film come in at 2 hours. And I'm not sure why Matt Damon got nominated for awards. His accent was awful and seemed to come and go. And his character had few dramatic scenes. What did he do besides tell his team to listen to the crowd singing and a whole country supporting them.

FINAL VERDICT: It's long. I recommend it if you want to see a great acting performance or if you are watching it on DVD so you can stop it a few times. I couldn't sit through it in one viewing.

7 January 2010,Far Better than i Expected !,"In general , i am not a fan of Eastwood works, and to be honest i didn't like ""Million Dollar Baby "" at all, therefore, the moment i have seen the poster of the "" Invictus"" i thought that it will be another ""Million Dollar Baby"" except for having Matt Damon as the fresh ingredient of the whole thing.

Knowing that the film was about a certain thing that happened during Mandela's Time as a president of South Africa dragged my attention toward the film, and that was the reason for me to watch it. beside the quality of the film story, the film was well directed, brilliantly acted, and well served. Most of the film , i felt as if was living in South Africa in that time, and every single moment in the film i've seen my self reacted anxiously toward it.

My advice to is to watch the movie, even if you didn't like political, or biography films , but Invictus is something else !",9

This man truly loves cinema and telling stories but at the same time he also respects the reality of the source and attempts to stay true to them and the viewers. 'Invictus' tells the story of Nelson Mandela surrounding the 1995 Rugby match that was a historical victory for South Africa and a glorious 'union' for its people. While many of us know how the movie ends, it is the subtle inclusion of the strong themes, layers of the story and how the story unfolds that make 'Invictus' a very strong and poignant film. Moreover, this film is more historically accurate than a majority of Hollywood movies that claim to be 'based on a true story'. In addition, there is some great writing involved, especially in the dialogues. I also liked how Eastwood portrayed the racial tension with sheer subtlety.

Morgan Freeman is truly remarkable as Madeba. His diction may be faulty at times but he gets most of the nuances right. Matt Damon is splendid as Francois Pienaar as he gives a spirited performance. The supporting cast is strong. I particularly liked the actress who played the Pienaar's maid.

I am reluctant to categorize 'Invitus' as a 'sports' movie because it's about so much more than sports but if it is labeled under the sports section, then it is one of the best of that genre. Not only does it have soul, but 'Invictus' is very true to its history. Hats off to Eastwood and his crew, hats off to Pienaar and his team, hats off to the good people of South Africa and finally to the great Madeba.",

I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

Viva Clint Eastwood, viva Morgan Freeman, viva Madiba.

PS. I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.

Of the films Eastwood has directed, my favorites, in no particular order, are ""Unforgiven"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Gran Torino"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"",""Bird"" and ""Invictus"". Yes, it's really that good. ""Invictus"" is another winner from Clint. He just seems to get better with age. What a creative roll he is currently on.

PPS. ""Invictus"" is one of the best sporting movies I have ever seen. But it's also about more than sport.",4
29 December 2012,I Think He Wants Us to Win the World Cup,"Over the past few weeks, the world has seen the release of two very well made sports movies. First we received The Blind Side, and now Invictus, the latest from Clint Eastwood. The 79 year old actor—whose best known for his roles as grizzled lawmen—has certainly proved his ability as a filmmaker during his twilight years, and Invictus is no exception. Thankfully, he doesn't seem to be slowing down one iota.

Invictus tells the story of Nelson Mandela (Freeman), the former President of South Africa and the man credited with unifying a country riddled with racism and turmoil in the wake of apartheid. Given Mandela's astonishing achievements, one would think the movie would be laden with dramatic flashbacks that clearly highlight the struggle he suffered as a prisoner for 27 years. Eastwood, it seems, has decided to take a different approach to telling this story.

The catalyst for this particular tale is rugby; a sport that many Americans know nothing about (admittedly, I knew little about the game going into the theater, but I did feel as if I had a better grasp of the sport as a whole when I walked out). This could easily be viewed in a negative way, as the bulk of the third act is focused solely on the rugby World Cup match that took place in 1995. Eastwood clearly revels in the brutality of the sport, as it nicely symbolizes the struggle the country was going through at that time. When teams lock arms and spar over field position, it's clear just how painful the process is, and this adds even more depth to the same issues that—unlikely as it is— District 9 grappled with only a few months earlier.

Matt Damon plays Francois Pienaar, captain of the South African rugby team. This is a role that seems well-suited to Damon, whose solemn determination is exactly what Mandela needed as a face for the symbolic triumph over prejudice that he saw embodied in the competition. The acting honors, however, clearly go to Freeman. If there's anyone who was destined to play Mandela, it's him—Freeman's mastery of the man's mannerisms, accent, and general presence is astounding. There aren't really any scenes that call for the emotional outbursts typically needed to garner an Oscar nod, but I have a feeling the sheer power of the movie as a whole will land Freeman a much deserved nomination.

That's the thing about Invictus–at its core, it seems to be nothing more than an inspirational sports film, but there are many other issues rippling just beneath the surface. One could nitpick about the decision to film this ""documentary style,"" with only limited (extremely limited) glimpses into Mandela's past, and I'd have to agree that it leaves a little bit of a hole in an otherwise absorbing movie. The message it sends to audiences, though, is what makes the final product so effective. And that, of course, is that athletics play a very important role in any society: they act as the ultimate unifying medium. Themes of bias and discrimination generate a lot tension, but when the final match is underway, everyone puts their differences aside (and inadvertently comes to the realization that we're all one and the same).

As far as motivational sports films go, you could do a lot worse, and the patient directorial eye of Eastwood will cause you to linger on every frame. I wouldn't say the movie is unforgettable, but it is a welcome pick-me-up that takes an optimistic stance on the nature of mankind.",7
27 March 2015,"Inspirational and Powerful,","Invictus is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It is a very powerful film with an inspirational message and a very inspired cast. Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon both deliver outstanding performances, they are both actors that, while I always enjoy seeing them in movies, they tend to always play very similar characters, safe roles that they are use to playing, but they both play very different roles in this, and their voices are unrecognisable. The role of Nelson Mandela is one of Morgan Freeman's greatest performances, he completely owns this film, he delivers his dialogue with great passion and you could tell he did research in to Mandela to prepare. Powerful performances and an inspiring true story, I would recommend Invictus to anyone looking for a good drama or history film.

President Nelson Mandela tries to unite a segregated South Africa by championing the national rugby team.

Best Performance: Morgan Freeman Worst Performance: Marguerite Wheatley",8
20 May 2010,The Vidiot Reviews...,"Invictus

If Rugby Union executives wish to make their sport as popular in America as it is in other countries, they should consider adding alleged rapists to their teams. And while this drama doesn't attempt to expound rugby's limited appeal, it is an allegory for the unification of South Africa.

Elected president shortly after his release from prison, Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) faces a splintered nation still reeling from apartheid. To alleviate tensions between whites and non-whites, he enlists the local rugby team – in particular its captain (Matt Damon) – to help unify citizens through athletics.

Directed by Clint Eastwood, Invictus is a superbly acted film that bespeaks of South Africa's segregated past, but never overtly. Instead, it focuses on the positive aspects of the country's 1995 Rugby World Cup run.

Nevertheless, while it works for this overlooked sport, the combined forces of Damon, Freeman and Eastwood could never make Cricket seem cool. (Green Light)",7

31 January 2010,One of the most moving films of the decade!,"Being South African, I clearly remember the Rugby World Cup of 1995 and what it meant to our country. Clint Eastwood has managed to capture those events, emotions, the atmosphere and the coming of a nation in this film flawlessly. Everything from casting to historical accuracy was perfect. I am truly proud that I experienced the events that led to the production of this film.

Superb performances by both Freeman and Damon, with Matt Damon pulling off the South African accent very very well and Freeman playing a fantastic Mandela.

Great movie, great story, great acting, great cast, great direction. Highly highly recommended.

27 February 2010,An emotional ride back to the past,"As a fellow South African no longer living in South Africa and having Rugby very close to my heart this movie is an inspiration to watch. Having had the pleasure of meeting President Mandela (Madiba) and also having met briefly the South African Rugby team for 1995, this movie hits home and deep in my heart.

A good depiction of what was going on then. South Africa was crying out for a single act of unification. An act that would unite all colours under one banner and a single moment in history that defines the spirit, compassion and healing that South Africa was going through at the time.

Thank you Mr. Clint Eastwood. Morgan Freeman was perfect in his role as Madiba. I've met Madiba and Morgan pulled it off brilliantly. Matt Daymon also played his role well and it is not easy pulling off a movie like this.

Thank you to all the crew that made this film. Mandela wanted to feel a single moment in history of healing with the power of joy! This monumental feat and WIN for South Africa's Springboks and the way Madiba brought the country together using Rugby, was a time to remember.

Head this all out there in the world. South Africa is a tough place to grow up and South African's are proud of that. It is movies like this that remind us of home and for 90 minutes we are back there, experiencing the spirit and love that ALL South Africans share.

Thank you",10
11 February 2022,A solid sports drama,"A little bit hit-and-miss, though 'Invictus' still manages to produce the requirements for a solid sports drama.

Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon are two actors I enjoy a lot, but by the end of this 2009 film I was a tad underwhelmed by them. Freeman as Nelson Mandela sounds great on paper, but in reality you kinda lose what makes Freeman so great - his voice, given he has to act with a South African accent. He still does a good job nevertheless, I just don't think I'll remember this particular portrayal of Mandela - unlike Idris Elba's attempt in 2013's 'Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom'.

The merging of the two plot points - politics and rugby union - is done well, though the former is easily more interesting than the latter... and I say that as someone who loves sport and dislikes politics!

It's one that is worth a watch, it just didn't give me anything to remember.",7
7 July 2016,"So-so Sporting Sequences, Uplifting Screenplay","The sporting sequences in Clint Eastwood's film are so-so; despite the guttural grunts on the soundtrack, it's clear the actors will never be successful rugby players. The commentary on the game(s) is replete with expressions that would not be used in rugby-playing countries; this is inevitable, perhaps, when the film is aimed at mass audiences, the majority of whom are not au fait with the game's rules.

Yet such shortcomings should not detract from a highly uplifting film that shows how Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) not only managed to unify the country during that magical year of 1995, but preached a message of hope and forgiveness that everyone could understand. Director Clint Eastwood and screenwriter Anthony Peckham are very good at depicting South Africa in the immediate aftermath of Mandela's release, when the whites and blacks had to try to get used to living as equals. This is well illustrated in the subplot involving the security guards, led by Jason (Tony Kgoroge), with white subordinates who up until a few years previously had been arresting their black counterparts. With their sharp suits and stony expressions, the white guards, led by Hendrick (Matt Stern) look especially fearsome.

Mandela's way of reconciling the two races was simple; not just to supplant one regime with another, but to try and reconcile everyone. Hence his insistence on preserving the Springbok name and colors for the rugby team. The sequence where he enters a meeting and overturns a majority black vote to ban the name is especially affecting; Mandela speaks slowly and in measured tones, without trying to antagonize anyone.

The central relationship between Mandela and South African rugby captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) has been cleverly handled. While Pienaar wants to adapt to the new South Africa, it's clear he is not sure how to do so, until Mandela invites him to afternoon tea. In this oh-so-tranquil of surroundings Mandela outlines his vision and the means to accomplish it, not by imposing his will on anyone but encouraging consensus. It is a lesson well learned; in the World Cup Final when South Africa are trailing the All Blacks, Pienaar calls his team together into a huddle and reminds them of why they are playing the game, not just for themselves but the entire nation.

The title INVICTUS comes from a poem by the nineteenth century British writer W. H. Henley, emphasizing the importance of listening to the gods but remaining ""the captain of one's soul."" This is a lesson both Mandela and Pienaar are well aware of, as together they lead their country into a new era of national unity.",8
28 September 2015,So moving and inspiring,"Nelson Mandela will always be a role model. He had so much compassion for the people around him. He believed in the Human being that we are able to elevate ourselves and accomplish things we thought we could never be able to. The power of the Human will, the Power of We when we come together to achieve a common goal.

Invictus is making him justice and is such an awesome tribute to this great man nicknamed Madiba. I cried a lot during this movie I still do each time I watch this awesome movie. In this world full of selfishness and violence, Invictus is like a fresh sunshine. There is no war no blood no violence. Just Unity, love, compassion and sport.

Sport is a mean to achieve peace between us, something which brings us together and allows us to achieve great things. Mandela realized it and used his National Rugby Team, once a symbol of the Apartheid which torn up the country he cherished the most for such a long time, to bring his Nation together and win the World Cup. This event was just a way to achieve a greater goal and it worked.

There would be no one better than Clint Eastwood, who as Mandela, is believing in the Human Being, to direct this awesome tribute. This movie is so enlightening, so moving, so inspiring it will make everyone cry of happiness and joy. It is also very sober, very simple only relying on the great talent of the actors to make a wonderful masterpiece.

Morgan Freeman is just so impressive in the role of Nelson Mandela. He shows his aura throughout the movie and he is proving once again he is such an awesome actor who can make us feel beautiful emotions. He is one of the kind and I can't see no one else to impersonate such a powerful role model.

Matt Damon is also awesome in playing Francois Pienaar the Springboks captain. He is inspiring in every scene he appears especially when he tries to tell his rugby fellow players that they are much worthier than they think they are. He is moving as he invited them to play and explain Rugby rules to young black kids in the ghettos surrounding Pretoria.

So yes we definitely need to see more movies like this which we are able to see how awesome the Human Being can be. This movie brings something very beautiful and pushes us to believe in ourselves and to come together to achieve great things. It counterbalances selfishness and greed with replacing them with compassion and unity.

So thank you so much Mr Mandela and Mr Eastwood for this awesome lesson of life. And may other will follow your path. x",10
10 October 2010,I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.,"Invictus is an inspiring film, based on a novel, and the novel being based on Nelson Mandela's legendary presence in South Africa.

Clint Eastwood... Matt Damon... Morgan Freeman... what talent! You also see Scott Eastwood quite often. The acting is great, but the main power of this film is the story.

The film isn't as tedious as one might assume, it actually flows quite well. Although this film doesn't have a heavily climatic plot, the laid-back approach allowed the main focus to be the greatness of the story rather than the need for excessive drama.

Enjoy this film, it's both inspirational and enjoyable.

The name Invictus comes from the poem written by William Ernest Henley, which inspired Nelson Mandela in the worst of his times.

Beauty through and through.",10
17 February 2010,The power of sport,"To make a good sports film you need a top class director, talented actors, and a theme that is more then the sport. Invictus is a film with ambitions of not just telling the story about how South Africa won the Rugby World Cup in 1995, but also about the early days of Nelson Mandala's presidency and the importance of the events for the new South Africa.

In 1994, Nelson Mandala (Morgan Freeman) is elected to be president of South Africa. Mandala starts a reconciliation process, after members of former Apartheid government to remain in their jobs if they wanted to. He also brought in members of the Apartheid security services to act as his bodyguards with his ANC bodyguards. Despite these efforts and his popularity, he still needs to find of uniting Black people who do not want Mandala to sell out and ensure he can provide on issues like crime, housing and social cares, whilst to reassure the White population that he isn't going to attack them and wants them to be a part of the new South Africa, and wants them to contribute. Mandala sees the best way to unite the nation is by sport, a weapon that was used against the Apartheid government with a boycott. South Africa had been picked to host the Rugby World Cup. But the South African rugby team, the Springbok, are unfit, lack experience and lack support of the Black population. They are calls to rename, and change the colours of the Springbok. But Mandala prevents this, and he asks the team's captain François Pienaar (Matt Damon) to inspire his team.

This is two films in one, a political film/bio-pic about Mandala trying to change South Africa and avoid either one race dominating the other, and of course a sport film about how an underdog defincing the odds. It took great skill by the screenwriter Anthony Peckham and the director Clint Eastwood. The political story is the most interesting aspect, with Mandala doing a forgive and forget reconciliation process, similar to Konrad Adenauer in West Germany after the Second World War. The ideas is for successful transition a government then you need to keep the same structure and allow professional civil servants to remind in their positions. Compare this to Post war Iraq where all the government system was dismantled, and all Ba'ath party members were executed from system, and helping turn that nation into right royal mess. There is also a financial reason why Mandala wanted to win over the whites, because they controlled the purse strings of South Africa, and also control the police and army. Mandala is shown to be a very intelligent man, who calmly argues his case and goes against easy political populism because he wants to improve South Africa for the long team. But he is also a man with family troubles and health issues, but wants to do the best for his country. The World Cup story is about how the underdogs of the whole tournament won, beating the likes of France and Australia. Pienaar and Mandala have to lead the team both on and off the field against tough competition. Their efforts help unite the nation. This is a cleaver film that tells this story. Fans of political films will like it. Fans of rugby will like it.

As well as the story, there are two great leads, Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon. Morgan Freeman is the only Hollywood actor who could Mandala, having both the look, and the acting talent. He plays Mandala as an intelligent, insightful man who is committed on improving his nation. He is quick witted, and they is a tragedy about his family problems. Freeman does do the Mandala voice well most of the time, but there are some moments where his voices slips into sounding like Red from the Shawshank Redemption. Matt Damon also does a good job playing a man who is less insightful, but a good sportsman and a good leader. He is one of the few White South Africans who isn't hostile to Mandala's presidency. Matt Damon builds up really well to play a professional rugby player, and does a believable South African accent. It's a shame there wasn't more of him in the film.

Clint Eastwood is obviously one of the best directors in Hollywood, having directed films like Unforgiven and Letter from Iwo Jima. But I think his direction of this film would be no different to any decent director, particularly the political scenes. But the rugby scenes are very good, from feeling like you are either in the stadium, watching from the stands, to being in the heart of the action. For an American Eastwood has a good understanding of the sport. I also liked that he casted former Bath player Zak Feaunati as Jonah Lomu.

Whilst the film is a very solid piece of work and people will enjoy it, there are some minor criticisms. The antagonism between the black and white bodyguards felt too staged, too Hollywood. It should have been less arguments, but more bitter. There also the Hollywood cliché of the guards overcoming their dislike for each other, playing rugby and again feeling staged. They were also some other moments that are hard to believe like a black boy listening to the World Cup final with the police on their car radio. Mandala also seemed a bit too obsessed with Rugby, seeming like he didn't govern on other important issues, and also skirted over issues like Mandala health and family problems. The film was also ignoring that there are still problems with South African sports, with rugby and cricket being played mostly by white people, whilst football (or Soccer to my North American friends) is seen as the black people's sport.

This is a good, entertaining film, with two good leads who deserve their Oscars nods, but it's not Clint Eastwood at his very best.",8
24 December 2009,"Heavy-handed and awkward in places, but moving too","Some moving and memorable scenes here, backed by excellent acting by the leads and many of the supporting actors.

Unfortunately, the movie was marred by somewhat choppy editing, in which characters seemed to appear and disappear for no good reason, and more important by heavy-handed explanatory sections near the beginning. Every line Morgan Freeman says, in a powerful role as Nelson Mandela, comes across as cumbersome and unnatural, as if he were speaking for a debate class. The natural flow of the plot was continually interrupted by long, gratuitous speeches.

It cannot be denied that many of the final scenes, and perhaps the whole last hour of the film, was powerful. But the first part seemed too didactic, and I had trouble following or caring about many of the numerous minor characters.

3 July 2013,Sports can create and/or strengthen unity,"Usually I am not much into sports and related movies, but certain directors and actors make an exception. Clint Eastwood is definitely one of them; I happened to see his Trouble With the Curve first and I was sure that focusing on genuine sports battle would not be the main theme here either. And it was so: the main topic is how rugby had its part in creating inter-racial confidence in South Africa right after abolishment of apartheid, and what was the role of South African President Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South Africa rugby union team (Springboks) François Pienaar -- played by Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, respectively (and giftedly). The scenes - based on real events and a strong book - run smoothly, the choice of background music is just to the point, and viewers get a versatile picture of one of the 20th century greatest statesman whose desire and aim was to create a ""all-inclusive"" society, without punishing those who just were ordinary employees and workers during the previous segregated system (different from the case with socialist leaders who mostly deprived, deported or killed most ""carriers"" of previous social order). Of course, Mandela was highly educated and lettered, not like e.g. Stalin or Mao Zedong...

Invictus is a nice movie, providing additional and realistic knowledge of life in South Africa in the 1990ies, and encourages to use popular activities/games/sports etc. in leveling confrontations.",8
4 June 2010,Really good drama,"When I first time heard for this movie I was astonished . I didn't see something like this so I expected good movie . Theme is really attracting and I saw ratings and I decided to wait for its cinema release . Movie was released in December but in Croatia it was in March so I decide to wait it on DVD . I would feel stupid if I watch something what will be released for two months . There are few interesting facts like its Oscar nominations . Great two leading roles were really good fact . Trailer didn't show much things but then I got it o DVD . This isn't wasting time and I was really astonished how movie is good .

Clint Eastwood as director was world class . Maybe this movie isn't in level of his masterpieces like Gran Torino but it is really good . This isn't some dramatic movie but it is in spirit of whole atmosphere . I can't see anything extremely bad about this movie . Eastwood is one of the best directors and actors and now he confirmed his sense for directing . I can see that he made one drama with nice atmosphere soul and complicated situations . This isn't some movie which can beat some dramas because of its sometimes too idyllic moments . It is really good drama and it is easily winning watcher's heart .

Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela was really excellent . You can see how his experience is bringing quality to this movie . His great acting is again confirmed with one really conclusive acting mixed with his great narrative parts . There weren't any special mistakes so his acting was great . He definitely was brilliant with his strong performance and his physically similar look with Mandela . This movie is really nicely showing problems and happiness so Freeman was on level .

Matt Damon as Francois Pienaar wasn't so good as Freeman but also very conclusive acting . He was maybe too unhappy during movie but he showed great spirit . I think he was also great choice for this role . His appearance was maybe great showing of his character acting . He really has a sense for acting so we could see it in this movie . I think he is one of the best younger actors . He didn't show some mistakes so it was really good .

All in one really good drama . I am definitely recommending this movie.",9
27 January 2010,"""It is a human calculation""","As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning, I can tell you you the entertaining, inspiring and enjoyable ""Invictus"" exceeded all my expectations.

It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.

I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

Viva Clint Eastwood, viva Morgan Freeman, viva Madiba.

25 December 2009,Clint Eastwood does it again.,"Don't know how Clint Eastwood does it.

The Cast, the story line, in fact everything outstanding once again.

Anybody who didn't enjoy this movie needs a brain scan.

This was not an easy topic, in fact it was very complex and yes maybe a few errors along the way but SFW, it was a job well done again. Towards the end of the movie I was biting my nails as if I was watching that final match all over again and not to mention what a great man Mandela is and alway's will be. Thanks to Morgan Freeman's terrific performance. Matt Damon - brilliant once again as well.

I walked out of the cinema wishing Nelson Mandela was still the president of South Africa.

Brilliant all round.",10
25 May 2019,Great film,"Morgan Freeman is believable as Nelson Mandela and evokes his great presence. A truly good film that captures the emotions of the time and how a sport united a nation together. It is indeed a great political tool used by Mandela that worked magic and a great time to be captured by the film. A great piece of history brought to life that saw the springboks win the world cup. Freeman who portrays Mandela brings the emotion and hope alive in this film as it existed during that time.

13 December 2009,A Film That Inspires Greatness,"After being imprisoned for thirty years, a man steps out of a tiny cell, and he is ready to forgive the people who put him there. Invictus is a movie that inspires greatness. It's difficult to see this film and remain unaffected by such a heartwarming and inspirationally true story.

In every moment of the film, you can feel the relaxed hand of Eastwood, painting this rich and important story with his trademark of gracefulness and understatement. With each film that he makes, Eastwood sheds a new layer of his vision. His ideas and consummate understanding of the world gel, and through his talent, they become magnificent pieces of storytelling that will be talked about for a long time. As his career advances, Eastwood's films only get better; they're mature and always from the heart.

Morgan Freeman's performance of Mandela is so fluent that he disappears in the persona and becomes almost unrecognizable in the role. He had been preparing for this role since the early 1990s when the two of them met and the President confessed his personal desire for Freeman to be his sole on-screen counterpart. He believed that Freeman would be the ""right"" man to play him in a film. After almost twenty years of on-and-off preparation, the performance is flawless. Freeman is like a chameleon; he becomes Mandela.

Matt Damon is extraordinary. Physically, he does not look like Pienaar, but he embodies the spirit of the man. In each of his scenes, you see a man's conscience burning within him, driving him to satisfy his hunger for greatness. Mandela's vision inspires him to lead and become the example that everyone looks to for hope.

The film is about lots of things, but for no other reason, why not see a film that educates us in what it truly means to be human? Unconditional love and compassion for all. I do not care what the Oscars have to say--this film is a winner.",10
14 November 2015,Good but not great,"This was good but not as good as I was expecting it to be what with Matt Damon, Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood directing. Actually it was kind of average with some very long winded sections of dialogue (speeches) and a mediocre outcome to the World Cup.

Usually I get all wrapped up in inspirational sports dramas but this final game was kinda meh, with continual cuts back and forth to the crowd, the game, people watching or listening at assorted venues. I guess I was also expecting the movie to be more about the rugby and less about the politics, although I did enjoy the glimpses we get into Mandela's personal life.

Truthfully about an hour into the movie the most interesting thing going was the ""rainbow"" team of the presidential guard and how they were interacting with each other and handling their new boss. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Nelson Mandela is very good though and Matt Damon puts on a decent South African accent (and certainly got in shape for this role) but the story itself was kinda tedious.

It follows newly elected president Mandela as he inspires the (losing) 1995 South African rugby team to strive for the world cup in hopes of soothing the country's racial tensions.",7
13 June 2016,Solid Drama That Weaves on The Topics of Politics and Sports,"As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning, I can tell you you the entertaining, inspiring and enjoyable ""Invictus"" exceeded all my expectations.

It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.

I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

2 September 2014,Unity through sports,"The movie tell's the story elements very well with enough proportions indeed. It's about overcoming old hatreds in a post apartheid environment, and that subject is depicted very well in scenes and images, some are subtle enough while some are striking yet none reach the stage of being disturbing. It's also about sports, with the rugby parts depicted quite totally without having to be too technical about the sport it self. I like how Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman done their accents. Those give the more authentic feel to the characters. Yes it's not as good as other Eastwood movies such as Million Dollar Baby or Gran Torino, but still this movie was worth watching.

13 September 2012,Invictus (2009),"Against all the odds, Nelson Mandela tries to inspire the South African rugby team to win the world cup in hopes of uniting a nation torn apart by racism.Luckily for Invictus' predictable story, it is handled by a real master of cinema. Eastwood certainly knows how to make movies. Like Any Given Sunday and Escape to Victory before it, Invictus had me engaged and entertained despite having no interest in the sport. Eastwood manages to inject some extra motivation by also concentrating on the political aspects of the story. The event itself starts to overshadow the characters, and Eastwood grasps for something a bit more thrilling with a number of red-herring assassin moments. It's solid movie making, with a couple of flat moments.

26 June 2010,Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.,"It's 1995 and Nelson Mandela (Freeman) has just been elected the first democratically elected black president of South Africa. Not surprisingly, his supporters see this as the ultimate opportunity for pay back to the white community for all the years of oppression. But Mandela is a different kind of leader. He believes in working hard to unite all the people and forgiving those who have harmed him and his people. Everyone assumes Mandela will replace the white leadership of the struggling national rugby team with his own. However, Mandela sees this as an opportunity to unify the country through sports. He commits himself to working with the existing white leadership and particularly the captain of the rugby team played by Matt Damon. He challenges Damon to rise to the occasion and capture the World Cup which they are hosting. He is taking a great risk with the future of his leadership. Based on the true story of Nelson Mandela and South Africa, it is part history, part leadership lesson and a moving sports drama. Highly recommend.

23 October 2012,Excellent Movie Even If Predictable,"So I read some comments about how this movie is too Hollywood, too predictable, and why would a leader even be concerned with this sporting event. All I can answer is that you have lived too much in Canada or the USA. In Canada and the USA sports are important, but not that important. In places like Europe, South America, Africa, or parts of Asia certain sports are VERY IMPORTANT!

Consider the recent football (soccer for you North Americans) match between England and Germany. Cameron and Merkel sat in front of the TV watching the game and not doing any business whatsoever other than relaxing with a few ""brewskies."" Even though Europe was falling apart. Sports moves people in these countries like no other thing can.

This movie is very good and I liked it. I found it very emotional. This movie though is similar to the German movie, ""Das Wunder von Bern"" (The Miracle of Bern). It talks about the hardship and how the people came together to find a little happiness from the desperation of reality. Though the difference in the two movies is perspective.

So how do you know if you will like this movie? Easy, how much are you attached to things like World Cup Football, or World Cup Rugby. If you are not attached emotionally to these types of things you will find this movie lackluster. If you are very attached and can get into the emotional spirit of the sporting event, then you will like this movie. It really is that simple, that black and white.",10
22 February 2010,Inglorious Victory...,"I would prefer it had they chosen another angle to look at Mandela's life.

It was made extremely obvious in the movie that the game was a metaphor for pulling together and no longer acting in self-interest, so the 'bonding' before the games was interesting, but at the end of the day I just don't give a fig about rugby, so I didn't need to see so much onfield action. If you're going to put Mandela in a movie, then make it about him, and not how he encouraged another organisation to do his work of uniting a nation.

Having said that, if you appreciate movies about how sport can bring people together and hasten social change away from the playing field, then this still does stand as a decent entry into that canon.

16 September 2010,Another quality film from Clint Eastwood,"Clint Eastwood's ""Invictus"" tells the true story of Nelson Mandela's involvement with the South African rugby team as they prepared for and participated in the 1995 Rugby World Cup. This was the first major sporting event to take place in South Africa following the end of apartheid and Mandela saw it as an opportunity to promote unity through sport.

The film is buoyed by a pair of standout performances. Morgan Freeman (as Nelson Mandela) and Matt Damon (as captain of the South African rugby team) both landed well-deserved Oscar nominations for their performances. I was particularly impressed with Freeman's performance, wherein he convincingly evoked the spirit and mannerisms of Nelson Mandela. As is typical of Eastwood's recent films, the supporting cast is full of unfamiliar faces but solid nonetheless.

The script is well done with an effective balance between Mandela's objectives and the goals of the national rugby team. As usual, Eastwood's direction is well-handled and the film has a polished look. The music is mostly good too but I have to admit that the few vocal pieces seemed pretty hokey to me.

Overall, ""Invictus"" is a worthwhile sports film with some added dramatic impact due to the South African setting and the presence of Nelson Mandela. I should also note that the film sticks pretty close to the truth, which, in the end, makes it even more remarkable.",8
5 May 2011,Good for the Heart,"This movie is better as any medicine to cure heart problems. The best part is that it's not some fairy tale, but really happened. Nelson Mandela is the only 21th Century Statesman who can stand in the footsteps of the founding fathers of America. Clint Eastwood is the producer and director to watch, as he knows where to put his attention and efforts into. Morgan Freeman really is Nelson Mandela inside this movie excelling way above the Oscar for best leading actor. That he was nominated and didn't win, only testifies that there still are certain matters to be sorted out in Hollywood. Matt Damon does a great job in the role of the South African rugby captain Francis Pienaar. The strange mix of suspense and excitement among the team of bodyguards when they have to escort Nelson Mandela around the country and during his 04:00 am training walk, underlines the motive of Mandela's decision to guide the Springbok Rugby team, the former symbol of Apartheid, to the world-champion title.

27 May 2021,this is a great movie:),"This was an absolutely great movie. This veteran actor, Morgan Freeman, did a wonderful job acting as Mandela. He kept the African culture in his words whenever he spoke. Every time he talked it sounded just like a South African. In this movie there was a huge number of close-up camera shots. This is one of the things I liked about this movie because it shows the emotions and it makes you feel like you're there in the moment. Also in the movie there is a lot of establishing shots, which is really good because you get a feel for were they are and how their surroundings look. In the movie I thought they did well on the music playing behind the scenes. I felt the music was really authentic and the the music went just right with what was happening in the movie overall. I thought it was an amazing movie.

3 October 2021,I am the captain of my soul and I am the master of my fate,"Clint Eastwood achieves the feat of a seventh consecutive masterpiece - and the second in a year with ""Gran Torino""! As usual with Clint Eastwood, everything nears perfection: adaptation, script, production, editing, casting, interpretation, and soundtrack. In short, Clint Eastwood should be the ultimate Oscar winner whenever the topics he covers are turned into major cinematic works.

He deserves it, because almost all of his work, both as an actor and as a director, is a constant quest for truth and justice.

With ""Invictus"", he offers us another great human fresco, where greatness of soul and strength of heart triumph, thus paying homage to one of the greatest statesmen in history: Nelson Mandela. The atmosphere that reigned in South Africa at the end of Apartheid in the early 1990s is perfectly recreated. As to Morgan Freeman, he is quite simply the almost true-to-life embodiment of the leader of the ANC, promoted President of the Republic of South Africa. His stunning performance is also worthy of an Oscar for Best Actor.

Thank you Mr. Clint Eastwood and congratulations on these great and pure moments of cinema, which are essential examinations of conscience in order not to forget.

Invictus by William Ernest Henley

Out of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud.

Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds and shall find me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.",10
5 August 2010,Disappointing,"The story of how Nelson Mandela, after becoming the leader of South Africa following the demise of the apartheid regime, tried to heal the racially divided country by, among other things, supporting the Springboks, the South African rugby team, who were supported by the white minority and hated by blacks, during the 1995 World Cup (the Springboks managed to win). Matt Damon does a nice turn as Francois Pienaar, the captain of the Springbooks, who coming like the rest of his teammates from an Afrikaner home hostile to the new regime slowly warms up to Mandela. Morgan Freeman is almost insufferable as the new president, showing him almost as a holy fool, a naive, always smiling, quasi imbecile. The real Mandela, who was (for a good cause) the leader of Africa's main armed faction for more than thirty years, is probably made of sterner stuff. You don't have to be a cynic to find this movie trite and corny, full of cringing dialogue that is almost painful to listen. Even the rugby scenes shown here are uninspiring. A disappointment.

26 January 2022,"Very authentic: setting, performance, and music","For the most part, 'Invictus' handles all the important and complicated events leading up to South Africa's victory in the world cup very compactly and neatly. Eastwood provides full understanding of political and social context with just enough information to juggle in two hours. What Mandela hopes to achieve is achieved through sports, and the director does not forget either political or sports aspects of the movie. Soundtrack strengthens realistic portrayal of South Africa in 90s and rigorous rugby matches.

However, last 30 minutes of the movie is amateur. Too dragging, superfluous use of slow motion, and trying too hard to wrap it up pretty.

17 July 2010,A Political Sports Film? Who Would Have Thought!,"It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.

These words, this verse of the poem by William Ernest Hensley in 1875, was the mantra of Nelson Mandela during his imprisonment in South Africa. He refused to give in to hate. He refused to give in to revenge. But how do you pull along an entire country with you? Especially a country as racially divisive as South Africa where Apartheid was a part of the landscape and politics for nearly 50 years?

Risking everything, Mandela achieved greatness by focusing not on politics, but on a sport: Rugby. Wanting to win the World Cup and thus unite a country, Mandela (played superbly by Morgan Freman, WANTED) sets out not to divide and conquer, but to unite and calm the racial tensions raging through his beloved South Africa.

With him, Mandela must convince Rugby captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon, THE DEPARTED) that their poorly performing team can do the impossible: win the World Cup.

As most of us now know, that is precisely what happens, and South Africa, for a while, forgets her bloody black-and-white past and turns everyone flush with excitement for simply being South African.

Clint Eastwood has proved in his waning years that he should remain (mostly) behind the camera and not in front of it. With the exception of GRAN TORINO, I've not been much of a fan of his as of late. However, when it comes to his directing chops, I've been fairly well pleased. Probably my favorite acted/directed Clint film would be the lesser known HEARTBREAK RIDGE. But that might just be me.

Many have already said that this was ""the role Morgan Freeman was meant to play,"" and I won't contradict that. He was completely believable as Mandela, getting the look, verbal cadence and movements of The Great Man down perfectly.

Matt Damon on the other hand ...didn't really strike me as the bullish and larger-than-life Francois. Although I think he did ""okay."" I believe that a search for a more stylized actor could've easily resulted in a match more adequate to the part.

Regardless, the filming is enthralling because of Freeman's performance and the fact-based situations that this movie is based upon. For those looking for a sports film in-line with HOOSIERS, ROCKY or RUDY, you might want to look elsewhere. For those with an interest in human history and how politics can sometimes take a dive toward the goal line, this one will run straight at you.",8
27 June 2010,Invictus succeeded in it's purpose completely.......,"Invictus is the third movie from the team of Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman and this time too they succeeded to bring us a brilliant movie. Invictus is based on the early years of Nelson Mandela as a newly elected President of Republic of South Africa,it was the time for change,the end of apartheid and the beginning of new era.The country was divided and hopeless, crime rate,poverty were increasing,country was not working right so was it's Rugby team and the world cup was on it's way in the year 1995.Country needed a inspiration,a medium to get united and to break the walls of creed and color.Nelson Mandela knew his country needed a inspiration,a moment that make the whole country feel proud will also help in bringing people close to each other and thus it was important for it's country to win the Rugby world-cup.So Mandela took the matter in his own hands,he meet with the Rugby team captain Francois Pieenar and made him realize that whole country is counting on them and how can they help in unite the whole nation if they win the world cup.

Nelson Mandela is portrayed by my favorite actor Morgan Freeman.Now,the problem is that both Morgan Freeman and Nelson Mandela are popular faces.we are familiar with both of them so,it is really hard to accept Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela.This is why a role of popular person should always been played by an unpopular face,like Ben Kinglsley in Gandhi,i didn't know who is Ben Kingsley when i was watching Gandhi so it was not difficult for me to accept him as Gandhi.But here Morgan Freeman is my favorite actor and that make difficult for me to accept him as Nelson Mandela but some minutes after movie starts,i never felt like i was watching Morgan Freeman and that is an real achievement for an actor and Morgan Freeman shows the brilliant performance here. Matt Demon was also brilliant in the role of Rugby team captain Francois Pieenar.

I think Clint Eastwood done a beautiful job here,his direction literally saved the movie,there was not a single moment in the movie where i felt detachment.The whole story of movie was so plane and predictable,but i felt movie very interesting and entertaining as it was great experience for me to see a movie based on great leader Nelson Mandela.Invictus is not completely a sports movie,the movie is also biopic which gives the glimpse of life of Nelson Mandela as a newly elected president,his views and thoughts towards his country and it's peoples and how he try to unite his nation,the movie is filled with very well written quotes and speeches.The movie makes us familiar with the historic moments of a country and Clint Eastwood succeeded in this completely.The scenes of the rugby match should have been much more energetic and passionate but like Clint Eastwood's other works this movie also remains calm and sober all time.Otherwise,the movie is very well made and was perfect in all the departments.

Invictus is not just a normal sports movie.The movie shows the importance of sports for a nation and it's peoples,sports unite us,you support a single team with the same spirit your religion and color have no importance here the only thing important here is your country. Because of those moments of celebrations or grief that we felt with one spirit for one team it realize us how much we love our country.Invictus will be respected and remembered personally by those who feel historical importance of the events occur in the movie,but it will also be enjoyable movie for others too from different part of the world.",9
11 January 2010,Mediocre at best,"I sat down to this movie with high expectations after seeing the trailer. However, I was very disappointed because I thought this movie would be one of the best movies of the year, and it turned out to be just another movie.

The biggest problem with this movie is if you don't know rugby at all. If so, you will have no idea what is going on (for the most part).

The movie is pretty slow moving at the start, and though it picks up, all you want it to do is to end.

Acting is decent, though, I would say that the way the movie is shot (sorry Clint Eastwood) is it's major downfall. I would wait until this is out on DVD to watch for sure.

3 October 2021,Wonderful film with a message of unity,"The film follows Nelson Mandela as he starts his presidency of South Africa and uses the 1995 Rugby World Cup as an opportunity to drive unity in his country.

Morgan Freeman is excellent as Mandela, Matt Damon is also notable as Francois Pienaar.

The film is actually very charming and powerful. It delivers a wonderful message of unity and forgiveness irrespective of colour.

A must see movie directed by Clint Eastwood, a fine director.

25 April 2011,Inspirational stuff from Clint Eastwood...,"I guess I should state at the start that I am a huge fan of Rugby Union, the game featured in this film. A little sceptical when I first put the disc in the DVD player because I'm not a fan of South Africa, I'm English, but my worst fears were soon put aside. The film focuses on Nelson Mandela's efforts to unite his country, and how he used rugby as part of this process. Based on true events, much of the story is about a country divided along lines if race that is now emerging into a new era. To help ease this process, and to get many of the whites on his side, Nelson Mandela inspires the captain of the Springboks, the South African rugby team, François Pienaar, and encourages him in his quest to win the World Cup, which is being hosted there.

Technically, this is a very well made film, although, as is usual with sports in films, the close-up action shots do appear to be staged (which, of course, they are). This failing aside, it's a very well written script and there are some very nice performances. There is a nice little sub-plot involving Mandela's security people, who are all black at the beginning, but when they ask for more men, Mandela sends some white security people round. After a little uncertainty at first, we see them gradually earn each other's trust as the film progresses. A neat little device that illustrates the points being made in the main part of the movie.

Unusually for a film of this type, the two main characters, who are both very inspirational men, seldom meet. When they do, you can feel the strength of Mandela giving encouragement to Pienaar. This comes across very well and even I was rooting for the Springboks by the end of the film (and I already knew who won!). I remember well watching the final, where Mandela pulled off a great stroke by wearing a Springboks shirt. This had been a symbol of power to the whites and a symbol of oppression to the blacks in South Africa. This one simple act did much to unite the nation and greatly inspire the team.

Two great performances; Morgan Freeman really nailed the voice and the mannerisms of Nelson Mandela, of course, he doesn't really look much like him, but I guess you can't have everything. Matt Damon did a great job as François Pienaar, inspirational speeches and a lot of physical work also, but, again, he doesn't really look like the man he's portraying. I can forgive that as they both did a really good job.

Over all I found this a very inspirational film with some great moments. It features two very good performances, but I did find it a little too long and the close-up action looked a little too staged. Having said that, I would watch it again sometime and I'm sure I would find more things to like about it. I do like the very measured style Clint Eastwood uses in the films he directs, nothing is too overstated and I have to admire him for that. Recommended.

My Score: 7.5/10",8
11 December 2009,An Important Film,"As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning, I can tell you you the entertaining, inspiring and enjoyable ""Invictus"" exceeded all my expectations.

It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.

I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

Viva Clint Eastwood, viva Morgan Freeman, viva Madiba.

PS. I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.

Of the films Eastwood has directed, my favorites, in no particular order, are ""Unforgiven"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Gran Torino"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"",""Bird"" and ""Invictus"". Yes, it's really that good. ""Invictus"" is another winner from Clint. He just seems to get better with age. What a creative roll he is currently on.

4 March 2022,A brilliant film,"I had seen this film when it first came out and I forgot how extraordinary it was. On the second viewing I was able to really focus on the performance of Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, and they were great. It is a beautiful story, very well-told, very inspirational and a story about a tremendously important man who is a once-in-a-generation type figure.

This film was one of the great Clint Eastwood films. If you haven't seen this movie, see it in the next 48 hours.

19 May 2010,A great movie about individual and national greatness.,"On my first trip to South Africa, I was taken to the top of Table Mountain. My host pointed out into the Bay. He said, ""That is Robbin Island. That is where we kept Nelson. He might have been bitter."" On the fact that he was not bitter, history turns.

I have since visited Robbin Island and seen Nelson's cell, now a national shrine. It was smaller than most American elevators.

On a more recent trip, not to say my last, to South Africa, I chaired a professional conference. In my concluding remarks from the chair, I got to tell my audience how proud I am of them and that I take pride in telling their story wherever I travel.

A recent review of this movie suggested that ""Nelson,"" what everyone calls him, deserves to be even more revered than he is. Of course, the reviewer assumes that the portrayal of Nelson in the movie is an accurate portrayal of the greatness of the man. One might well hope that if a movie were to be made of one's life, that one might be portrayed by Morgan Freeman, unlikely in my case because of race.

In any case, Nelson Mandela is a giant of modern history, one who led others to greatness by example. He deserves to be played by Morgan Freeman. Would that I might.

It is a really good movie about a Country that has prevailed under conditions that most of us would not wish on our worst enemies. Enjoy.",9
28 November 2020,Inspiring For All,"What a man Mr. Mandela was. Hard to imagine how someone who was so mistreated and went through so much, had so much compassion and unrelenting forgiveness. The film does a good job showing how so many people during that time period in that country were fueled by passion alone when it came to decision making, while Mandela was really able to put that aside and take a step back in order to make the right decisions for all. It was this constant awareness that he was able to mend decades of division amongst the people of South Africa.

I love a good sports movie, and this is one for sure, but definitely more than just a sports movie for obvious reasons. Matt Damon does a fantastic job portraying team captain Pienaar. Morgan Freeman is just as great, and just well as may be one of his finest performances. Clint Eastwood does another masterful job at directing. All his movies are amazing cinema, and this is such a good feel good story. There truly isn't any of those ""downer"" moments two thirds in; it was legitimate feel good throughout.",8

7 December 2013,Pass the Popcorn review,"Because of his recent death, we decided it would be fit for us to try and honour the memory of Nelson Mandela by reviewing one of the many movies about his life. Even though there is much controversy surrounding his life and actions (great people are rarely not controversial), the majority of people still consider him an icon, a great politician and an extremely important figure in South African history. Invictus depicts Mandela's life after being released from prison, but since showing all the things he had done while president of South Africa would be impossible and make the movie a mess, it was decided to concentrate the story on the South African rugby team.

After spending 27 years in prison for sabotage and conspiracy, and finally being released, Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) is chosen as the president of South Africa. His mission is extremely difficult: to end apartheid and unite the people. He sees his opportunity in the South African rugby team, the Springboks, which is losing all of its games. As the team is a symbol of oppression (only white people cheer for it), the Sports Commission wants to change its colors and name. Mandela, unexpectedly, decides to back up the Springboks and opposes this decision: he doesn't want Afrikaners to believe Mandela wants to rid South Africa of their presence. He wants the nation to feel as one again by cheering for the same team.

A lot of research and hard work was put into this movie: Clint Eastwood, the director, started watching so much rugby for the movie he ended up being a fan, Matt Damon interviewed Francois Pienaar and trained rugby, and Freeman, who had been Mandela's friend for many years, went to South Africa to get his blessing for the movie - which he gained. Unfortunately, the movie didn't turn out to be as good as one would expect. One thing that bothered me is that, no matter what a great job Freeman did and the effort and hard work he put in preparing his role, I could rarely 'feel' Mandela - it was just Freeman acting, though masterfully. Moreover, I felt the movie was too long and got tedious from time to time, especially when showing teams playing rugby: I know that's what the movie is about, but it could have been made more interesting, especially for people who don't understand the game.

On the other hand, I thought it was an excellent decision to show how the relationships between black and white members of Mandela's security staff develop: Mandela forces them to work together and overcome their animosities, showing that people can change and, maybe most importantly, even a small change is (and was, for Mandela) crucial. It would have been nice to see more of Matt Damon's character, but he mostly plays rugby during the movie. Still, it is somewhat understandable: this movie is, after all, about Nelson Mandela, and what a huge inspiration and powerful politician he was. It is also about the good side of sports: there is no violence and flare-throwing silliness here, only excitement and the feeling of unity a nation like South Africa needed very much.

16 December 2009,"The Great White Hero again, Mandlela story needs the Great Tarzan","How many more? um? How many more SA films where the Africans are a backdrop to some White hero? Isn't the story Cry Freedom, or In My Country etc etc, or Catch A Fire? The engineered rainbow rhetoric which exist only only screen but nowhere in the economy of South Africa. The story of Africa always needs a great white hero, like Last King of Scotland. And not to mention more white directors. And they are searching hi and low 2 find the white Tarzan in every African victory.

Film is an art but I get concerned when every film out of SA sings the same theme. It speaks to something artificial, something social injustice. When did we see a film where whites didn't get let off the hook? When did we see a film where whites didn't exist?

Name a ""Black film"" and look behind the lens; who wrote it, who produced it, who directed it? Amistad , the music by John Williams, the director Mr. Spielberg. A Jamaican film called One Love , again the same pattern. Tsosti a story of violence in the African communities, violence is a natural reality of South African people in European perception; it sells and it feeds their image of us of being gang bangers, and semi-noble savages . It is almost impossible to consider a film that does not include a European central figure. War Dance, singing dancing through the horrors of a genocide. The recent Last King of Scotland reflects this it is in the legacy of CRY FREEDOM, the title shows the mindset behind it . I t would not be sufficient to tell the story of Idi Amin; so infamous enough and surely notorious enough character in his own right. No, they say, this would reduce the value of the project, in comes the European into the storyline. It is actually amazing to see Mel Gibson attempt to make a film of a non-White people without a central European character. Returning to the likes of Richard Attenborough we cannot blame him for his bias in Cry Freedom , he is by nature a European and is simply acting out his European weighted world view, avoiding Eurocentric as a term, as every healthy race is sensitive to his or her cultural perceptions",1
2 April 2021,Predictable but great movie,"This film is not one of Clint Eastwood's best films, but it speaks more about his directorial biography. To me, the film was very, very good. I love sports, but rugby doesn't interest me at all. However the film is brilliantly directed, visually beautiful, and Freeman is the embodiment of Mandela on the big screen. A great man, selfless, always looks to the good of all, without petty interests. The idea of uniting a quarreling nation through sports is brilliantly portrayed and, although the film is somewhat predictable, it was never boring to me and I enjoyed it all the time.

8 July 2010,INVICTUS: Mandela inspires a nation,"INVICTUS opens with the image of a road dividing the well groomed, green rugby field for the white African team and the rough, dirt lot where black African children play. Coming down the road is the motorcade of newly elected President Nelson Mandela.

This is a movie about inspiration. President Mandela's (Morgan Freeman) resolve to unite the nation without punishing his suppressors after serving twenty-seven years as a political prisoner is indeed inspiring. Through his example, he teaches his country how to forgive.

Knowing that his county is still racially divided in the wake of apartheid, the President enlists the help of the national rugby Team Captain (Matt Damon in his most buff and tan) to unite the country with the universal language of sports. Africa is hosting the Rugby World Cup Championship and he knows that the eyes of the world are on them. His first task is to inspire the team to overcome their losing streak and win the championship. But the bigger challenge is to inspire his hostile countrymen to rally around the mostly white team.

Unfortunately, the sports section of the movie isn't as moving as it could have been and therefore less inspiring. President Mandela gives the Team Captain the poem, ""Invictus"" for inspiration. (Mandela got strength from this poem to survive those hard years in prison.) The Team Captain surprises his players with a visit to Mandela's tiny prison cell. But an opportunity is lost when he doesn't share the poem with his team. The audience hears the poem as a voice over. (My frustration increased when I couldn't make out a few of the words.)

Perhaps the screenwriter was trying to keep to the true story. In sports stories there is always the problem of creating suspense when we know who will win. And this definitely is a problem here. Apparently, the game was not an emotional roller coaster.

I'm not saying there are no inspiring moments. There are several. It's just not as moving as it could have been. (I wonder if director Clint Eastwood was trying to avoid having the movie called sappy...?) It is still a three, maybe three and a half, star movie. Who wouldn't root for Morgan Freeman in a strong (however tall) portrayal of Nelson Mandela?

Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.

I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

Viva Clint Eastwood, viva Morgan Freeman, viva Madiba.

PS. I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.

Of the films Eastwood has directed, my favorites, in no particular order, are ""Unforgiven"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Gran Torino"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"",""Bird"" and ""Invictus"". Yes, it's really that good. ""Invictus"" is another winner from Clint. He just seems to get better with age. What a creative roll he is currently on.

1 May 2022,"Bit superficial, but it wasn't a problem, it rose above it!","Felt rushed and some things were left unspoken, such as the airplane thing or the kid with the bag, like he was carrying a bomb, but it was a beautiful inspirational movie, even broke a tear here and there. Loved the idea! Great quote material, great original songs. As for the nominations: Morgan's definitely worthy, I haven't seen the rest of the nominees performances, I can't say yet if he deserved the Oscar yet, but I will say when I'll watch the winner; Damon's wasn't deserved, too brief and ""natural"" performance to be up there, but the movie deserved a best director and best picture nomination at least, in my opinion! We need more movies like this! Peace!

1 October 2021,Wonderful,"This is truly a great movie that really reflects the true events of South Africa and how Nelson Mandela united an entire country. It is a little dated now, some of the South African accents are poor and some of the rugby action by the actors is dire and full of wrong doings, but if you look past that, this is a brilliant film. To have Morgan Freeman as Mandela is a master stroke; Mr Freeman is one of the very great actors of all time. If you believe in hope for humanity, this movie will give you the belief that you need.

15 December 2009,Invictus and Mandela the Man,"""Invictus"", the Movie and the Man Mandela By Edwin L. Young, PhD December 14, 2009

Clint Eastwood's Weltanschauungen is pure Americana. From the Wild West gunslingers to the on-the-outs lawman to macho modern women to global battlefields and finally to reformation in a third world nation, Eastwood's fame has been established on indomitable hero and heroine characters fighting against insurmountable odds and winning. His movies are all of a type one could call the ""invictus"" type and seem almost to be an extension of what I would presume to label as his own, but not idiosyncratic, 'invictus' type of personality. Eastwood's finesse as a director justly earns him the appellation of one of the greats among movie directors. Yet, with respect to those American-ish accolades, I must retract from the consensus that he is well deserved of being worshiped as a hero in the cinematic world. I must make a case that warrants my detraction from his halo awarded by the film critics, and even me. I strongly suspect that he is a true believer in his version of this pure Americana Weltanschauungen. Unfortunately, and I am sure unwittingly, this thematic schema underlying his work is aiding in perpetuating a broader cultural motif. While seemingly a hallmark of inimitably strong and laudable characters and his own character as well, this pattern in his movies is actually a prominent yet unacknowledged source of America(n)'s proclivity for using violence to deal with conflicts with those who are considered unsavory and misguided antagonists within our nation. Ironically, the same characteristic which is considered worthy of being emulated for the good of the country is, nevertheless, one that contributes to fostering those very same conflicts which presumably is his intention is to put to an end. Paradoxically, ""Invictus"" is an exception to his themes. It simultaneously proves and disproves a justification for his upholding of his devotion to this macho cultural motif. Surely this movie is a glowing example of that indomitable will with head bloodied but unbowed. On the other hand, Mandela himself, and Mandela's political strategy is the most telling example of a diametrically opposite belief system about what true human greatness is and what the most effective means are for dealing with those who are considered ideologically oppositional, unsavory, misguided antagonists, and enemies, both within his, and our nation, and abroad. Mandela, an internationally famous yet solitary 'consensus of one' within his fiercely divided nation with its formerly mutually violent and now mutually suspicious and antipathetic parties, stands as the turning point, as a pivotal force, for future world history. What was Mandela's strategy and why was he successful in stemming the tide of national, mutual animosity between Africans and Afrikaners? He used two things. First he used the management strategy of interlocking objectives. What this means is that two camps can be, in this case, made to feel that the success and well-being of each depends upon each striving to make sure the other reaches their goal successfully. Second he took on a challenge to make a national symbol, South Africa's Rugby team, the winner of the international tournament. At the beginning they were considered the dark horse. His victorious election to the presidency of South Africa after having been imprisoned for thirty years by the Afrikaners made him a folk hero of monumental proportions to the blacks and an awesome figure to be feared and reviled, but secretly revered, by the losing Afrikaners. So, when he sent for the Captain of the Rugby team to join him in the quest, against all odds, to win the world cup and had them shown on national TV, with the whole nation watching, he put in progress a plan to unite the nation in supporting its team in their determination to win. His public appearances, drawing attention to their county's ambitions for their Rugby team preceding the tournament, began to make the nation see him as championing the cause of all South Africans. Interlocking objectives! Both sides were gradually induced to work for a success that would be their mutual victory and, in the end, to him see as the leader favoring, not one side, not just the blacks, but all South Africans. His character, forged into iron from his early days as a political activist, was further forged into steel while in prison as he read the great books of the world and observed and studied the Afrikaner guards. One major factor not mentioned in the movie was that it was F. W. de Klerk, the last President of the apartheid South African State, who brought him those books over all of those years. I speculate that de Klerk did much more than just bring him books. Mandela read and thought while imprisoned, in an environment sealed off from the immediate pressures that make men small-minded, grew into a highly educated, highly independent, deep and deeply universalistic thinker and planner. What I see in all of this is his abdication of the belief in the cult of the individual. The cult of the individual essentially is the message behind the message in the poem ""Invictus."" Notwithstanding the invictus message, Mandela now had a new assumption and a new understanding of the encompassing nature of structures and systems. He eventually saw how the system, of racially antipathetic, politically opposing parties, was intertwined with a multitude of other, mutually influencing and sustaining, systems. Further, he eventually saw that there were fulcrums within those systems which others may not see but which could be used to alter them, from the most encompassing at the state and even international level, to the interactions between former antagonists, and ultimately alter even the character, personalities, and behavior of all individual citizens. This is the meaning of a true, great statesman! One who understands how he and all people are shaped by the structures and systems within which they exist and then turns that around to reshape those very same structures and systems for the greater good.",10
28 December 2022,Pretty Fly For a Sports Film,"I recently saw the movie 83 (2021) and it again renewed my conception of stereotypical sports films being bad. Basically we have an underdog team to which some silly things happen that don't think they will win but want to win and who indeed end up winning in the end. They're predictable in the extreme and the emotional investment in sports of the players is the silliest thing about the movie to me.

This movie isn't as much about sports or the victory of the athletes, however, as it is about a political plot for Mandela to gain support from white South Africans. Nervous about being under the rule of a majority government after centuries of discriminating the native population, white South Africans were afraid and wary of black president Mandela. Apparently they were in love with the sport of rugby and Mandela decides to use support for this sport to try to bring the community together.

It still has its cheesy cliche sports bits, but sport is legitimately presented as something bigger than just a bunch of beer-bellied men going crazy in front of the television on Sunday mornings.

Freeman plays Mandela, who is a fascinating and quirky character very worthy of being explored on film himself, even though this movie doesn't go too deeply into Mandela's life and political struggles. And who could have done it better?

Honourable Mentions: 83 (2001). A Bollywood film about the Indian team at the Cricket World Cup. Sports tripe that's not saved by scenes exploring Indian culture.",8
14 December 2018,Morgan Freeman is magnificent,"His portrayal of Mandela lends gravitas and emotional depth. This film is worth seeing for his performance alone.

26 March 2021,review good,Invictus is a film produced by Clint Eastwood on 3 december 2009. The film had a lot of reward like the oscar of the best actor in a second role and on Oscar of the best actor. To begin with the film ios a title part of mandela's life durin g his presidency in South Africa. The goal ofmandela is to change and reduce racism in the society in Southn Africa. And he use the rugby world cup to help him to take away the segregation in South South africa and change the vision of South africa in the world. But can Nelson mandela do it? So now we talk about us opinion abouit the film. On the one hand the biotbic of Nelson mandela prsidency is a goodn resulmt because it's not to much part of his life. Morgann freeman play the role very good however his accent isb a little bit boring. And withint the rugby scènes are very important beacuse they show the fight and the fight and ad up action in the film because sometimes the film can be a little bit bring like during the film can be a little bit boring like during the long dialog. To conclude Invictus is a great performance but it have sometimes inc onsiscenty because ven tought sport gatrhers people racism is Always her in South africa and in the world today.,5
16 February 2020,What connects Rugby and Nelson Mandela?,"I normally don't like movies such as Invictus. I am also not a fan of mixing politics and sport... but this movie engulfed me... My rating is biased by my own experience though.

Watching the movie threw me a couple of months back, specifically into the 2.nd of November 2019, the day after I arrived to South Africa.. I sensed ""something"" in the air.. something was clearly going on among all those people with some kind of ""antelope"" on their green shirts.. and suddenly around midday, the entire country got flooded with joy and happiness. I immediately realized what just happened. South Africa won the world cup again! Springbok's black captain Siya Kolisi became the most popular and beloved person during my entire stay..

The movie gave me however much wider context and perspective on my own recent experience. I learned the about the history, the importance and it motivated me to google even more details about the characters, events, teams and about rugby in general. I fully enjoyed every second of the movie (including the final subtitles :D)..",10
26 March 2021,A good film with big flaws,"This film is called ""Invictus"", it was produced in 2009 by Clint Eastwood, the main actors are Matt Damon an Morgan Freeman. In summary, Nelson Mandela's election marks the end of Apartheid but South Africa is still a racially and economically nation. Mandela relies on sport with the captain of the South Africa rugby team to unify the country. Their goal is to go to the 1995 World Cup and win it, even though they are of average ability. In my opinion, the movie could have been less centered on rugby and more on the life of black people in the shanty towns. Let me explain my point of view, on the one hand, the film highlights the important facts of Apartheid to the entire world, it maintains the duty of remembrance. In addition to that we learn more about Mandela's life and his feelings in prison. Eastwood's movie is also fascinating, we are stressed at different moments and enjoyed in others moments. On the other hand, this production shows a Disney version of Apartheid with a beautiful happy end, whereas racism is still present in South Africa. Like I said precendently, it's too focused on rugby and show enough the proverty and discrimination of black people. It counts for me, Iwould see that more. Moreover, I find that Morgan Freeman's accent isn't natural end the team production isn't composed of enough South Africans. In conclusion, I recommend this movie for those who don't know the Apartheid and Mandela's life. Nevertheless, it's not a decent film for those who know Apartheid and even live though the Apartheid.",6
16 December 2009,Solid Movie but Nothing Extraordinary,"If this film were a woman, they would describe her as sturdy. It's a solid movie but nothing extraordinary. Of course the acting is top level and Clint Eastwood's direction is solid but the story itself is straightforward and often bland. Containing no plot turns or twists and surprisingly very little emotion, it's worthwhile even though it's toothless. It was a good idea to avoid covering the sport of rugby in depth because the goofy nature of the sport is a turn off to most. They focused on the impact of the sport itself and that's what saves this film. Again, it's middle of the road delivering nothing bad but falling way below greatness.

10 April 2022,An unconquerable story of unity and triumph over adversity,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, a great feel good story for all the family.

Sterling performance from Freeman (as Mandela) and Damon (as Rugby captain)

I don't know how factually accurate it is, but I was aware of how Mandela did unify South Africa despite all the odds

A great film you can watch multiple times. 8/10.

12 October 2015,College underdogs overcome the odds....without the padding,"This is the same as every other identikit sporting movie - of the underdog overcoming the odds to triumph.

Predictable : The action/training scenes could be transposed from any college/ice hockey/baseball pitch in any number of tedious movies to the miraculously recovering South Africa . Just change the colour of the kits and remove the ludicrous protective padding and headgear and you have Invictus.

Clichéd : The cuts to the commentator who pops up to spell out the gigantic scale of the task ahead (for anyone too stupid to follow the plot) are laughable but, it seems, essential for any movie of this type.

The hugely mis-cast (again) Matt Damon as a mini-me of the South African team captain making the inspirational speeches in the scrum. The shots of 'ordinary' people watching it in bars and leaping from the sofas of their homes.

Nauseating : The 747 performing illegal manoeuvres a couple of hundred feet over the stadium. The old (white) presidential guards enjoying a jolly good game of rugby with the new (black)security detail in the grounds of the Presidential palace. Matt Damons' visit to Mandelas' place of imprisonment is just cringe-worthy. The action on the field just soon gets tedious.

I would have been far more interested in knowing how the 'new' South Africa bagged the hosting rights of the international tournament and the importance (or not) of it to the relatively new nations' population.

All in all, avoid this simplistic nonsense - unless you are one of the few who will watch rugby in any form (and I know of a couple). If you didn't already know the story, you will after ten minutes into the film.

Who would've thought that uniting a nation after decades of internal division, violence and oppression could be solved by a couple of games of 'rugger'. That's Hollywood.",3
19 April 2022,Not just a movie,"I'm a very lucky man, since I've met this incredible man, back in june 2004. Mandela was and is one of the greatest persons of our generation, you can't put into words really what he suffered, and how inspirational he was. Now... the movie. Besides Morgan Freeman blending in to become Madiba, so close that when you see them together on the documentary on Blu-ray, it's spooky how alike they were. The Academy robbed him an Oscar. Why wont I go further than 8/10? Well, the reason is simple enough. I understand that this world cup was a turning point for Madiba and South Africa, but... I don't care at all about rugby. Everything looks great, but when you watch a movie were 1/3 is about a sport you find extremely boring, I cant muster excitement for the ""nervewrecking end"". I just see a bunch of bloody guys smashing into eachother. Btw, Scott Eastwood is casted as one of the kickers. He looks today just like his dad in his glorious past.

27 May 2021,A Continuous Story of Nelson Mandela Life after He Was Elected President.,"This movie is a look at Nelson Mandela's life after he became the first elected President of South Africa. It really was intense to watch as he got hate from his own people, but inspiring to see that he kept his head up and a warm smile on his face. The camera angles on the scene were they capture the crowds cheering and how it went into slow motion really set in place how important that moment was for Mandela and the team. The choice to choose Morgan Freeman to play as Mandela was a no brainer. Every role he has ever played, he delivers it perfectly and as expected each time. Morgan Freeman really captured what Mandela would put forth for his people and the 1995 winning Rugby World Cup team, and made the movie feel authentic, like as if I was really watching Mandela live.

This movie pulls no punches and tries to display both black and white to great effect. Morgan Freeman is great as Mandela. You feel the emotion in every word. This sports movie really gives you a meaning to support the players all the way.

29 November 2021,"A great movie with an interesting angle, on a major difficulty in South Africa","Nelson Mandela is portrayed in this movie and played by Morgan freeman. Freeman was first in cast and the person, that Mandela himself wanted to be portrayed by in the movie. Mandela is going to be president of South Africa as we see a very interesting way to prioritize his time first time as president in a Country of major problems. We see the South African football team that won the Rugby World Cup in 1995. We follow the team leader of the South African rugby team, whom Mandela is interested in talking to. Mandela is on a mission to gather the separated South Africa, and he does this by investing his first time as president in trying to influence, the Rugby team, of South Africa. To make sure the team wins, Mandela reads loud a poem called Invictus, for the rugby team leader. This has a big impact on him. The faith that Mandela puts in his team to be the first step toward uniting South Africa, is on the shoulders of this team as we follow it through the movie. We see the prison that had Mandela as the rugby team leader gets very touched by the incredible almost two decades, Mandela was locked in there. The movie is about this Rugby Cup mostly which I find to be just a little too monotone for my taste overall. I think it is interesting that the movie has chosen this angle, of the whole situation of South Africa. That, a rugby cup could have such an impact on a country, is amazing and beautifully portrayed in the movie. But I do find that I need a little more history details about the jail-time for Mandela. The most caching moments of the movie where the scene of the jail and the way the movie centres around the poem Invictus, which soul-strengthening power was both helping the Rugby Team of South Africa, as well as Mandela.",

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

Viva Clint Eastwood, viva Morgan Freeman, viva Madiba.

PS. I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.

Of the films Eastwood has directed, my favorites, in no particular order, are ""Unforgiven"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Gran Torino"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"",""Bird"" and ""Invictus"". Yes, it's really that good. ""Invictus"" is another winner from Clint. He just seems to get better with age. What a creative roll he is currently on.

PPS. ""Invictus"" is one of the best sporting movies I have ever seen. But it's also about more than sport.",7

17 November 2016,A Solid Yet Unbearably Slow Drama,"Sports are not my thing I've never been into them and find them boring, yet when I first heard about this movie I was extremely curious to seem if I could get over that an s for the most part I did I found this to be a very good film despite some major pacing issues. But by far the best thing about this movie are the performances from Damon and Freeman who both deservedly earned Oscar nominations for this movie, Morgan Freeman was so good in this movie not only was his accent extremely convincing but he also nailed the emotional turmoil that Mandela was going through your able to get completely behind him and Freemans performance was just overall inspiring. Matt Damon gives one of the greatest performances of his entire career in this film, he has a great parallel to Freeman and you get a sense of the similarities between them, Damon was great in the rugby scenes and also great and conveying how desperately he wanted to lead his team to victory and said like Freeman you were very easily able to get behind him. I never thought I could feel such intensity from a rugby match by my god I was on edge during every second of them because they take their time to build up the importance of winning this match and makes it all the more satisfying to watch. The relationships between the South Africans in this movie was a pleasure to watch it was done perfectly you understood all that these two peoples had been through and watching them gradually come to trust each other was fascinating and satisfying. However there are some flaws with this film and it's mainly the excruciatingly slow pace it works for the rugby scenes but outside that it's just makes scenes drag in majorly and it did bore me at time and make me just want them to get back to the rugby. This film also does lack some subtlety characters just seem to immediately say what their thinking instead of conveying it through a performance despite the fact that they could have used some of the dragged out scenes to build up some more investment.

Invictus is far from a perfect movie but it has very good intentions, this film has two excellent performances from Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, well directed rugby scenes, a great political and racial story and some truly inspiring scenes.

19 January 2010,Outstanding Movie,"This film is simply mind blowing.I have to hold up my breath even. Whole film is full of suspense.And i have eaten all my nails and pluck my hairs. Morgan Freeman is simply outstanding. I ll give him 10 this film is now at my top of favorite films. After so long i am happy to watch a good movie. I don't know why nowadays all concentration in movies on comedy. Comedy is okay but sometimes for change there must be some informatory movies like invictus. But if somebody told me what invictus means.Any South Africans i think its some official word i don't know. Can anyone tell me any good movie as this. I ll really appreciate it. Thanks.

12 April 2010,Interesting and slightly inspiring but it could have been so much more,"My dad wanted to see this yesterday but I wasn't too keen on seeing a film but I went anyway and sufficed to say I enjoyed myself. Invictus tells the story of Nelson Mandella as president of Africa who joins forces with the captain of the South African rugby team Francois Pienaar to ask them to win the world cup and help unite the country in the awake of the apartheid.

This is a very good film. Morgan Freeman as Mandella was terrific. He played the part perfectly with the touch of charm, heart, intellect and thoughtfulness. Matt Damon was okay as Francois but I have to say it could have been played better with another actor in his place. Clint Eastwood directs once again with flair capturing the essence of the story and focusing it firmly on one event as the apartheid was more than that, which is where I feel he went slightly wrong. It would have been nice to see more of an exploration about the rise of Mandella and the wider impact of the apartheid instead of just about the world cup.

It was interesting and inspiring to watch though I didn't feel the inspiration until the very end. It wasn't amazing as there were parts where I was getting a bit bored but it does pick up. What did let this down slightly was Matt Damon's satisfactory but nothing more performance and lack of the powerful tone of the situation and more exploration of the wider implications of the apartheid and Mandella's biography and more inspiration surrounding it. Eastwood has failed in this sense and instead of turning into the masterpiece it could have been like Changeling, it's just very good film, which for me is not normal in his vocabulary and it is easily forgettable unlike Changeling. But it would be a shame to put this down too much as this is still well worth seeing even if it's a bit on the long side.",7
25 January 2010,Invictus...very good film for who knows something about South Africa,"From director Clint Eastwood, ""Invictus"" tells the inspiring true story of how Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) joined forces with the captain of South Africa's rugby team, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon), to help unite their country.

Newly elected President Mandela knows his nation remains racially and economically divided in the wake of apartheid. Believing he can bring his people together through the universal language of sport, Mandela rallies South Africa's underdog rugby team as they make an unlikely run to the 1995 World Cup Championship match.

I really recommend this film for everyone. Truly inspiring.

28 November 2010,I am the captain of my soul,"'Invictus' was one of unnoticed or rather unattended movie in my 'movies to watch' collection. I didn't had the proper mood or the interest to watch it even the critics were in favor of it. However when I finally watched it last night I was more than glad I did.

Based on true events which occurred surrounding the newly elected south African president Nelson Mandela and the de motivated and beaten up Rugby team which has no direction 'Invictus' is a story or triumph, humanity and most of all politics which is intended to change the world for the better. Mandela not being the popular elect amongst the whites strategically place Ruby as a tool of attention and somewhat bait to unite the whole country in to one purpose ; Gear up and change the country. The movie no doubt portray how well Mandela is in his office and uses his humanitarian attitude surprisingly well towards other who might think that he will resist. More than Rugby once you concentrate on the Mandela character the movie itself will start to be an inspiration towards any human being who breathes.

Wonderfully crafted cast including Morgan Freemon as Mandela and Matt Damon as the Rugby teams captain Francois Pienaar, 'Invictus' has made way in to my sports movies hall of fame. Proving once again that Clint Eastwood is one of the greatest of directors of our time surpassing who he was being an actor of my time this movie is a winner by all means. I will cherish it just like I did Coach Carter, Radio and Blind Side.

Just before I wind up, 'Invictus' in real is a short poem by English poet William Ernest Henley (1849-1903). It was written in 1875 and first published in 1888 in Henley's Book of Verses. It says that Mandela was inspired by this poem while he was in prison and no doubt that you may too so I shall keep it in this post. Out of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeoning of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed. Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds and shall find me unafraid. It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.",9
26 December 2009,One of the best movies of the year,"Easily one of the best movies of the year, it has been mentioned that this movie has no story line behind it and that Eastwood is taking a preacher attitude thru it. Well in a sense this is the point behind it. It a hopeful movie it shows how the rooted hate and racism of a hole nation can be canceled by a common goal. the deep wounds of a country which had years of oppression and hate can not be fixed without forgiveness. What would be of human kind if on a change of power hate continues the other way around (Hotel Ruwanda comes into mind)Now reviewing the movie the acting is good however the highlight for me is the story line behind it that can move a country. A simple game can not fix a country yet years of suffering can not be changed by one man the healing can only be started by him

17 March 2010,A Great Cinematic Metaphor,"The movie takes its title from the poem of William Ernest Henley. It was composed in a very difficult moment in the life of Henley, and it was his way to find inspiration against terrible odds. The movie takes the poem and builds on it a great cinematic metaphor: the verses were a source of inspiration for Nelson Mandela in his long years of prison; after his election as President of South Africa, the poem would become an inspiration for winning the Rugby World Cup, as a symbol of overcoming the past and forging the reconciliation.

I enjoyed the movie a lot, but I must say, especially for his second part: Clint Eastwood mastered perfectly the rendering of the grim fight in the games, as well as the terrible training sessions. It has guts, it's high voltage there, everybody and everything is strongly motivated. And Matt Damon was the perfect choice to communicate all these emotions and all these motivations.

Nevertheless, I think the first part of the movie was a bit too declarative. It could have been so in reality, and it's perfectly possible that at the beginning of his presidency Nelson Mandela had to be very didactic in order to explain to his people the need for reconciliation. However, it is difficult to make a credible cinematic personage with discourses. Especially when it is about a great historic personality, like Mandela.

Morgan Freeman had here a very difficult task. I must say he approached the personage with great humility and he found this way the right key and the right tones. He was able to render the hero sincere in his declarations of principles from the first part and gave to the role a great touch of humanity, by a mix of modesty, humor, resolution, and even of a bit of necessary cunning.

Now, coming back to the history that inspired the movie, we could ask ourselves whether the finale of the World Cup was really the moment of reconciliation in South Africa. I think it was only a moment, a necessary and happy moment in a process that will take still many years.",7
6 August 2010,inspiring and engaging,"i started watching this movie in early morning and i was very skeptic about watching it but knowing that it has name attached like clint eastwood, morgan freeman and matt demon i put my butts down on a chair and started watching it on my laptop and right from the start i loved every single frame of dis film. morgan freeman and matt demon were truly amazing in their characters with their flawless south African accent. although i never enjoyed rugby but dis film made me like the game and final match was just like a thriller. what is best about the movie is dat its all true and clint eastwood totally justified the novel. one of my favis of eastwood- freeman collaborations.

11 December 2009,Invictus' action is caught in a scrum,"Invictus (it means unconquered, I had to look it up too) is a story about Nelson Mandela (played by Morgan Freeman) and his quest to unify an apartheid-riddled South Africa through the game of rugby in the early 1990s.

The story begins with Mandela's release from prison. He immediately becomes elected president and immediately begins work on bringing his country together. And when I type immediately, I actually mean slowly. The movie drags along at a snail's pace for about an hour. For being a movie dealing with a vicious sport such as rugby, I was expecting it move along quickly and with a lot of brute force such as I would find in a rugby match. I forgot about scrums, which can take a while to produce any kind of action. And, this movie did exactly that.

The movie has some very strong moments though. One in particular was where Director Clint Eastwood took a small fraction of the people of South Africa and used them to show what was happening on a larger scale. He did this by focusing on Mandela's security detail. Mandela had rehired the old security detail (a bunch of white guys) to work with his personal bodyguards (a bunch of black guys) to protect him. Mandela used these two groups as an example of how he wanted his fellow countrymen to act. Eastwood couldn't show all 42 million South Africans having disagreements so he took eight people to tell the story of cooperation through their actions. Great job, I get it.

So, what about the rugby? Wasn't this supposed to be a movie about rugby? Yes, I think it was supposed to be. It was also a movie about Mandela's quest to bring people together. The rugby was used well, and not knowing enough about the sport, I wasn't totally engulfed by the action scenes. There was one scene where the South African rugby team taught impoverished youths the rules of rugby. Here I wish they had capitalized on the scene more by telling the audience what goes on in a rugby match. It wasn't until the last 20 minutes where we were finally wowed with some gritty rugby action during the 1995 World Cup.

Should you see this movie? Tough question. If I say no, I go against the Eastwood/ Freeman establishment, which I don't want to do because I think Freeman should get an Oscar nod for his portrayal of Mandela. If I say yes, I wouldn't say it enthusiastically. So I'll say this, if you want a biopic on Nelson Mandela's life, don't see this movie; and if you want a rough, in- your-face rugby movie, don't see this movie. But, if you want a little bit of both, then by all means take two hours and go see it.",8
29 April 2011,Invictus: Some Compelling Drama,"Despite my ferocious adoration of the films of Clint Eastwood, particularly the more recent ones with accomplished cinematographer Tom Stern, Invictus was a film I had avoided seeing, simply due to my complete disinterest in sport and inability to watch it. Finally, however, I was forced to put my dislike aside to get my Clint fix.

Reliving the story of Nelson Mandela's early presidency, Invictus follows the newly elected leader's plan to unite his post-apartheid nation through the country's rugby team, a former symbol of the white oppressors. Collaborating with captain Francois Pienaar to establish the Springboks team as an institution which can be supported by all colours, Mandela sees World Cup victory as a much needed catalyst to healing the wounds of racial segregation.

It is precisely in the above plot summary that one can find what turned me from getting to this film for so very long a time, the unifying power of rugby not something I exactly believed in whatsoever. That said, any collaboration between Eastwood and Stern is automatically compulsory viewing material for me, so huge a fan am I of the sum of their creative visions. And yet, I couldn't help but maintain a scepticism nevertheless. Opening with newsreels covering Mandela's release from prison and election to office mixed with shots of Freeman altered to look like the newsreel footage, Invictus does not dwell on the politics surrounding the election, preferring to begin instead with the new president's first day in office. We immediately see, as perhaps we ought to expect, the theme of race relations coming to the forefront of the film's focus. The presidential guard serves as the primary representation of the changing state of South Africa, the two colours begrudgingly forced to work together and eventually coming to trust, even like, one another. As Mandela comes to have his bodyguards overcome their prejudices and forgive those who did them wrong, so too does he slowly repair his country's damaged state, caused as it is by the distrust of decades of enforced segregation. The first thing to address must surely be the performances. As Mandela's personal choice, Freeman does a very fine job. Not usually much a fan of his roles, I was behind him the whole way. Damon too is on good form, better than I've known him to be in the past (his wonderful performance in Hereafter suggests that he works well with Eastwood). Fortunately for me, the scenes of rugby are minimal, far more time spent off the pitch than on. Now, as someone who really just doesn't get sport at all, I of course had no familiarity with this story, and no idea whether or not the Springboks would emerge triumphant. The fact that I was rather interested to find out says something about the film's tension, though I would be lying if I said I was shouting for them. What is impressive is that through the sweeping crane shots of thousands of faces cheering on their team and the images of black and white united together in mutual hope, I came to understand— if only slightly—why sport can mean so much to so many. And do believe me when I say that that really does say an awful lot.

Though it falls far short of his best work, Invictus is a strong offer from Eastwood. As someone completely ignorant of its subject matter, the fact that I was made to be interested in the match, and even brought to understand the meaning of sport for people, does much to contribute to my appreciation of the film. It may not be a masterpiece, but it makes for some compelling drama.",7
22 February 2010,This movie is an experience - I will never forget it,"The music is an important part of this movie experience. Such as a rugby match in slow motion with a background of African music. Wonderful!

Then there is also the happiness of seeing how people of different races find friendship. There are several examples of this.

I think the movie has some hidden messages in the rugby and haka scenes. I have not been aware of such messages in movies before, but I will be looking out for them now.

One of the movie's many strengths is that it is not filled with the usual clichés about life in South Africa. It shows people enjoying themselves, and it shows that in the end courtesy and intelligence can win the day in human affairs.

6 January 2010,Inspirational,"One Great Movie... Inivictus is one of Clint Eastwood's best movies without a doubt.The acting by Morgan Freeman is just exceptional and truly inspiring.If you are looking for a nice entertaining movie nothing to serious but not comedy this is it. It will make you happy and inspire you, the whole idea of using rugby to unite a nation by Nelson Mandela ( Morgan Freeman) was laid out so well in the movie that it was just fantastic. Its one of the few movies which add sports into it and the sports is not just a drag going aside but it flows really well with the plot.The whole movie is done really well and is one of my personal favorites and i feel nothing should stop you from watching this.

6 July 2011,powerful movie great poem,"Out of the night that covers me, Black as the Pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll. I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.

That is one powerful poem I tell you. I know it inspires me, and it is one of things that kept Nelson Mandela going during his 25 years in prison. The film Invictus from 2009 directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Matt Damon is a good movie. Is it a great movie hmmmm.....well some of my biggest problems with the movie are things that actually are true, so I don't know what to think. I mean Nelson Mandela chooses a rugby team to be the symbol of cooperation and reconciliation after apartheid, and then shortly thereafter they host the world cup and he in part Drives the team to victory and gets the country to rally together black and white behind this one cause. Well I would normally say come on I can write better fiction in my sleep. However, it pretty much went down that way, so what can you do but heap another log on the grand fire that is the legend of Nelson Mandela. Morgan Freeman does a spot on Mandela and it helps they do kind of look alike. I liked this movie, I didn't love this movie, nor do I think it is a classic in the making, but with time maybe my mind will change. In any event I learned a really kick ass poem. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",7
16 October 2010,Peaceful and inspiring,"Nothing all too intense going on here and that's nice for a change. To my understanding, the story is not exactly historically accurate, but fortunately not because Clint Eastwood felt the need to artificially generate personal conflict and tension, a moving back story just so we can worry, if Johnnys foot will heal in time before the big game. Instead he lets the central message dominate above the little problems of separate characters, pretty irrelevant they would be compared to a whole country in fear.

So just let the positive vibes in. It's a nice, peaceful story with a very inspiring feeling.

17 December 2009,Simple storytelling at its best,"Clint Eastwood delivers another great work. Morgan Freeman fit the part so well. But I believe two things made the movie great. Matt Damon is the first. I believe he performed at a deeper level than anything he has done, including Private Ryan or Will Hunting. The other was the setting and cinematography of it. I felt like I was really in South Africa, and experiencing the tension as well as the concealed hope of the situation. The weakest part was the music. The score was fine, but at several points music with lyrics distracted. African music was uplifting; but modern songs detracted from what was taking place.

This wasn't really a family movie, nor a sports story (although it would be good to learn a few rules of rugby if you aren't familiar with the sport). It was a true story of hurt, anger, forgiveness, and hope. ""I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul.""

24 June 2013,A good movie!,"As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning, I can tell you you the entertaining, inspiring and enjoyable ""Invictus"" exceeded all my expectations.

It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.

I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool.

6 February 2010,Rugby ended racism in South Africa?,"The film made up of one half showing the problems Mandela faced during his presidency and how he tried to unite the county and end apartheid and one half showing the actual rugby games.

The scenes with Mandela (Freeman) were very well directed and the portrayal of Mandela was close to flawless (as expected from Morgan Freeman). However the focus was on the rugby and it seemed Mandela spent more time watching the games and talking to the players than doing anything else. You are left with a strong feeling of not having enough insight into Mandela's presidency.

This isn't helped by the rugby scenes being filmed akin to a live televised sporting event. You see the same angles ad nauseam and the camera is generally so wide you have no idea what is happening. The director also seems to refuse to use a shallow depth of field at any point - you have no idea what you should be focusing on even on close up angles.

It can be argued all this is intentional as you're not supposed to focus on the game, but should rather focus on the crowd and see just how much impact the game had in uniting the country. However this premise was hugely overplayed in my opinion and the movie makes it look like rugby single-handedly ended racism in South Africa.

With over an hour of rugby footage, it's hard to justify just how poorly the action was filmed and with an overplayed premise, even Morgan Freeman's fantastic acting can't save this one - 4/10.",2
4 June 2010,Unbeaten,"Even though the plot is known/predictable the theme ""TO UNITE THE PEOPLE"" was effective from the start to the end.........Clint Eastwood with his extraordinary caliber as director,Morgan Freeman with his omnipotent acting and Matt damon with his energy provided for a movie that inspired me...........As I say biographies,real life events do inspire u........The scene of the plane reaching out to wish goodluck was unexpected and great......I had no idea that it had happened in 1995.......I was 10 years old when this had happened........Due to films based on real life events,biographies and autobiographies I get to know what all were& are happening.........I highly felt for Mr Mandela for he forgave those who had done wrong to him and imprisoned him for 27 years........

22 June 2012,You need more than rugby to bury Apartheid,"'One Team, One Country.' The team was the Springboks; the country was South Africa. The slogan was the brainwave of Edward Griffiths, who was CEO of the South African rugby union and communications director of the South Africa rugby team during the 1995 World Cup.

On 24 June 1995, 43million South Africans came together to watch the Springboks beat the New Zealand All Blacks in the Rugby World Cup final at the Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg. Invictus, a new film directed by Clint Eastwood and based on John Carlin's book Playing The Enemy, celebrates this feat as the crowning moment in Nelson Mandela's campaign to forge a new, democratic South Africa. Non-South Africans may wonder: why rugby?

For South Africans, rugby is a big deal. It was the sport of the hated ruling Afrikaners and as much an icon of Apartheid as the orange-white- blue flag of the old regime or its national anthem 'Die Stem'. No black person would be associated with the sport on principle. Football was the game of black South Africa, while Indians, like my family, played cricket. Everyone (including all the prisoners incarcerated with Mandela on Robben Island) always supported the away-team against South Africa. My mother still supports England against South Africa – old habits die hard.

As much as rugby was hated by the black majority, it inspired a religious fervour in the Afrikaners. They had suffered under the sports boycott that prevented South Africa from competing internationally in the one sport it excelled at. Mandela's eureka moment was to recognise that if he could win the hearts and minds of the Afrikaners through their one great passion, rugby, then governing the new South Africa would be a great deal easier. With the 1995 Rugby World Cup being held in South Africa, Mandela saw an ideal opportunity to unite the country. But winning over the black masses to his PR campaign was not going to be easy.

The campaign around the Rugby World Cup reflected the realpolitik of the ruling African National Congress (ANC). During the struggle to overthrow Apartheid, the ANC had allied itself with the Communist Party (SACP) – and the SACP's rhetoric was far more effective at mobilising the black masses than the elitist middle-class nationalism of the ANC leadership. But in power, after the first democratic elections of 1994 following Mandela's release from prison in 1990, the ANC was eager to shake off its communist and working-class allies and build new alliances with the middle classes and capitalist elites in South Africa. What better means than rugby to achieve this new coalition?

Invictus, Latin for 'unconquered', is the title of a short poem by the British poet William Ernest Henley. Mandela used to recite it to himself while in prison. Eastwood's film focuses on the build-up to the World Cup final and the developing bond between Springbok captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) and Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman). Damon is a convincing Afrikaner, while Freeman, who has been Oscar-nominated for his performance, is an uncanny look-a-like for Mandela. He's so impressive that I can forgive the odd lapse in pronunciation. It doesn't matter that he says 'perry' instead of 'petty' and 'Springbucks' instead of 'Springboks', because in every other way he is very credible.

Alongside this pivotal relationship, there are some lighter comedic moments, too, like the understandably indignant reactions of the newly appointed black bodyguards who find themselves having to work alongside those who once protected FW de Klerk's Apartheid government. The white guards talk rugby; the blacks don't. They are puzzled by Mandela's newfound interest in the sport, especially when he overrides a decision by the militant government sports department to change the name of the team from the hated Springboks to the more neutral Proteas.

Why take such a stubborn stand over such a petty issue, Mandela's secretary asks him? Mandela responds that if he can't face up to hard decisions now, then he never will. This recognition of the difficulty of forging a new alliance underpins the worldwide respect and admiration for Mandela.

Towards the end of the film, a Boeing 747 flies low over Johannesburg; its thunderous roar terrifying the 62,000 in the stadium waiting for the big rugby final to start. Then, when the plane's underside with the words 'Good Luck Bokke' painted on it in giant black letters, become visible, terror turns to delight. Just before kick-off, Mandela walks on to the field to meet the Springboks team. 'Nelson, Nelson, Nelson' call the crowds ecstatically, and the chants are shown reverberating in living rooms and pubs around South Africa.

I left the cinema feeling a little teary – but optimistic, too. It may be because as a South African living abroad at the time, I wasn't there when the masses celebrated Mandela's release; I wasn't there when the nation queued to vote in the first democratic election; and I missed this last euphoric moment when rugby briefly united a country.

Today, it all feels like a long time ago. The assertion of ethnic rights, the desperate protests in the squatter camps and the squabble over resources in a period of global recession have seen to that. Will this year's football World Cup achieve something similar? Or is the belief that sport can bring unity and purpose to a divided country nothing but a chimera, like the rainbow that disappears when the sun is no longer shining?",9
28 May 2019,Inspired playing,"As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning, I can tell you you the entertaining, inspiring and enjoyable ""Invictus"" exceeded all my expectations.

It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.

I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

Viva Clint Eastwood, viva Morgan Freeman, viva Madiba.

PS. I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.

12 October 2022,I Saw The 16th Man First,"The 16th Man, a 1-hour ESPN film on the same subject was released 7 months after this movie, but I saw it first. It really affected my ability to watch this movie without comparing them. What I saw in Invictus was a real weakness in telling the full story of the reality of the situation surrounding truth & reconciliation. I found it surprising, considering it had more than double the run time of The 16th Man. Invictus was a tad disjointed in it's inclusion of ""characters"". I understand that it's a movie, but I believe it should have focused on more than the people played by its two headline actors. Simply put, it didn't tell the story of as many of the real people as I think it should/could have. Between this film and the documentary, I would recommend The 16th Man to get the reality and emotional impact. I rate Invictus a 6 because of the direction, performances and production values. If it had a stronger script and editing, it would have gotten a higher rating from me.

17 January 2017,Superb. Uplifting.,"With Clint Eastwood directing, Morgan Freeman playing Nelson Mandela, and Matt Damon sharing top billing, how could Invictus fail? The answer is that it doesn't, as this rich historical drama provides great insight into South African history and the philosophy of one of the 20th century's greatest leaders. The film tells the true story of Mandela's presidency as he struggles to overcome prejudice and years of hatred and violence between blacks and whites. Seeing in the nation's rugby team an opportunity to unite his people, he befriends the team's captain (Damon).

While loaded with true-life sports movie clichés, Invictus overcomes them through the strength of its acting and the attention to political detail, from the desire of blacks to take back their country to the fears of whites about losing their voice in the newly democratic nation. I was fascinated and moved by the power of Mandela's philosophies of forgiveness, respect, and fellowship to steer both groups in the direction of unity. Invictus has brief strong language but is otherwise free of potentially offensive content.",8
27 July 2013,"Moved me to the very core of my soul!! I loved it, as will you!","By the end of this movie I was shaken, and weeping for joy. This is one of the best feel good movies I've seen of all time. The story flows from scene to scene and it was a good pace.... what else would you expect from an exceptional director like Clint Eastwood. The actors did a fantastic job. Thank you!

I know you will enjoy this movie. I enjoyed the soundtrack so much I had to purchase it.

I would like to say more about this movie, but I can only speak of the feeling it gave me when it was finished. And that was, it left me feeling positive, and grateful to have someone like Nelson Mandela in our world. He is a true inspiration.

Silver-lining: this is a definite buy it movie, including the soundtrack!

17 February 2010,"Mandela got a deserved Nobel Prize so ""Invictus"" deserves an Oscar","This movie just worth every coin I've paid to see it. It's a perfect lesson from how to give a tribute to a great person by making a film.The footage goes further from any other Mandela's documentary, it focuses the life from an entire country and places to the audience in a very realistic sight from all the white-black hate called Apartheid that Southafrica have been through. The film gives a great lesson, there's no better way to change things than doing it by the example. Mandela lost almost 40% from his life on behalf of his nation, let's not forgive that ever. I think Morgan Freeman's acting was just the way everybody always expects from him, at the same time his character in this film reminds me his great job in ""Shawshank Redemption"", doing almost the same part,I mean, a person who even in jail never thought as a criminal. Although, the movie was a good way to promote the next FIFA World Cup in Southafrica y Coca Cola.

1 February 2010,I can't say anything bad about Clint. He's a living LEGEND! So let's all praise him whist he's alive.,"I've always admired Clint Eastwood's work as Actor & Director from the Spaghetti Westerns to Gran Torino. I will ignore the few dodgy movies in between (especially the one's with the chimp). But overall he's got better with age in his acting but more especially with his directing. Million Dollar Baby and Gran Torino are testament to this. Invictus was surely a big project for him to take on, because it was outside the USA and involved a sport called Rugby?? I reckon Clint did a great job in showing the racism between both blacks & whites without going over the top. But I'm sure there will be S.Africans who will not agree with the entire story told and Rugby fans who cannot relate to some of the ridiculous rugby scenes. But who cares? Who else would take on such a task like Clint? He's still breaking barriers with racism at his age when he could easily take the easy route of being a Hollywood star. I don't know where he still gets the motivation and energy from at his age to do it. But he sure knows how to drain every emotion from the cinema goer with superb acting, storyline & soundtrack. Morgan Freeman and Clint must be definitely up for the Oscars.",9
13 April 2010,Another Great human interest film from Eastwood,"Invictus Morgan Freeman Matt Damon Nursing a hangover in a flat somewhere in Upton Park, East London that's where I was. Not when I watched Invictus, when Mandela was released I mean. Isn't it supposed to be one of those 'where were you when' moments? Well I'd crashed the night in Upton Park after a party and everyone sat around watching it on TV.

Invictus is about those early years of the new South Africa after Mandela became president. A new nation, a new democracy, a new anthem and a new hope. The film chooses to focus on one aspect of those moments, South Africa's rugby team the Springboks. For those who don't know rugby, due to the aparthied system the Springboks were alienated for decades unable to play in international tournaments. By the time Mandela was president of the new RSA, they were awarded the hosting of the 1995 Rugby World Cup as a reward. Rugby at that time was considered a whiteman's sport in South Africa, not taken to by the black population who preferred soccer, and rugby was a symbol of the apartied oppression. Director Clint Eastwood focuses on how against all odds Mandela helped the Springboks not only manage greatness on the rugby field but using the world cup and the rejuvenating national pride to became a truly national team and a unifying force.

The story is well told in a good chronological and factual order, nothing is hazy or left unexplained. It would have been easy if not tempting to fill the movie with rugby but no doubt at the risk of alienating some of the audience and Clint Eastwood, who as a director has always found great human interest stories has created a good balance between action, character development and drama, although I felt the onfield rugby action was a little soft. It's always hard to capture sport in film, and I would go as far as to say only the 1960's 'Grand Prix' and 'Any Given Sunday' have successfully managed to do it. One wonders whether Eastwood would have been better off using actual game footage but for those non rugby enthusiasts it was probably fine as it is.

Freeman is more than excellent as Mandela. He is able to capture the warmness Mandela projected, his mannerisms and body posture to make himself believable and likable. He also brings a subtle enough attempt at Mandela's vocal range that whilst it slips from time to time and you know it's not Mandela and you are aware Freeman is trying to be Mandela it doesn't spoil the character. Matt Damon puts in a strong performance as François Pienaar but I felt that not enough was made of Pienaar character and this it must be said is not Damon's fault but Eastwoods. I remember those days well, and as much as I detested seeing South Africa win rugby, it must be said that Pienaar was indeed a fantastic spokesman, ambassador even not only the sport but for his country.

Eastwood Concentrates on Mandela pushing the Springboks and pushing the country to get behind them and yes it was a tremendous act of reconciliation given their political and racial attachments, but Pienaar was instrumental in making Mandela's plan work and without him both on and off the field the Bokke would not exist today. Sadly Matt Damon was limited to playing Pienaar as a sportsman , the occasional motivational speech and a limited dialogue I just felt not enough was made of Pienaar's real ability to lead by example both on and off the field. I never liked the Springboks as a team, especially after the most recent World Cup ( or Australian video referees) but it must be said Pienaar was a superb ambassador for the sport and his country and this does not come across in the film. Other than that it's an engaging film, there's some nice character development threads amongst Mandela's staff, the security forces and the Springbok players, the script is strong and there's a definite positive energy about the film, it leaves you with that sense of hope South Africa had back then. Looking at South African then and the South Africa now is as much as testimony to Mandela's greatness and it's such a shame it's all gone downhill since Mandela handed over the reigns. You don't need to be a rugby fan to enjoy this film, excellent.",8

1 July 2012,Outstanding film; one of the very best,"Wow. What a fantastic film this is. I was a bit unsure about the film before watching it, and despite owning the DVD for some weeks I had put off watching it. I thought the film would just have plodded along, and because I am not a fan of rugby, I did not think it would hold my interest for long.

But how wrong I was. Invictus is possibly one of the best films I have ever seen. I really think it has everything; brilliant acting by Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, great plot, excellent film directing and fantastic inspirational music.

I even had butterflies in my stomach whilst watching the film, and halfway through I thought to myself: This film is great.

I think Morgan Freeman gave the performance of his life, and it shows that he is acting powerhouse. But most of all, my hat comes off to Clint Eastwood. Over the last ten years his films have been phenomenal, and this could be his best one yet.

I could not recommend Invictus more to film lovers. It is a modern-day masterpiece, and unless you are only a fan of high octane action films, you will like this - a lot.",10
25 December 2009,Uninteresting unless you like rugby or are South African,"Clint Eastwood has made a string of great movies this decade, but for me Invictus isn't one of them. I don't know anything rugby about nor do I care for it. I didn't know much about Nelson Mandela either, and after watching the movie I didn't learn much about him, as the movie isn't so much about Mandela than it is about rugby. Morgan Freeman is a good choice to play Mandela, but you can still feel he's acting as his accent isn't that genuine. Matt Damon is also in the movie, but his part is nothing significant. This time Eastwood isn't starring in his own film.

You can skip this one unless you like rugby or you're South African.

4 July 2010,Loved this film.,"It is correct that nobody could play Mandela other than Morgan Freeman! Not mentioned as often is the outstanding portrayal of Captain Francois Pinnear by Matt Damon. This is a supporting role, but truly one of the finest roles of his career.

I think it is time for supporting actor Kgorgorge to move into lead roles. He was absolutely captivating in his commitment to protecting Mandela. The roles played by all the others in supporting roles were precious and perfect, especially Brenda and Mary.In short, since it is a Clint Eastwood movie, it is perfectly cast, down to the sports/new announcer. The editing appears seamless. The aerial shots of the mountains and coastal areas of CapeTown serve to emphasize the isolation of this metropolitan area.

A favorite whether or not every detail is factually accurate.

12 December 2009,Good but not great,"I left the theater mildly entertained. Glad I saw the movie and thought Freeman and Damon did a good job, but I was really disappointed in all the side shots or stories that never pan out. Constantly trying to throw in some type of adrenaline type shot that completely fizzles. Motorcade being slowed down by celebrations, the shot to the top of the rooftops, security celebrating and not paying attention, and then we go to the next scene. It seemed like the writers were trying to add in historical perspectives but would only allow the barest of information. Mandela's family and relationship with his daughter and wife. Happens when the security details gets together for the first time. We see lots of tension and then the story just kind of goes on from there This happens often in the film and instead of adding to the main stories seems to take away and dilute the story But having said that, I did enjoy the movie and it makes me want to do a little more research to find more of the historical perspective.

6 February 2010,"Excellent, Inspirational, Solid","Invictus, Clint Eastwood's latest movie starring Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, is yet another success for the prolific 79 year old director. It is the true story of Nelson Mandela's struggle to unite South Africa after decades of apartheid, shortly after his release from prison and during his first term as President.

The mission that he sets upon himself and upon Matt Damon's character- Francois Pienaar- is unconventional to say the least. To win the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Mandela realizes that this will be the only way to unify such a divided nation. Francois is the captain of the Springboks, South Africa's national rugby team. He tells him ""If I got elected President, you can win the Cup."" However, not only is South Africa a huge underdog, the country is racially torn and greatly divided between the blacks and the Afrikaners, or white South Africans. The rugby team being made up almost solely of whites, the blacks traditionally cheer for the opposing team.

Mandela's vision of bringing his country together through sport and national pride is both a political and human triumph. Morgan Freeman plays him brilliantly and brings in front of our eyes the man whose charm, inner strength, courage and intelligence make him a hero to so many around the world. He is an outstanding Mandela and it is true that in many scenes it is hard to differentiate the two. His physique, mannerisms, voice, accent are all a perfect match. He is a replica of Nelson Mandela and in fact when asked who could interpret him in a film the former President answered: ""Morgan Freeman"", quite an endorsement for the actor. Matt Damon gives a very realistic portrayal as well, having gained weight and muscle for the role, and completely altering his accent.

We see the human, real side of Mandela- or ""Madiba"" as he was called- a man with his own struggles and doubts, and strained family relationships. When asked about his children he replies that he has forty two million of them and one senses his enormous sense of purpose and love. There are heartwarming moments when both his frailty and determination are exposed. For instance, when having memorized the names of each member of the team, he slowly steps onto the field and shakes their hands one by one, wearing the green Springbok jersey. Or when Francois and his team visit the miniscule jail cell where he was imprisoned for 27 years of his life, with a poem as his motivation to ""stand when all he wanted to do was lie down"", only to come out even stronger and ready to exceed his own expectations.

Fabio, who loves soccer and I know will watch the World Cup this summer almost as obsessively as Madiba was following the performance of the Springboks, thought the rugby scenes were too long. I found them to be really interesting, well done and fun to watch even though I was not familiar with the sport.

This is a powerful, solid movie with excellent performances. Lessons of forgiveness, team work, unity and perseverance make this film very inspirational. I very much enjoyed it as I have all of Mr. Eastwood's latest. His films are always of an extremely high caliber- in acting, script, cinematography and directing. This one is no exception.

My rating: 8.5 Fabio's: 7 Total score: 15.5 For more reviews, check out http://paulinasmovies.blogspot.com",8
22 June 2021,"A film packed with emotion, turning points, and growth...","A film packed with emotion, turning points, and growth, Invictus is an enjoyable viewing experience. Although it centers around sport and it may not be incredibly personal, you may find yourself relating to the characters and understanding the events that took place within Mandela's first years as president in ways you have not before.

The film follows the story of Nelson Mandela's inspiration to unite South Africa, centering upon his goal to have a united South Africa. While divisions between the black population and white population are still heavy, Mandela realizes that black supporters cheer on the opposing side when the Springboks take the field. He must do something to fix this and joins forces with the captain of the Springboks. The team faces challenges and overcome barriers within themselves and in the country.

Morgan Freeman was a wonderful addition to the cast and played an excellent Mandela. He really encapsulated the resilient man he was and played it well throughout the span of the movie. The cinematography made sure to capture all the angles of tension and excitement while the dialogue was enough to get the plot across. Although there may have been accent slips, a few scenes that ran too fast, and messy dialogue, the film is overall a good one to watch and empathize with.",7

Freeman did a great job doing his role as the President (Nelson Mandela). The editing and different angles are great in my opinion. The music in the background gave it a proud and happy feeling. The film was at first didn't come off pretentious I thought. Its based on the first few years of Nelson Mandela being President. Nelson somehow brought the country together by pushing a Rugby team.

12 December 2012,Clint Eastwoork and Morgan Freeman at their best.,"Another great movie by Clint Eastwood and acted inspirationally by Morgan Freeman as Mandela. Morgan has always seemed to play supporting roles still at a great level and seeing him finally play a Starting role and runs with it. Its hard to imagine that this role the fits like a glove to Morgan Freeman did not get him the Oscar that he has deserved for so long. Its amazing to see a movie about this man be made that seemed to preach about forgiveness and someone who reached across the aisle to unite a divided country. While his election caused a lot of unrest among the ruling whites and the years worth of oppression. With his wisdom he knew that the Rugby team could cause more unrest if it were to be ended, so he instead choose to challenge the captain to win the world cup and unite the whole country. The whole message for forgiveness, unity and persistence make this a movie to see. The relationships created weather with the black and white security detail, the team reaching out to the communities to teach them how to play was a testament to Mandela and his leadership. The way Mandela used the sport of rugby to unite a nation and the way Eastwood also showed this was a very emotional and delightful message that people should be cheering for. In one of his more straight forward works of his career Clint has accomplished one of his most inspirational films in Invictus. Everything in the movie worked on so many degrees of art without being too exaggerated and egotistical it only asks of you to have a open mind and heart. The way Eastwood uses his skills to direct the film so perfectly and to lay back directing when he needs to with out pushing the subject matter too much in our faces. In a time when neighboring countries replaced that white power base that ended up with more self serving regimes whose power was maintained by seizing assets of the former white citizens, that were also replaced with friends being placed into positions of power. These countries then resulted into a land of squalor and destitution. He was then treated with a lack of confidence raising question on how he will be any different. The film was Mandela but the rugby team was his symbol of what he faced that the Africans rooted for the other teams because of apartheid and division between all the races. With his focus and determination the symbol of division would be revived to be the catalyst to unite all South Africans. We may all like a feel food under dog story which this was but this was a much more touching film that is more about people coming together to rebuild their country. With so many great moments and a little romanticized bit of history, this will be something you enjoy and stays with you after the movie is over. He did not solve all the problems of the country but he helped create the foundation for a unification and to improve and grow.",9

25 January 2010,A film that aims for an ambitious goal but skews the kick wide of the mark,"As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning, I can tell you you the entertaining, inspiring and enjoyable ""Invictus"" exceeded all my expectations.

It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.

I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

Viva Clint Eastwood, viva Morgan Freeman, viva Madiba.

PS. I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.

Of the films Eastwood has directed, my favorites, in no particular order, are ""Unforgiven"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Gran Torino"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"",""Bird"" and ""Invictus"".

20 January 2010,Not one of Eastwood's best,"It will be interesting to see if this movie has universal appeal, particularly in USA where Rugby is confined to colleges mostly on the west coast. The thread of the story of course was more about Mandela's wish to find a way for uniting the country through sport and this came across quite well along with the scepticism on both sides of the political divide and the mistrust of the new administration. Personally I thought the sequences of the Rugby went on a little long although they were reasonably well done. The question remains though, would the film have been made had the result of the game been different? Character development was not strong apart from the Mandela character.Matt Damon was fairly convincing but the film, for me at least, failed to reach the heights of other recent Eastwood films. I am sure the film will have a large audience in South Africa and to a lesser degree other Rugby playing nations.

17 March 2015,One man to make a difference in a country torn by apartheid,"Morgan Freeman is an exceptional actor to portray a prominent political figure as Nelson (Madiba) Mandela. Matt Damon as Francois Pienaar is also superb. I do not know much about the sport, nor politics but I can easily recognize and value great leadership by example, humility through character of forgiveness and reconciliation, and acknowledging that South Africa is composed of mix races both blacks and whites. This movie is very justified with all the events in 1995 as close to 100% historically accurate as possible. President Nelson (Madiba) Mandela used the 1995 Rugby World Cup to unified a torn country with a common interest as a step to move forward from apartheid, crime, poverty to become a ""Rainbow Nation."" I enjoyed how he was inspired by William Ernest Henley's ""Invictus"" poem while he was in prison during his 30 year time and help inspire Francois Pienaar, captain of the Springbok, to lead his rugby team. Both Freeman and Damon perfected their accent as true South Afrikaans. As an American also living in a mixed race country, I value Pienaar and Mandela's work and great efforts to emerge a country with a broken past to rise and rise. The movie ends with Nelson (Madiba) Mandela's voice over reciting versus from the William Ernest Henley's poem. Overall GREAT movie!!

""Invictus"" By William Ernest Henley

Out of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds and shall find me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.",10

4 March 2010,Deserved a More Refined Treatment,"Let's just say that I was expecting much more from this film due to its director and significant theme besides Morgan Freeman's nomination. But I feel disappointed mostly due to the lack of originality and distinction in the visual language: boring shoots, slow edition, poor camera movement, not to mention the lame dialogs or conventional sound.

Freeman indeed finds a role that is just perfect for him, but that could have contributed more to the story than merely to cite some quotes of leadership. But he does a lot with the little he was given, something that could not be achieved by Matt Damon in the same scale.

I think that the film rested on the sports scenes for too long -especially at the end- wasting a precious topic that might have been handled from other perspectives, rather than the single development of the game, just like any teen-oriented commercial movie does. The splendor of the regular Eastwood's films is not shown in this piece of work, limiting its relevance to the historical documentarian value delivered in an unpolished frame.",7
10 July 2013,It's much more than JUST rugby,"Though the movie doesn't give much insights into the life of the living legend known as NELSON MANDELA, it sure tells us a lot about what the man is made of.That ""we are the master of our fate, we are the captain of our soul"".

Forgiveness is a mighty powerful weapon that can make or break nations.How a sport can unite a divided nation into ONE, it is a well known fact but to actually be able to do that in a country like SOUTH Africa,at a time when it was ready to rise from the ashes or to fall into its own crevices lying beneath the surface and ready to torn apart the whole nation again into TWO,is what gives me INSPIRATION to rise whenever i'll fall...

The entire cast is brilliant without going overboard in situations that could've been intense.A truly inspiring movie that can be imprinted in your heart for the rest of your lives if you're ready to FORGIVE people and make this world a better place to live in!

15 August 2014,Screenplay results in totally off target absraction,"The movie only focuses on one small part of an otherwise astounding account of a political genius and triumph against all odds that make the real South Africa/Mandela story so remarkable. The movie by association, trivializes, neglects and attempts to abstract the most important and historically relevant part of the overall story into some kind of Hollywood style under-dog sport movie a la mighty ducks. Granted there was already the ""Long walk to freedom"" movie that the film makers wanted to distinguish themselves from, but in the end the only analogy I can think of is they may as well have made a movie about ""Gandhi"" solely based on his supporting role in a regional cricket match between India and Pakistan ... years after all the really important political struggles and accomplishments that preceded it. Ask yourself this question... ""Do you feel uninspired? Well do you? Punk""

9 January 2019,Fascinating story behind an iconic moment in sports,"Invictus is based on the famous rugby finale held in South Africa in 1995. The post match presentation where Nelson Mandela presented the white springboks caotain with the trophy has become iconic and this is based on that moment. The setting and music paints an image of a bitterly divided country being gently brought together. Echos of apartheid linger and Nelson Mandela artfully turns the Springboks from a symbol of white South Africa to the team of the nation. Music and stadium scenes are quite overwhelming, while scenes of the mostly white team touring the black townships and building bonds with the children of black South Africa are heartwarming to say the least. A strong cast, including Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon. Portrayed is the the conversion of a lackluster South Africa national rugby union team to 1995 Rugby World Cup winners and focus for a reborn South Africa.

Everyone eyes will be on South Africa in 2010. What better way to celebrate one of the most beloved story of peace and freedom than to re-enact the 1995 World of Rugby?

Let me ask You a question avid reader... Would an experienced movie watcher really pass up a movie directed by Clint Eastwood featuring Morgan Freeman?

All in all: This IS a feel-good drama but who doesn't need one sometimes?

13 February 2010,Moving portrayal of a great man and a great occasion...,"I had the honour of seeing this with a South African couple who knew all the landmarks and the sly South African in-jokes, which went completely over my head.

It was a wonderful portrayal of Mandela's humility as a man, and also of his power as President. Freeman is superb, although the accent wavers occasionally, and Damon is also strong as Francois Pienaar.

The sporting sequences are some of the most realistic ever committed to film. Some deep research must have gone into those sequences as you feel you are right on the field with the players.

Viva Clint Eastwood, viva Morgan Freeman, viva Madiba.

PS. I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.

Of the films Eastwood has directed, my favorites, in no particular order, are ""Unforgiven"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Gran Torino"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"",""Bird"" and ""Invictus"". Yes, it's really that good. ""Invictus"" is another winner from Clint. He just seems to get better with age. What a creative roll he is currently on.

25 July 2010,Dull Ghandi meets Remember the Titans and Rudi,"Here is the plot: Nelson Mandela (played by Morgan Freeman), upon becoming president, decides to use his country's return to international interaction as a catalyst for smoothing the segue from apartheid to a mixed society. He decides that the beloved (by whites) rugby team should be the focal point and asks the captain, played by Matt Damon, to inspire his men.

Why it fails: 1)Like Glory or Remember the Titans, this movies simply tells a story by having one episode after another without any depth of character or emotional charge, as though the source material of evil white people was enough to move you to cry(as opposed to Rudi, when he practices or gets rejected or finally makes the field you feel it, not so with Invictus). There is nothing inspiring nor moving, the direction is flat, and the three chapters to the movie are impossible to distinguish. Matt Damon takes his fellow prisoners on a trip to the prison where Mandela was for almost thirty years, but what should have been motivating was not. Morgan Freeman voice overs a poem, Invictus, during this visit, but his normally beautiful voice is wasted in over-sentimentality which not only beat the point to death but was difficult to understand. The movie seems to set up that Matt Damon will motivate his players to counter the New Zealanders' Maori psychologically devastating pregame war dance. Does he get the men to learn the ANC anthem to get them prepared before the match? It is impossible to tell what or whether they sing. A truly failed moment.

2) The dialog is dull, you remember almost none of it after the movie. Morgan Freeman is my favorite actor but almost all he does here is issue Ghandi-like one-liners which does not have nearly the same effect as they did in Ghandi.

3) In summary, the whole thing is emotionally flat, Mandela is a great man, but his legacy is white-washed from the ANC violence, not one Rugby player's personality was developed, including Matt Damon's, the directing was uninspiring,a good movie for people who want to feel politically correct and but have no depth.",6
24 August 2019,Stirring and inspiring stuff,"Clearly the world needs more people like Nelson Mandela leading their countries. It takes a special kind of human to forgive and to respect others like he did. Some other people who are now in positions of leadership are considerably more childish.

It's a pity that the Springbok victory at the World Cup is marred by the fact that nearly all of the All Blacks had food poisoning and were severely ill. A former chief bodyguard to Nelson Mandela believes betting syndicates were behind the deliberate poisoning.

7 May 2023,One of the best movies of all times!,"Firstly, as someone who lived in Africa, incl. RSA, the movie is very true to the actual events and the people. Almost a documentary of a critical phase of the South African life. It breathes loving-kindness and compassion, which unintentionally makes it a Buddhist movie too.

The movie is so highly emotional and inspiring, charged from the start and building up its climax by which time you will need a handkerchief or two.

Above all, the movie celebrates one of the most charismatic and courageous world leaders, unmatched by even the greatest spiritual and religious leaders in sharing love for other fellow human beings. Nelson Mandela is someone to always learn from and the movie does a great job in showing why that is.

I have seen it probably 10 times and undoubtedly, I will be watching it again.",10
27 May 2021,the movie was decent,"Invictus was a decent movie and in my opinion it was slow for the first 45 minutes. It also didn't have enough sports action for me. I really liked the picture and camera shots and angles. They were crisp and easy to watch. Morgan Freeman did a good job at playing Nelson Mandela. I liked how he did hand gestures when he was talking. However, Freeman's accent was choppy at times. He had a strong accent and other times it sounded like he wasn't even trying for an accent. The script and scenes were cheesy and predictable. In my opinion the movie was ok but I wouldn't watch it again. It was kind of stretched out in some parts and the good parts didn't make up for the slow ones.

9 December 2022,good movie to watch,"As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning, I can tell you you the entertaining, inspiring and enjoyable ""Invictus"" exceeded all my expectations.

It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.

I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool.

28 February 2010,Clint does it again !!,"Being a Clint Eastwood movie, I definitely had high expectations going into this one. And the movie more than lives up to ones expectations in all aspects. It is based on true events related to the initial struggle of Nelson Mandela to form a 'Rainbow Nation' when he became the President of South Africa. The storyline is pretty simple backed by good performances and direction. Also the movie unravels at a good pace. It has its own moments of joy and triumph.

It is truly one of the most inspirational movies one would ever come across. Also the fact that its a Clint Eastwood movie, makes it even more special. A modest 8/10 from my side.

8 July 2017,An inspiring story...do also read the source book,"The story of perhaps one of the most unlikely outcomes in my lifetime - Nelson Mandela, a black man jailed for ""terrorism"" in ultra racist Apartheid-era South Africa, becomes its president. This movie is really pretty good, but for the real-world version of this significant event, do read John Carlin's ""Playing the Enemy"" to see how even more unlikely and miraculous was this turn of events. The ""People who liked this also liked..."" section of this IMDb review should include ""The Color of Freedom"" (2007)...""the true story of a white South African racist whose life was profoundly altered by the black prisoner he guarded for twenty years. The prisoner's name was Nelson Mandela."" With Joseph Fiennes as the prison guard and Dennis Haysbert as Nelson Mandela.

14 December 2009,"Wonderfully acted and shot, if not exceedingly long and under edited","Solid performances from both Damon and Eastwood (director) and an excellent portrayal by Freeman. ""Invictus"" looks at the issues faced by the new government in post apartheid South Africa and one of the ways, support of the ""White"" Rugby team, that Nelson Mandela tries to heal the country. Freeman is very convincing in his role, maybe because he finally plays a role closer to his age, as Nelson Mandela. He exudes leadership and understanding. Damon plays the Rugby team Captain that presses his team to continue their quest for a rugby championship despite the distractions of the time. His performance is good but not great as he doesn't really show any range on emotions. The final piece of the triangle is Clint Eastwood. He continues his exploration of important contemporary topics and gives us the expected excellent cinematography. Where he lets down the audience is in the editing. Many scenes are much longer than required and summation makes the movie a half hour longer than it needed to be to achieve the desired end. Good movie, but I would wait for it on DVD.

12 December 2022,Invictus,"Invictus was a heart touching film to say the least it is so sad what had to happen in that country for it too become a fair country. I loved Invictus I don't even watch rugby but the way the actors played their roles, and the director directed the film was amazing. It was such an amazing film that I give it a ten out of ten it made me feel remorse for those who suffered and had to go through such unhuman times. I think the way they presented Mandela in this film was stunning from the way he walked to talked it was picture perfect. I really wish there was a second movie to it I don't know what it would be about, but I can guarantee that I would love it if its even half the movie Invictus is. I praise the director for the way he portrayed and honored Mandela I hope too see more movies like this in the near future.

13 December 2022,Very Educational,"A good sport related film that shows not only a team of Rugby players competing for a win in the world cup finals, but also a country fighting for a place where all citizens have equal rights. Mandela as the president plays a big role in this as he has a huge impact on the captain of the South African Rugby team. This country lived in chaos for a long time undermining the black peoples rights. A lot of people went through a great deal of pain and loss as the blacks continued to fight for their rights. This is a good movie to show our Cinema class as a lot of young students don't always know much on this topic.

12 January 2023,invictus,"Invictus is a great movie to watch, Nelson Mandela has been released from prison after twenty-seven years on February 11, 1990 and was voted as the South African president, wanting to unite his country. Morgan freeman is a great Mandela, it is a very inspiring movie the movie revolves around a rugby world cup. Mandela is trying to get the white and black people all happy in one place at the same time. Mandela gets a good relationship going with the captain of the team playing the role as a motivational coach. At the end of the movie when Mandela went to watch and support I didn't think that was a good idea because people could be focusing more on him then the game. But I do recommend watching this movie if you haven't already.

10 July 2010,Inspirational,"I thought this was a good movie. It is not on my number one favourites list or anything, but it was enjoyable to watch. I cannot comment on how close to the facts it was, as I'm not familiar with what happened (as I was only 5).

I will keep this review short, as I only have two things to say.

First, I thought while Morgan Freeman performed very well and is a phenomenal actor, I believe that the inspiration in his role was due to the great things Mandela had done and not how he portrayed Mandela. Regardless, it would not have been the same if an unknown had been casted instead.

Second, the rugby match was a very epic / inspirational battle and was very close as you would see in several classic sports films. But, I think that how the director portrayed the Bokke as being so horrible and even loyal fans having no hopes of making the quarter finals, and then they come from behind and win the world cup seemed unrealistic. It made the film that much more inspiring, but they made the team look too bad.",7

30 April 2011,"Soccer is a child's games, Rugby is war.","Rugby is in the soul, the heart and the mind. If you are lucky, it is held within your Family as The Greatest of Sports. If you expect Invictus to deliver some great Rugby you are watching the wrong film. Go watch Ireland's Grand Slam 2009 DVD's or the British & Irish Lions Tour from 2009. If you want a truly compelling, well directed movie with it's basis in Rugby then watch Invictus. Morgan Freeman is excellent as Madiba (let's face it Morgan Freeman does not do bad performances) and in fairness to Matt Damon he pulls off the role of François Pienaar rather well. François Pienaar himself was happy with the representation, so should everyone else. Damon is maturing into a very fine actor and Eastwood is (I believe) an exceptional director (watch Gran Torino and call me a liar). Invictus tugs at the heart strings and delivers a message about being colour blind, not only that it gives us all a brief view of what Nelson Mandela suffered though. If you ever wanted a feel good movie, then in a roundabout way, this is it.

6 December 2013,fantastic movie...,"this movies is amazing and rocked me inside.. the best ting about this movie is i never felt even a single sec of distraction.. from movie..

this is really amazing casting of movie.. though the story was real.. yet it has been beautifully cast....

dialogs and inspiration speeches in the movie worked as catalysis to make it wonderful..

this movies kept me watching whole movies without took me off the screen.. in starting of movie i though movie is based on Mandela life.. but it has beautifully covered not only Mandela life but also the how he made the self contribution to his country using the Rugby game..

The Morgan freeman acting was really touching and how beautifully he took over the role of Mandela in so powerful way .. is really worth to see..",10
4 March 2010,Disappointing...,"...why well simply because as a sports film it is terrible! I am both a rugby player and a South African. Not for one moment did I believe any of those guys had ever played rugby, the acting from the other 14 players was terrible even if they may have looked vaguely like who they were meant to be portraying they couldn't deliver a line much less tackle, kick and pass.

The only good thing was Morgan Freeman, he was as Nelson Mandela absolutely convincing and inspiring what a shame the rest of the film is toilet!

If you want a good sport film go watch something like ""Million Dollar Baby"", Clint got it all right then and mostly wrong now but if you are bored of watching paint dry then I suppose this might be an improvement!

It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.

I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

Viva Clint Eastwood, viva Morgan Freeman, viva Madiba.

PS. I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.

Of the films Eastwood has directed, my favorites, in no particular order, are ""Unforgiven"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Gran Torino"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"",""Bird"" and ""Invictus"". Yes, it's really that good. ""Invictus"" is another winner from Clint. He just seems to get better with age. What a creative roll he is currently on.

I thought that Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Matt Damon did an incredible job making the life of Mandela and 43 Million South Africas come alive. We could use more emphasis on the phrase ""our nation"" today as Americans but really for mankind around the world. Thank you.

21 June 2021,Great movie,"Loved the movie, the camera shots were amazing!! The establishing shots made it feel like you were there in the big field playing with them, the music went so good with the movie to. Morgan Freeman's acting was on point, he did a really good job acting as Mandela. I like how he still kept going when he was getting hatred from his own country but he kept going because he wanted to bring his people together which he did. The movie was amazing, the cameras shots, angles, and the music went so well with the movie. Matt Damon also did an amazing job, his accent was good and acting. Loved the movie and everything if I could I would rate it 100/10.

The accents are very incorrect and some lines and/or words make me cringe. I feel that they should have used more south african actors as our accents are rather hard to put on. Otherwise great film.

6 September 2010,Hmm,"My wife rented this yesterday and we watched together last night. Our 10 year-old son came into the living room to watch a time or two but the movie didn't hold his attention.

In principle it's a very compelling story (Mandela and the Springboks, writ small as it were). However I felt that the movie wore its morality too strongly and without pause or nuance. The moral dimensions of this story would have been better conveyed if done with more subtlety.

I normally really like Morgan Freeman however as I thought about how he was doing this role I realized that playing Nelson Mandela is very, very hard. Perhaps impossible. The real Nelson Mandela projects a quality that's almost beatific and actually not unlike, say, the Dali Lama. Few human beings possess that quality. A less well-known name that comes to mind is the American monk Thomas Merton.

The 'scare tactic' at the end where we're showed a possibly evil, white face followed by an ensuing 'tension' was abrupt; not organic; and felt like it had been tacked on. And this last remark, now that I've written it, feels tacked on to the preceding part of my review. Still, while I've given it some reflection, I'm not going to greatly belabor the writing of this review.",5
27 February 2010,Disappointing,"Going in I thought this was going to be terrific - great actors, great story, great director - what's not to like? As it turns out, plenty. Aside from a fine performance by Morgan Freeman, this movie is a stinker. Simplistic script, no real story, and of course we know in advance how it all turns out. Acting is very flat (except Freeman) and the rugby match scenes go on forever. I love rugby and played in college, but this stuff was awful. The on-pitch rugby action doesn't begin to capture what world cup rugby looks like or even a college game for that matter. I'm doubly disappointed because I love Clint Eastwood's direction generally. I still can't believe he made this film. Seemed very amateurish to me. If you must see this movie because you like Morgan Freeman, get it on DVD when it comes out.

13 December 2022,IT WAS GREAT,"Invictus: I found Invictus to be a great movie to show the kind of person that Mandela was as a person/president. He showed care and equality to all people white and black. He showed the soccer team teamwork, hard work, consistency, etc. He did well with his image and showing humankind the greatness of equality. I would recommend both Invictus and Mandela: a walk to freedom, personally I would watch a walk to freedom before Invictus since a walk to freedom shows more about Mandela before he became president and then Invictus shows when he becomes president and how he runs things and does what he's wanted of a president to do for years which is equality and acceptance of people who are different.

20 May 2010,"A fine though hardly great sports drama, the Blu-ray version of ""Invictus"" comes with some spectacular extras.","In the last decade or so, we've come to expect that everything director Clint Eastwood touches has a patina of Oscar gold. His movies have racked up so many Academy Award nominations, and wins, that each new film is greeted with the fanfare reserved for a masterpiece.

On that score, ""Invictus"" is a disappointment — a fine, though hardly great film.

Morgan Freeman plays Nelson Mandela, the South African activist who was called a terrorist, jailed and kept in isolation for 27 years, released and elected president of the country that oppressed him. Matt Damon plays Francois Pienaar, the captain of the nearly all-white Springboks national rugby team, who became Mandela's partner in an unlikely quest to unite their fractured nation through sports.

Screenwriter Anthony Peckham, working from a book by John Carlin, explores how Mandela used rugby for explicitly political purposes, reasoning that just getting blacks and whites to cheer for the same team would do more than a hundred speeches or marches.

Eastwood stumbles a bit in presenting so much on-screen action of a sport few Americans comprehend. The climactic game seems to go on and on.

It's still an inspiring sports movie, but could have been much more.

Extra features are rather spare for the DVD version, but improve to spectacular upon upgrading to Blu-ray.

The DVD has a musical trailer and a 7-minute featurette about Damon buffing up and training to portray a rugby player. That's it.

In addition, the Blu-ray has a 28-minute making-of documentary that's most notable for video footage of Freeman meeting with the real Mandela. There's also a picture-in-picture commentary track totaling about 100 minutes that includes insights from Eastwood, his cast and a host of crew and technical advisors.

Falling into don't-miss territory is ""The Eastwood Factor,"" a 22-minute featurette about Eastwood's career by film critic Richard Schickel (a shorter version of a feature-length documentary). It includes the revelation that more than 20,000 costumes from Eastwood's films are preserved on the Warner Bros. lot.

The Blu-ray also boasts a digital copy of the film.

19 March 2021,A great film but not perfect !,"""Invictus"" is a film made by Clint Eastwood in 2009 about South Africa during Apartheid. After his election as South Afrcia's president, Nelso Mandela must affirm his power and unite all people, in his country, torn by racism and the inequality. The film is historically very insteresting since the film uses rugby to show the unification of white and black people thanks to sports. The film is very good in its globality, with a very interesting subject , the most impressive things in this fim are all the slow-motion and the way of filming during rugby scenes. The final match is also very impressive. The music is very well used, Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon are very good in their roles. The only little technical problem I have to criticize is about the scrums' scenes which are pretty well realised but their are too many of them. In spite of the good scenario, at the end of the film people feel as if everything about their problems was solved at the end of the final match. While we know that the Apartheid hasn't ended like that. If we put aside the ""joyfull end"" I recommand this film which allows us to better understand the difficulties that South Africa went through.",8
19 March 2021,A playing movie,"Invictus is a movie about Apartheid in South Africa, shown through rugby. It was directed by Clint Eastwood in 2009.

This movie shows Mandela's coming to power and how, through rugby, he managed to unite all Africans. Thanks to his courage, and his determination, Mandela has been able to overcome many trials.

In our opinion, the movie should have been more focused on Apartheid than rugby. Even if the movie is really realistic and lively, a fondamental part has been forgotten and miss to the history : Mandela's life before coming to South Africa's power. But globaly, we can congratulate the choice of every actor and their good acting which allows us to live this inequality story.

It's an interesting film with some emotions due to smooth running of each scene. It's a movie accessible to children as well as adults, so it's important to watch it, to understand better this part of history .",8
19 March 2021,"Great movie, well directed !","Once again, Clint Eastwood strikes the audience with his new movie ""Invictus"" released in 2009. We get to see Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon's good acting. Morgan Freeman plays Nelson Mandela right after his election as president of South Africa, while Matt Damon interprets François Pienaar, the captain of the South African rugby team. Together, they help one another and encourage each other to try to unite the country. And to do so, they will use the rugby team. Unfortunately, the story of the movie is, we think, a bit too focused on rugby and doesn't deal enough with the apartheid. And it is not completely realistic because rugby isn't the only thing that helped ending the tensions. Moreover, we think it was a good movie, well adapted with the settings, the lights, and the music in each scene. The acting was really good. As European, Morgan Freeman's accent doesn't disturb us, but it might be the case for South African people. This movie is very moving especially a scene with Nelson Mandela and an inspiring poem. ""Invictus"" deserves a 8/10 grade, and we grately recommend it!!!

19 March 2021,"Rugby , Politics a good match...","This movie which is called ""Invictus"" and came out in 2009 talks about the mandate of Nelson Mandela who is played by Morgan Freeman and of the rugby world cup of 1995 that took place in South Africa. This film stars Matt Damon who plays the sprinbocks captain , Pienaar, and who is one of the principal actors . It takes place in the post apartheid South Africa and shows how rugby helped this country to reunite . In our opinion the film could have been more focused on the black people side of the story and on Mandela's political story and how he delt with everything. We think it could have been interesting to see what happenend after the final of this world cup to show us if black and white people really got over the apartheid . For us the only black rugby player of the springbocks (Chester) should have been more in the foreground of the film . it would have been interesting to see how he delt with the whole situation and how he felt with all the hate from the fans . Otherwise overall it was a good film which showed the moving side of the story put forward with the good acting of good actors. The songs add something extra which makes the film emotional. Therefore we give ""Invictus"" a 7/10. The only down side we really have is that there were too many white actors. We would recommend this film as it shows the historical background of South Africa. It allows us to know Mandela's story and who he was, what he did for South Africa and the political aspect of the 1995 World Cup. It also shows a difficult period in the country which was ended by rugby and it's interesting to see how a sport can reunite people. This film can be convenient and be enjoyed by rugby fans who also like historical facts.",7

When we saw this film at the end my firned and I had the same reaction : it is a good film because the director highlights the important moments of South Africa's history (Mandela, the rugby cup and apartheid). More over even if you don't like rugby, this film can make you love it, with Damon's performance and also the different scenes of rugby game ( angles of camera...). However rugby takes up too much place, even when Eastwood shows us scenes of Mandela's presidency the story is always centered around rugby's problems of South Africa and discussions. That gives us the feeling that the rugby is the solution of Mandela's problems and apartheid's problems but we know the end of apartheid cannot be solved with rugby. In reality, the end of apartheid took place with a referendum in 1991 and it stil has consequences today.

19 March 2021,Good film but ...,"""Invictus"" is a film directed by Clint Eastwood, released in 2009. Morgan Freeman is Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon is Francois Pienaar who are the main actors. Firstly, it's a film about the beginning of Mandela's presidency and we follow a part of his fight against apartheid. Along side we follow the training of the South African rugby team, Springboks, for the Rugby World Cup of 1995. Secondly that's a good movie thanks to the directoy and the actors. The acting of Freeman, Damon and the other actors are good indeed very good. The filming and the environment is done with a great realisation. Especially the metaphor with the rugby team is very nice because it shows the extreme violence of apartheid with a nice credibility. However the music is not as good as the scenes. we said just before the metaphor with rugby is good but it's a little bit too much, the fierceness is extreme in comparison to the reality of the sport but represents well the reality of apartheid and it gives a bad image about rugby. Finally I recommend the film, if you are into rugby and if you like sport in general. Also you have to know a bit about the history of apartheid to understand the film. So we give it a note of 7/10.",7
19 March 2021,Maybe less rugby would have been better,"Not being a rugby fan doesn't make it easy or really pleasant to watch it, however I still find Invictus rather good. Using the Rugby World Cup to solve the apartheid and consequently to unify white and black people was a good idea, Even if I'm not sure that things happened that way. It wasn't so easy to solve. The movie helps in the understanding of the conflic between black and white people in return, the end doesn't reflect reality that much because in real life the apartheid wasn't solved so easily. Freeman as Mandela was quite well-played unlike Francois Pinaar for who Matt Damon doesn't fit in. The music is appropriate but was too discreet.

19 March 2021,An inspirational movie...,"This year, Clint Eastwood has realized a new film, on South Africa's rugby team, Invictus. Eastwood has choosen Morgan Freeman as South Africa's president Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon as rugby captain team François Pienaar. The opening of the film starts with the arrival of Nelson Mandel at the country's head. At this time, there were many tensions between black people and white people. To alleviate tensions, Mandela will bet on the Springsboks, the national rugby team of South Africa. In spite of a good performance of Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, the film is too much focused on them, thought it should be more about South Africa's condition at this time, the 1990's. Personally, we think it is a good film, with a certain reality of the 1990's. The acting is really good and scenes are well directed. This story is fascinating. The way the movie is produced, with Mandela who gives good life's lessons, even without lots of scenes of action, Eastwood made a great film. So we recommend you this film ! This is the kind of movie that Oscars will like.

19 March 2021,A magnificent story but a start that was long,"To begin with, South Africa is deeply racially and economically divided. Nelson Mandela turns to rugby to unify the county and makes an ally : the team captain, Mr Pieenar.

On the one hand I found that the film takes too long to start. Maybe Invictus would have been better if some scenes had been shortened ? On the other hand, I understand the importance of the details ( Nelson Mandela's), but it weighs down the film as it is too centered on politics. This film deals with apartheid in a very discret way which can make it easier for the youngest to understand it. Howevern, I think it was too much simplified like in a perfect world.

Nevertheless, in my opinion, I found this film well told, with very touching details which bring a lot of emotions. I'm thinking in particular of this scene were Mr. Pieenar visited Nelson Mandela's cell. I recommend this film becauseit is important to be interrested in this kind of subject and that film sums it up well. Still a very good film directed by Clint Eastwood. Morever, I found that the actors, Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon played their roles very well as usual.",7
26 March 2021,An inspiring movie on sport and tolerance,"As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning, I can tell you you the entertaining, inspiring and enjoyable ""Invictus"" exceeded all my expectations.

It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.

I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

Viva Clint Eastwood, viva Morgan Freeman, viva Madiba.

PS. I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.

Of the films Eastwood has directed, my favorites, in no particular order, are ""Unforgiven"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Gran Torino"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"",""Bird"" and ""Invictus"". Yes, it's really that good. ""Invictus"" is another winner from Clint. He just seems to get better with age. What a creative roll he is currently on.

PPS. ""Invictus"" is one of the best sporting movies I have ever seen. But it's also about more than sport.",9
26 March 2021,An enjoyable tool to understand Apartheid,"""Invictus"", is a movie by Clint Eastwood that was released in 2009 starring Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon. This movie takes place right after Mandela's election in South Africa. It tells us the story of Nelson Mandela ( played by Morgan Freeman ) and his impact on racism in South Africa. We will also follow François Pienaar, the leader of the Springboks, South Africa's national rugby team during the rugby world championship in South Africa which took place in 1995. We thought that ""Invictus"" was a pretty good movie, first of all, Morgan Freeman is really convincing as Nelson Mandela and his acting skills are none the less. Even though it's a movie, the story was not too distorted which makes it quite reliable, it also shows us the reality of Apartheid and the importance of Nelson Mandela for the black population. Despite its good points, the movie is not flawless. One of our main complain is that the beginning is really focused on Mandela's political life while the end is more focused on the rugby championship and the importance of Mandela fade progressively away. Here's a list of what we didn't like : Rugby is showed as the solution against racism like it solved all of the problems and we found that there was a bit too much of it. Back to Rugby, except Matt Damon who played the captain of the Springboks, we didn't see the rest of the team as much as him, they're just the ""team"". The thing we disliked the most was that we didn't see as much of Nelson Mandela's political life and his diplomatic relationship as we would have liked to. Finally, we found that the end was a bit too romanticized and the musics were forgettable. To sum it up, the actors were great as well as the directing but the flaws we described are enough to not make it perfect. Despite all oh this, ""Invictus"" is a great movie, it can teach you a lot of thing and it's not straight reality, here's a little reminder, it's a Hollywood movie mode by white people without the real victims of Apartheid.",7
26 March 2021,"Politics, Sports and South Africa","Invictus is a good film with a good casting released in 2009. Clint Eastwood punches the world of cinema with this film which is about sport and a tragedy. The casting is incredible with Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman. Morever this actor won the oscar for best actor in 2010 for this film which also won ESPY award for the best sport movie in the same year. In 1994, the election of Nelson Mandela marks the end of Apartheid, but South Africa remains a deeply divided nation. This is why the president mixes sports and politics in order to bring together all the ethnicity group. However, sport is pushing aside the country's problems. Due to the film which does not show the real problems because it is centered on rugby. According to us, Invictus shows the different ethnic groups Mandela doesn't get a revenge against white people on the throw of movie. On the countrary, Mandela shows a lot of sharing despite a very difficult past which unfortunatly is overlooked. We notice a beautiful lack of trust between Mandela and his bodyguards who become his friends. A touching story of friendship. Finally, Freeman's accent is bad. We rate it 7/10, because, Invictus doesn't show the reality but is good. We recommend it because it's a ""Must-See"".",7
26 March 2021,"Too, much rugby...","The film Invictus talks about the Apartheid and how Mandela through his election, managed to change the society of South-Africa? The goal of the film is to show segregation in South-Africa and the impact of Mandela wants to show the power of the nation when everybody is united. Invictus was released in 2009 and produced by Clint Eastwood. The principal actors are Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman. Firstly, the construction of the film is boring and long. Besides, we could think that the topic of the film is mainly rugby whereas the main topic is racism and the Apartheid. Talking about rugby! If we don't know rugby's rulesz, you cant't understand the film and you're lost. Due to the fact that we hate rugby, we disliked the film. In addition, there are no emotions. Everything is exaggerated. Also the highlights of the film are very wishy-washy. However, Morgan Freeman incarnated Mandela perfectly. Matt Damon is aood actor. Chester Williams is amazing in his rôle. Music does by Kyle Eastwood, the son of C. Eastwood, represents well the topic of the film. The poem writen by Ernest Henley is well incorporated in the film in spite of it was too present.",7
26 March 2021,The power of a unifier,"""Invictus"" is a biopic of Mandela, released in 2009, who speaks about his life, apartheid and the gathering of a nation. Mandela tries to stop the apartheid with rugby. In the story, we follow the arrival of Mandela to power. Thanks to the world cup, he wants to reunify the black and white population. Moreover, we follow the evolution of the Springboks players who grow up as the film progresses. In my opinion, I think Clint Eastwood created a great film which nevertheless lacks of realism. In effect, this film didn't highlight the real relationship between black and white people. I would have liked a more historical story. As far as I'm concerned, I think Morgan Freeman has a great appropriation of Mandela's role. The more the film progresses, the more we feel his emotions. To continue, Matt Damon is also a good and beautiful actor. We are taken into the story, moreover in the rugby's matches which are very well recording. In spite of that, the film talks too much about the president Mandela and not enough about his personality. To finish, I recommmend ""Invictus"" for the entertainment, for the emotions it procured me. The film goes back over a part of the president Mandela's life and the beautiful nation's victory.",8
26 March 2021,good story but more excpetions,"The film ""Invictus"" was produced by Clint Eathwood in 2009. It talks about the president Nelson Mandela of the Republic of South-Africa in 1994. Furthermore, the film shows the life of the black population at this period as well as racism between black and white men. We can see how Mandela tries to unify his country, notably thanks to the rugby world cup. For us, this film is a good film with a beautiful story and provides many emotions. Particularly when the rugby team visits the prison and the cell where Mandela was imprisoned. It's a very strong moment in the representation because we hear the poem ""Invictus"" that mandela often read. Moreover it's too centered on rugby and is too far away from the true story because in the real life Mandela was not centered on rugby. Furthermore the main character is normally Nelson Mandela but there is another character, the leader of the rugby team and he is much more important. Then there is no suspense, we know already at the beginning how the film will finish. There is a happy end but even if the team has won, racism is Always present. To conclude, we recommend this film because it's a very beautiful film.",7
26 March 2021,GREAT HISTORICAL MOVIE ‼,"We have rather liked the movie Invictus, This film tells the beginning of Nelson Mandela's presidency and particularly his interest for the rugby team named ""Stringboks"". We think that the camera's angles and acting are pretty good, the movie is dynamic enough despite the historical aspect often boring in films but we recommend it if you love history. It denounces pretty well the pain of black people in South Africa. However we can't quite agree with different points: Mandela is too centered on rugby games throughat the movie. Well, in our opinion it's not the reality, it's sometime exagereted. As for as we are concerned, we give the mark of 6/10. Thank for reading this post.

29 November 2021,Unifying a country through sport?,"Heated fights, sports, politics, race and a divided country, what is not to like? If you like drama! Invictus is a movie about Nelson Mandela's (Morgan Freeman) time in office as newly elected president of the republic of South Africa. Through his growing love for sports lies a secret on how to unify the divided country. The job of hosting the world cup in rugby is an essential event in Nelson Mandela's carriers as president and his work on moving forwards as one nation. Mandela sees an opportunity in the rugby team Springboks. The springboks play badly and doesn't stand a chance in comparison to some of the other teams, but Mandela believes that they are the ones who's going to win the world cup. The springboks are a team that the white population of south Africa always has cheered for, with their leader Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon). Francois plays an important role in the unifying of the country. Nelson Mandela contacts Francois and asks him to believe in his team and train them to win the world cup. Throughout the movie the Springboks visit a group of children playing soccer. They play with them and teach them how to play rugby. This many examples on how during the movie the Springboks goes from inly being cheered on by the white population to being supported by the entire country, all rooting for them to win.

It is, in my opinion, a great movie. As I said earlier it has everything you could ask for, drama, sports and so on. Because the movie has a focus on rugby and not politics only, it is for everyone. Even if you don't like sports! Invictus is a movie with true intentions and great casting. It has stories within its own big story about winning the world cup. For example, the small story of the housekeeper in the house of Francois Pienaar's parents and how she slowly becomes a part of the family instead of just working for the family.

This movie is a great example of why biopic is such a good genre. Through the eyes of the main character, in this case Nelson Mandela, you understand his background, and present story, only now explained in a more entertaining way, with the liberties the movie director gets through this style of movie. I don't think I could've personally watch a documentary about a person and be as emotionally devoted to the movie as I was with this.

31 August 2023,It should be just about veteran's,"It was sad More veteran's should have been involved Very disappointed with the constant lies from Harry

It's disgusting how Harry is using veteran's for his gain

Harry has no talent and megen is even worse She has jo compassion so false He should be drop by invictus.

The invictus could be so great with out Harry's lies Absolutely disgusting saying he received no help He never had psd from Afghanistan He was bunker Harry Soldiers had to protect him plus fight on the front line.

7 November 2019,Unworthy of it's merits,"Frankly, this movie gets far too much credit. It's a movie about Nelson Mandela though, and Morgan Freeman plays him. So yeah, people are going to say they like it. Myself on the other hand, well, I turned it off halfway through. The story telling is muddled and confused, for the first hour all I could think was, what is this movie even about? What exactly is the plot here, and where is the character development? Is it about Nelson Mandela, one of the greatest peace makers of our time, or the rugby team he worked with?

The first 30 minutes are exposition, where nothing happens to any of the characters on screen. There's no moment of emotional impact on any characters in the cast for the first 40 minutes. The only information we receive for the first half is in the form of expositional dialog, characters saying, ""The Spring Bucks are a sign of racial inequality. You can't break bread with them. I don't like you because your people are mean. Yada yada."" But we as the audience only ever see the genuine inequality of the sport once, in the opening shot. And it's not the Spring Bucks being shown. We never see any direct discrimination from Caucasians at all, honestly. It's weird.

Aside from the rugby arc, we glimpse more deeply into Nelson Mandela himself. But these moments are short, and never focus on the subject at hand. The scenes don't link together properly, each one reiterating what we have already heard, or referring to something irrelevant. We spend more time on Mandela's body guards than could ever be necessary, when almost no time is spent on his work outside of his rugby centric social outreach.

Don't get me started on the sound track, my god it is appalling. There's this constant attempt to cause conflict where there doesn't need to be any. Body guards getting anxious about assassination, crowds booing Mandela out of arenas. But the music doesn't follow. The song at 1:07 is what forced my hand, I had to end it. It was then and there, that I slayed my own vessel to the abhorrent sounds of Colorblind, by Overtone. The ""inspirational song"" plays after Mandela gives a brief speech about change. Look this song up, try not to end your life, I dare you. It's not a terrible song, I don't like it, but it's cool if you do. However, to play this after a speech from NeLsON MAnDeLA, OOOOoo boy that really shirks my gherken. Ok that's it, I'm out.

Oh yeah, one thing though. It is cool that this is a movie set in South Africa, for that, I am glad it was made. Solely for that reason though, am I ok with its existence. For that, I give it 3 stars. But that's it, for all the talent that went into this movie, it honestly deserves a 1... To, you know, set that average straight. This movie is bad, do not watch it unless it's all you got, or you live in South Africa.",3
20 February 2010,Great rugby and history movie,"It takes Americans to make the best ever movie about the great game of rugby. The grunting, the heaving, the sheer passion. The acting was brilliant particularly in the body language between the black and white bodyguards but the acting was great. The games were well explained. The threat of Jonah Lumo well explained. The final was a nail-biter for my friend who knows nothing of rugby. The final game dragged a bit. There were technical issues in the rugby simulation particularly when the ball failed to go 10 m from one kick off. I think Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman deserve their nominations but the cast acted all the way down the list. The music was not as inspirational as say ""Cry Freedom"".

4 January 2011,Movie vs DVD,"I went to the cinema to see this film last year. I was very impressed.

I thought that Morgan Freeman played a very good Mandela and Matt Damon a very plausible Francois Pinnaer.

The direction was extremely good as would be expected from Clint Eastwood.

I was so impressed by the silver screen version, I wanted the DVD as soon as it came out.

I have just watched it for the first time and there is something missing. I am referring to a Clint Eastwood momentary cameo role.

Am I dreaming or what? Did I or didn't I see a shot of the crowd toward the end of the rugby match and in centre shot there was Clint Eastwood with his arms up cheering with the rest.

I have scanned the DVD footage and it ain't there, so I'm of the mind that it has been cut. It's a shame if it has, I think it should have been left in.

There are no deleted scenes in the extra material included on the disk so I have no way of finding out.

Comments welcomed",10
24 January 2010,Eastwoods Best Film to date,"Enlightening, heartwarming and puts rugby where it belongs on the world stage. I thought this film had merit just on historic value but it was extremely well made and gave an insight to the events of our recent past.. I thought all the actors carried their parts well. Damon even fooled us with his accent. Freeman was superbly cast and played his role flawlessly. To my mind an Oscar winning performance. As a rugby fan I have to say some of the acting ""on the field"" was a little unrealistic. Not only did it lack the intensity and skill of the players but the ""restarts"" were completely unrealistic and obviously played by actors and not rugby players. Having said that it was a clear and accurate account of the events that actually took place. Many of the ""quotes"" and events could be taken straight from Pinaars own autobiography written after the 1995 World Cup.

25 January 2011,Morgan Freeman,"Alright, SO is it just me, or was Morgan Freeman's performance in this movie, Invictus, far from Oscar Nomination worthy? I was genuinely excited to see this movie before its release, due to the political and revolutionary depth of the plot, mixed with an inspiration story about South Africa's Rugby Team. In addition to that, I have almost always loved Morgan Freeman as an actor in previous movies. However, after watching Invictus for the first time, I was a little bit discouraged by the quality of his acting. I have since watched it several more times, enough to come to the conclusion that Morgan Freeman, in some ways, ruined this movie. I feel this way for several reasons, but perhaps the most significant flaw of his performance was that his accent was not very good at all. I mean, granted it is somewhat of a hard accent to conquer I am sure, Freeman did not make for a believable Nelson Mandela. I could not help but notice that each and every line of his, seemed forced and a bit ""off"". He is a great actor, but I just do not know if accents are his thing. Morgan Freeman has one of the greatest voices in the world of acting, and is known for having such a pleasant demeanor about him. He should stick to roles that lack international accents. Nelson Mandela is such a significant and beloved hero in South Africa, I believe that someone who is attempting to act as Mandela should deliver a firm dialect, but Morgan Freeman's accent was inadequate for the role.",5
13 December 2009,Great story poor rugby representation,"Invictus was a great story. I read the book ""Playing the Enemy"" that the movie was based on and the movie wasn't nearly as good. But that's not a surprise. I recommend the book. I coach and play rugby in America and I think the rugby scenes were horrific. Clint should have used real athletes for the rugby scenes, not actors. None of the Samoen team even looked Polynesian. They all looked like wimps. The movie made it seem like dropkicks are a big part of the game. They in fact are very rare. I am glad that rugby is shown in the USA because it is so unknown here. Beyond the rugby footage, the movie was very well done. I am currently reading Mandela's autobiography and it gives great insights to his character and motivations. He is truly a great man and I was glad he was portrayed by such a great actor as Morgan Freeman.

21 February 2010,much more enjoyable if you know The story,"I saw yesterday this movie knowing some of the background of the movie, like who nelson Mandela is and what was the apartheid. also i some about Southafrica in the world cup of rugby in year 1995.

the good: the acting i found it very good, and the rugby parts very real. you can really find inspiration in the movie.

the bad: being a Clint Eastwood movie i expected much more. first of all, its almost mandatory to know some about the story. But even so, the movie lacks of something..., its like you are waiting for some to come, but i never does. sometimes it looks like a documentary, at the end of the movie you cant tell if it is a sport movie or a drama with some sport in it...i expected a little bit more.

Still, its worth seeing, not Eastwood's best but a good movie. don't go watch it with hopes up.",7
4 June 2010,Best green screen work ever!!,"The film was a moving story without falling into the common trap of being over-emotional. However, the most remarkable aspect was the seamless green screen work. Usually, I can spot a ""screened"" shot in milliseconds...not here. Not until the second viewing. And even then, it wasn't overtly noticeable, more a sense of contrasting shadowing.

Damon's work was subtle and powerful. But, after all these years, that's to be expected.

Freeman was perfection itself. No surprise there. My question is, has he ever given a less than stellar performance??

And Clint Eastwood, where to start? I was pleasantly surprised when I watched his directorial debut and have yet to be disappointed. He makes emotionally investing films and pulls powerful performances from all his actors. I can't wait to see what he does next.",8
4 July 2013,I adore Clint Eastwood,"I've always enjoyed his flair and candid use of human-centric cinematography. He always champions the human spirit. Unfortunately in this movie.........I must say there is a heavily political shaping of the truth which in fact far from it.

1. What they fail to mention is that Mandela who incidentally prior to his incarceration wrote the pamphlet, ""How To Be A Good Communist,"" has simply been put there to ensure there is no disruption to the running of South Africa by the Rothschild-Oppenheimer family and in particular their gold and diamond mining interests.

2. Indeed the current head of the Oppenheimer family, Harry Oppenheimer, owns 95% of the world's diamond mines. Isn't it surprising that the Jewish media fail to inform their readers why, if the blacks in South Africa are getting Africa for the Africans, all the gold and diamond mines, ie. the wealth of South Africa, is still controlled by Jews.

3. Communism was of course invented for the Rothschilds' by Moses Mordechai Levy, more commonly known by his Crypto-Jew name of Karl Marx, which makes it no surprise that the African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa was guided by two Communist Jews, Albie Sachs, and Yossel Mashel Slovo (Joe Slovo). Indeed, when Nelson Mandela's ANC took over South Africa, Slovo was named Minister of Housing.

4. Communism is designed to concentrate the wealth in the hands of the few Jews at the top (plus in this case, the odd token black man), whilst the population of the country they have usurped is left in poverty. It therefore should come as no surprise that none of the mineral wealth controlled by Rothschild front men, the Oppenheimer family, is returned to the black people and instead, South Africa, far from becoming free, experiences a dramatic decrease in living standards for the black population, and rapidly declines to the status of the world's most violent and crime-ridden country. AIDS infection soars to at least 25% of the black population and Mandela's successor, Thabo Mbeki, son of one of the terrorists jailed alongside Mandela, Govan Mbeki, after he succeeds Mandela as President, states that poverty, not HIV is the cause of AIDS.",8
26 October 2015,Appropriate timing for a great movie.,"Figured it was time I got around to watching this movie, considering how it is currently the Rugby World Cup (although the events that have just happened are slightly different to those in this movie ha ha.) This movie features some great performances by both Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman, they are definitely the highlight of the movie. I think this movie highlights an essential part of the Apartheid conflict, and the struggle to return to normality after freeing Mandela. I also really enjoyed the music in this movie, I felt it appropriately added to the tone where necessary. I felt that Clint Eastwood's direction wasn't anything to run home about, it helps to develop the story where necessary but mostly goes unnoticed. This movie may not be very accessible for those who don't understand rugby, but if you are willing to ignore that, I would consider this to be a enjoyable, uplifting movie, with some great performances.

4 August 2022,Inspiring,"I never get tired of watching this film. Mandela did an incredible job in regards to the true story I love how lifting the film is.

One of my family members plays for the springboks all these years later.

Matt Damon plays his part really well and Morgan Freeman is fantastic.

9 July 2015,Perfect!,"None other than this movie could have portrayed those events in a better way. It is indeed a wonderful movie. But, it is a lot more than a movie for me. It inspired me to learn more about South Africa and specially about Nelson Mandela. Planning to read the book on which this movie is based on.

As Nelson Mandela himself had said once that only Freeman could portray him. Freeman proved him right. Brilliant performance by him.

Though the actual events might not have been so dramatic but still I wish I could be part of that final match. It was filmed in a way that for last 3o minutes, I felt I was part of that crowd of 62 thousand.

This is the first time I am writing a review on IMDb and it is the movie which made me do so. Only one word can describe this movie in the best way, Perfect!",10
30 April 2018,"A Story of perseverance, and forgiveness.","As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning, I can tell you you the entertaining, inspiring and enjoyable ""Invictus"" exceeded all my expectations.

It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.

I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.

Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.

I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.

Viva Clint Eastwood, viva Morgan Freeman, viva Madiba.

PS. I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.

Of the films Eastwood has directed, my favorites, in no particular order, are ""Unforgiven"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Gran Torino"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"",""Bird"" and ""Invictus"". Yes, it's really that good. ""Invictus"" is another winner from Clint. He just seems to get better with age. What a creative roll he is currently on.

PPS. ""Invictus"" is one of the best sporting movies I have ever seen. But it's also about more than sport.",8
