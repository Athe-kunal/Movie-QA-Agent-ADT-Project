9 January 2005,A Wonderful Fable About A Dreamer Who Sees the World With Beautiful Eyes,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

8 August 2004,Lying as an Art Form,"What do you say about this movie?

I am at a total loss to describe it. The concept itself, a son tries to come to terms with his dying father that he knows nothing about but an enormous catalog of unbelievable stories, doesn't sound very promising. It sounds like a tired old formula, and I expected such when the rental started playing

It's not.

Werewolves, giants, witches, siamese twins, bank robbers, hidden cities, sirens, etc. are all present in the fantasy, but they seem unremarkably to be part of the life of an otherwise ordinary traveling salesman. Whether they really are or not is never made completely clear, but that's the rub.

I once read a review by Harlan Ellison in which the main point was how a well told lie illuminates the truth in far better clarity than a simple recitation of the facts ever can. At one point in the film, the questing son remarks to his bed-ridden father that he's heard all of his stories thousands of times, and he has know idea who his father really is. The father's reply is, `I've never been anybody but me from the day I was born. If you don't know who I am, that's your failing, not mine.' Later investigations make the point clearer. I'll bet Ellison loved this movie. It is an extraordinary lie.

Did I like the film? You bet. It's Tim Burton's best work without a doubt. Is it for everybody? Probably not. Many will find it confusing and pointless, but good fantasy is like that. All I can say is, relax and let it happen. You won't regret it.",
3 February 2004,Movie Magic,"Every other year you get a movie that oozes magic and charm. Think ""Chocolat"". Think ""Amelie"". Think ""What dreams may come"". Perhaps even, ""Being John Malkovich"". And this year, it's time to think big... ""Big Fish"", to be precise. All four of these movies have some things in common. Merely describing the premise is not nearly enough to do justice to the mood of the film. And the mood, the emotional reaction of the audience, is in many ways much more important than the actual content. Still, there's no way around it in a proper review: We meet a disillusioned young man and his father, a charming old guy who knows exactly how to tell stories to fascinate first-time listeners and children. Unfortunately, there's barely any of those left, as he retold his magical stories once too often. When his health and life are beginning to fade away, his son wants to finally learn the truth about his father. Meanwhile, we hear his life story, as he tells it... Tim Burton is probably best-known for visual eye candy movies. Few directors can compete with the imagination he's shown in movies like Batman, Nightmare before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow. Outside the realm of darker, more gothic visuals, Tim Burton has so far been somewhat less prolific. Planet of the Apes was an expensive embarrassment, and Ed Wood is a decidedly acquired taste. Big Fish, then, is a new direction for him. Yes, it is eye candy, or perhaps even eye H""agen Dazs. But this time, the movie has much more of a soul than his monkeyplanet. This soul is achieved by two means: a great story (or collection of stories) and great acting. If you don't believe that the story is great, watch the audience. At key moments, everyone was chuckling or laughing, at others, I heard dozens of sniffs and tissues being unpacked around me. Yes, this is heartwarming stuff that a colder, more cynical soul would call cheese. Finally, Burton has found a story worthy of his talents again. And, better yet, he did not forget to encourage his cast to act. For a case study of such failure, see Christina Ricci's completely flat performance in Sleepy Hollow. In Big Fish, the cast is so carefully selected that failure is simply not an option. Ewan McGregor (playing the father in his youth) may not have much more to do than smile, be charming and sustain a Southern US accent, but he does it brilliantly. Much more important are the performances of Albert Finney and Jessica Lange, playing the aged father and mother, respectively. And they both deliver character performances worthy of prizes.

After cheerleading so enthusiastically for this movie, perhaps it is time to take a step back and look at it from a more critical perspective. Yes, it managed to enchant the audience, but it did so the Hollywood way. Special effects and big budget feature heavily. This is in stark contrast to the seemingly much less organized and much more intuitional charm of Amelie. This movie is also much more comfy about its pace - it takes its time just like a good storyteller would, but perhaps leaving behind the five-second-attention-span MTV generation kids in the process. On the other hand, I am tempted to say that its biggest vice is that there just isn't enough of it. Given the episodal structure of this movie, I can almost imagine what it would have felt like as TV series, or multi-part TV movie. I am not sure whether to wish for this to happen or shudder at the thought of ""Big Fish: The Animated Series"" or some such atrocity. Every story told in this movie is perfect, and a series of such perfect stories would be wonderful. Yet can perfection be sustained for a large number of stories? Either way, I wonder what is going to become of Big Fish - a franchise or a single movie. It definitely is more deserving of praise, awards and viewers than any other movie released during the past six months, including LOTR-RotK.",
24 December 2003,How to create your own legacy...,"I often find that in order to be captivating, a film these days needs to be stressfully suspenseful or have a complicated story line. This film had neither, and yet I found myself hoping it wouldn't end while at the same time, anxiously awaiting its conclusion. I have to admit, I was distrustful of Burton as many of his more recent films have had less-than-satisfying conclusions. Nonetheless, I went to see Big Fish (3 days before its release in Canada) with no expectations and was astounded. This movie is an absolute treat for our hearts, ears and especially our eyes with each cartoon/fantasy-like scene painted with Tim Burton's reliable brilliance and magical touch. Ewan McGregor is pure sunshine and Albert Finney gives one of the greatest performances of the year- he *is* Big Fish. But I suppose that when you strip away the beauty, the doll-house sets and all the abracadabra of cinematography and modern day technology, all you have is a very simple story, and therein lies the heart of this film; that one can create their own legacy, ""the story of my life."" Not through either extreme of extraordinary adventure or unbelievable lies, but through the art of storytelling- and THAT is what this film is about. It is through our *stories* that we are immortal.

Go see this movie, bring the kids, bring your date, bring your parents! It is for everyone...everyone who appreciates a visually and emotionally beautiful irregular story about a regular person's life.

***** 5 stars!!",8
7 October 2017,"Not the Best Movie Ever, but My Favorite Nonetheless","Big Fish is nowhere near a perfect movie. Sometimes the dialogue is awkward, the pacing drags at times, and Steve Buscemi is, as always, a weirdo. There are bizarre and fantastical ideas that can take you out of the movie. For all its flaws, I can't give it more than an 8. That being said, this is my favorite movie of all time.

Big Fish strikes a chord with me. It examines the value of a life, our modern-day myths, and, ultimately, the nature of our humanity. I don't cry easily, and I'm not just saying that - I didn't cry at Schindler's List, or Titanic; but Big Fish makes me sob every time. The ultimate catharsis, where a man's identity, value, integrity, and family are all validated, and his life has been a life worth living.

Tim Burton was definitely the man for the job on this film, and if you like his other classics like Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, and Batman, you'll probably enjoy this one, too. What else can I say, this is my favorite movie.",8
18 February 2004,"Tim Burton's career equivalent of ""Forrest Gump"" is an ultimately rewarding adult fable with some beautiful cinematography and memorable ideas...","It was either ""Cheaper by the Dozen,"" ""The Haunted Mansion"" or this. I didn't exactly feel like watching my favorite comedian run around with a horde of little kids cracking bad poopy jokes behind them, and I didn't want to see Eddie Murphy do this either (it was bad enough in last year's ""Daddy Day Care""), so I chose to see the more adult-oriented of these three films, and I'm glad I did, because Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" is a marvelous film--full of wit and imagination and eerie vibes that sometimes don't fit into Burton's films the way he wants them to--but actually have a purpose here.

""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" is simply one of the best films of all time, and you can quote me on that. That was Burton's breakthrough--then came ""Batman,"" which was very good but slightly lacking in substance, and then came ""Edward Scissorhands""--one of my sister's favorite films, a beautiful love story and an eerie fable...but just missing a very small ingredient that kept it from becoming a great movie (perhaps the same with his film ""Ed Wood""--a very good film, but not exactly one of my all-time favorites).

I have my doubts as to whether anyone other than Tim Burton could have pulled off ""Big Fish."" Here's a movie I expected I would dislike and come away feeling a little bit empty--but that's only partially true. The movie doesn't quite exceed on the level it tries to, but as a film, it's one of the best motion pictures of the year.

It stars Albert Finney as Edward Bloom, an old man who loves to exaggerate tales of his past and pass these on to his friends and family. One night his son, William (Billy Crudup), tires of hearing the story about how he caught the town's largest fish in a lake using a gold ring--so he ignores his father for three whole years, until his mother (Jessica Lange) informs Will that his father is dying of cancer, and that he wishes to speak with his son one last time.

Drawn back to his old Alabama hometown with his new wife, Will finally learns the truth about these so-called ""exaggerated"" stories--and we, as the audience, get to see them in flashback mode. It begins with a young Edward (Ewan McGregor), a ""big fish"" who was just too small for his own town and had to move away to search for brighter prospects. On his journey he comes across an assortment of odd fellows, including a ""Gentle Giant,"" a failed poet living in a heavenly town named Spectre, and a strange circus ringleader who also happens to be a werewolf.

All of these stories that Edward Senior tells his family relate to their current positions, and to call the film simply beautiful would be what John Candy once said is ""the understatement of the year."" My particular favorite character was the poet living in Spectre, played by Steve Buscemi (a wonderful supporting actor), who I had no idea played any role in this film prior to viewing the opening credits and seeing ""with Steve Buscemi"" appear on screen.

Buscemi's poet has been working on a particular poem for twelve years whilst living in Spectre. ""Can I see it?"" asks Edward. It says, ""Roses are red, violets are blue, I love Spectre."" ""But it's only three lines long!"" says Edward. ""That's the reason you don't show your work to people,"" Buscemi says.

Danny DeVito also appears as the circus ringleader, and the most regretful scene in the film is that in which we see him naked from behind. I shudder at the thought. But, for what it's worth, DeVito's second re-teaming with Burton is magnificent--he's a supporting character, but the film certainly benefits from his performance.

Like all of Burton's films, ""Big Fish"" teeters on the edge of greatness, but it never quite crosses the line. This is a marvelous film, full of warmth, kind-hearted fables and beautiful cinematography, and it's one of the best films of the year. It's certainly a unique film experience unlike any you've ever had before. Unless, of course, you've seen ""Edward Scissorhands"" or ""Ed Wood."" Then some of it may look a bit familiar.

Still, I enjoyed it more than ""The Lord of the Rings."" And I could actually relate to this film.

Trivia note: ""Edward Scissorhands"" was a Tim Burton film. The main character of this film is named Edward. Sometimes when people pronounce his name with their thick Alabama accents it comes across as ""Ed Wood."" Mere coincidence or something more? We may never find out.

4.5/5 stars.",
1 July 2020,Make a story of your own,"The whole story of a man's life is something large, but this movie managed to be entertaining and comical telling a story by dividing it into many stages so well told it feels like it's a little fairy tale, so many aspects and many temporal lines in 2 hours that feels like just a single hour.

The story itself is touching and beautiful while the time placement (involving the wardrobe used and design of the places as well) totally transports the audience to those years, it's colorful and complements the ""adventure vibe""

This is undoubtedly a great movie to watch with the family, so every single member can appreciate each other stories and how they all got intertwined.

10 October 2013,"This movie reminds me story of me and my father, before he died on cancer","My father was a brilliant sculptor and a great visionary. When I was a kid, I never could explain what he was doing. I got it a month before his death when i was 26. This film filled my eyes with tears, because it reminded me him. he had a lot of ideas and brilliant and original ideas for improving the world, but for all his life he could not sell it to anyone, because those ideas filled his whole day. Literally. His whole apartment was filled with papers. Thank you for this movie. Thank you for the message. I would add a note that when we dream, we are escaping from the world of facts and truths. When my father said that if you think of anything in life, you have to write it down because what comes to your mind it never comes again it changed my life. Now I'm writing a book - a novel from environment of Mesopotamia and that just because my father was someone who believed in imagination and creative values.

27 January 2007,A wonderful tale about life's magic,"Subtle, delicate, touching and fascinating pledge for the life as fruit of dream. About the ambiguous taste of imagination and about existence like a spectacular trip. About desire and reality like warm bread.

The director of ""Big Fish"" is Tom Burton. It is only decent definition of a film -mixture between childhood and small miracles, about a special image of ordinaries gestures and about hope in eccentric aspects. The texture is same of grandmother's tales in Christamas Eve or Sunday morning. A brave hero, strange village, temptation and huge love, success and discoveries, miracles and public,secret sense of life and courage. So, in many cases, the reality is only boring passage and the dream, the childish game, the sound of angel's voice or the strange facts are heart of magnificent act of contemplation.

It is a moral story but, in same measure is source of a way to look the world. The life is not a punish or bag of routine. The faith is not only part of a relation with God but with yourself. The others are, in great measure, parts of funny miracle and ineffable expectation.

The Ewan Mc Gregor acting is brilliant. Nuances, accents, inflexion of words, smile or gestures are bricks of a magnificent character, touching, warm, credible. In some moments, the film is spectacular dialog between McGregor and Albert Finney interpretation.

In fact, ""Big Fish"" is a tale. A fairy tale about life's magic out of words or exterior facts.",10
14 December 2003,The director- as well as character- as illusionist: a Tim Burton treat,"Director Tim Burton is notorious for his inventive, unique brand(s) of images he puts into his films, and a style that seems to regenerate in each film he does (though not always successfully- Planet of the Apes proved that). Now there's Big Fish, a film loaded with visual spectacle, and it shows Burton working an adaptation to his own advantage for the first time in years. Here he tells a story about storytelling, using both make-up, sets, and CGI at his disposal, and it's about one man's own imagination and how he carried it on to others, whether they were delighted by the tall tales or not.

This man is Edward Bloom, played by both Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor, and they both deliver wonderful work here as the dying Bloom still telling stories of adventures and the young Bloom playing them out, respectively. As do Billy Crudup as Edward's son William, who's grown weary of his father telling the story of his birth (involving a catch of a big fish), among many others, and all he wants now at his deathbed is the truth. Jessica Lange is also dependable as Edward's wife Sandy, the love of each other's lives.

What's so alluring about the world Burton creates (based on the novel by Daniel Pierce, which I imagine must be loaded with vivid description) is that he simply builds on the world Edward created for his and his family's amusement. Stories like the visit to the town of Spectre, and that town's most known poet Norther Winslow (Steve Buscemi in one of the film's highlighted supporting roles); the years spent working for nothing in the circus for Amos (Danny DeVito, another note of interest) just to know more about Sandy, whom he sees frozen in time; his stint in the war, etc. All of the people and environments that are reveled are done so with many visual effects, but they're the kind that help build on Burton's vision instead of depleting it. Even if a scene may have dialog or acting that could be taken as over the top, the storytelling is on par with some of Burton's best work (i.e. Batman, Edward Scissorhands, and even the somewhat recent Sleepy Hollow).

The best thing that can be said about Big Fish, even to those who might not like it, is that the journeys and stories taken in the film, by real and 'elaborated' real characters, generate a film as a delight for all ages. That it also has comedy along with drama (grounded in a sense of humanity for both) is also a feat accomplished well by the actors. To me, this is one of the better films of the year. Grade- A",10
16 February 2004,Tim Burton's Surprise Heartwarmer,"I approach Tim Burton films with a certain trepidation. Will it be ""Edward Scissorhands"" or ""Batman II?"" With Burton you could get a quirky comedy, a dark thriller, or sweet morality tale. And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish.

""Big Fish"" combines Burton's unusual humor with a heart-wrenching story of a father-son deathbed reconciliation. Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom, one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUV-sized catfish plays the other. Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback. Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son, Will, estranged from his father for the past three years. Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer.

Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions: an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a house-sized giant; a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth; military service during the Korean War morphs into a behind-the-lines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud. Originally a true believer, Will now knows everything his father has told him was not just an exageration or even a tall tale but an outright lie. In his effort to understand the truth behind his father's stories he learns to love the man as well as the mythology. And Burton delivers a terrific punchline at the end of the film that left me both tickled and weeping, a truly weird emotional state.

Burton deals with mythic themes in ""Big Fish."" Besides the surface story of the generational tension between father and son he explores the metaphor of the big-fish-in-a-small-pond by examining the impact Ed Bloom has had on the lives he's touched in his workaday contacts with colleagues, customers (he's a traveling salesman), and people in the small towns across the South. Not exactly ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" he still manages to show how all of us -- even the little fish -- have profound effects on the people around us. And of course love -- unrequited and reciprocated -- control almost all of Ed's many adventures.

The acting is wonderful. You will actually believe two Brits and a Scot (Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, and McGregor) are natives of small town Alabama. Lange brings dignity and brio to the role of the long ""suffering"" wife -- and she still looks great(!)-- you believe she has had a long and loving life with Finney/McGregor. DeVito is a delight in the role of a circus ringmaster. But the scene-stealer is Bonham Carter in the dual role of Jenny and the crone witch.

I rated this movie ten stars and when you see it you'll do the same.",10
4 May 2020,The importance of Legacy. An uplifting tale for those who want to live life to the fullest.,"-- Maybe MILD, MILD SPOILERS -- for those who want to know what to expect from the movie but don't want to be spoiled of key aspects.

If you knew exactly when you were going to die, would you live life differently? The answer to this question is explored here in a fantastical and uplifting tale of a man who told his life story to his son which seemed too extraordinary to be true but yet was not entirely false. It almost seems unrecognisable the fact that Tim Burton directed this movie as, visually, it's the least macabre and extravagant of his, yet the deep heartfelt storytelling he always puts in them is not only still there but takes the center stage in this one.

It is impossible to provide a spoiler-free review of a movie that tries to blur the line between fantasy and fiction, but here's a review that attempts to capture the essence and feeling of the movie.

The use of metaphors, symbolism and fairy tale morals provide a unique and stylised point of view of the life of a man who always dreamt big. While, to his son, all his stories seemed like pipe dreams with no other purpose than to amuse him as he was younger; he however doesn't get as mad as anybody would have gotten in his same situation. He approaches him in what could be considered his death bed to ask him to tell the truth.

Throughout the movie we witness many incredible feats the father accomplished in every stage of his life, some of them good and others not so good. The story telling smartly wraps every life story with a coat of positive outlook paint at a dire or frightening situation while as the plot moves along it leaves the audience wondering if it was true and it if isn't we want to believe it is.

It reminds me of another drastically genre-different movie called The Pan's Labyrinth (2006), which takes place in the 1930s and in it a little girl finds a faun who tells her she is the lost princess of a fantastical kingdom and gives her three trials she must complete in order to be able to return to it. As you watch the movie progress you get the feeling that certain themes are conflicting with one another as you try to figure out if what the girl is actually witnessing is fiction or not. I won't spoil the ending but it ties up closely to what happens in this movie although it has been stated by the director (Guillermo Del Toro) the actual ending.

IN CONCLUSION, regardless of whether the ending is satisfying for everyone or not, the movie is blatantly self-aware of what it is and never tries to hide its inevitable conclusion. It's ending has a sense of finality and a deep message that sticks with you and especially makes you realise the importance of life, the people you meet and the family you have. It's uplifting, optimistic, positive and encouraging; an absolute must watch to those who want to live life to the fullest...

P.S.: The title of this movie might be the best title any movie has ever had. Absolutely heartwarming when you understand what it means.",9
7 July 2004,It doesn't get better than this...,"When I saw the French movie Amelie I sat in the movie theater with a smile on my face throughout the whole movie. The exact same thing happened while watching Big fish. It is simply one of the best movies I have ever seen. It made me feel good, it made me laugh, and it almost made me cry. What else is there to ask for?

The actors did an excellent job, and the dialogue and the story was told in a very good way! The characters are also well described, every character had a meaning in the movie, everyone from the friendly giant to the twins to the witch to the big fish!

The are a couple of movies that really makes me feel good, and Big fish easily enters that collection of feel-good-movies. (Amelie, The Cider House rules, Chocolat)

7 March 2006,There Are Lots of Big Fish in the Sea,"I had the advantage of having read the novel before the movie. The book works a little better. Others have talked about the specifics of the movie. I want to talk about the premise of the lie. My father was a liar (often in the most positive sense of the word). My sister and I grew up with so much misinformation, that we have spent the last 30 years after his death trying to rake through the BS. We often heard tales like the ones in the book (not quite as dramatic but creative nevertheless). It was mostly things he had done. That he had accomplished. Why we were so darned poor after all this always confused me. If someone had met all those people and had all those experiences, why hadn't he parlayed them into something incredible. Once we got through it, we realized he wasn't a liar. He was an entertainer. And what he did was to pump life into a world that often doesn't have life. And while we would groan at him and tell him to stop, we would listen as if everything he said was gospel. The Albert Finney character was the same way. To be metaphorically taken away by his fantasies was the greatest gift he could give. The only gift he had. And every one was a harmless, benevolent yarn that would live on after him. There are still times when one of my father's stories pops into my head and I have to regroup and rethink before I realized what a fabrication it was.",7
27 December 2003,Cohesive and a feast for the eyes,"I've had high hopes for this movie since I first heard about it some time ago. After all, most of the Tim Burton movies I've seen (barring Planet of the Apes) have been really wonderful. To say the least, Big Fish did not disappoint me. The story - by no means complex or suspenseful - was simple enough to allow the viewer to really take in the fantasy and mythology in Edward Bloom's tales. One didn't need a surprise ending or secret identities to make this film enjoyable. Rather, it was the simplicity and universal nature of the story that made it interesting. While some reviews have mentioned that the film can seem choppy at times, I didn't see this at all. The transition seemed smooth and logical, and while sometimes I found myself wishing for more scenes of younger Edward Bloom, I never felt bored by any of the movie. Nothing seemed to 'drag'. I was also quite impressed with the quality of acting in nearly the entire cast. Billy Crudup didn't really hit his stride until the end, but he was tolerable through the first three-quarters of the movie. Albert Finney did a great job of portraying a lion on his last legs, bigger than his body but unable to show it. Jessica Lange was amazing and added the emotional oomph that Billy Crudup often failed to provide. And while Ewan McGregor's role was not particularly difficult, at no point did he overplay the character, and his accent (to my ear anyway) never slipped. Though this wasn't as dark as Sleepy Hollow or as bizarre as Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice, Big Fish definitely had the Tim Burton touch in its scenery. The colors - whether dull for Elder Bloom's time or bright for Younger Bloom - matched the mood perfectly, and everywhere you looked (especially in Bloom the Younger's timeframe) there was something else to marvel at. Tim Burton fans will not be disappointed.",
8 February 2004,"Very sweet, imaginative story despite lacking a strong conclusion","Will Bloom feels like he doesn't really know his father - his habit of telling exaggerated and untrue stories instead of the truth. They don't speak for several years until Will hears that Ed is on his deathbed and returns home. He hopes to find out the truth behind the stories but can only get more of the same without doing some digging.

Even having watched the trailer I was unsure exactly what this film was about, but I trusted that Burton's imagination would carry it. Having seen it, the film can best be described as being about story telling in that the film is more about the wonder of the stories told than the actual narrative in terms of start/middle/end. In terms of the traditional idea of narrative, the film is not perfect - it is not as meaningful or as satisfying as I would have hoped, and this is shown in an ending that, although sweet, is not as neat as I would have hoped. However the telling - that's where it is at.

The stories told are wonderfully whimsical and amusing, like the film states the stories have elements of truth but also be coloured by Bloom to add life to them. For me, it was very simple to get involved in the tall tales and I was held in the spell of Ed's stories easily - even thought it never came to a `real' solution I was still captivated by just how sweet and imaginative it all was. If it sounds like I'm having trouble putting my words together it is because I found the film quite hard to quantify - all I know is that I found the whole experience to be very sweet and enjoyable despite it not really amounting to much in the grand scheme of things. In this regard the film is a consistently imaginative fantasy film that is gently humorous and outright funny at times.

The cast are pretty good. I was originally a little put off by McGregor's Alabama accent and it took me a minute to get past it, but other that his performance was very good and he helped create the film's mood of wonder and whimsy. I think both McGregor and Finney needed to have that sort of accent - I don't know why but it is a storyteller's accent and it does help the material. Finney is good and manages to keep the spirit of McGregor's character going despite not being surrounded by the images to support him. The support cast works well whether they be tall giants or well-known cameos from Buscemi, Carter and Devito. Lange, Crudup and Cotillard are all good but it is easily McGregor and Finney's film.

Overall some will find the lack of structure and real substance to be a problem - after all, this is a film about tall tales and not everyone will be able to enjoy that. However this is a wonderfully light and fun bit of whimsy that is a lot better than I expected it to be. While it may not amount to a great deal more than that, it can still be enjoyed for what it is - a great fun story!",
17 April 2010,"Sweet, imaginative and moving","I will admit I like Tim Burton, and have enjoyed a vast majority of his films, Edward Scissorhands, Beetle Juice, Batman and Ed Wood. Big Fish is I think one of Burton's better movies in my personal opinion, maybe not his very best, but it is a very sweet, imaginative and moving film. Here Burton delves into familiar territory, a strange place between reality and fantasy, dream and nightmare. The story is really sweet, and while slow at times, does have a poignant ending. The visuals as pretty much always in a Tim Burton film are gorgeous, not Gothic here like in Sleepy Hollow and Edward Scissorhands but evergreen and picturesque. The scenery was beautiful and so was the cinematography, and Danny Elfman's score is stunning. His score for Edward Scissorhands blew me away, but the lyrical, sensitive and hypnotic themes used here make it a score that is truly special. The screenplay is well crafted, and has a bittersweet feel to it. Sentimental yes, but also bittersweet. The acting is remarkably good, with Ewan McGregor making for a handsome yet somewhat charming young Edward Bloom, and the wonderful Albert Finney a revelation as his older self. Billy Crudup is excellent as the son who is intent on exposing his father, and sets out to learn the truth, and Danny DeVito is great as the shape-changing circus ringmaster. Jessica Lange is beautiful and alluring as Sandra and Helena Bonham Carter is almost unrecognisable as the Witch. Then there is Alison Lohman, Marion Cottilard, Robert Guillaume and Matthew McGory(as Karl the Giant) and they are very good as well. Overall, I loved this film, it is moving and very imaginative. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",9
14 February 2006,Burton's most touching movie,"After the quite disappointing Planet of the Apes remake, Tim Burton returned to form with Big Fish, a strongly underrated gem which is one of the best pictures of 2003, along with The Return of the King, Lost in Translation and Mystic River. It's the most heartbreaking, poetic and romantic movie he's made since Edward Scissorhands, and it's a shame it didn't get the recognition it deserved.

At the movie's center is the relationship between the dying Edward Bloom (Albert Finney, excellent) and his son Will (Billy Crudup) who wants to find out the truth about his dad: for several years, Edward has told some amazing stories concerning his life, and Will is the only one who has stopped believing them. Now, he wants to know what really happened.

That's when the film properly kicks off, as we're shown young Edward's (Ewan Mcgregor, absolutely comfortable in the role) life exactly as he has described it, alternating facts and, for most of the story, fiction. Expect giants, witches, werewolves, a hidden town (appropriately called Spectre), a Fellini-inspired circus, fish which look like naked women and lots more. This is Burton as we like him: bizarre, unpredictable, hard to summarize. You have to see the movie to truly understand why people love it.

Still, behind the adventurous and romantic facades lies great human tragedy. Big Fish will make you laugh, but by the time the end credits start rolling you will most probably have tears in your face. Life can be funny for a second, and very sad right after wards. Never has a Burton film been so dramatic.

As I said, this is a wonderful film, yet sadly it was heavily overlooked (it received only one Oscar nom, for Danny Elfman's gripping score). Watching it is a marvelous experience.

One scene is worth the entire viewing: Edward sees his future wife for the first time. According to some people, time stops in that moment. Burton makes it happen on screen. That one sequence is pure movie magic.",10
19 January 2005,One of the best films in the last 25 years,"Big Fish...

What made me watch this film in the first place was solely based on the fact that Pearl Jam got nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song. That's what got me to the theatre the first time. What made me goto the theatre two more times after and purchase the DVD the second it became available was the greatness of the movie. It's not often that a love story so deep comes along. This movie encompasses two types of love, between a father and son, and a husband and wife. But it's not a sappy romance. How Tim Burton did this, proves how genius he is. Though the movie itself seems so far-fetched, it could not be more real. If you've already seen this movie, and like it, you'll know what i mean. For those who don't know whether or not to watch it brings me to the next point. Someone who doesn't even like the story to this movie, could still love it. It's one of the few movies I can tell people has some of the greatest imagery. Sure, movies these days have cool effects and stuff, but with Big Fish, you will be captivated by the use of colour and parallelism. From the town of Spectre, to the cool carnival, everything is so magical. Now onto two very important things that give this movie the 100% rating i gave it, and why it was nominated for Best Picture at the Golden Globes, Acting and Sound. Surely, everyone knows Ewan McGregor. But it's his supporting cast that make this film amazing. The chemistry between Billy Crudup (William) and Albert Finney (older Edward Bloom) is amazing. Though they have few scenes together, the ones that they do have together are very touching, and again extremely realistic. Jessica Lange (older Sandra Templeton) and up and comer Alison Lohman (Sandra Templeton) suit their respective parts perfect, and they both compliment each other by their characters. They we have the always funny Steve Buscemi (no one could have played his part better) and Danny DeVito who is also incredible in this movie. Helena Bonham Carter also provides a very unique role in this movie... her mystique and subtle beauty suited this movie perfect. Then came sound. A great original score, a fantastic soundtrack and an amazing, and I'll say it again AMAZING original song by Pearl Jam made this whole movie come together in perfection. Elvis Presly, Buddy Holly, and the Allman Brother to name a few of the old school music in this movie are an excellent choice to showcase what time periods we look at in this movie. All in all, Tim Burton, Danny Elfman, and the casts best pictures in my opinion.

Just a side note: Billy Crudup hasn't appeared in many films, but to mention two of his other movies (Almost Famous and Sleepers) seems appropriate. He's casted in some great movies if ya ask me. :)

24 January 2006,"Burton Makes A Nice, Light Film","This ""fish tale"" is generally a nice story about a father who tells tall tales for years to everyone and has a son who has resented those stories, thinking his father was nothing but hot air.

The big pluses for this film were the colorful scenes and the fact that is was simply a nice story. Since this is a Tim Burton film, it's no surprise that the visuals are so entertaining but it is a surprise that the story isn't a dark one. I guess that disappointed a lot of his fans but thought it was a Irefreshing change of pace from him, and I appreciated his effort here. It's the kind of movie many folks wish they made more of today.

The fun parts of the film are not the beginning or ending but the middle in which the dad's stories are brought to life. There are some strange and fun characters. The story is a bit too much New Age/reincarnation mumbo-jumbo but the whole thing is so bizarre that you can't take anything seriously....except the father-and-son relationship, of course, which is meaningful. That may be a bit heavy but almost all the film is a lighthearted fantasy.",8

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works.

19 October 2005,Boy Who Cried Wolf!! (Werewolf!!),"""A BIG FISH in a small pond!!!"" the phrase applies to a typical local yokel who better not leave his sequestered Podunk town or else he is in for a rude awakening!!.. Venturesome as though he may be, Ed Bloom leaves his Mayberry, joins the circus, and decides to fall in love...True love comes along less than once in a lifetime...The intuition for true love in this movie is succinctly illustrated through a dark angled idealism, and suddenly, problems with falling in love are romanticized by a myriad of quirky determination patterns, as well as utterly human shortcomings!!. Married, having a son, a house, etc, etc, etc and so on and so on and so on and so forth and so forth and so forth, pans out to whereby his emeritus years become those of expounding dissertation about his exciting dare devil nefarious life as an impervious adolescent.. Spinning Yarns? We know better!!...Try telling his son that...Too incredible!! Too spectacular!! Too heroic!!...Ed Bloom's blindly motivational love and devotion towards the woman he cherishes, makes Romeo and Juliet's relationship seem platonic... Crazy dreams, the supernatural, and negligence of compassion via the compelling illustration of the cold cruel world, make Big Fish a reality as far as being a five star film!!

In the end, Big Fish shows how the aspect of positive human nature prevails, and how a person's life is intricate and meaningful!! The impact your father has on you is indelible, and recognition of unconditional love for your family, and the people around you, manifest themselves in many distinguishable ways, all of them being indispensable!! Ed Bloom is the picture-book example of how exaggerations and erroneous behavior in your life are an integral part of your existence!! You have realized you are fortunate to be human because you are not perfect, the adjective perfect is for calculators, Hallmark Cards, and martinis after work...Ed Bloom had an anything but John Doe in an orange crate funeral.. A numerous cross section of socially diverse individuals had a grass roots recognition of who Ed Bloom was, in that sense, Ed Bloom died a very rich man!! Big Fish was a melting pot of proclivities and acute misconceptualizations that established a colorful obituary as being the ultimate trophy we can be the recipients of for our agenda here on earth!! More significantly, the aggregate affection, as well as the life experiences all of the characters in the movie have had, and would not trade for a million dollars, is something that this film brilliantly portrays, by way of a hail Mary pass that winds up being the game winning touchdown!!.. It was this convoluted philosophical disposition that ""Big Fish"" so perfectly executed that puts this film in the category as one of the best films ever produced. Expediting faulted emotions is a sink or swim endeavor, and, in this case ""Big Fish"" swam, (No pun intended) Metaphorically, all of these accolades are a way of saying that the ending to this film was very powerful and cohesive...surprisingly and effectively so!! I give Big Fish a five star rating, and a perfect 10!! This website ranks it as one of the top 250 films ever made!! I totally concur!!",10

5 March 2017,"Tim Burton's ""Forrest Gump""--And Every Bit As Endearing","I've now seen ""Big Fish"" twice in my lifetime. At the end of both viewings, it elicited tears of emotion like only a select few films can. While Robert Zemeckis set the template for the ""one man's incredible life experiences"" genre, Tim Burton matches him blow for emotional blow here.

For a very basic overview ""Big Fish"" sees Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) called to the bedside of his ailing father Edward (Albert Finney). Both parties are estranged from each other, what with the more reserved son resenting the seemingly tall tales and often overbearing nature of the gregarious father. With Will looking for a morsel of truth and Ed wanting one final opportunity to spin his tales, the film largely turns back to the clock to Ed's younger days (played by Ewan McGregor), in which truth is inextricable from fiction--in the best possible ways.

This being a Tim Burton movie, trying to explain it in words is a bit of a futile effort. In many ways, it might be the epitome of a ""Burton joint""--it is rife with his flare for cinematography craziness, it contains many of his usual actors (like Danny Devito & Helena Bonham Carter), and the themes/plots present are extraordinarily outlandish (some might say ridiculous).

But unlike some of Burton's other works, ""Big Fish"" doesn't lose sight of the forest for the trees. In other words, it manages to tell a coherent story full of expertly crafted characters. As previously mentioned, it is also one of the most emotional movies one could ever watch (especially as it relates to father/son dynamics). As long as you can get past some of the wackier antics, ""Big Fish"" will move your very soul.

Overall, ""Big Fish"" is a movie that must be seen in order to fully be understood. It melds the best of Burton's unique cinematic visions/tropes with a legendary-in-quality screenplay from John August (based on a novel by Daniel Wallace). The combination of storytelling, emotion, characters, cinematography, and even humor is almost unmatched. If you enjoyed ""Forrest Gump"", this will almost surely be another favorite.",10

12 August 2022,Fisherman's story,"When watching the movie I thought this movie was a copy of the legendary Forrest Gump with the added bonus of being more fanciful. However, that's not what the film is intended for, Gump just narrates his real stories and nobody believes it, Edward, on the other hand, adds a touch of fantasy and children's stories to his deeds, that's the difference between the two, one just wants to tell the facts of his life the other tries to re-signify or enhance the facts of his life, or at least transform simple things of our daily life into adventures never seen before.

9 December 2005,Unimpressed,"Many people have said how great they found this film, personally it didn't really do it for me.

I thought it was quite sickly actually. Plus points for the special effects; Tim Burton rarely disappoints in that area, but what got me was the obvious way it tried to toy with the viewers emotions, it tried too hard to upset me, and at the end I didn't care, I knew it was manipulating the viewer and I didn't fall for it's narrative tricks. But this isn't about how clever I am, rather, how superficial I found the acting and the writing to be. There were too many clichéd characters, and I suppose that is partly the point of tall tales, but I found it boring.

It's definitely not for everyone, it left me cold and wet. Rather like a big fish.

20 May 2007,Truth is Stranger than Fiction,"Who doesn't like a good story? Big Fish took the traditional grandpa story and turned it into a very colorful and entertaining picture. That is not easy to do. What looked like it was going to be a juvenile and childish movie with adult overtones actually proved to be very grown up. I was totally wrapped up in this story just like a kid hearing his favorite bedtime story.

If someone were to catch this movie in the middle or just see clips of the trailers, then the movie would look like an LSD trip on film. But it really was a very sensible and touching movie which needed every bit of the exaggerated and iconic symbols used. The colorful story was equally matched by the colorful scenes. Big Fish was a big success.

19 June 2007,Like Tim Burton...,"Have you seen when something's magical? But I'm not talking of the magic magicians do, I mean when something is so incredible that it completes you inside; therefore it's magical. I'm talking about the unavoidable feeling when watching ""Finding Neverland"" and about the obliged feeling when watching any Tim Burton movie. All of the magical things we live in life, one way or another, Burton has expressed them in images throughout his career...In movies.

That I have seen a big part of Burton's films and that until today I have only written about ""Charlie and the chocolate factory"" is beyond me; but I'll try to make it up talking a little bit about his, undoubtedly, best film. By far the most underrated movie of 2003, ""Big Fish"" is a journey of the imagination to its greatest extreme; the vision of life in the eyes of a man who couldn't seem more ordinary.

This man is Edward Bloom, and I would like to see life the way he does: ill and about to die, and telling his son Will (Billy Crudup) the true story of his existence, in an attempt to reconcile their differences. The thing is that Will ha always questioned his father's 'distortion' of the truth he has had to deal with all his life; and maybe this last story of Edward has the same little amount of truth as the others...Or maybe it is the whole truth.

""I tell stories"", the father simply declares to his son. It's a fact that everyone who likes listening to stories (and even the ones who don't) likes people to tell them with a little bit of seasoning; as you'll see Edward does. And that's also Tim Burton's main characteristic as a director; to give something extra to all of his films, which becomes a completely personal touch.

So it is like if Daniel Wallace had written his novel knowing that John August would adapt it creating a marvelous script that Tim Burton would later turn into this excellent film. With the images of Phillipe Rousselot's photography, the filmmaker lets his imagination loose, letting us see that he has pretty much in common with the main character of the story.

The movie is, of course, coherent as a whole; but it's nice to say that it is a collection of beautiful scenes that don't cease to amaze us for a minute. One scene is particularly spectacular, for any cinema lover as for a lover of love itself. Edward is narrating the day he met his wife. ""The say that when you meet the love of your life, time stops"". Burton literally freezes the whole image, allowing the movement of the main character only, who takes some 'frozen' popcorn in the air out of the way, to get to the woman he's looking for. Instantly, everything's moving again and the scene reaches its end in a funny way you must appreciate.

That scene is pure cinematographic art, the magic I'm talking about: flawless. Actually there are not many flaws in ""Big Fish"", with Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney portraying the young and old Edward, respectively; both in a way so moving that it's difficult to differentiate them. Starting from Billy Crudup, the rest of the cast is perfect: inspired Danny DeVito, big presence from Matthew McGrory and Steve Buscemi playing a role that couldn't have been for another person.

Burton knows which actors to choose, and which actresses. Jessica Lange shines unstoppably in her role of the faithful and loyal wife; Alison Lohnman (a promising young actress) gives interest to a part that doesn't seem to have it, and the always mystical Helena Bonham Carter doesn't do more than stealing the show. Danny Elfman's score also steals the show but it's really one more character, as in any Burton film (if you haven't seen ""Edward Scissorhands"", give yourself a chance: it's a great movie, but the music...).

In conclusion, ""Big Fish"" is no more than the piece where all the things Burton has worked on come together. That fantastic atmosphere of each film is present in this film with a lot more characters: here we find, at least bits, of a Jack, an Ed Wood, a headless horseman and even the other Edward; scissorhands. Coming to think of it, I would like to see life not so much like Edward Bloom, but maybe like Tim Burton.",10
6 January 2004,Pure Cornball! Fried Green Tomatoes meets Forrest Gump,"A movie in which the current story is merely the flimsiest excuse for the backstory. From the moment the narration started, I was never involved in this storyline. My friends and I were not on board for another southern tall-tale. Is there any other kind of movie that Hollywood allows southern characters to appear in? For a hanky movie to work you do have to care about the characters. The second time Albert Finney asks for water you'll guess what's coming.

Tim Burton is getting much attention for his newfound maturity. What that means is that whatever the merits of his quirky, poorly-scripted previous movies, he's now signed on to one of the two acceptable messages for Hollywood dramas to have: 1) You gotta have heart. 2) Believe in the magic. Both of which are pure cornball. In this case it's #2. Ready-made themes excuse viewers from developing or even thinking much.

If you're an adult with the mind of an eight-year-old you're in for a treat. If you're a week away from your own death, this could be the ideal movie for you. Otherwise, prepare to roll your eyes and hold your nose. Just bring whatever sentimental feelings you've developed at the Hallmark store and install them wholesale into this story.

Is it any wonder that this is the last movie Spalding Grey watched before killing himself?",2
13 December 2011,Destiny in the witch's eye,"With Burton, it has always been a propensity for telling stories that drives his films. He surrounds this with a kind of wondrous imagination derived in a slick manner from old horror movies, a commercial imagination if you ask me, but which often dazzles attention away from the real design of the thing, which is a story at the center. He is the most successful when he can align these, visual outer layers and storytelling mechanisms, when he can devise ways to point at some kind of maker folding the elaborate origamis that we experience decorating the surface.

So, Beetlejuice, with the nightmare world nested in the attic; Ed Wood even better, a subtler kind of magic, with the visionary maker marshaling movie characters into a fiction that does not matter how cheap as long as it creates real bonds that enrich lives, the real magic hiding in the shared passion for adventure. And this, perhaps the most direct of all.

So again at the center we have a storyteller weaving fanciful episodes involving kind giants, dark woods, the circus, a wartime adventure. It is all shaped around a singleminded devotion to discover and hold onto the love of a lifetime, love as destiny, this is the precious knowledge he is trying to impart from his deathbed. Of course we are seeing the whole through the eyes of the son, a journalist, a cold pragmatist, himself a storyteller from facts, at first outright disbelieving but gradually coming to unfold the wondrous origamis for some truth of their maker in the pattern.

The son himself is coming into a life that is mirrored from the one narrated from, newly married, awaiting his first child.

The idea is that there is truth at the heart of fiction, always has. We fold the real world into a more elaborate version of the mind, the truth being this; the hard facts alone would not do, it is the adventure of discovering for ourselves that has the power to impart some essence or wisdom. It needs to be our journey in these shoes. From our end, we have to learn to not merely think, but to embody, to situate the world at the heart.

It is an essay on how to engage fiction, the film itself, in order to be enriched with a love that is true, the essay nested as our effort to apprehend the tall tales. We make the discovery with the son.

Eventually it was all true, or so it goes in the film, this is a major blunder on Burton's part trying to directly address our inner child, when the point is to cultivate an openness of seeing that would allow us to abstract what matters. So the giant was as we imagined him to be, the circus owner, the twin singers except no longer conjoined. Seeing truly, this part collapses. No doubt, he trusted us to have invested enough emotion by then to not pay any mind.

Overall it is not a bad film to absorb, even if the way Burton has made it we'd rather spend time inside the fantasy; real life is bleak, but also badly integrated with the other segments, each segment badly integrated with the rest. As a result, it feels longer than it is. It feels syncopated, always starting again from where we'd left it.

Still, if you feel you have sufficiently absorbed this, made your own, freely traveled back and forth, got to know that the person is not telling the stories but the other way round, you are ready for bigger, more challenging adventures at the hands of more eloquent makers, more talented folders of visual origamis; start with the great Raoul Ruiz who recently passed away, and move backwards to Wojiech Has where the blueprint of fiction is metaphysical, Welles as an inspiration for both.",
8 January 2008,Burton crafts another masterpiece.,"An utterly fantastic journey from start to finish. Every second of it brings a complete smile to my face. There is a quote from the film that is something like ""Sometimes things can be so strange, yet seem so familiar."" That directly applies to this entire film. It is filled with events that are so strange and magically bizarre, but everything feels so close to home. It was just two hours of what I felt was the best day of my entire life. Of course, coming from Tim Burton, the visuals and cinematography are absolutely breathtaking. All of the surreal happenings are just breathtakingly beautiful. The set designs are possibly the best I've ever seen. The performances are all phenomenal, as expected from such a superb cast. Helena Bonham Carter is absolutely exceptional, and Albert Finney makes me feel some of the most strong sympathy I've ever felt. Billy Crudup does the same. Alison Lohman is just gorgeous. Her beauty radiates across the screen and makes it very easy to believe why Edward Bloom would fall so madly in love with her. Ewan is as charismatic as ever, creating one of the most likable characters I've ever seen. It's a fascinating film full of greatness from a standard suburbia to a Utopian commune to a roaring circus and all the way across seas to the war.",10
18 May 2005,Truly terrible movie.,"""Big Fish"" has for reasons beyond me been hailed as a modern classic by many a viewer. The story is about an insane, self-centered chronic, liar (played by Albert Finney), who tells the story of his life to his neglected son (Billy Crudup). Of course the father lies about his life and comes up with a lot of stupid tales about himself as young (Ewan McGregor).

What I don't get about this movie is how people can like a person as reprehensible as Ed Bloom. Not only is he an arrogant S.O.B. who can't talk about anything but himself, he was also a bad father and probably also a bad husband, which is somewhat implied by Jessica Lange's restrained and depressing performance. Also, Ed Bloom seems to get sad every time someone tells him that he's not funny and tries to make him act sane for at least one time in his life. Wait scratch that, first he's sad and then he tells another story. I found it impossible not to hate him. Which is strange because everyone in the movie loves him, and I have no idea why. The only scene I really enjoyed was when he got beaten up.

Some things aren't awful though. The sets and Alison Lohman look great and... Well that was about it. Otherwise this is just two hours of pure horse-manure.

I could ramble on about all the pointless, sugarcoated, sentimental crap that this movie is stuffed with, but honestly I just want to erase it from my mind.",3
22 July 2023,THIS is a feel-good movie!!,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

25 January 2011,A Brilliant Tall Tale Or Is It?,"Tim Burton has moved us with Edward Scissorhands, to me his most brilliant original work..being that it was a screenplay by him and Caroline Thompson... but BIG FISH is by far his MASTERPIECE. Based on a amazing book, he connected with the material beautifully. The visuals, the acting, the craftsmanship in putting all this together in a very touching... tug at your heart strings... laugh out loud... Oscar worthy production was handled to perfection. How could you not like this film? I simply wouldn't understand it. Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Danny Devito all give A+ performances... Jessica being left out of most of the reviews I had to bring her in... not to be unnoticed are also a stellar performance by Billy Cruddup, Alison Lohman, and Helena Bohnam Carter. In fact I think every person in the film had one of their best performances. Just stellar all around. One whopper of a story that gets you pulled in and doesn't let you go till the ending credits! Big Fish will be in my movie library along with Edward Scissorhands and be a favorite in my heart, my 15 year old Daughters, my Wifes, and everyone I talk to about it. Great, great, did I say Great film Tim Burton... you definitely got your magic back!",10
23 July 2015,about the life's magic,"subtle, delicate,touching. pledge for the life as result of the dreams. about the real taste of imagination. about the childhood as only decent age. about the life as spectacular trip. the director of film is Tim Burton. and that fact could explain all. the childhood's spirit presence, the crumbs of miracles, the new side of gestures and words, the hope in eccentric clothes. the texture - same from the fairy tales.a brave hero, strange places, temptations, danger and a great, unique love. success, discoveries, wise testimony about the pillars of life. a film about truth. the real truth. like an amazing travel in the heart of the things.a moral story and a tool for the right image of world's sense.

30 April 2007,A Story that you never going to forget,"And i say it for my own experience, because i see this movie i watched this movie more than two years ago, and in spite of that i can write this commentary without problem, i never going to forget ""Big Fish""

Tim Burton surprise in each movie that he makes, sometimes for good (""Bettlejuice"" ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"", ""Ed Wood"", ""Edward Scissorhands"" and i hope that he do it again with the dark Sondheim's musical adaptation ""Sweeney Todd""), sometimes for bad (""Planet of the Apes"" and ""Sleepy Hollow""). And without doubt of it and happy i can say that ""Big Fish"" is, not only the best movie that he ever made, is too one of the best movies that i have ever seen and it probably (No matters if I'm going to a topic that is so discussed) one of the best movies ever made.

The story of ""Big Fish"", which was based it in the novel by Daniel Wallace, talk us about Will, who has lost affection for his father. One day, he receives a phone call from his family... his father is dying. He remembers then what was the cause of that lose of affection: Will hates when his father entertains all telling them all the stories of his youth. All of that stories are fantastic ones. Will hates it. When he was a kid he loves it. But now he hates it. When Will go to home again to take care to his father... he don't know that he is going to live the most big adventure of his life.

Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" is a real nostalgic experience in a beautiful way (Few movies that i have ever seen, in spite that i have not seen much, makes that feeling on you, like ""Smultronstället"" by Ingmar Bergman, ""Meet me in St. Louis"" by Vincente Minelli, ""City Lights"" by Chaplin and ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" by magistral director Jean-Pierre Jeunet), makes it cares in the REAL facts that makes so important life. I talk about your father, your mother, your sister, your brother, your family, your family or the people who loves and you love too. ""Big Fish"" is too a kind of time machine that returns us to that paradise of our childhood that much times we reject as adults. And in spite of that you'll be and adult, you can enjoy all that fantasy, all that story that, anyway, makes us human beens.

This movie is perfect is perfect too in the direction (I think that if is Tim, is very obvious), the performances ( My God, what cast! Ewan McGregor who was too in ""Trainspotting"" and ""Moulin Rouge!"" ""Albert Finney"" ""Billy Crudup"", ""Jessica Lange"" who was in ""Crimes of the Heart"" , Helena Bonhan Carter who was too in ""Getting it Right"" by Randal Kleiser, Alison Lohman, Robert Guillaume, Steve Buscemi who was very funny here and in ""Ghost World"" by Terry Zwigoff, Danny de Vito, Mattew McGrory who was wonderful as the giant, Ada Tai and Arlene Tai who was great as the paper of Ping and Ting, with other magnificent cast) and the scenario is real beautiful, in any detail. ""Big Fish"" is a real masterpiece, not only of the contemporaneous cinema, too of the history of cinema. Of course is just my opinion, and its maybe that movie with a touch of fantasy, surrealism and at the same time about present time, where the human been makes a world of corruption, some people can shows that we can change it a little with a tiny piece of sugar of fantasy, we can change the world and our lives in an inexplicable way.

Thanks Tim. You bring us that little piece of sugar of fantasy that we need.

*Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any.",10

11 May 2004,Wow!!!!!,"I would like to start by saying that I have always loved watching Albert Finney ever since I saw him in A Christmas Carol as a child. After seeing him in Big Fish alongside Jessica (I in no way look 80) Lange, I love his acting even more. I thought the entire tale was wonderful from beginning to end, and I did not want to see the story end, which, I would say, should be considered a defining characteristic of a feel good movie such as this. I felt all of the acting was superb as was the writing, directing, etcetera. I have only one thing about this movie that really baffles me... are you listening Academy? Why wasn't this movie the winner for Best Picture? Ohh, yeah... LOTR... my bad... on any other year, it should have been.

28 November 2007,Burton's view on Burton,"Each director has his movie that would sum up as his experimental catharsis. Woody Allen and Charlie Kauffman write every single script with this allegory. With ""Big Fish"", there is nothing great and difficult to understand, because it is done with a great magical, simple sense that entangles multiple interpretations: it beholds on the viewer to know what he/she will grab of the story.

Many saw the form of creating a legacy. Of how a man is nothing more than his interior world, thus being the Big Fish the Big Story. Doesn't really matter whether it's true or not. Others see how to view the world and put on the charge on the warmed-heart direction. It has a panoply on light colors and cozy art direction, of likable actors and fantasy characters.

All of this views are excellent. But what I see is Burton's most personal film. Yes, of course. But he admits and perseveres that he is a conflicted artist and his salvation relies on creating lies, stories that don't exist. He is a filmmaker, he lives by creating stories. Ed Bloom is Burton's hero, his unsuppressed self. All what he created, every inch of lies and fantasy he garnishes into his story, it's just a derivation of his interior oasis (may that be good or bad) and all of this movie is an intimate approach to his mind and heart. Burton is every character in the story, waiting to be heard in his most pure and dire form.

""Big Fish"" is Tim Burton view on Tim Burton.",8
16 May 2004,Alice in Wonderland for grownups,"Wow! Take a tumble down this rabbit hole and see what Tim Burton's fantasies bring you! This was a spectacularly told story about a son's quest to find what his father was really all about...only to discover he knew it all along.

An extremely moving tale that dares us to dream and reminds us to stop and

smell the roses along the way wherever we go. A definite classic that has

rightfully been embraced by the movie-watching public and taken its place in

the IMDb ""Top 250"" of all time.

24 June 2023,A touching sentimental tale about a great visionary or the Magnificent Tim Burton: Part four,"A sentimental fairy tale. The magnificent storyteller Tim Burton continues to delight us with his works, and this film adaptation of Daniel Wallace's novel ""Big Fish. The novel of mythological proportions"" was no exception. I have nothing to say for the book, because I have not read it, so I will evaluate the picture as an independent work. You know, this picture partly repeats the best pictures of Soviet cinema, especially in terms of sentimentality and touching, and is even capable of knocking out tears, and the love story is very reminiscent of the notorious ""Diary of Memory"". And I've seen the picture more than once. And here is my brief opinion for you - A touching sentimental tale about a great visionary. You can find fault with the picture, and I will certainly do it in a separate paragraph, but for now I will focus your attention exclusively on the advantages of this sentimental fairy tale.

So, here they are: 1. The scenario - the picture tells us the amazing story of Edward Bloom, who is about to die, and his son and daughter-in-law come to him on this occasion. And the son wants to get to know his father in these remaining days, because he didn't tell anything about himself, except incredible stories that seem to be stories from the outside. For a little over two hours, we watch the most vivid memories from the life of Edward Bloom and try to figure out this amazing man for ourselves, just like his son. Is Edward an inventor or is everything that happened to him true? And a whole epoch in the history of mankind will flash before the viewer, which can be easily recognized. The local history is full of vivid images, charismatic characters (which are definitely catchy), the thoughtfulness of a fabulous assumption, central thought and message, and some dialogues make you think about many things. During the timing, we are imbued with Edward's story, we are entirely on his side (although most viewers will even consider some of his actions immoral). And the finale is the apotheosis of the whole story. A grandiose and expected ending to the story. It turned out very touching.

2. Edward's stories - I have no right to list them in front of those who have not yet watched this masterpiece of Maestro Tim, but they are all good, who is more and who is less, but definitely good. After all, they have both fights and chases, and in them we see the character of our hero, the manifestation of his best qualities. Yes, they are fabulous, and the finale of these stories is obvious even at their very beginning, but this does not make them bad, because the themes that are raised in them are eternal: perseverance, the spirit of research, the path to a dream, love, and so on. There is not enough time to list everything. And how I want to believe in these stories!

3. Allegories, grotesque, exaggeration - all this is here and in considerable quantity. For example, the allegory of Edward with a large fish, because if you think about it, he himself was this largest fish (hence his eternal desire to drink). A fabulous town with an equally fabulous name, a clairvoyant witch, and so on. What can I say, even Helena Bonham Carter here does not play an eternally disheveled aunt, but almost a cutie. Yes, and it was like that, in 2003, when almost everything was good cinema - eh, those were wonderful times. And old Tim does not hesitate to philosophize, and the audience can do it after watching this masterpiece.

4. ""Family is the main thing"" - this is the main idea of the whole picture of Burton. Yes, Edward is an inventor, but without his stories, his son's life would not be so interesting. Edward left behind a long memory. He will live in these stories. Appreciate your loved ones, love them with all your heart, especially your parents - because you will not have others. Spend as much time with them as possible, because it is not eternal, otherwise, later, you will regret that you did not have time to tell them something important, and you will not be able to return the time. Edward's son realized this - and found happiness, and pleased his father in these last days on our Earth.

Now about the quibble (well, you have to find fault, because everything can't be perfect). The story of the Korean War smacks of the ""American dream"", but even in it, old Tim tried to avoid politics and showed this story with comical effect, so he says goodbye.

A little bit about the main characters: 1. Edward Bloom performed by Ewan McGregor (young) and Albert Finney (old) is an amazing man, a visionary with a rich imagination who has lived an incredible life. Brave, strong-minded and resourceful, who changed the lives of many people around him. Both Evan and Albert coped well with their roles. The viewer believes that this is one person, just in different periods of life. Well done!

2. Will Bloom, played by Billy Crudup, is Edward's son, and looks like a boring and uninteresting hero against the background of his father. He does not believe in the stories of his father, on the basis of which he constantly quarrels with him. During the painting, he manages to sort out both himself and his father. And in the final, he becomes a different person who accepted his father and understood everything that he wanted to tell him.

Many thanks for the participation of Danny DeVito, Steve Buscemi, Marion Cotillard and Helena Bonham Carter. The viewer accurately appreciated their acting work.

There is not that gloomy and attractive atmosphere of old Tim, but there is a fabulous atmosphere, especially it prevails in the choice of color palette.

Despite all his efforts, the picture failed at home, and only the world allowed him to scrape together at least some pennies, but for Columbia Studio it was a failure, so Tim did his next work already under the patronage of the giant Urner Brazzers, and it was a puppet dark fairy tale ""The Corpse of the Bride"", but we'll talk about it in another time.

My rating is 9 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",9
1 March 2007,Uneccessary but well-done,"I don't really think this movie was necessary, I think it was just a spur of the moment thing. It just seemed like a generally pointless storyline but in the end, it was well compiled into a story as big as life itself. It's a classic film, don't get me wrong just not one of those memorable classics. But I hope you get what I'm saying. This movie just didn't seem necessary and they could've come up with a more complicated storyline. It didn't feel urgent and it wasn't out to stress a point but that's what you need in films like these. Sure, maybe it had a main idea or two but there were more than two ideas scattered throughout the story, which made it not stick, not stand on a basis for an important movie structures. However, I did give this movie a ten because once again it reminds us of life and that's always welcome in movies. shows, or whatever because we can all relate to it. Everyone has a life and everyone has stories to share. Sure, this is a fictitious story but it really captures the intensity and mystery of life, which reigns above all in any movie. Big Fish was so very well done but it was not urgent and it didn't fit in as well as it could and I know that's the case with a lot of movies but I think Big Fish really could've used a main, thorough, substantial idea.",10
19 December 2005,I cried watching this one,"No doubt about it, this movie touches you in many ways, its funny , its sad, its enjoyable, you won't be disappointed. Ewan Mc Gregor is a brilliant actor that captures the eye. Albert Finney is a master and a legend himself. Crudup is also enjoyable as the son of Edward Bloom who also played a brilliant part in Almost Famous.What about Dany Devito as the funny circus guy? The cast is superb from all the corners. As for Tim Burton , he's a genius and he showed the world that he truly loves the public by presenting his masterpiece. The ending was absolutely magical and reminded me of my late grand father : how he touched all those people during his life and no one would ever forget him and would still talk about his adventures even after he's gone!

So don't hesitate buy it enjoy it then watch it again and show it to all of your friends again and again because its not everyday that you'll see such movie like this...

5 March 2006,An adventure as big as life itself.,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home.

19 January 2004,Sir Reel and the Disney Disease,"Well, this film certainly took a while to hook me in, and actually my wife, pre-occupied with real life instead of reel life left the theater after about 20 minutes.

I had convinced her to see this with me after a friend had told me he thought this was a great romance. Ewan MacGregor does reprise his role from ""Moulin Rouge"" as a hopeless though far from helpless romantic. There's an ""aw-shucks"" aspect to his portrayal, did we ever see him smile and a cartoon beam of light twinkle off his teeth? Even if not, his romance doesn't have much bite to it.

I think the acting (and casting, are Southerners really that foreign to us, and to Tim Burton?) was no big shakes. Crudup gets one scene (towards the end) to really show his craft, but if you haven't seen ""Jesus' Son"" you're better served by watching that. Jessica Lange is a goddess, but here she is not much more than a Hallmark card. For her may I recommend Titus...amongst many.

And did someone really write here that Danny DeVito was subtle? Now, that's funny...

The big story here are the big stories, and Burton's always crafty realization of them. The tall tales are fun in a circus fashion. Indeed we even do get to visit a circus, and Burton remains a fan of the freak show...there's no boy here with scissors for hands, but plenty of others...the ""Siamese"" twins above all were enchanting.

There's just not enough other oddball twists from Burton to make this a ""great"" film for me, a doctor who has some prescience (Guillame/Benson lives!!), the deposed colossus skipping town, and so forth.

I did like new twists on myth as presented here. It would be interesting to see what others think of the book that this is based on. Also, the notion that the best we have to offer in our lives are our stories is a beguiling one (especially for someone working in the ranks of the Hollywood dream machine I suspect). I take issue with that message in theory, and in the realization of it here...I think that this dream has been manufactured to be consumed by so many, and thus lost its most interesting flavors.

So we end up with a cafeteria prepared big fish, that really is not that difficult to stomach, and is filling enough. As I think about it Burton's characters in the past were not a strong point (defined more by quixotic behavior than on dialogue, and detailed character portrayal...Batman was not the only comic book escapee among them), but I still think this film comes up a little lacking for Burton fans.

Lower your expectations, and give this film time to see past the ""Forrest Gump"" nature of it for the trees surrounding Specter and other delights...

3 December 2014,One crazy story after another,"Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) tells the same fish story throughout his son Will (Billy Crudup)'s life of catching a fish with his wedding ring. They stop talking to each other and they only connect through Will's mother Sandra (Jessica Lange). Ed is sick and Will goes home to see him. Will retells his father's stories. As a kid, Ed encounters the witch (Helena Bonham Carter). He (Ewan McGregor) is heroic as a teen and then he confronts a giant. He convinces Karl the giant to join him to leave town. He takes a detour and ends up in the hidden town of Spectre. Later, Ed meets Sandra (Alison Lohman) at the Calloway Circus.

I like the weird Tim Burton style. The movie falls into a bit of a rut as one outlandish situation takes over from another. I need the stories to be connected more with the real part of the movie. It doesn't have the needed emotional impact. It's just one crazy wild adventure after another.

22 January 2007,A son tries to separate fantasy from truth in order to find out who his father is,"Ed Bloom (Albert Finney), a larger-than-life kind of guy, has always told miraculous stories about his life where fantasy and reality are seemingly interwoven. This has lead to years of alienation from his son Will (Billy Crudup) who feels he never heard the real stories and who doesn't appreciate his father's fantastic tales. When Ed Bloom is on his deathbed, his son returns. Feeling like he never knew his father, he hopes to separate the lies and fantasy in his stories from the truth, hoping to find the true person underneath the tall-tales.

In the movie, Edward Bloom recounts stories from his life. We see the younger Edward Bloom (mostly played by Ewan McGregor) as the main character of these fantastic tales. There are many themes in this movie as they vary with the story being told, but the main theme is the relationship between father and son as his son rediscovers and comes to terms with who his father is.

It's a heart warming, adventurous, funny movie where fantasy and reality go hand in hand and the possible is as likely as the impossible.

To me, this is Tim Burton at his best. Warmly recommended!",9

5 July 2023,Must watch,"A fantasy to raise the spirits!!!! Both touching, funny and at times extremely moving. Just watched the film for the first time. A memorable cast, playing characters both quirky and endearing. There are few films which tick so many boxes, all of them the most positive aspect of film making. Tim Burton is a director who can make fantasy seem most real. And he brings out fine performances from all the cast. Wes Anderson is the only comparable director. I love both of their work. In these depressing times, it is wonderful to be carried away to a place happier brighter and more positive. Go and enjoy the ride!!!!

10 May 2004,Only mildly entertaining/resonating,"I guess expectations will get you more often than not. I'm a fan of much of Tim Burton's work, and the accolades declaring this to be a new ""Wizard of Oz"" were encouraging, but as it turns out, I was more entertained by that other recent film with the similar premise - Secondhand Lions.

Big Fish started with promise as it sets up the metaphor and mythos of its story, but about halfway through it all becomes rather ho-hum. I like where Burton was reaching with this, which was higher than Secondhand Lions was reaching, but it really failed to resonate or captivate in the way it seems to try so hard to. Secondhand Lions knew it was a light comedy, seen from the eyes of a child coming of age, and it was successful in that sense. Big Fish didn't seem to know what it was... it wasn't really all that funny... or dramatic... or romantic... though it had slight aspects of each. And with the protagonist a jaded adult (Billy Crudup), it just wasn't as captivating to experience as compared to Haley Joel Osment's youth in Lions.

Some good performances, especially Ewan McGregor as the younger Edward Bloom, but unfortunately the film is nowhere near as entertaining or resonating as other Burton fare such as Edward Scissorhands or Ed Wood. Hmm... Burton likes characters named ""Ed"", eh?

30 June 2004,From death comes life.,"What a great story. The characters make this excellent entertainment. They are colorful, eccentric and out there. As the viewer is drawn into the lives of the character, we see the looming death of the story teller. Is this a remake of Walter Middy or Moulin Rouge in the red dirt of Alabama. See the whole movie. Don't give up on it and it will deliver the goods in the end!

Highest praise goes to the Art Director. The scenes, setting and colors are top drawer. Sure, there's a story with good acting but more so it is a visual feast.

Ewan McGregor must have a good agent to get juicy roles like this.

20 October 2018,This is a Tim Burton film with a different vibe...,"... than most of his more gothic fantasy oriented films. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney both play the same character--Edward Bloom. Finney is the older, present day Edward Bloom and McGregor plays him as a teenager and younger man. Finney's segments are set in the present and McGregor's scenes are set as flashbacks, but they are fantasized versions of various events in his life. In the present, Finney is terminally ill and his son (Billy Crudup) is set on finding out the real versions of various stories his father had told him over the years. Crudup is frustrated with his father, as he feels that he's never been told the truth about his father's life and that the stories he tells are just too fantastic to be true.

His quest for the entirety of the film is to find out the truth about the real stories. Anyway, the flashback/fantasy sequences that feature McGregor are the stories that Finney is telling his son. The story goes back and forth between past and present. The title of the film comes into p lay with the repeated motif of ""big fish in a small pond."" Edward Bloom was just too big and fantastic to be living in small town Alabama.

McGregor's fantasy sequences are easily the best and most entertaining sequences of the film. We see him as the star student who can do no wrong; we see him leave his tiny hometown and try to make it elsewhere. He sees his dream girl (Alison Lohman) at a party and spends three years trying to learn about her and find her. He is determined to make her his wife. Along the way, he joins the circus and ends up being employed by Danny DeVito. He also meets a giant and a set of conjoined twins. There is a hilarious scene with Steve Buscemi.

Tim Burton stock pl ayer, Helena Bonham Carter is excellent as the girl who harbors a lifelong crush on Ewan McGregor, but ultimately never got him to see her in the same way. Scottish McGregor's attempt at a thick Alabama accent is decent--at least he maintains it throughout the film.

This film was so much fun and a nice change of pace from the usual Tim Burton fare. I wish there were more scenes with Ewan McGregor and less scenes with stick-in-the-mud Billy Crudup. This film could have also used more Steve Buscemi--he's hilarious. Jessica Lange also lends support as the older version of Mrs. Bloom and Marion Cotillard appears as Billy Crudup's wife.

17 June 2014,"""There are some fish that cannot be caught.""","A lovely, touching film that has only gotten better over time. Big Fish has many detractors, even among people who are normally big fans of Tim Burton. I wonder if these people expect that every film he does should look the same? Because by the time Big Fish came out, he was frankly in a rut. I think it's his most unique film and certainly one of his best. The performances by the cast are all excellent, particularly the supporting players. As the present-day Edward and Sandra, Albert Finney and Jessica Lange are every bit as good as you would expect from these vets. As the younger Ed and Sandra, Ewan McGregor and Alison Lohman both hold their own, though Lohman gets little to do. McGregor's Southern accent is a little over the top but this is a story about a man who was over the top so it doesn't really hurt anything. The rest of the cast is great. The look of the film is superb. I do wish he could have made it without much CGI (the ""big fish,"" for example, looked extremely fake). But I realize that I'm fighting an uphill battle asking that of mainstream directors these days. Anyway, great film. Heartfelt and magical. A tribute to storytellers. It's also the film debut of Miley Cyrus but we'll forgive it for that.",8
1 May 2022,what was dad really doing all those years?,"Will bloom (bill crudup) isn't sure where he fits into his dad's life (al finney). Dad tells tons of stories about where he's been and these big, giant whopper adventures, where dad always seems to be the hero that saves the day. Similar to the adventures of baron munchausen. Is it all a pack of lies? Where has dad been all these years? Things are all explained at the very end. Cute story. Small roles for miley cyrus, steve buscemi, danny devito. Directed by tim burton. This was nominated for best music.

8 December 2004,not as good as I thought it would be,"I thought this film would have more laughs and be more entertaining. It is about a guy, who goes home to see his estranged father who is gravely ill. He resents the fact that his dad liked to tell him tall tales as a child. Now that's a real reason not to talk to your father for years. So the movie relives of his dad when his dad was young. It shows how he left town with a giant, joined the circus, and how he got his wife to marry him. And how he went to war and bought a town. The part with the giant was probably the best because it was the most laughable. You could see how the son wouldn't believe that. But most of the stories told were so-so and nothing great.

FINAL VERDICT: The general idea behind the movie was good, but the stories shown in the film weren't all that great. If they were going to have a movie about tall tales, then make some of them really out there. That would have been more entertaining. So, I don't recommend this one for anyone who is looking for a fun film to watch.

19 February 2007,Beautiful and Unexpected,"As a lifelong Burton fan, I approached this film with high hopes, and no trepidation whatsoever. Honestly, I have never met a Tim Burton film I haven't liked for one reason or another, but Big Fish is only the second to make me cry (Edward Scissorhands being the first). I was expecting a deep storyline, wonderful cast of characters, and little confusion from time to time, but I got so much more than these things. We have all had a ""big fish"", it's the one that grows and grows until it takes on a life of it's own, before long you don't need to tell the story anymore, because that fish is just one step ahead of you. Bloom didn't lie, he told his own version of the truth, a heartwarming, romantic, and enthralling truth. The cast was nothing short of stellar (especially Billy Crudup making one of his rather rare on-screen appearances). The characters made Big Fish what it is, each and every one influencing the progression of an incredible story you can only hope holds some truth. The elements of love, friendship, and family are embedded in the symbolism and dialogue. The visuals are captivating and awe inspiring. No one does it like Tim Burton, and Burton will struggle to ever create a film to match this...I would (and do) recommend it to everyone.",10
27 November 2005,Can a story be more real than reality?,"This is one of those rare movies that doesn't really try to sell you anything. The moral of the story is yours to get, if any. There is no hard hitting conclusion or ""Aha!"" moment.

The way the story is told is rather nice, even if it annoys me with the Southern nuances of the storytellers voice. I mean, OK, the story is nice, the visuals are nice, violins in the background, slightly computer enhanced color hue, but does it have to sound like someone's grandmother from the Southern Texas is telling the story?

Conclusion: worth watching story of a relationship between father and son. I give it an 8.

29 May 2004,Tim can do no wrong when it comes to films,"This is the first time though when I watched a Tim Burton film and was like ""huh?"". I know Tim does unusual movies, but I was a little confused. I did watch it twice, and I loved it a lot better the second time. It takes a little to get used too. I really enjoyed the ""tall tales"". I even reconized some fimilular faces. I thought Tim did an excellent job on making the film. He really captures Will's life. And the story is very charming. The ending is a tear breaker, but I won't spoil. If you are a fan of Tim's, you are most likely to get ""Big Fish"". But it does take a while to get used too. I think you'll enjoy it though.

5 June 2020,"A beautifully told, emotionally fulfilling tall tale","There are tall tales, and then there's Big Fish. From the visuals to the story to the score, this is such a beautiful film. Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Marion Cotillard and the rest of the cast all bring a sense of humanity to this fantastic tale. Some may say that parts of this movie don't make sense, and that's true, but I still think this is Tim Burton's best emotional work. Plus, every time I watch it, I want to call my dad and tell him I love him.

10 January 2004,It has no idea what it wants to be,"I have to start this by saying that Tim Burton has always been one of my favorite directors. I like his skewed point of view, his Edward Gorey-ish surrealism, his way he will show the not merely odd in his films but also the unpleasant, the ugly, and the weirdly bizarre, and show them in a lovable, accepting manner that makes them sometimes hauntingly fascinating. Instead of that ""train wreck you can't look away from"" feeling, Burton always leaves you with a voyeuristic sense that makes you want to watch his films more than once, to see the things you missed the first time. Instead of hammering away at the viewer with the weirdness of the characters, Burton lets the personalities speak for themselves; and perhaps this works because his characters have always been inherently likeable.

Not so this time with his latest effort, Big Fish.

To tell this nested set of stories, Burton assembled a cast that is top notch: Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom, Albert Finney as the elderly Edward Bloom, Jessica Lange as Bloom's wife Sandra, Billy Crudup as their son William Bloom; with a host of minor roles filled by such notable performers as Robert Guillaume, Danny DeVito, Helena Bonham Carter, and Steve Buscemi. He even includes folksinger Louden Wainwright III in a not-so-invisible role, for what reason I cannot imagine, and insists on spelling his name incorrectly throughout the entire film's opening AND closing credits. This puzzled me a great deal.

In fact, I was puzzled many times throughout the film, but mostly after, when I should have been nodding and smiling, and not wanting to wait until it came out on DVD; instead, I was itching to leave the theater as soon as possible, and sat there with a distinct frown on my face when it finally ended.

Very /few/ films have made me feel as if I wanted to leave. No matter how bad a film is, I rarely walk out on it. Maybe that was the problem with Big Fish; it really isn't BAD. It's pretty. But it's also hollow. You keep watching, and watching and watching, hoping that it will eventually turn into the film you think it should be, then it ends and you realize it never will.

Basically, the story line is simple enough. Edward Bloom is a storyteller. He tells stories about his own life, and adventures, and entertains for decades with these fantastical tales--first his friends, then his wife, then his own son, William. But as William grows up, he becomes irritated with, then angry about, these ""lies"" that he was told. He wants to know the ""real"" father--the one that he can't see for all the stories that he feels act as a smokescreen. Yet, he cannot get any closer to the truth, so he falls away from his father emotionally, until his mother phones him to tell him that his father is now dying.

So William packs his suitcase and pregnant wife and moves back home to help sort out the end of his father's life. Immediately, he is faced with the same stories, the same lies, the same fantastic tales of his father's adventures, and cruelly and selfishly cuts the old man off time after time. He refuses to accept either the stories, OR the magic they contain, and most of all, the fact that they are very entertaining stories. But he is forced to remember the stories, as his father relates them to William's wife, who seems to be entranced by them, and him.

As the stories get told, we are 'treated' to them. ALL OF THEM. These are not SHORT stories. These stories are long, they are convoluted, they have many moments that make you want to question Edward as he tells them, and they contain many many MANY dead ends that lead---and this is the really frustrating part---nowhere at all. And they go on and ON.

For example, take the story about his walk down the ""haunted road."" Edward ploughs his way through mists, and trees that grab him (literally) and strange sounds and (ick and double ick!!) a HUGE nest of large black jumping spiders (!!) and a town that shouldn't even exist, and these things get barely a mention at all (except for the town.) The entire time, the voice-over is yammering on and on about perseverance. About ANOTHER story that was told earlier. About NOTHING. After several dozen of these sorts of scenes, you are left with a feeling that you are missing the point--if you knew where to look, maybe it would pop out at you. But it never does. Because it isn't there. You are constantly trying to reconcile what you are seeing with what you are hearing.

In fact, if you removed the soundtrack and voicetrack from this film entirely, and just WATCHED it, you'd be so puzzled you wouldn't be able to make sense of the plot--but what you /would/ have was an entirely different impression of what was really happening! This feeling of being pulled in two different directions is not only unsettling, it's highly irritating.

The film has two major flaws in addition to this. First, it is about the South--to be precise, Alabama. There is an ingrained ""southernness"" about the movie that needs to be there, because there are several references in it that would only make sense in the Southern U.S. Yet, Burton uses three British actors, one from New Jersey, and a New Yorker, and only ONE person has even a HINT of an Alabamian accent. He doesn't go so far as to allow his Brits to speak with their normal accents, but they don't do ""Suth'n"" either. And neither Albert Finney NOR Danny DeVito speak in consistent accents. Devito wavers from exaggerated hillbilly to his usual ""Noo Joisey"" intonation, and Finney can't decide where he's from. This smacked of really shoddy dialogue coaching, and did nothing for the continuity.

Second, the film is FAR FAR TOO LONG. It needs a good edit. The pace is snaillike, the acting sometimes seems improvised and directionless. And it just has no idea what it's supposed to be ABOUT most of the time.

There are many little oddities all through the film: a street shown briefly in one scene mirrors one seen in Edward Scissorhands; The 'martial arts' in the Chinese army scene is idiotically choreographed; the ""twins"" seem to change size in their various scenes, as does the giant. The ""banjo man"" on the porch in Spectre is not only playing the song from ""Deliverance,"" he IS the young man who played the banjo in ""Deliverance!"" And why Louden Wainwright? Did Burton owe him a favor? He's no actor. He sticks out like a sore thumb among those who ARE actors.

There are things that make /no/ sense, visually OR plot-wise. Why does the kid steal shoes? Who, or what, is that naked ""fish woman?"" How can so many barefoot people dancing on grass make so much noise? What's up with the bits about Edward's need for water--about feeling ""dry""? (He soaks in a tub, fully clothed!) Even some of the camera angles are downright awkward--as if an amateur camera operator had been given free rein to be as ""arty"" as he wanted to be.

And probably the weirdest one of all: Tim Burton has made another movie about someone named Edward.

None of these little items, or the other dozens of such things, are explained or illuminated in the film, especially not at the end, when one might expect them to become clear, or at least say why they cannot be clear. They are simply /there/. And they build irritation throughout the course of this very long film, and the pacing is slow, slow, slow. Never have I felt so much like getting up and leaving a film, just to take a break from it all.

This film isn't a fantasy. It's not an allegory. It's not a drama. It's not a comedy. It's not even a decent Tim Burton film! The characters aren't all that likeable or believable; if Jessica Lange had ducked and nodded and smiled ONE MORE TIME in that film, I'd have thrown a tomato at the screen. And NO ONE--I repeat NO ONE--should have to see Danny Devito NAKED, OR repeatedly watch Albert Finney slurping.

I really wanted to like this film. From the previews, it looked like an entirely different film than the one I saw. It looked lighter, more magical, more surreal. Instead, it was a hodge-podge of bad writing, uncertain goals, unexplained events and senseless details. It just didn't gel.",2
21 June 2017,"Not Just the Facts, M'am...","Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home.

Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom.

10 November 2017,Whimsy: The Movie,"Big Fish posits a strong ideal: that a story can be full of immense truth even if it never literally happened. Burton's Forrest-Gump-esque personal epic is his sweetest film, full of whimsical silliness and fable-like hyperbole. As a whole, the film never quite sinks into me the way Finney's stories do with his audiences, but it's still a good parable about living in the shadow of a larger-than-life character.

19 February 2014,Forrest Gump with an extra dose of whimsy,"Tim Burton directs a remake of Forrest Gump. Just... let that sink in for a little while. Done? Okay, now that you're suitably afraid, let me assure you, it's not as bad as it could have been. It's actually rather good, truth be told.

And yes, it's perhaps not fair to say that this is a remake of Forrest Gump as the stories are different, the characters are different and it's based on a different book. Still, it feels like a remake of Forrest Gump. Emphasis on feels. The whole 'a young man from a small town travels the world, meets important people and later in life profits from those contacts' is straight out of Forrest Gump. Heck, they're even both set in Alabama.

This isn't a flaw, however. There's room for more stories like these and even though Forrest Gump is an obvious inspiration, either for the movie or the novel, it doesn't lessen the value of this film as it is different enough to be called its own creation. The most important differences are the shifted focus from international politics to family values and the vastly different main characters. Forrest Gump, at its heart, was a comedic drama with heavy leaning towards political satire. The whole Vietnam War and Gump's career as a soldier. Big Fish is smaller in scale in that its protagonist doesn't change the world, not even accidentally. The story focuses more on the idea of what it would be like to be related to a person like that. To someone who knows so many important people that sometimes it feels like he doesn't have enough time for his own family. Not for lack of trying, but because he lives in a bigger world. It's an intriguing idea and the film handles it with grace.

The actors are also delightfully talented and the various characters are more colourful than in Forrest Gump. Burton's tastes shine through and the whole film has a nice feel of dark Gothic and urban mythology mixed with fairy tales. Colourful film all around. I also really like the central family. They all feel unique personalities and you can see the bonds between them. The relationship between the father (Albert Finney) and the mother (Jessica Lange) is especially heartwarming in a way I haven't seen in a while.

If you're a fan of Tim Burton, Forrest Gump, urban fairy tales or good storytelling in general, this one is definitely worth checking out.",5
18 June 2004,Burton is The Fisher King!,"Director Tim Burton's surreal & illusionary cinematic techniques have taken us to mystical lands such as: Gotham City, Planets of Apes, Scissor Worlds, Edywood, and Mars. However, mainstream film buffs have been appalled by Burton's outlandish direction. Along comes `Big Fish', Burton's latest flick. Without a doubt, this is Burton's most mainstream film. `Big Fish' will hook those conservative moviegoers along with Burton's cult fanatics. Ewan Mcgregor stars as Ed Bloom. Ed is definitely not a late `bloomer' because of his vivid life and the eccentric characters he befriends along the way. Albert Finney co-stars as the late `bloomer; or should I say the older Ed Bloom who tells his suspicious off-center life tales to his estranged son. The tales might sound fishy to his son Will, played by Billy Crudup, but he listens to them because of his dad's near mortal condition. Alison Lohman, Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter, and Danny Devito round out the acting pond in this thespian school of fish. `Big Fish' possesses sentimental humanistic elements unseen in Burton's previous films. The film, which runs to 130 minutes, could have been shorter in duration but `Big Fish' is still worth the bait. **** Good",8
20 August 2022,"Big Fish"" is visually inviting and suggests different paths for its interpretation and, after all, not everything that is improbable is impossible","In the final scene of Big Fish, narrator Will Bloom says a sentence that sums up, in a few words, the meaning of his father's life (and the movie we are watching). He says: ""A man transforms himself in his own stories. They live even after his death. And that's how he becomes immortal."" Indeed, Edward Bloom is a genuine storyteller. All of his life events-from the most trivial to the most extraordinary-take on new value and new meanings when inserted into his narratives. In his trajectory, ""it is impossible to separate inventions from facts, man from myth"".

It is only fitting, therefore, that John August's great screenplay (adapted from Daniel Wallace's book) begins with a typical fisherman's 'story' - a narrative involving an impossible fish and the alliance of the Edward. Unfortunately, despite being an exceptional storyteller (after all, he spent his whole life practicing), the guy ends up awakening sorrows in his son, who resents never hearing his father tell something 'real' about himself. So, when informed that Edward is dying, young Will Bloom decides to return home (accompanied by his pregnant wife) with the aim of finally trying to 'meet' his father - who, in turn, does not miss the opportunity to relate. Her 'experiences' for her daughter-in-law, who, after all, is nothing more than a new audience.

And what ""experiences"": for Edward, nothing is prosaic. In describing how he saw his wife for the first time, for example, he explains how 'time stops' when we meet 'our great love' (in a beautiful shot that takes this concept literally). In addition, his stories involve figures such as giants, witches and gigantic fish, giving rise to extremely fanciful incidents that capture the viewer's imagination in a ravishing way.

The audience is therefore invited to delve into Edward's adventures and reflect on the impact of these stories on the construction of the father-son relationship. For this, the protagonist's life is presented in a linear way and the film makes clear its use of exaggeration. The quality of Tim Burton's direction is evidenced here. He always manages to present fantasy as improbable; never as impossible. Thus, he suggests to the viewer that there are reliable parts in the construction of his main character. This is the link between drama and fantasy, with a dash of adventure. There are imaginary elements that are so believable that they engender the dramatic tone of the events presented. As the director's hallmark, the fantasy is also metaphorical, dark and fun. Among his allegories, it is possible to discuss the position we assume in relation to cinema; especially to Hollywood cinema. If Edward represents the proposals of mainstream cinema, Will represents the spectator. Will progresses from the naive gaze, through intense criticism, to a stage where he accepts the story factory.

In fact, it is precisely the magnitude of Edward's exploits that explains the metaphor described by the film's title: like a large fish that dies by being confined in an aquarium too small for its dimensions, Edward is a man who, despite not having colossal ambitions, has immense energy and an impressive pleasure in life - and, like fish (which need to constantly swim so they can 'breathe'), immobility (read: monotony) can be fatal to him.

This characteristic, by the way, is brilliantly portrayed by the two interpreters who give life to Edward: Ewan McGregor, who embodies the character in his younger phase, reveals intelligence by showing him always smiling - even in the most difficult moments - and facing problems with unshakable self-confidence. Albert Finney, on the other hand, takes on the difficult task (which he performs with his usual efficiency) of illustrating, for the public, how Edward is tortured by the limitations imposed by his poor health, which prevent him from leaving the house. To make things more interesting, the casting of McGregor, Finney and Perry Walston (who plays the character at the age of ten) was extremely happy, as the three of them really look alike, which gives greater authenticity to the story. Incidentally, the same goes for Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange, who, despite being little explored by the film, convince as the two versions (at different ages) of the same character.

Making the most of the inventiveness of August's script, filmmaker Tim Burton shows himself entirely at ease in this universe - which, after all, is not too far removed from those seen in his previous works, such as Ghosts Have Fun, Edward Hands- de-Scissors and Batman (plus, of course, the wonderful Nightmare Before Christmas, which, despite being directed by Henry Selick, bears the unmistakable mark of Burton, who not only produced it but also worked on the story's conception and of the film's look). It's no wonder that one of Big Fish's main attractions lies in the production design of the talented Dennis Gassner, regular partner of the Coen brothers.

In the same way, the photography by the Frenchman Philippe Rousselot stands out for giving the appropriate atmosphere to each sequence, from the scary to the romantic - and its preciousness deserves applause: observe, for example, how the face of the young Sandra Bloom always appears brighter than than the rest of the environment (and, at times, almost in soft focus), illustrating the ethereal, romanticized way Edward sees her. Danny Elfman, who was present in the soundtracks of almost all the director's films, mixed the songs of the time with instrumental themes to illustrate Ed's stories very well, and even in scenes that deserve our greatest visual attention, the soundtrack does not go unnoticed. . The soundtrack that packs the entire final act of the plot leads the viewer in a brilliant and exciting way. No wonder Elfman received a more than deserved Oscar nomination for this work.

The dramatic structure of Big Fish is very simple, the narration helps to glue the different moments, between the present with Ed already old and his hyper fanciful mini-stories, thus serving as an epitaph for the evil that must soon hit him, since he is sick, to the point of even giving up the chemotherapy he was doing. The relationship of the old man with his heir continues despite the contempt of the second, who even begins to change his posture, slightly, becoming sympathetic to his father basically out of compassion via convalescence.

Because it is a film divided by short stories, the story is episodic, similar to Amazing Stories, an old series that Steven Spielberg produced, which in turn tried to modernize the themes of Twilight Zone and Fifth Dimension with a more fanciful and playful guise. The circus approach that Burton produces here already brings together some of the visual elements that would wear out in his filmography, there is a lot in common of this work with the future The Chocolate Factory and Alice in Wonderland and even The Home of Peculiar Children, in particular in the matter of varnishing bizarre figures with a hyper colorful atmosphere and full of cuteness, but here, it fits, since even that is discreet.

Big Fish"" is visually inviting and suggests different paths for its interpretation. Great entertainment, works its fantasy and drama nuances well. By bringing the father-son relationship to the screen, it suggests a dramatic arc that could be better developed. In his metalanguage, he shows that the act of telling stories is always in tension with the search for the truth of the facts. As a souvenir, it leaves an example of the universe of Tim Burton and an invitation for reflection. After all, not everything that is improbable is impossible.",8
9 July 2011,An ordinary story made extraordinary by Burton's imagination,"¨There are some fish that cannot be caught. It's not that they are faster or stronger than other fish, they're just touched by something extra.¨ Big Fish is a beautiful film that truly captures our hearts by its brilliant storytelling; and it couldn't have been directed by any other than the great and imaginative storyteller himself: Tim Burton. Daniel Wallace's novel, Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions, could have been a disaster in the making if not put in the right hands because the novel is all about imagination and storytelling. Many movies have destroyed stories similar to this one because the effect that imagination has when we read a book isn't translated in the same way when we see a film. Very few directors leave room for imagination in their movies, but thankfully Tim Burton is one of them. He creates a very beautiful, artistic, and imaginative scenery, and the cinematography in Big Fish is also brilliant. He can turn a simple story into an extraordinary one with his artistic sense. Big Fish is actually all about storytelling and teaching us how our lives can remain immortal through the stories we tell. People can remember us by the stories we've told and left behind in the minds of those we've touched. John August (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) did a magnificent job with the screenplay adaptation as well. The entire movie worked well as a whole thanks to the great scenery, great performances from the entire cast, and great dialogues. The movie is great from start to finish, it's truly beautiful; the scenes and characters will stick in your head even long after you've seen it.

Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) has just been diagnosed with cancer and as he lays in his deathbed his son, Will (Billy Crudup), begins recollecting his past and trying to separate fiction from facts. Ed has always been a storyteller, and Will used to love to hear these fantastical stories about how his father caught an uncatchable fish, married the woman of his dreams, and set out to do big things in the world, but as he grew older he became resentful towards his father who always spent a lot of time away from home and making up stories that in his opinion weren't true. Will's wife, Josephine (Marion Cotillard), wants him to make up with his dad before he passes away. Ed however claims they shouldn't worry because he's seen the way he was going to die and it wasn't like this. That was just one of his many stories and it's exactly how Will begins recreating the story of his father. When Ed was a young boy he visited an old witch (Helena Bonham Carter) who showed him the way he was going to die through her glass eye. We later see Ed as a young adult (played by Ewan McGregor) trying to make a big name for himself in the small time he grew up in. He achieves many great things, but realizes the town is just too small for him so he decides to move on to a big city for greater things. He takes a journey that leads him into various interesting characters, such as Karl the Giant (Matthew McGrory), the poet Norther Winslow (Steve Buscemi), the Siamese twins Ping and Jing (Ada Tai and Arlene Tai), his future wife Sandra Bloom (Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange as the old Sandra), and a circus owner named Amos Calloway (Danny DeVito). Will tries to make sense of these stories in order to figure out what is fact and what is fiction so he can finally understand his father.

Several of the stories are unbelievable, but they are extremely funny and worth listening too. The performances from Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney as Ed Bloom are really heartwarming as well. Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito are hilarious in their supportive roles, and Alison Lohman is breathtaking in her role as the sweet Sandra. This was also Marion Cotillard's first American film and she has made quite a name for herself by now. Helena Bonham Carter also had a remarkable role and she is as strange as ever. Billy Crudup has the most serious role as his character is more of a fact sort of guy and is tired of listening to all the stories his father has told him for years expecting him to believe them. He is also very credible as Will Bloom. The entire cast is actually a delight on screen and Big Fish works in great part thanks to their performance. The artistic scenery also caught my attention and it played a huge part in the storytelling. No one could've done it better than Tim Burton himself. By the end of the movie I guarantee you will feel touched and moved by this great story which is also helped out by having a powerful ending. It is just one of those pictures that will be hard to get off your mind for quite some time so I really recommend this film because this is the way stories should be told.

2 October 2014,Just enjoy the ride,"Bizarre and entertaining story about a son (Billy Crudup) trying to learn more about his dying father (Albert Finny) by piecing together the stories and myths he's heard his entire life, which eventually leave them estranged.

Tim Burton definitely brings the imagination to this and Ewan McGregor is excellent as the young William Bloom, can't fault his Southern accent or enthusiasm. Actually everyone involved in the ensemble cast is pretty good.

This is one of those movies where you just go along for the ride, like Forrest Gump or Benjamin Button. you never know what's going to happen next or which strange and influential character will cross his path. The father-son relationship is bittersweet as he sets about trying to unravel fact from fiction and I loved the ending. Amusing and magical. 6/19/14

6 April 2004,"Just like 2001's ""Planet of the Apes"" - a complete failure.","A fantasy film where telling tall tales should play right into Burton's strengths as a filmmaker. But for an imaginative film that relies on blowing the viewer away with fantastic scenes, I found it all too pedestrian and if you will...unimaginative. The storyline was slight and forgettable, and its sweating hard attempt to act the part of the aggressive traveling salesman to make me buy a product I didn't need with such a sugary sentimental pitch, never worked. After catching all those wild stories that blur the lines between reality and fantasy, with no tension coming forth and not anything real happening, I'm left wondering what it was all about. It would be too inane to believe that the filmmaker actually wants us to go for the bald-faced lie over anything real because it is so charmingly told, which is another way of adopting Hollywood's moneymaking code of giving the paying customers whatever they want as long as they feel entertained and the investors are happy with the box-office returns. But that is exactly what this film is about. Along with the superficial metaphors disclosed about death and love and an idyllic life, which are supposed to be poignant pronouncements for the film to cover-up all its emptiness and its attempts at doling out false hopes for those who buy into its premise.

26 April 2023,Touching and spellbinding... like a painting coming to life,"There was a time up until 2019 that BIG FISH was often aired on channel 6 but I always avoided it because I thought it would have been dumb considering the title. Well, I must have been so dumb myself! Last March I finally saw it and I ended up loving it to the point that I wanted to give a score higher than 10.

During the wedding party of Will Bloom his father Edward (Albert Finney) tells the story of when his son was born he caught a huge catfish in the river using his nuptial ring as bait but Will, having heard these stories from very long, he doesn't believe them anymore and starts avoiding his father. Skip to three years later, and Edward has cancer, so he has no other choice that to tell his story to Will and Josephine.

Edward (Ewan McGregor) had to stay reclused at home for three years because he grew faster than normal, then he went on his road and met a huge giant named Karl, and then they took separate ways: Will went to live in Spectre and becomes friends with poet and small time crook Norther Winslow (Steve Buscemi) and the Mayor's daughter Jenny. After leaving Spectre Edward reunited with Karl and went to Amos Calloway's (Danny de Vito) circus unbeknownst to the fact that Calloway is some sort of mutant as he turned into a wolf only to return to his human form in the morning. After trying to win the love for a woman and serving in the Korean war helping two Japanese women escape from torture Edward returns in the US and reunites with Norther helping him to rob a bank that is on the verge of bankruptcy: Norther will become a broker and Edward will have the money for buying the house of his dreams.

After the stories are over Edward has a stroke and Will has to stay with him in the hospital and inable to talk, Edward lets Will imagine how the story ends and they imagine to escape from the hospital and go in the near river where all the characters he met during his fantastic journey greet him. When Will arrives to the river he turns into the catfish and flees. Will, after understanding his father's love for stories, will tell the story to his son.

The plot was incredibly touching and Edward's stories incredible as they sound. The settings were great and looked like from an old fairytale book, they were so spell-binding that it shows that Tim Burton put a lot of effort behind it. And the acting was great by all: McGregor as the young Edward Bloom, Buscemi as the poet turned broker, De Vito as the werewolf circus manager and the others were very endearing and their acting added a lot to the movie's greatness: and the soundtrack was on par with all the other qualities.

Overall, one of Tim Burton's best movies he ever did for the subject, settings and acting. Even tho, and this is just a minor warning, some Kleenex are needed especially towards the end.",10
29 November 2005,Patchily successful,"Young man, estranged from his storytelling father for years, returns home to his father's death-bed and learns more tall tales, more legends, and how sometimes true stories are saved from the mundane by a dash of colorful whimsy. Director Tim Burton obviously felt a kinship to this journey, and to the relationship between father and son, but he can't seem to work up much energy or enthusiasm in the present day sequences (this despite the fact Albert Finney seems to be having a ball). The fantastic flashbacks, with Ewan McGregor as the young Finney, are fabulous however, and these episodes are the best things in ""Big Fish"". The film is handsomely-made, well-conceived, but you have to get through many lulls to find the good stuff, as if it were a crime to have one completely good movie. The production is very bright and beguiling, although comparisons to ""The Wizard of Oz"" (by one professional critic) seem somewhat premature. ** from ****

8 December 2004,A Unique Delight,"I haven't been this drawn to a film since I saw Edward Scissorhands in the theater. When the movie was over I was completely ready to go back to the ticket booth and buy myself another ticket for the next show. I would have if I had enough money to but $8.50/film is pretty steep. Tim Burton is nothing less than a genius. He is my favorite director ever and after viewing this film it made me realize all over again why I love his work so much. He has the ability to create such a fantastical world that you almost wish you could have been part of that magic. And Danny Elfman did an incredible job composing the music. He is a modern day musical genius. Him and Tim Burton make the best team in the history of cinema (in my opinion).

I can't believe this film was nominated for only one Academy Award. Blasphemous! It should have been at LEAST be nominated for 5! At LEAST! Best picture, best cinematography, best direction, best actor, and still including Best Musical Composition. Although I do have to admit Danny Elfman should have won a long time ago for Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas, but the Oscars don't seem to actually care about talent. Anyways...aside from that...This film is truly wonderful and delightful and amazing and I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend watching it! EsPECIALLY on the big screen! I, of course, gave it a 10/10 but would much rather give it an 11 because it's off the charts. :)",9
19 January 2005,Wonderful,"This movie is described by many people here in great detail, and I don't think there is much more I could add about the characters. The storytelling throughout the entire movie is just wonderful.

It is so easy to get caught up in the stories being told about the young Edward Bloom, that we forget that we are being told the stories by the dying Bloom. And thus we are taken from the youthful tales of wonder, to the sweet old man dealing with his bitter unbending son. Slowly throughout the movie, the son learns who his father was, and who he still is, and that is the wonder of Big Fish. There is no big ""Turning Point"" from the son, just a gradual understanding of who his father is. And the ending is a joy as well - over the top, fantastic, and an absolute masterpiece.

Someone before me in these reviews stated that men might like this movie more than women - that I am not sure about, but I can say, as a man who didn't always have the best relationship with my own father (and what man HAS had the perfect relationship with his father?), this movie is especially poignant to men in a lot of ways.

10 / 10 (and as a note, my father received a copy of this from me as a gift last year!)",10
15 May 2023,Fever Dream,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

8 January 2004,sentimental bullhockey,"Tim Burton has made a number of films I really like (Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Pee Wee's Big Adventure), but this is not one of them. The son trying to figure out his father is a wholly unlikable character. If I were his dad, I'd disown him. Like everyone else in the picture, he is successful, very clean cut, and middle class. In fact, these words can be used to describe the film in its entirety, and I don't mean that as a compliment.

It's possible that the Burton films I like were carried by quirky actors like Johnny Depp and the young Winona Ryder. As good as he was in Trainspotting, Ewan McGregor has become a dull, middle of the road, mediocre actor. His role in the midst of these extended fantasy sequences is too bright-eyed, too naive to be at all involving or interesting. The only reason I was able to sit through this entire picture was the presence of Steve Buscemi, in a relatively small role.

How a film is able to involve a lot of carny sequences and remain pure as the driven snow is beyond me, but I think the more important question is WHY would a director do this? Tim Burton's film has a very Disney-fied quality to it, everything is squeaky-clean sweetness and love once initial misunderstandings are overcome. There is not nearly enough humor in this film to make it worthwhile. Burton's wide-eyed fantasy world has become unbearably boring.",1
1 April 2012,Big lies great truth,"A poetical movie mixing reality and fancy so well and effectively that we cannot say where one ends and the other begins. Albert Finney makes a splendid role as a father telling his son stories of his life where he mixes real facts and events with fanciful narrations full of poetry and romanticism. The story begins when the already adult son is called from France to come near his dying father's bed and begins to revive all those stories that filled his childhood but had ended up by revolting him against what he later began to consider a pack of lies. But now he realizes that he doesn't know his father well and he approaches him willing to know really what and who he is indeed below the top of the iceberg to which he thinks he can compare his father's moral appearance and thus reach the true nature of his personality. It's a very beautiful story in itself and the fancy included in the father's tales are beautiful too both visually and in words. All the performers do an excellent work personifying charming characters. A landmark in the history of recent cinema indeed.

18 July 2004,"Three tales about Big Fish - one man's impressions of a very busy, ambitious film.","Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is a sick old man. His son (Billy Crudup) is frustrated by the fact that he's spent his entire life telling tall tales instead of really talking about himself. So, to tell us about his father as a young man (Ewan McGregor), Crudup only has these stories to tell us.

Obviously an intensely personal film for Burton, who is really here telling us a tale about his own father.

* I could imagine it all before I saw it. Or maybe I felt the exact content of it wasn't relevant - the initial idea said everything there was to say: man tells tall tales instead of talking, son is not impressed. I could imagine these fairy tales from watching the previews. Just tall tales.

* Or maybe its because I just found the character of Burton's father so frustrating. Always claiming he cares so much about people and about life in his stories, yet not caring enough to talk with them like a human being. Stories make nice movies; but would i take them instead of life?

Burton isn't naive to this. Its the conflict at the centre of the film.

But i just couldn't forgive Albert Finney's character. Burton clearly can. That's the problem with too-personal projects. You can't be objective about what you expect the audience to be experiencing while they watch it - because your own experience of it is informed by so much that's offscreen. So of course Burton can forgive Finney, because he's his own father! You love him despite the fact that he's a selfish, frustrating old rat. But he's not my father, or anybody else's - why should we forgive him?

* Its such a busy film, too. Burton really shot for the moon with this one. He tries to tell us a million movies at once: every five minutes a new movie, and frankly I didn't care about any of them. The twenty minute tangents into his fathers' stories had about as much dramatic tension as my own grandfather's stories. They were all just silly stories his father was telling. I thought the gawdy colours were too much for the same reason.

6/10. I find his simpler films like Edward Scissorhands more profound and beautiful: less is indeed more. Maybe I just didn't like Billy Crudup (BO-RING! Think robotic Hayley-Joel in Secondhand Lions). It didn't work for me.",1
14 March 2007,Ranges from fantastical to dull,"Heartwarming tale that starts off rather awkwardly, but slowly picks up steam until the fantastic finale, which is executed very well and is surprisingly emotional. The frame tale of the father-son relationship is pretty weak, and slows the film down for much of it - partly due to Crudup's annoying character - but manages to evoke a sentimental reaction by the end. The fantasy elements of the tale range from innovative (the town) to dull (the romance), but all have Burton's signature touch. McGregor and Finney really carried the film, it's too bad that a large portion of it has to be focused on Crudup. Among the females, only Bonham Carter is memorable, as she is quite good in her dual role. There's some good supporting work from DeVito and Buscemi, and the visuals are frequently fantastic. A bit of a letdown, but still a good flick.

16 June 2005,Delightfully bittersweet fantasy,"This may be my favorite of Tim Burton's films. It's a clever, literary, memoir about a man who embellishes his life with fantasy and his son, and how they come together at the end of his life to reconcile the tall tales that weave the tapestry of his life. It's also a story about parental bonds, and learning to love as unconditionally as a parent may.

Albert Finney is remarkably moving as the father in his old age, with Ewan McGregor playing the fantastic flashbacks with equal skill. The cast is excellent all around, the cinematography is - as with most Burton films - lush and gorgeous, and the story is endearing. Some may find the pace a little slow, but trust me, it's all very worth it in the end.

Billy Crudup plays the son of Ed Bloom, an all American boy who has lead a charmed life. Bloom has created fantasies to embellish every major event in his life and does not distinguish them from reality. His son, who feels alienated by his father's penchant for tall tales, wants desperately to know his father before he passes on, but must slowly come to realize that he already does.

While not entirely light-hearted, this is a very entertaining and good feeling film, which touches emotional depths that Burton's work rarely reaches. I recommend it without reservation to anybody who wants a bit more than simple entertainment.",9

29 October 2016,Burton does Forrest Gump - with middling results,"BIG FISH is Tim Burton's attempt to do a whimsical flight-of-fancy movie based around an old guy on his death bed telling tall tales to his son. It's as simplistic as that, and it feels a bit like one of the Pee Wee films although without the irritating main character. Basically the viewer gets a ride through Burton's imagination with all of the kookiness and weird characters we've come to expect from the director.

This feels a little like a Coen brothers movie in places although without the wit. It's not a very good film, purely because I didn't like the main characters. The smug Ewan McGregor has long been a bane in my life and he doesn't change my opinion of him here; plus that Southern accent sounds fake even to this British viewer. Albert Finney is little better in a role that pretty much any old actor could have played. The only one I liked was Billy Crudup, who I have never seen playing a nice, ordinary chap before.

The nature of the tall tales and adventures is rather ordinary and the various romantic sub-plots are entirely boring. Once again we get Helena Bonham Carter turning up underneath various prosthetic work and various cameos from the likes of Danny DeVito and good old Steve Buscemi. Some of the interludes are surprisingly racist in their depiction of Asian cultures and others seem to take pride in circus culture and the exploitation of animals that goes with it. Needless to say I found none of the whimsical humour funny at all. Burton's on definite autopilot with this one.",4

5 October 2014,Something got lost along the way,"(59%) An over ambitious adaptation that only partly fits Tim Burton's creative eye. The cast is strong, but nobody it seems is given any chance to make any real impact as characters are dropped only to be brought back again as and when needed in a wild attempt to link everything, and everyone, together in one neat package. With that said this is still a quality piece with good direction and production values, some nice touches every so often, and quite a lot of charm, but the attempts of poignancy feel forced as it's so hard to connect with everything this wants to fit in. Overall it is worth a look as certain people will like this more than others, but it's really not my one of my favourite Burton movies.

6 April 2012,"What a Lovely, Strange Film....","Tim Burton always produces remarkable motion pictures, whether they're ultimately that good, or not. With 'Big Fish', with its fluorescent colours and lovable weirdness, some critics have dared say that it's not very good.

A few of the parts on their own are a little iffy but it's the huge scale of extraordinariness that verges into Terry Gilliam's territory and the way they unfold that literally takes one's breath away. In the best Tim Burton way, the surprising turn into something even more surprising, letting our imagination run riot. He doesn't even seem to rely on CGI - just look at all those individual daffodil flowers and that bright green lawn, where you think you can see where the turf has been stitched together.

Those of us used to Ewan MacGregor being in Trainspotting, might find it difficult to adjust to this naive and often seemingly rather simple fellow with his quite strong American drawl of an accent. Having Albert Finney play him in later life seems more natural somehow as he seems like an eccentric granddad, telling us all these very tall stories. Helena Bonham Carter is cast to type as a sort of modern witch and possible love interest for MacGregor and is as good as she always.

The in's and out's of the story are too complex to write with any brevity and in any case are best left for the viewer to experience as they let the film unfold. The way I saw 'Big Fish' was as a fairytale for adults, with adult-ish themes plus all the wacky weirdness of Tim Burton.",8

25 September 2011,The story of stories,"Big Fish should be filed under 'what could have been'. Having been a big Tim Burton fan in my formative years, having loved Batman and Beetle Juice in my early teens and then growing into Ed Wood later on, my interest was dwindling with Sleepy Hollow and turned into real concern with Planet of the Apes. Out of nowhere came Big Fish - which seemed to signal a complete shift for Burton. He was finally growing up, rebelling against his own predictability and the style that he himself created and single-handedly turned into a cliché. On Big Fish he was reinventing himself and recreating himself as a legitimate filmmaker. Sadly, it remained a completely solitary incident. Burton sunk further back into his own clichés and never once created anything as fresh as Big Fish since.

And so, Big Fish must be considered as a film by its own right, rather than a transitional step in Burton's filmography; and when seen as such, it's revealed as a gorgeous film, a drama/fantasy combination that's considerably more positive and whimsical than comparable films like Heavenly Creatures, The Fall and Pan's Labyrinth, all of which use the fantasy in the darkest ways possible. In Big Fish the fantasy isn't about escaping from horrible reality - it's to enhance a ""regular"" reality, to make it more interesting and more spectacular. In a way, it's about the very essence of storytelling, and by extension, of filmmaking, which may explain why it's Burton's most emotional and personal movie - since Edward Scissorhands, at least.

Burton's knack for visuals is obviously on display here too, but for once it's not the main attraction. Big Fish is gorgeously shot, the lighting and coloring construct the mood, but this time the characters are the centerpiece - the characters, astonishingly, not the actors (looking at you, Johnny Depp), because not one of the actors actually delivers a shattering performance (Albert Finney is the best one, as well as the only one who makes the fake accent work) but the characters are all remarkably memorable, and the credit should go to the cast but most of all to Burton. It's shocking that he could ever make a movie as emotionally potent as Big Fish, and sad that he never tried to repeat it.

You can completely ignore the fact that Burton directed this; if you hadn't been told, it's possible that you'd never notice. Just sit back and enjoy a beautiful, touching, sad, hilarious, magical story, and be glad that someone talented took the time to make it.",9
28 December 2005,"Simply a good, big tale","'Big Fish' is a magical, big tale about an ordinary guy who becomes unordinary and lives a big tale. It captures a southern US father and his relationship with his son, who fails to believe his big tales until a moving experience brings them closer together and closer to 'reality'. It is ultimately the tale of a father/son relationship as much as it is a tale about the unusual and adventurous life that his father leads and the unusual characters he befriends along the way to a successful and magical life.

The film is full of symobolism, but it is often a little too simplistic, and I felt that the plot could have developed more in some areas. This could have been a much longer film, and I think that it needed to be longer in order to tell some of the story, but it does fairly well as it stands. I felt that some of the scenes were rushed and that some of the detail and additional scenes could have made this a much better film.

I don't think this film is for everyone, but if you're after a good story about characters and want to watch something original, then I suggest spending an evening with this film.",8
2 March 2005,so nice,"December 28th, when i passed my psychology exam, i immediately went to our bookshop to celebrate the event , that's my odd nature - and i saw the book called Big Fish there. It was thin and thus cheap so i bought it , went outside and started reading. I was charmed by the way it was written, the style reminded me of American folklore (actually that was a Russian translation, and a book of American folklore i had was also on Russian , so, maybe ,it is only a wrong impression) , and the story was so unusual , and so unusually told , and i loved it.

On the back cover of the book it was said that Tim Burton have filmed it not long ago, so the only thing to do was buy the film immediately. Often , when you read a book and image the characters and events quite well, a film based on this book becomes a disappointment for you .But this was not the case. The film is excellent. Doctors call it schizophrenia or something like that ,when your imagination becomes real and surrounds you , but what to do if it's not just an imagination? You can't tell reality and fantasy apart only because they are the same.If something you face ain't alright with you, think it up the way you like it more.",10
20 April 2004,Big Fish? or Wet Fish?,"I really can't decide whether this is an Ok film that didn't quite push the right buttons, or just a plain non-event of a movie. It's rare that I find myself in this position. Usually I either hate or love a film, or find a movie not worth bothering with at all. But this one, whilst most certainly not impressing me at all, is neither bad enough for me to slate it, nor good enough for me to sing it's praises.

Quite simply, I'm not sure what Burton was trying to do here. I understand all the metaphors and allegories that are present, but the ultimate goal of the film eludes me. Was it to make me think about how I relate to my father? Was it trying to tell me that not all stories are made up, or true? Was it simply trying to point out the difficulties of having a larger than life personality in a boring, mundane world? Is it all of the above? And, at the end, do we actually care?

A film has to be entertaining on some level in order to keep the audience's attention. BF does this, but only just. At no point do you feel any great empathy for the character of the Father, as told in his stories. In fact, there's nothing about the film as a whole which really grasps your attention and demands that you continue watching.

Perhaps the biggest failing, as with many other films, is the hype that surrounds them. BF has been hyped up as a wonderful movie that will astonish and delight. Unfortunately it doesn't deliver on that promise. In the end, it's just the story of a man coming to terms with his father's death and helping through that time and coming to understand himself better in the process. Throw in a few gentle fantasy elements and that's really all there is to Big Fish.

Ultimately not so much of a Big Fish, as the One That Got Away....",5
2 December 2006,Flawless,"Of entire thing I got to say this - I love this movie. And it is really head to describe how good this film was.

This movie is about life, love and friendship told in the most magical of way. A story of a son tries to reconcile with his dying father by trying to retrieve the stories that his father used to talk about himself and his unbelievable adventure.

I must admit at first I have doubt if I'm going to see this or not since it seem pretty dreadful and also there not much of anything show or word of mouth saying much about this film. Three years later I finally got to see it, I feel like I was wasting all those times not getting to know how brilliant this film was.

This film is great in everyway from the very second the film start to the very last second the film end. It will fill you with lots of emotion, dream, mythical adventure, and an art of storytelling. I must praise screenwriter John August to be able to bring all that into the screenplay making this one of those rare screenplay that surpass its novel.

Another thing that really standout is the cast of the entire brilliant actor, Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney was so believable that they will make you cry. And Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange is so look-alike and they are so good. And it is great to see Helena Bonham Carter with a blonde hair. That make up is great and the costume is beautiful. And what best is the acting that is very believable and very emotional that they will make you cry and feel for each and every character.

What another point that I like about the film is the fact that this is unlike anything that Tim has done before but somehow he still able to make it his own. The magnificent set, the style of the film and mood are very much his own. Maybe also it has something to do with the great score that add lots of mood to the movie.

The movie consists of great number of metaphor, which is another thing that I like about this movie. There is a meaning to everything and it has been written beautifully and directed brilliantly. This is a truly a must own movie.

Recommendation: Yes, Worth Every Penny To Buy DVD.

Reason To Watch: Imaginative, Brilliant Writing, Great Directing and Acting.

Reason Not To: You'll Left Wonder How The Hell This Didn't Get Any Oscar For It.

Rating: 10/10 (Grade: A+).

Please Rate After Read Y/N, Thanks.",10
27 December 2006,Big Fishes make Life Beautiful,"If you ever met a single person whom u dint like for the tall stories he told, just think again. He has just given you a wonderful moment that you could cherish for your entire life. For he has made a dull moment brighter and colorful. The movie is simple yet fantastic in its content and delivery. The many relations in a family has been showcased well. The relation between the father and the son stands out sheerly because of the depth of the characterization. If you want to be taken into a roller coaster ride of Passion, Love, Adventure, Friendship, Fantasy and Relation, then go buy a ticket for yourself in the ride. Else you know what you would miss if you hadn't been to a roller coaster ride earlier.

10 January 2004,"Boring, and half the time, unwatchable","There are too many problems with the film. First, Albert Finney with Jessica Lange? Give me a break. That's as bad as the current Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton matchup. No it's worse. Albert Finney has always been as unattractive as a curmudgeon, and the years haven't changed that. I thought his character was obnoxious, whether played by him or Ewan McGregor. I could care less about him.

While this movie has a few neat visuals and strong performances, (who are the Siamese Twins?) and great work by Danny Devito and Robert Guillaume. They were all wonderful. Here's to Billy Crudup too.

The story was so boring, and the main character so uninteresting, and suffering through seeing Albert Finney's mug all over Jessica's, yuck. Can't Hollywood make appropriate matches? It's so unappealing to me. I'm am very disappointed in this film. I won't see it again.",6
8 January 2022,Beautifully weird,"A beautifully weird film. The cinematography is vivid, the storyline unique, and the acting superb. The characters are well cast and have depth. The plot jumps around a bit, and definitely has a few weird moments, but the ending is beautiful.

24 July 2006,Style and substance make this a worthwhile adventure,"Whimsical.

Offbeat.

Gripping.

An epic adventure.

Big Fish is one of Tim Burton's more colorful films. It moves away from his typically dark Gothic undertones and into whimsical fairytale land with giants, witches, Siamese twins, hidden cities, mermaids, sirens and werewolves, coating the film in a rich fantasy glaze, but it keeps its storyline grounded and simple throughout: it chronicles the life of Edgar Bloom (Albert Finney; Ewan McGregor) as he, on his deathbed, retells his experiences and stories for his son to mend their broken relationship.

This is one of the most beautiful, elegantly-crafted visual films I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. Yet it is evident that Burton does not neglect other aspects of film-making by focusing too much on stylistic devices. He is, first and foremost, a storyteller and never lets visuals alone carry a tale; the visuals facilitate the story, and not the other way around. This is seen by the strong performances by the cast, and in particular, Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney who both portray the lead of Ed Bloom at different periods in his life. They help carry the story, as do the unusual humour and the magical score by Danny Elfman.

Toward the end of Big Fish, I realised how smitten I had become with all the quirky characters, the central father-and-son relationship and the overdose of style that Burton presents--to the extent that I was sad when the film ended even though the conclusion was very satisfying. The film most probably has a few flaws (there were some segments that felt too long) and if you don't like strange or whimsical, then Big Fish isn't for you.

Lastly, anyone who likens this offbeat gem to the studio schmaltz that is Forrest Gump should be shot in the knees.

10 May 2004,It just doesn't live up to the hype.,"I had heard nothing but glowing praise for this movie, but I found it to be only slightly entertaining. After reading through some of the other IMDB comments, I'm relieved to see that I'm not the only one who thought so.

The exaggerated stories and special effects did little for me. Even the ending was somewhat predictable. A good cast was put together to make the movie, but there wasn't any outstanding acting. I don't think there was enough of a story line or truly memorable characters for anyone to stand out.

I did like much of the soundtrack, which of course contains lots of hit songs from the 50s and 60s, like so many other movies I've seen before.

There's really nothing special about this movie. I gave it a 6 out of 10. I was considering a 7, but it's really not that good.",6
15 May 2012,The beautiful Southern Belle in Burton's entourage of films,"Tim Burton in recent years has dwelled into a very familiar look, a familiar style, and to an extent a familiar cast of actors and actresses that continuously follow the man's career. But in the midst of this consistent approach to directing films in the past decade is a movie so magical, so majestic and so unlike Burton you can hardly believe it was him behind the camera. That's because Big Fish is the most emotionally-driven tale he's ever done, and this requires quite a different tactic. Big Fish is his Schindler's List, a movie that emotionally touches home to not only the viewer but to the director making it.

Big Fish is about a wrecked father-son relationship that tries to heal before the father passes away. But the father continues to reveal himself through tall tale stories that blend tons of fiction with plenty of reality—although the son is determined to figure out the truth behind all the life stories. Based on a late 90s novel by Daniel Wallace, this movie follows the life of the father (and all his crazy moments) leading up to the present with him inches from death.

Argue what you will about Burton's look, his selection of actors has always been superb and it's no different here. From the young Billy Crudup and Ewan McGregor running the show to great smaller performances by Jessica Lange, Helena Bothman Carter and Albert Finney we have ourselves a great cast representing a great group of characters we can easily grow to love and associate with.

While Burton has divulged into the typical dark Gothic look with dark gloomy backgrounds and dark gloomy material, Big Fish's Southern Gothic roots demanded a different look. And this is where Burton excels in more ways than one. The visual effects blended with the story quite well, the imagery was a beautiful mix of warm, dark, and downright colorful, and the cinematography made Alabama shine beautifully in ways that not even Forrest Gump could achieve.

Beautiful is the best way to describe Big Fish; from the writing to the acting to the overall look and feel. It tackled the father-son dynamic extremely well, flowed peacefully without ever feeling boring, and kept your interests and emotional investments nice and high up until the very end.

While overall this will never go down as his most popular or more iconic movie, I can and will safely say that this is one of his best films and easily his best directing performance he's ever going to deliver.

And unless he can learn to expand his directing horizons, this will remain true.",9
30 November 2020,A poor man's Forrest Gump,"Aside from some nice Tim Burton touches, Big Fish feels very derivative and it is difficult to reconcile the younger and older versions of the main character.

3 September 2018,Classic,"For me personally it is one of the greatest movies off all time. I never get tired of watching this having seen it multiple times. A beautiful story with an amazing cast of actors and actresses. Love the narration and the fantasy element of the movie keeps it always interesting. It reminds me a little of Forrest Gump another classic in some ways. Ewan Mcgregor best movie performance also for me. Without him I dont think the movie would have been the same. Pure genius. A true classic.

6 January 2006,Better than expected,"Watched this somewhat reluctantly with wifey. Beforehand thought it looked a bit wish-washy, plus I'm not a huge Tim Burton fan. Glad i saw it.

The story focuses on Ed Bloom (played by Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney). Ed, according to his stories, has lived an amazing, basically unbelievable life. In his travels he tells stories of giants he has befriended, finding a magical town, joining the circus to met his wife and so on. His son decides one day to start searching for the truth- are all his stories tall tales, is their some truth amongst them, or are they all as told? The movie unfolds really well, McGregor and Finney both do a great job. To my surprise it held my interest, and at stages amazed with the excellent cinematography. Worth seeing. My friend Gary won't like though.

Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom.

1 June 2014,"There are plenty more films in the sea - I mean, cinema","And the moral of Big Fish is well, what is it actually? That you should lie to your kids as often as possible because that will eventually make them like you? That you should raise your kids to be one of those morons in primary school that have got some relative doing that for every damned story there is? That you'll one day transform into the bloke you're pretending to be in all of your lies if you just tell them often enough? The answer remains unclear in this peculiar Tim Burton film – or, as specialists on Tim Burton films would say, in this Tim Burton film.

The audience experiences the father and son story through the eyes of the son (a character about as nuanced as the defecating elephant that also stars in the film) who visits his moribund old man after not having talked to him for three years. Upon this foundation, Burton and screenwriter John August create myriads of fairy-tale flashbacks, seemingly taking Forrest Gump as an inspiration, but never explain why all of this should be told to begin with – if not for some lads in the visual effects department amusing themselves by designing all sorts of unreal creatures and objects. The story is almost entirely void of emotions while most of the life lessons spouted by the father consist of him not being your usual fellow and that one can achieve quite a bit if mythical things happen in your life.

I'm not expecting every children's film to exhibit a life lesson or have a specified purpose for existing, seeing as two hours purely dedicated on entertaining can produce a wonderful time for cinema-goers. However, Tim Burton strikes me as being more driven to entertain himself than the people watching his films – something that isn't inherently counterproductive for his work, but gives it a sense of being rich on the outside and empty on the inside all too often. Big Fish thoroughly matches that description, boasting elaborate designs and colours for various locations and creatures, captured in beautiful cinematography, yet quickly loses this appeal, as there isn't any more added to it. To be fair, the romance at the centre of it is lovely to watch and the story arc in the town of Spectre a highly amusing one. But even if all little branches that come sprawling from the film's premise were that enjoyable and assembled more coherently, I'd remain underwhelmed by its premise.

Introducing a fully new plot point on a five minute basis, Big Fish is quite the antithesis of a dull film and shows the occasional potential of becoming a remarkable film for young and old. However, it turns out to be for neither of them: too frightening and violent for one, too absurd for the other.",

9 July 2007,"In the bottom line, anyone who's ever lost a parent would automatically relate to the sentimental and ever so touching nature of Burton's Big Fish","Big Fish is director Tim Burton's most mature film to date, taking his regular fantasy elements and vivid imagination, and planting them in an adult environment, where they can be both visually entertaining and emotional shattering. And yes, the film is that good.

The story revolves around Ed Bloom (Albert Finney), a dying father who receives a surprise visit from his estranges son, Will (Billy Crudrup) while on his death bed. Ed has the tendency of telling tales of his past, most filled up with imaginative figures and mythical places. Will speaks with his father and asks him to retell the story of his life (a major part of the film is told in flashbacks, where the marvelous Ewan McGregor of Star Wars and Trainspotting fame portrays the young Ed). While listening to his father's gripping autobiography, Will tries his best to overcome his overlong cynicism and doubt towards the tales, and try his best to separate fact from fiction  a task he finds particularly hard to accomplish.

In the bottom line, anyone who's ever lost a parent (unfortunately, I lost both) would automatically relate to the sentimental and ever so touching nature of Burton's Big Fish. The film is a moral tale that teaches us the importance of family and nostalgia, and emphasizes the sad truth that sometimes we really get to appreciate and understand what we have when it's too late. When the movie ended, and the credits started to roll, I really wished I would've known my own father better (he passed away when I was 9 years old).

Honestly, why this film didn't race for the big Academy Awards of 2004 (for 2003 releases) is way beyond me, since this is purely one of the more complex and layered dramas of the 2000's.",10

I watch this movie at least once a year, and it just gets better and better! This is a movie you watch with the family At Thanksgiving, Christmas, after a funeral (yeah, after a funeral). This movie is about the relationship between children and their parents; and, when children realize their parents are fallible. This is a fine, dialed in, movie, make it a part of your life.

16 July 2004,Fairytale Journey,"This movie is best described as the journey of a man's life with a fairytale portrayal. It chronicles Edward Bloom's sugar-coated life events that initially made for good stories and later defined his character. His son wishes to discover ""who"" his father really was, not just some made-up story. But in the end, it is revealed that sometimes holding on to harmless fantasies in life, like a child's belief in the toothfairy, is not so bad after all.

And this movie felt like something out of a children's book, perhaps Gulliver's Travels. The adventures you are taken on alternate with farcical themes intermingled with semi-serious ones. And this ""replay"" of Edward Bloom's life seems at times better suited for children. While still enjoyable by adults, it should not be assumed to be too much more than its ""Jack and The Beanstalk"" type story.

12 May 2019,The bright side of Tim Burton,"Being so far from Tim Burton's usual style, it exceeds expectations. It is artistically and thematically beautiful. The way each character is portrayed and the environments that they interact with are so nuanced. It merges fantasy great with reality, containing lighting that allows the audience to easily distinguish between the two. The story revolves around love. It focuses on life, then onto love as you'd see in a romance, only to finish with an incredibly touching relationship between father and son. It is hard to explain what makes this movie so great, but you really do feel good watching it. (full of metaphor).

11 January 2004,Not Good - poor man's version of Forrest Gump,"Some SPIOLERS................... The main problem I had with the movie is Bloom's stories never really did it for me. A couple of chapters in his life were interesting - I liked his circus experiences and the story of the love of his life. But other than that, despite the fact that Edward was a charming man with a wonderful outlook on life, his stories were just not inspiring enough to generate any sort of emotion. His journey with the giant? The witch? The bank robbery? His days as a salesman? I kept waiting for the stories to actually go somewhere but they really never did.

5 September 2014,Sometimes we try too hard...,"That was a lovely surprise. Another film on my Watchlist that I eventually got round to watching on a lazy day, not expecting much, but expecting something. But not what I got.

I guess I wasn't expecting the fantastical element - the flashbacks to a past life full of carefree and wondrous adventures. On the other hand, being directed by Tim Burton and with a cast including Danny Devito, Steve Buscemi, Albert Finney and Helena Bonham Carter, what else was there to expect? A straight story told my an old man to his straight son, in a straight up-an-down past? Hardly at all.

A well put together story in the vein of Forrest Gump - not quite at that epic level, but still a fascinating and endearing narrative, calmly told and full of hope.

There was nothing cheesy or overly exaggerated about a film which, in reality, is just a fabricated tale of events. Think about the Chinese twins at the end. Did you expect them to be joined at the hip, or not? I have no idea how much is true, exaggerated or completely fabricated. But I don't have a problem with any of that.

Is there an underlying message to this story? Will I be thinking about it in starts and fits in two or three days time? Probably not, but it's still a lovely film.",8
27 August 2004,"""Big Fish"" is a fantasy par excellence!","""Big Fish"" is a delightful fantasy. It is well delivered by the director, Tim Burton. The screenplay by John August is a perfect fit to the silver screen. Albert Finney plays senior Ed Bloom, a story teller who pores his heart into his never ending stories to his son, Will. Billy Crudup, Will Bloom, is perfect in his underplay of the son searching for a portion of communication with his estranged father. He has not spoken to his dad in several years, and he searches for a line of communication through the adventures that he recalls as childhood fairy tales. Robert Guillaume plays the family's doctor taking care of the dying father with a gentle and understanding hand. He gives a very comforting performance. Mathew McGrory plays Karl the Giant, and the camera angles are very convincing in solidifying his character. All moviegoers with a sense of imagination should see this movie. It is a compelling, warmhearted film. It is truly a fantasy, par excellence. Put it on your must see list. A box of Kleenex may not be a bad idea.

24 July 2006,Excessively sentimental,"First, I've got to say Tim Burton movies are always visually great to look at, and this is no exception. Unfortunately, the visuals are about the only good thing going for this movie. It feels like it tries too hard to be sentimental and forgets to actually make a good story that's interesting. The stories where just plain boring and didn't seem to have any point other than just to flaunt his visual style and to appeal to the most sentimental of viewers. And this movie wears on you; the longer it goes on, the more it becomes unbearable to watch, which makes the 2 hour runtime seem like an eternity.

I guess people that like their movies mawkish would like this one (which by looking at the IMDb rating it appears that there are a lot of people like that), but I'm not one of them. I expected more from Burton.

The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

12 December 2003,This Fish Flounders Without The Hook,"When I heard that director Tim Burton (Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Planet of the Apes, Sleepy Hollow) directed this tale, I assumed that an extraordinary saga would unfold on the screen as something unnatural and weird, yet entertaining. Weird it was, yet it often failed to convey a story. Rather it made some attempts at reconciling Edward Bloom's (Albert Finney as the dying old Bloom and Ewan McGregor as young Bloom) tall yarns he would tell repeatedly to anyone who would listen and especially to his son Will Bloom (Billy Crudup). Will soon learned to disbelieve all of his father's fantastic stories and ultimately became totally estranged from his father, whether as a result of shame or the lack of intimacy and connection with his father. His mother, the ever-smiling Sandy Bloom (Jessica Lange), lends little of her stellar talents to this wooden role.

The fables as they unfold are truly implausible and often border on the ridiculous. Clearly, one is left with the same mindset as the son Will, that Edward is a huge bulls***ter who may have trouble separating fact from fantasy. The story or stories are told in confusing flashbacks, sometimes in a true Tim Burton fantasy and sometimes in what appears to be a vaudeville style. The characters are indeed colorful and weird such as the ringmaster of the Circus Amos (Danny DeVito) and the Colossus (George McArthur). It borrows heavily in fantasy style from other recent fantasies like the Truman Show, Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings, yet does not come close to telling a story with clarity and style.

The film jumps from clarity to confusion and back to rationality and clarity. We are touched that the son ultimately appears at his dying father's bedside and attempts to find out who his father really is. There are many seeing the picture who will be quite taken by its symbolism, fantasy, and fatherly machinations. For myself, this film could have been written in a much more coherent manner and revealing much, much more of the possible intimacy that can exist between father and son. The comedic routines are quite funny and Burton seems to have the timing down quite well. However, its humorous sequences are not enough to carry the film or to carry the story from scene-to-scene.

The ending is predictable early in the film and clichéd at best. Helena Bonham Carter's talents are wasted as Jenny, the child becoming adult who had her eyes on Edward since he was a young man. She also plays a more interesting role as a witch in this flick, but it also falls flat and gets placed on the shelf with the rest of the cast that have not been adequately developed. This is a picture that you will either love or simple discard as too much weirdness and lacking coherence. Obviously, you know where I stand.

5 June 2023,Lighthearted with a Complex Message,"If you are looking for a film that combines the innocence and charm of a children's movie with a thought-provoking narrative, look no further. This movie offers a delightful blend of adventure and romance, and as a dedicated fan of Ewan McGregor, I thoroughly enjoyed his performance. However, it must be noted that the film lacks a certain memorability factor. It doesn't possess any exceptional qualities that would make me recommend it to infrequent movie watchers. Nonetheless, I can envision this movie evoking a strong sense of nostalgia for those who encounter it during their youth (which I did not).

31 December 2003,GREAT but not up to par with other Burton films in my opinion...,"In Big Fish, Tim Burton deals with actors more than he has in any other movie. There is more dialogue between actors, and there is also a voiceover, placing more emphasis on human beings than Tim Burton's imaginative creations that we've seen in his other films. That being said, Burton fans will not be hugely disappointed. Burton's imagination does indeed color this movie to make it even better than Daniel August's novel. He makes a giant look like the size he is in the story (unlike Lord of the Rings' failure to make the hobbits look small enough at times) and employs stunning cinematography (that's more the director of photography but obviously Burton was working closely with him). The freaky living beings and odd situations common to this film as well, giants and circuses and siamese twins and a land like eden with delicious apple pie. Where in other Burton films the dialogue seems unresolved and out of nowhere at times, this time when that happens it makes sense because the movie is just myths and the story of people trying to make sense of the myths. Danny Elfman wrote another wonderful score, the movie has a great feel, and impeccable acting (Ewan Macgregor, Helena Bonhman Carter, Jessica Lange, Steve Buscemi, and Albert Finney all did wonderful jobs) Unlike other Burton movies, this one is not gothic or pulp at all. It's brighter, but it maintains the signature Burton darkness, and it's a good family movie. Like some Burton movies, it's also a bit moralistic, which is not always my personal preference. But I definitely recommend this one to everyone. Check it out.",6
12 May 2004,"Big Fish, small movie","Watching a movie like 'Big Fish' I realized I am sick of 'fantasy'. I am sick and tired of watching so false and artificial stories. So overwhelmingly decorated that they seem birthday cakes: look good, taste bad. The minor lies beneath this movie are nothing in comparison with the major lies. Black doctors delivering white babies? Black kids in white churches? In the '40? In Alabama? These are just little examples of 'real fantasy', if you excuse the oxymoron. The political correctness is the main lie, by no means the only one: Britons speaking like southerners? 33 years old guys acting as teenagers? Etc. This fantasy, decorated with corny FXs and clichés, does not deserve its fame as a great movie. It's just a medium entertainment if you don't have anything else to do. Certainly, Tim Burton improved his performance in comparison with the abominable 'Planet of Apes' but he is still very far from his best shape ('Ed Wood', 'Batman', 'Sleepy Hollow'). 5/10.

25 December 2003,"A pleasant, but meaningless film","BIG FISH is not one of Tim Burton's best films, but it put a smile on my face for two hours, and for that, I'm grateful. Albert Finney and Billy Crudup give very good performances as a father and son who do not understand each other. Ewan McGregor is also good as Finney's younger self who goes on fantastic adventures. The cinematography was absolutely gorgeous. The special effects and make up were also fantastic.

The problem with the film is that nothing ever really happens. No lessons are learned and it was all just a fantasy. Nothing is ever at stake. Tim Burton is a master filmmaker who no doubt will continue making great films, but this is not one of them. Its a good film, but not as good as it could be.

If you want to find a great film with fantastic visual effects, I would suggest WHAT DREAMS MAY COME. More is at stake in that film.

28 April 2007,Simple salesman's simple story,"The man from little town, goes to search for his bright future and joins the circus where he spends some time working meanwhile finding the girl who he will love all of his life...

Then comes the war and man responds to the call of Uncle Sam. After some time he returns and starts the career of salesman, travels around the country and making some fortune. He have a boy and sweet house.

As in every man's life, there is another woman in his life too but only his wife is the one who keeps his heart.

Now, this is the story, simple story of a simple man, and there is nothing extraordinary in it, but... but only if it is told by me. If Edward Bloom (the main character of the movie), is the man who tells the story... the story of his life, then this simple story have a chance to become most magnificent, most wonderful and amazing adventure and fairytale that you heard in your life.

And do you care that the science never will accept the existence of mermaids or werewolves? Who cares that there can't be witches who has ""magical eye"" where you can see your future death? Do you really need to stop Edward when he tells you the heroic war story with Siamese twin singer or spy, or singer-spy or whatever (whoever) in it? Or do you need to stop him when he introduces to you the most talented poet who writes 3-line poem for last 12 years, then tries to rob the bank and finally becomes oil millionaire?

No, no no and no... because I didn't cared, and you won't care. You will buy it. You will buy each and every word that Edward says. Because it is true. His lies are true as much as any other true I heard in my life.

So what are you waiting to? Don't miss the chance to catch an uncatchable, big fish.",10

15 June 2004,Schmaltz sells,"Schmaltz - it's a Yiddish word for gushy sentiment, for the use of cloying and manipulative emotionalism. I thought that this movie was a perfect representation of Hollywood Schmaltz.

A lot of people love this movie. There's an understandable yearning for stories, for fantasy. But I thought that these stories, these fantasies, were trite and predictable. (Especially the ending.) It was also a little disturbing to me the way that the film whitewashes (literally) the history of Alabama, making it seem like some paradise of ideal race relations. Notice how the ""fantasy"" scenes set in the protagonist's past are completely free of any tinge of racism, and that aside from a single Black boy, there are no African-Americans to be seen at all. And ""Big Fish"" was filmed in and around Montgomery Alabama, where ML King preached and Rosa Parks boycotted. It's so much easier to construct false images of the past than to remember what it is was really like.

When the past is too uncomfortable to remember, it is often distorted and made to be the subject of fantasy. But just because amnesia is popular doesn't mean that is healthy.",5
26 March 2006,Simply awful,"The worst Tim Burton movie I have ever seen, sure many people say, ""Don't insult this movie---if you do I'll slit yer little throat!"" Because they say it's a beautiful movie; and it is...only it became something that sucked. FIRST of all what the hell is with its' Southern-drama thing? It's stupid and way to redneck. Second of all, the ending is bizarre, and I like bizarre but this was terrible because you can be disturbing and bizarre (which Tim Burton is) and good, but you could also be the opposite. Thirdly, this film was way too positive, bright and happy---holy crap! Has Tim Burton gone mad? This isn't his style, it's GREAT to try something different but he took it WAY to extreme. There is even one line that says, ""I consider myself a social person..."" WTF!!! WTF indeed... Tim Burton did this crap and then he did his worst film up-to-date CHARLIE AND THE Chocolate FACTORY. This film just sucked, which is sad because it could have been very good. And I mean VERY good 1(1/2) out of 10

Of course some neat ideas did save this movie from getting lower grades... and its too sugary too. Go watch something better.

3 April 2004,Burton at his muddled worst,"This movie is an unsalvageable wreck. The acting is wretched with apologies to Bonham Carter and Cotillard who do not belong within a hundred and fifty miles. Burton seems confused as to which of the 4 or 5 different movies he wanted to make. None of them is fully realized. There is the sappy fun-for-the-whole-family melodrama that has infected his recent work. There is the 'trademark' weirdness that he has failed to develop significantly since Scissorhands. It just seems recycled and out of place here (Burton himself absolutely pillages Peewee's Big Adventure, which by the way, is a far superior film). There is a contrived story between father and son which leaves me with the impression that Burton not only never had a father but has never seen a father and a son interact in the same room. And there are at least three moments, horribly short, where one sees what the film could have been. That is the most infuriating part. The most disappointing film I've seen this year. 2/10 stars

23 January 2008,A heart-warming and thoughtful delight,"This was the third time I'd seen this film and finally it hit home. A moving, funny and visually spectacular treat that has one of the most poignant and upbeat endings I can remember. As a Tim Burton film there is a certain anticipation, and I think this can be a problem...there is no Johnny Depp and it's not particularly Gothic so you have to readjust to what it actually is, an emotional and thoughtful piece dealing with the reality, and unreality, of death. That's why it took me a couple of viewings.

Wonderfully wrapped in an Elfman score, the story is a meander through the tall-tales of a dying man and his son's attempt to reconcile truth from fiction when understanding his Dad. There is a tenderness and warmth here that gives this film a wonderful depth. There is also great humour, splendidly presented by the excellent acting and script. Visually stunning throughout, this is a real treat that deserves to be given time to grow on you.

Bottom line....a heart-warming and thoughtful delight.",8
27 May 2005,"You can count on Tim Burton to tell you a ""tall tale.""","How many of us have met someone who always tells us ""tall tales?"" Are they true stories or are they mostly exaggerated? As you watch this film your mind may well be asking that question: Is Albert Finney's life as Ed Bloom, a mere figment of his imagination or did he actually live all those ""adventures."" Such is the theme of this fine Tim Burton film from 2003.

What I like about Tim Burton's films is that I can NOT ""second guess"" the story as it progresses. That keeps to a surprise what's coming around the corner in the next five minutes as the scenes progress.

The film is well served by the acting talents of Albert Finney, Ewan McGregor, and Billy Crudup in the two main character roles with Ewan McGregor playing the young man Ed Bloom and Albert Finney playing the senior Ed Bloom.

Another delightful surprise is how Tim Burton casts some well known actors to play small but significant supporting roles. I would say that these well known faces had no more than 15 minutes of screen time throughout the film but they were instrumental to the total performance: Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter (Tim's main love in real life), Robert Guillaume, and Danny DeVito. If you have watched HBO's ""The Sopranos"" then you will also enjoy Steve Buscemi's (Tony Soprano's cousin Tony Blundetto) performance as Norther Winslow (although he has been in 89 films since 1984!). Identical twins, Ada Tai and Arlene Tai are uniquely cast in the scene as entertainers of the Chinese Army! See how Buton uses these twins in the story!

Am I hearing the same ""twinkle"" music in the background like I heard in ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas?"" Effective in creating the almost fairy tale image.

I'm not going to tell about this film, scene for scene, nor offer insight into how it ends. Rather, you need to tune your cable box to when this feature will be shown in your area or check the local video store.

It's all about the ""process"" of story telling.

""Once upon a time, there was this man who dreamed he was really a fish....a fish out of water!""",9
6 February 2004,It's a wonderful lie,"Judging by most comments submitted to this forum, this film has become an all time favorite. Coming from Tim Burton, however, the movie doesn't measure to some of his best films at all.

Edward Bloom is a dreamer, a quality he thought he would pass to his son, only to find out that it only causes embarrassment in the young man, who has to go through life listening to the same stories over and over again. Where did Edward Bloom go wrong? That point is never clearly explored by anyone connected to this fantasy. Was it all in Edward's head, or was it real? Well, let the viewer follow the clues and let him arrive at his own conclusion to see if this Walter Mitty of a man really lived the lies his son Will seems to believe he is telling, or did he actually encountered all these adventures in the process of growing up.

The triumph of the film is the casting. Young Edward, played by Ewan McGregor, suddenly transforms himself into Albert Finney, the older Edward. The same can be said of Alison Lohman turning into Jessica Lange. This was a most felicitous event because in most occasions actors playing a younger character don't bear any resemblance of the actor who plays the older version. In this movie this process seems seamless, as far as how uncanny both McGregor and Lohman might look like Finney and Lange at a later stage of their lives.

Since the film is basically about Edward, his wife, Sandra, has very little to do in it. Jessica Lange is totally wasted, or Alison Lohman, for that matter. One would have liked to have seen them more on screen. Billy Crudup, as Will, is fine. Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor are very good playing Edward.",7
2 May 2004,"brutal to watch, boring, unamazed with stories","Man, I found this movie very brutal to watch. Some of the scenes dragged on forever and I was more annoyed with the old guy's stories than his son was. I don't know if I would have kept watching it if I was watching alone. I wasn't amazed by anything that happened. I suppose if I had experienced what Edward Bloom experienced I would be amazed, but this movie fails to amaze me with its stories. I actually did turn it off before it was over, when his son was doing the monologue at the end and fish jumped out of the water I couldn't stand it anymore I frantically searched for the remote controller and pressed the stop button like ten times. It was so goody good teeheee twoshoes I couldn't stand it. I give it a 3/10.

4 November 2006,"A real ""Big-fish' can","If the movie is an art form that deliver the personal interpretation of the world what the artist see and feel. Tim Burton's world is exaggerated in darkness and sadness of a boy who is rejected from the world, so he creates his own world in darkest colors from a crayon box he has. Thus the movie is full of those wonderful dark colors such as charcoal black, dark blue and purplish Grey. All the characters are rejected from the society or rather intentionally ejected themselves and lives in an alienated world of their own, full of mysterious characters with those tortured dreams.

This movie isn't too far away from his previous creations but it shift little. The movie is full of colors, warmer and brighter. The camera moves faster. I assume that that's how the director's view is heading, almost dreaming and also forgiving.

The movie is totally a 'make-believe' itself, by the end of movie, you are starting to wish, to see if the 'big-fish' is real, still swimming around in the pool. Even if you know you are deceiving, you left in charm. If the cinema is fake as same as the 'big-fish', this is real cinema that makes the cinema 'real'. Make the movie as a genuine 'Big-Fish', so you feel like criticizing nothing at all when finally the ending credits rolls.

Helena-Bornham Carter's almost perfect New Jersey accent, also, Ewan Mcgregor's not-so-perfect New Jersey accent is also another 2 'Big-Fish' in the movie, we are all here to believe (so we forgive).

Albert Finney was always great, as I see him as an American answer to Britain's Sir Anthony Hopkins.

How wonderful to see a movie is so different from others that are full of 'Freud-sque' oppression of sexual desires,tortured dreams and weighed pressure (name the Kubrick). A one's life could be dark and also full of sinful mistakes from a viewpoint of psycho analysis's. This movie will open your hardest heart and will leave you to dream, once more. The Tim Burton's best movie yet, where the real people with a ""big-fish' in a same can.",10
22 March 2005,Another Tim Burton fairytale.,"Yet another fairytale from one of my personal favorite directors. Tim Burton's typical atmosphere and characters make this movie an unique one.

Still I can't help it to be somewhat disappointed. The movie was not quite what I had expected and hoped for. Judging from the trailer I seriously thought this could be my favorite movie of all time, it had all the right ingredients to become so. Maybe I expected a bit too much of an ""Forrest Gump"" in fantasy land.

But really, ""Big Fish"" still is a treat of a movie. The visual look of it is typically Tim Burton style and I absolutely love it. There also was some wonderful humor present which make this movie mainly fun and entertaining to watch even though there also is enough room for some drama.

Thing I really missed in this movie was the presence of Johnny Depp. Burton + Depp is always fireworks and I really think that it could have lifted the movie even more, not that Ewan McGregor is a bad actor of course. Oh well, at least we still get to see Danny DeVito's naked behind instead...Albert Finney really was excellent in this and Billy Crudup also was surprising good.

The characters are probably what makes this movie work. The fairytale like characters and storyline's are truly stimulating for the fantasy.

I'm really surprised with the high rating it receives here, not that it doesn't deserve so but because I felt that not everybody would be able to connect and relate with the weird and unusual visual style and story of the movie. Guess I was wrong and I'm glad so! Apparently ""Big Fish"" is perfectly watchable for a wide range of people

19 October 2020,Touching and playful,"""The truth is, I didn't see anything of myself in my father. And I don't think he saw anything of himself in me. We were like strangers who knew each other very well.""

For those who've had a difficult relationship with a parent, this film might be especially touching. Perhaps it asks whether a son can truly know his father, and what the sum total of one's memories (or their embellishment) mean when life is finite, and they die when we do. To try to connect with one's father at the end of his life, to make peace, and to better understand his life, particularly with the perspective shift that comes from being on the cusp of fatherhood oneself - there's something profound in this.

While telling these tall tales from his life, where he has fantastical adventures and is always the hero, perhaps the father substitutes the life he wish he'd led for his own, which in some way gives his son a model to follow both morally and creatively. We are here, we lead a humdrum life, we die - how much nicer is it to jazz up the meaningless of it all with stories? The wonderful line ""A man tells his stories so many times that he becomes the stories. They live on after him, and in that way he becomes immortal"" can be devastating if you think of the stories of loved ones who have passed away in your own life.

The film is playful and fun because while we're given what amounts to a deathbed in the present, we're also given wild, unpredictable tales in the flashbacks to the past, which are filled with romance, adventure, and comedy. While the film can get a little sentimental and cheesy at times, the emotional range is broad, and there are some truly sweet moments, like the field of daffodils the father presents his wife-to-be in courtship. You have to also love the attempts at poetry from Steve Buscemi's character. It might have worked even better had the overall tone been shifted a teeny bit darker, but the poignant, uplifting ending is perfect.",8
4 October 2018,Quick Review,"""Big Fish"" has a great twenty minutes finale that will melt your heart and will make you ugly cry. But also, it has a weak script for its 2/3 that could easily confuse any viewer that isn't paying attention very closely to the Picture!

Overall, I recommend for every fan of Burton's work or for those who want to see a cute family movie!

28 June 2004,A Surprisingly Moving Film,"I really didn't expect to like this film very much, because I don't consider Tim Burton to be the type of director who could handle a film about humanity. I also suspected the film might get sappy and sentimental, but he manages to stay clear of this.

The film takes about ten minutes to establish itself, but once the tone is set it will hold your interest for the full two hours. This despite the lack of tired Hollywood action sequences.

Billy Crudup hits all the right notes as a son who realizes he never really knew his father in any real sense. I've never seen one single frame of Crudup on film that did not ring true, and this is no exception.

Overall a movie worth seeing.

Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

8 February 2004,"Big, SLUGGISH, Impaired Fish","A summary which is meant to be the precise opposite of this film: short and painless.

The movie is a monolithic bore (yawn, yawn, triple yawn...) Mostly because of this, somewhat due to phony-sounding southern accents along with excessive narration and lethargic editing, the lead actors are neither engaging nor believable. Some nifty set decorations (but oh the drudgery one has to sit through between eye-popping scenes), and a great turn by Danny DeVito, and not much else. Snooze at home and skip this overwrought slug of a flick.

19 August 2004,Narrative Threads,"Tim Burton weaves a present story with a narrated past story, which interweaves truth and fiction. The past thread is involving and entertaining. At least four narrators will have told it by the end. Burton usually succeeds with fantastical stories. His presentation often aggrandized by salient photography; so, here, the high-key lighting is nostalgia of old movies. Ewan McGregor masters the lead--threading the nostalgia, offbeat humor and aging, as he must relate somewhat to the Ed Bloom in the present thread. Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito and Alison Lohman help. Alberty Finney and Billy Crudup don't, though. Yet, Burton is who completely fails to make the present story interesting in any way. Even the low-key lighting is boring. It's like a TV-movie sort of reality. The inevitable reconciliation wasn't worth my time, only the past narrative was.

2 September 2006,not classic but...,"Initially I wasn't enjoying this film; the characters I was meant to like I didn't, and the characters I was meant to dislike I liked (poor old Don Price, what did he ever do?). But this changed as the tall tales progressed. To be sure, there's nothing surprising about the direction it heads in and the conclusions it reaches; you always know that eventually all participants will agree that if the legend is more exciting than the truth then print the legend. But there's something in the telling that makes the trip enjoyable, and like any tall tale this one may just improve with a few more retellings. This is a film about a man whose recollections of possibly dull encounters become taller and taller with each telling. I have a friend like that.

3 October 2004,"Overly manipulative, poorly written, but PRETTY. Not Burton's best.","Burton has always been a stylist, and his stories tend to work when the style emphasizes/benefits the story. Ed Wood, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, even Scissorhands all work with his perhaps overly designed baroque films.

Sleepy Hollow, Planet of the Apes, and this film are not very well written - the stories are clearly on the back burner to the set-pieces, and his favored casting of HBC in some quirky turn. Big Fish has a potentially very affecting story here - the story of a son trying to understand his father, almost when it's too late, to try to find the ""truth"" in the lies, and maybe embrace the ""love of life"" those lies may represent.

But that story is not effectively TOLD here - Burton is more concerned with giants, shoes on a line, Elfman musical interludes, Danny DeVito in weird make-up, set design. People love Burton's ""quirky"" touches, but quirky touches do not a good film make. Bad casting (McGregor, as good as he is, does not convince as Finney's young self) doesn't help. Finney COULD have gotten an Oscar nomination if he had been directed properly here, but is wasted in a role that should have been his for the taking. The movie, incredibly, doesn't seem interested in his story, or his son's quest.

Much potential, frittered on a soft-headed, overly- and transparently manipulative film that is under-written and poorly executed. Big Fish is beneath Burton's talents, when he's firing on all cylinders.

As an earlier poster says, too many clichés and ""Disney""-esque b.s. in this film that is handed to us rather half-assed-ly only makes it seem like a cynical attempt for Burton to have a big and popular hit.

I didn't love Mars Attacks, but at least it seemed more heart-felt.",3
22 July 2021,Beautiful,"This film is in general very beautiful and very sweet and speaks in general of the end of a man's life that is confused between fiction and reality. The film is sweet and fun until the end where it also becomes very melancholy but never becomes too overwhelming or boring.

12 January 2004,Big Fish is dead in the water,"Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is a robust looking old man who loves to tell stories, in fact he has been telling tall tales all his life to his children, inflating events in his own life to mythic proportions. When Bloom's journalist son Will (Billy Crudup) returns to his parent's house on hearing that his father is dying of cancer, he is determined to separate fact from fiction and get to know the father who was never around when he was growing up. Based on a semi-autobiographical novel by Daniel Wallace and adapted for the screen by John August Big Fish, the latest by Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood), is a beautifully looking film that has its engines going full blast but never seems to achieve liftoff. I am drawn to films that have a surreal vision of an alternate reality, but Big Fish force-feeds it to us rather than subtly evoking a sense of magic.

The film is told in flashback as Will and his pregnant French wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) recall the stories his father had told him all his life. We first see young Edward (Ewan McGregor) as a sports hero and science fair winner in Ashton, Alabama then, after leaving Ashton with a gentle giant named Karl, encountering the inhabitants of a wondrous town called Spectre where everyone walks around barefoot and is full of joy. Although vowing to return one day to Spectre, Edward moves on and agrees to work for a circus manager (Danny de Vito) in return for information about Sandra (Alison Lohman), a girl he has fallen in love with. Eventually he finds her at Auburn University and, in one of the best scenes in the film, courts her with 10,000 daffodils to prove his love.

After Edward is drafted to fight in the Korean War, he rescues conjoined twin entertainers, Ping and Jing and brings them home to work in the circus. At this point, it just continues from one off-the-wall sequence to another until its grand Fellini-esque final sequence. Unfortunately, despite some high expectations, I was unmoved by the ending. I did not find anything lovable about Bloom and feel that the theme of father-son reconciliation was handled much more convincingly in The Barbarian Invasions by Denis Arcand. While Big Fish has some fine performances and outstanding special effects, it did not instill in me any true sense of wonder or authentic emotion. Sadly, Big Fish is dead in the water.",6
17 November 2019,Perfect in its own way.,"This movie is basically Forest Gump except even better. I'm not trying to c*** on Forest, he's awesome, but this brings something special.

A collage of bizarre encounters and experiences with a deft sense of comic timing though never quite losing a disquieting tone, this is a delightful weirdness trip that also has something unexpected up its sleeve.

It's not trying to touch the feels the way FG did. it's not meant to be Zeligesque or pseudo-historical, it's the gaiety of the tall story that uses narration as narration should be used; to supplement the picture, not as an excuse to not tell the story visually.

Not heavy, but with hard edge, this is a festival of anecdote telling first and a meditation on the blurring of fantasy and reality second. I personally don't do unreliable narrators and just take everything at face value. It's more enjoyable that way.

This is an understated movie that lets you follow it on your own terms. It's fun and has an ineffable poignancy of an unassuming sort that I rarely see.",9

23 May 2004,Disturbingly BAD ... Overrated as it gets & Dumb as it gets,"Why would that idiot even tell stories that are so odd that no one in their right mind would believe them? They're not particularly clever or eccentric enough to captivate anyone. We, the viewer, were even treated to them visually and that just added to their deplorably foolish nature. I was not captivated or enchanted by even one of these tall tales. This film reminded me of that classic TV moment on the `Simpsons' where homer remarked to Marge about having to pay for concessions he had pilfered after a school drama production `I had to see Krabopple's butt, believe me I paid for it!' Well, I should have looted my theatre's concessions after this flop because I had to see Danny Devito's butt.

13 January 2004,Sleeping with the Big Fishes,"I couldn't wait to see Big Fish, A nightmare Before Christmas is one of my all time favorite movies, which is why I was so disappointed by the over long, dull, sometimes magical, but often misbegotten story that these actors were forced to partake in.

From time to time a magical moment will arise, and then the film seemed to be about to take off only to be pulled in, sometimes even crash back to a story that is so thin, I could not believe they stretch the subject for a decent short film to a two hour yawn-a-thon.

For me Big Fish was the disappointment of the year because, it seemed to be all promise, but the promise never quite delivered. This sweet film, left me feeling pretty sour about film making that depends on no plot, no story, no performance but that of the pretty visuals.

18 January 2005,Burton reaches a new low,"A really unfortunate waste of a film, chock full of contrived, manipulative, false-sentimentality that would almost, but not quite, make Spielberg blush. Okay, that sounds a bit harsh, but this is bland, un-affecting Hollywood tripe. Burton doesn't insult his audience's emotional intelligence to the Spielbergian degree, but nor does he inspire us the way he once did my sharing his unique vision. This film has the emotional subtlety of a jack-hammer and it contains none of the imaginative wonder of 'Beetlejuice' or 'A Nightmare Before Chritmas.' Sadly, this is what Hollywood/Middle Age can do to a former bright light. The kind of movie that guy from 'Good Morning America' would call 'loads of fun' in one of his lobotomized reviews. Skip it. Skip it. Skip it.

30 April 2004,I don't see how this movie got an 8 out of 10...,"It would be strong to say that I hated the movie, and maybe my expectations were too high going into it, but other than the story being a pretty original idea, I didn't really like it and wasn't entertained much at all. I hadn't seen this in the theater and as soon as it came out on DVD I checked IMDB for ratings & reviews. When I saw that it had got 8 out of 10 rating, plus it was a father son / fantasy movie, I raced over to blockbuster to rent it thinking for sure I would have liked it. Sadly enough and to my surprise, it did nothing for me. I did watch it pretty late in the day and found myself yawning and wondering when it would pick up, but in my opinion any good movie would keep me awake no matter what time I watch it.

As I said, it had a pretty original story, and the acting was certainly believable. For me though I had a hard time just simply enjoying the fantasy and imagination of the stories and how they unfolded when instead I focused on the credibility of them and the damage it was causing to his son. Don't get me wrong I am a movie freak and my favorite movies are action, Sci-Fi, fantasy, and horror, so I depend heavily on the make believe. I like a good drama too, but in this movie, I think too because I am a father, I sided more with the son in that, I just saw him as a terrible father, possibly terrible husband too. I kept thinking to myself, now here's a guy who apparently wasn't satisfied with his normal life so he creates this second life, most of which is fantasy, but you don't really know which is fact and fiction. But because he was a good story teller and such a social person, the stories were enjoyed by most rather than just passed off as a pathological liar. I might have been able to get in the spirit of that, but his son resented him for it and I guess so did I. I think too it struck to close to home for me as it reminded me partly of my own father in that I can't ask the guy what time it is without him telling me how to build a clock. Or if I try to tell him about something, he'll interrupt me and go off on some tangent story himself. Another pet peeve of mine is that it pains me to see parents mistreat there kids or tell them lies and from one perspective that's all this movie is about. In one scene the son told his father that he didn't know anything about the real him because all he got were these fantasy stories rather than stories of how his father really was. And because he too was going to become a father he wanted his son to know the real him. In this scene I cried out `Amen!' But in the end (which was pretty un-climactic), because his father was dying and more or less to make piece with him, the son reluctantly told him a story of how he dies, or moves on I should say.

I guess another issue that bothered me was that the father was always seen as a man who was a good person and who helped others out because he was such a good person. And here he ended up buying up a whole town (which appeared to be a true story) in order to preserve it. But again rather than admiring him for that I kept thinking, that his son and wife never saw him because he was too busy working and keeping up this other life. It's kind of like feeding others when your own family starves, and I guess that's the feeling that I came away with on this movie. It shocks me quite frankly that it received 8 out of 10 as very few movies hit that mark. I have thought that Tim Burton's past movies have been really good, this one just didn't sit too well with me. But as it stands now, it's in the top 250 movies of all time (shocking), so it must be worth a watch. Hope you like it and get more out of it than I did.",

7 October 2015,A wondrous tale,"Tim Burton's Big Fish is the fantastically inclined director at his most mature, while never losing the whimsy and otherworldly elements that have made his films so beloved. While the film is literally about larger than life stories that are perceived by characters in the narrative as wildly embellished tall tales, the tone is one of utmost sincerity and unblinking frankness, leaving out the winks, nudges and sly jabs that usually come with Burton's aesthetic. It's straight up drama, coming from a place of true humanity, that just happens to take place in a story where we get to see these tales of fantasy and unbelievable occurrences. It's this merging of the serious with a dose of utter magical flair that makes it so special, and a beacon of memorable, down to earth style in Burton's otherwise spooky lineup of stories. Billy Crudup, an extremely underestimated actor, plays rational, logical Will Bloom, who is visiting his ailing father Edward (Albert Finney) in the countryside. He grew up hearing wild stories from his father about daring, impossible exploits that he went through in his youth, stories that couldn't fathomably be true. Or could they? Will resents his father for his blatant eccentricities and Crudup expertly displays the subtle rift this has formed between the two of them, creating wounds that only open again with this visit. He brings along his wife (a dazzling Marion Cotillard). As Edward continues to regale them with stories that Will has heard a thousand times (and Cotillard for the first time, humouring him with her warmhearted patience), the film transports us back in time and brings these stories to wild, colour filled life, with a youthful and vibrant Ewan Mcgregor playing the young version of Edward. We learn of his encounter with a mysterious witch, an eerie town in the forest inhabited by a future bank robber (Steve Buscemi), a giant, his time in the war and subsequent escape, and in the film's most touching vignette, a stint working for a local circus, run by a flamboyant ringleader (Danny Devito, the crass little teddy bear) with a scary secret. There he meets his gorgeous future wife, played by Alison Lohman, a positive vision of beauty. Jessica Lange plays her in the present time, infusing quiet warmth and aching love with simple gestures. These tales from the past all have a brilliantly bright, storybook wonder to them, reigned in towards introspect by the characters in the present who they are being told to, and ruminated on by. Whether they are true or not (although there is a concrete answer, surprisingly) doesn't really figure in our enjoyment of the film, or its validity as a moving piece of work, but they instead serve as an illustration of Edward's enormous imagination, only equaled by the size of his heart, and love for his wife and son. The ending sequence is one you'll be fighting back tears during, and is one of the most genuine, earnest moments in a career that for Burton tends to dwell in the realms of detached, emotionally gray territory, but here he orchestrates the most moving, heartfelt work I've ever seen him do. From beginning to end, this tall tale makes your imagination leap with the notion of fantasy and larger than life endeavours, but always beckons you back to relatable, human roots with the back and forth synergy of an orchestral symphony. A classic.",10
7 July 2004,One of the best coming of age dramas,"There is enough Drama/Comedy/offbeat darkness in this film. It is director ""Tim Burton"" at his best. One minute you could be smiling in melancholy happiness and the next, eyes filling with tears. The characters in the film represent all the adolescent and adult emotional feelings one develops as they adapt within families and societal life. The dark undertones sort of represent the overall mood you ""the viewer"" experience within each progressive scene.

Actor Billy Crudup (Will Bloom)plays the son of (Ed Bloom)Albert Finney with such convincing manner:everything from the facial expressions down to the speech and vocal tones conversed between the two. Ewan McGregor plays the part of (Ed Bloom) coming of age. And does it so well. The struggle of son living up to father's expectations is very real.

Showing that a strong family structure is key to success in most nearly everything. And a weak family structure is somewhat a struggle. Director Tim Burton explores these issues with fine intelligent complexity.

The film is very well acted and beautifully choreographed.

A timeless piece of film.",8
11 November 2007,A great film!,"Since Edward scissor hands, i've been kind of disappointed with Tim Burton's films. So much so that when ""Big Fish"" came out I didn't bother to go and see it.

4 whole years after it's release i finally saw the movie and I was overwhelmed! this is Burton in his best.

The cast is perfect in delivering a moving story about the kind of people you never see on a day to day basis... And this exactly what Tim Burton is all about.

A great film, wonderfully told story, excellent acting and a definite 10/10 for me.

13 August 2010,I Never Swam for My Father,"""Throughout his life Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor) has always been a man of big appetites, enormous passions, and tall tales. In his later years, portrayed by five-time 'Best Actor Oscar' nominee Albert Finney, he remains a huge mystery to his son, William (Billy Crudup). Now, to get to know the real man, Will begins piecing together a true picture of his father from flashbacks of his amazing adventures in this marvel of a movie,"" according to the DVD sleeve description. As you might expect, the presence of Tim Burton and many of his regular crew mean your production values on ""Big Fish"" are going to be good.

Now, this is supposed to be the story of a son estranged from his father due to the latter filling his son's head with nothing but lies. The father's stories, told in flashbacks, turn out to be vivid exaggerations, like the ""fish tale"" opening. Well, the ""stories"" aren't revelatory. And, it all leads to the expected heart-tugging conclusion. More is told when Mr. Crudup tells his wife something interesting but relatively unexplored, ""When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was there."" So, our storyteller was a nice guy and a loving husband, but only spent a little time with his son - or, was it a lot of time telling tales?

And why?

The disconnections are strange.

We begin with a crystal ball-eyed witch showing our young lad and his friends how they are going to die. One of the other kids dies masturbating to ""Playboy"" on his toilet; either this story was a father's warning, or it proved sexual urges trump the will to live. We don't see our hero's death, but he does. As he's seen his own death, ""Ed"" is able to lead an exciting life, encountering a string of circus-like people. The key relationship, that of father and son, gets lost in the past. Only during the final act, do we get to the heart of the story - then, Crudup and Mr. Finney, updating his ""Billy Liar"" (1960) stage role, begin to sell it.

2 July 2021,Changed my view about life!,"Don't know how to describe it . But I realized something from this movie which is , ""Life creates story and also stories create our own life"" . What is your life ? A bunch of good or bad story . People of our life are not usually constant but stories remain intact decades and more .

I loved how the characters are well described in this movie! Every character had a meaning in the movie, everyone from the friendly giant to the twins to the witch to the big fish!

20 April 2012,"I'm not a Tim Burton fan, but...","I usually find Burton's films to be somewhat tedious, over done with effects and generally not that entertaining. Of course there are exceptions. I loved Ed Wood for one. But this film, well, is simply beyond description. And I mean this in the best way possible.

Performances are stunning. Danny DeVito, Jessica Lange...a cast that is at its, their best being incredible. Billy Crudup might be the most underrated actor of his generation, and he doesn't disappoint in this role. It's a fairy tale sort of. Maybe not. It's a fantasy or many fantasies or a big lie or the hard truth about a father and his son. Their journey together or alone through their life. Lot's of tales told by a master. Lot's of questions and doubt from his son. Great tales though. Incredible stories. Unbelievable characters. Or are they? I don't know how to explain this movie. Let's just say that when it ends, you just might find yourself wanting it to start all over again. Not because it has any kind of socially redeeming message or is to difficult to understand. Far from it. But simply because it is almost impossible to get the grin off your face and you just don't want that magical feeling to end.",10
22 February 2004,I did'nt hate it.,"This movie was ok, I guess. It was very sentimental and really a little overblown. The story was OK but it felt like Tim Burton was just being self-indulgent seeing what images he could create like the field full of daffodils. A major gripe concerns the movie's re-writting of history in regards to race relations in Alabama and the US. I so sure there were black doctors delivering babies for white women in the south in the 1930's!

The acting is great, esp A. Finney & J. Lange, as is Tim Burton's cinematography & the power-of-positive-thinking philosophy feels good. The idea that a son would dislike his father and not talk to him for 3 years just because he tells tall tales gets the whole thing off on a very bad foot, from which it never really recovers.

But really, to vote a 10 for a movie that espouses the way to leave a legacy is to make stuff up, you would have to not only have voted for Bush & Cheney, you would have to believe their stuff.

2 January 2005,*Imagine Your Own Reality*,"Very interesting movie.

A boy in childhood and growing up is told stories and tales by his father as factual events experienced by the father in his life.The stories involve a witch, a giant and a mermaid amongst other things.

Now in adulthood the boy believes these stories are ""tall tales""(hence Big Fish) and seeks to discover from his ailing father the truth rather than the fantasy.

Now, on one level this film could be said to be very silly; on another level, very profound.

Often people who make up false stories as part of their own lives are irritating and obnoxious. They are frequently con artists, sales people, charlatans, lonely individuals or those leading a Walter Mitty existence. And such persons often do more harm than good.

However: What if our lives and that of those around us can be improved by the dreams and imagination of others? Who is to say that the product of our dreams and unlimited imagination cannot be considered as real as anything else? And if enough people believe something is true, it can become part of reality.

This is a thought provoking film which is entertaining, deserving to be highly rated.",
28 February 2008,Burton's one of the best,"If this is Tim Burton's apology for the pretty awful ""Apes"" then any fan will surely forgive him completely. This daring, highly stylized fantasy is everything I ever loved about his movies.

The driving force of Big Fish is its characters and the casting is simply superb. Finney's scenes were apparently filmed first, allowing McGregor to watch and assimilate some of his mannerisms into his younger portrayal. Crudup is able to amply portray the Will's frustration as he finds himself unable to connect with his father. And the resemblance between the wonderful Lange and Lohman as the younger and older versions of Edward's wife is uncanny. McGregor is particularly successful in walking the same fine line as the story itself, balancing between the real and unreal without ever seeming absurd or silly. Will's wife is an especially beautiful character, being both the perfect wife and a charming fresh audience for Edward's anecdotal stories, he brow knotting prettily in concern as he tells the delightfully twisted tale of the prophetic crow. The performances are all heartfelt, but McGregor manages to blend this with Burton's quirkiness perfectly.

I follow Burton since Vincent(1982) and I honestly think that Big Fish represents Burton's most mature and personal work to date. Perhaps it marks a new and more honest direction for the director, but it certainly ranks among his best with it's delicately balanced poignancy and humor.",10

25 June 2005,the point is not whether or not he's lying...,"I've never seen a Tim Burton movie that I didn't like (I wasn't too fond of ""The Nightmare before Christmas"", but Burton only produced that). ""Big Fish"" continues this trend. When elderly Alabama resident Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is dying, his estranged son Will (Billy Crudup) has to return home. Ed has spent much of his life telling fanciful tales of his exploits, none of which Will has ever believed. But when Will investigates, he begins to speculate that these stories may have been true after all.

Regardless of whether or not one can believe all these things that Ed is telling people, we grow to respect how the situation is helping the father and son reconnect, and also how Ed and his wife Sandra (Jessica Lange) are trying to rekindle their sexuality. Ewan McGregor is particularly impressive as Ed's younger self, and Danny DeVito is pretty funny as a circus ringmaster with a dark secret. A great movie.

13 January 2004,big fish - small return,"One word: ""cute"". The movie is cute, the characters are cute, the moral is cute... damn, mr. burton, you went soft!

Visually the movie is strong, and i think it was well done all around, but as the third act started i was wondering where all this was going. While it did start to loss me, the ending grabbed me and got me back. It wrapped it all up very nicely and drove the message home in a pretty powerful way.

With that said, and while there were several enjoyable ""burton"" moments, i just felt like i was watching a ""nice, cute"" kids movie. Why did they bother with the pg-13 rating? Cut 3 swear words out and about 5 seconds of film, and this thing is PG and more directed at its target audience. I really am a fan of Mr. Burton's work, but i think ""beetle juice"" was edgier. And i read that someone thought the movie was violent? Did i miss something?

Its nice, its sweet, its sentimental and gets a few laughs; but i have to say that i expected more. My vote: less cute, more burton.",6

31 October 2004,Social Commentary in Big Fish,"On first viewing of Burton's Big Fish I was easily dazzled by the wonderful visionary effects and heartwarming story. I immediately loved the film not only for these reasons but also because I felt there was something deeper being touched on in the film though I didn't quite grasp it all at first viewing. Since I have watched it several times more and clearly seen the social commentary the film makes.

Culture today is moving into a period called post-modernism, which has many aspects to it, but chiefly the movement from modern logical thought to something beyond. Shown mostly in the younger generations, post-modernism has turned away from science and logic. The way to reach a young person these days is not by lecturing facts, but through stories and experience. This film explores this cultural shift brilliantly, whether it really intended to or not.

The film continually keeps you guessing as to what parts of Ed's stories are real and what aren't, but that's not the point. The point is that regardless of how much the stories are true (or make logical sense), they are who the man is. Indeed logic even has no place in them, shown by multiple absurdities and illogical time sequences with the witch. Edward is the character representation of post-modernism, with his son William representing the modern world and it's lack of understanding of post-modernism.

I would elaborate more but the film is so rich in scenes and characters that display different aspects of this point that to do so would require a more in depth study than can be given here. So look for it in the movie yourself if you know anything about this cultural change.",10

14 April 2007,When Tim Burton has a Lobotomy,"I'll admit I'm not the biggest Burton fan. I don't like Corpse Bride (gasp! How dare I?) and Nightmare Before Christmas still creeps me out when the little creepy Lock, Shock and Barrel kids start singing. I think I can pick out two movies from Burton's bag of tricks that surprised me, that I really like: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Edward Scissorhands. So, being a fair-weather fan of this cinematic veteran, I did my best to put on a happy face and give this movie a chance. I was, deep down, not expecting much. And that's exactly what I got. Not bad, but not good either. It was somewhere in the middle, but I'm rating it toward the lower end of the scale. Ewan, my sweet Ewan, what the heck was with that accent? I've seen some darn good souther accents in my short days as a critical movie viewer, and honey, you didn't cut the mustard. I don't mind Albert Finney, he does a pretty good job as a dying old guy with just a touch of senility. The costumes have their shining moments, and they storyline rises and falls throughout. All around, I didn't like this movie. But, if I was forced into a corner and told to watch this movie, I'd do it.",4

10 January 2004,Big Fishappointment...,"I think this is the biggest disappointment of the year for me. So many of the pieces of this puzzle are exquisite... they just don't all fit together. Burton's weirdness always seems to be at odds with the storyteller that is necessary to pull it off. Finney and Lange (who is almost unbelievably radiant these years... see Titus, see Normal) are excellent as usual. But in the end, the pacing and narrative flaws sabotage what is one of the most beautifully art-directed movies of the year. Sad but true.

14 June 2007,Something Smells Kinda Fishy!,"Let me start by saying that Tim Burton will always be a great artistic director/production designer. His movies will always carry that weird, offbeat imagery which will please fans to no end. Unfortunately, he will always be at fault for choosing such weak scripts for his projects. John August's run-of-the-mill script for Big Fish leaves much to be desired because of the shallow storytelling and flimsy characterization. Most of the characters involved are either too flat, or too deliberately odd, for the viewer to relate to. Big Fish introduces us to Ed Bloom, a man who tells some unbelievably amazing stories. But these episodic stories didn't seem to have any point other than just to flaunt Burton's visual style and twisted imagination. I failed to see young and old Bloom as inspirational or even likable, rather he came off as annoying. Old Bloom droned on for hours, talking nonsense. Young Bloom was a self-centered dolt, who always got what he wanted. His son, Will, had all the reason to resent his father, but even he came off as a jerk at times. On the bright side, the movie delivers good results in the acting department, although McGregor's southern accent isn't quite convincing. All in all, an unsatisfactory effort.",4

13 February 2004,Don't Believe The Trailer!,"When I watched the trailer for this film, I was made to believe that it would be a 'magical masterpiece' and uphold Tim Burton's strange fantasy theme, along with many claims it would win however many BAFTAs etc. I decided to spend my money on it and entered the cinema with medium expectations.

For the next one and a half hours, I was presented with a FAR to literal, non-magical, emotionally inept, cliched interpretation of a jumped up love story. Ok, there were 'some' classic Burton pieces in the film, but it really didn't hold it together for me.

I thought the casting had been done by a Big Fish, everyone was terrible and I felt as though they had been chosen for the role as there was no one else available at the time.

9 June 2004,"Wow, I almost cried...IT WAS THAT BAD","I do not understand how you people can come on here and write about how good this movie was. If you enjoy sitting in a darm room with no sound, no light, and no outside interference, then this is your movie. It was the most boring movie I've seen in a long time. Since when is it funny for a man and a huge giant to travel down separate paths of life and meet up again. The portrayal this was supposed to be with the fathers stories relating to the ""big fish"" was the worst comparison ever. One minute, the dads a liar, the next minute, hes a savior. I expected so much from this movie, and got so little, and frankly, I'm disappointed.

This movie doesn't deserve anymore than a 2/10, and even that is pushing it.

30 August 2020,One of Tim Burton's best movies!,"Let me start by saying that Tim Burton is one of my favorite filmmakers. He's made some good ones like Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Batman, Beetlejuice, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Pee-wee's Big Adventure and he also made a few okay but not great recent movies like Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, Alice in Wonderland, and Dark Shadows. So yeah, solid filmmaker with quirky style. Big Fish is sort of like Forrest Gump because it's a life story. The themes about relationship between father and son are very poignant. The flashbacks about Edward Bloom's life are entertaining to explore. The performances from the cast are quite sensational, especially from Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Danny DeVito, and a few more. It also has some fun humor to laugh about. The musical score by Danny Elfman is quite breathtaking and emotional. The visual effects are quite stunning. For me, Big Fish is quite a fun and unique movie filled with fascination and entertaining storytelling about life.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

17 September 2005,A son of a dying father tries to differentiate between the facts and fictions of his dad's rather unbelievable life.,"There is no movie quite like this one. On so many levels it is different, unique and utterly mind-boggling. It is not just the visual pleasures, like so many movies out there, but it is mostly the story and how it literally ends where it begins. It is Tim Burton's best work, in my opinion. This movie is a charming, simple, child-like film that is easily misunderstood.

The whole point of this movie is not that it's one great lie, it's point is that a great story is not just facts, facts are boring. It is telling us that a great story is always somewhat over exaggerated. In the beginning, the adult Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) tells the guests of his son's wedding about the day his son was born, the day that he caught the biggest fish in the Ashton river (which was rumored to be left over from the Cretaceous period) using is golden wedding ring. Later in the film, Dr. Bennett tells Will (Edward's son, played by Billy Crudip) the factual story of how he, Will, was born. Which version is do we remember? Edward's, of course, because it was over-exaggerated. This movie tells the story of the beginnings of a tall-tale.

Before watching it, I must warn viewers, this film is not for everyone. This movie is strange and only those who can think like Tim Burton will understand it. However, there is so much depth to the story that it requires some thinking to it. It is not a movie for parties and sleep-overs. It is not a movie for action-lovers. However, it is for those deep-thinkers and those who loved to hear their parents tell them a great story while they lied in bed and lingered on every word.",10
13 November 2020,Just beautiful!,"No need to loose word, tho I should probably use much more since I'm commenting amazing storytelling. This movie is amazing work of art and a message:"" life is a story, and with some imagination it can be an adventure. Even when laying still on your bed"".

25 September 2006,"Deep, deep, and broad....","It might be possible to watch this movie and appreciate it on some level without blowing snot into a tissue, but I would assert that if you aren't whimpering like a baby by the end, you've either missed some important points, or you've lived an unbelievably ""Leave It to Beaverish"" life.

This movie is remarkably layered in both it's ontological and emotional effect.... If you are courageous enough to let it seep into your soul and name what ""is"" for many, many families on many, many levels, then you have a real treat in store for you... but a painful treat... but it ""hurts so good....""

15 August 2016,Magical!,"This is a film about a young man, Will Bloom, who grew up with his father's stories. His father, Edward Bloom, is quite the storyteller, his stories are peculiar- magical! Though they have resulted in Will feeling as though he doesn't know his father- that his father is almost like a character in a fairy tale. It is to be expected since, Edward Bloom's stories revolve around witches, giants, creatures who are man by day, and wolves by night. And all these creatures, Edward Bloom, tells stories about, he also claims to have met them and, that they exist. Cute when you tell these stories to a five year old, but to a thirty year old? Not so much.

And so, Will is convinced that: 'A man tells his stories so many times that he becomes the stories. They live on after him, and in that way he becomes immortal.' Edward Bloom can tell the same story over and over, and Will is getting tired of all the silly stories. For, he is now presented with quite the challenge: to tell his father's story. His father is battling with cancer, and doesn't have a lot of time left. And Will is wondering what he will describe of his father, to his future children? He finds it near 'impossible to separate fact from fiction, the man from the myth."" But still, when he makes plans to visit his gravely ill father, it is with the intention of finally being able to understand him, even if his father doesn't always make sense.

This film touched a nerve with me. I'm the type of person who likes to tell children stories. The weirdest sort: from how animals speak English when people are sleeping, and the latest being that werewolves are real, as are vampires. I'm still trying to convince them of tooth-fairies. But I see little hope. How they believe in werewolves of all things, but not tiny flying people, is beyond me. Especially when they get a coin after every tooth. They have no such proof for the existence of werewolves! See why I see little hope? Anyway, I'm sure you've now concluded that I receive a great deal of satisfaction after successfully 'lying' to a child. Of course, when the child is older they'll tell the same lies-that I'm sure. But in some ways I feel like this is the sort of film that makes you guilty for all the lies you've ever told. I mean, what if my child grows up believing I'm nothing but a liar? That because all my stories were lies, that I too am a liar? Or what if I take a lie too far? Personally I don't see this happening, I am in a habit of forgetting whatever it is I lied about, but this is what Edward Bloom did with his son. Of course, this is a film based on a story. But it still raises a valid point.

But then, there's the flip side. The magic, the wonder, the incredible change in perspective: you have the power to change a child's life. All, by shaping just how they see the world. That's some power, and I'll like to put it to a good use. As Roald Dahl says there's magic in everything. So why can't we give our children a small peek at what they will one day find for themselves?

The film represents both sides: Will is the realist, he wants the facts. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. And then there's Edward Bloom, he's the crazy storyteller who may just convince you his stories are more than stories. When their two perspectives meet, what will happen?

I recommend this film for parents to watch with your young children. For those times when you're struggling to have them believe in tooth-fairies! Maybe I just care too much since my own parents weren't much for telling stories, I was that kid who would look forward to the story telling sessions at school and shushing the others when they so much as whispered something over the teacher's words.

NB: I gave this film four stars only because it left me feeling a little confused at the end. So parents, be warned. But with children, I don't see how you'll have any problem! Well, in my experience.",8
26 December 2005,A really lovely movie with a great feel to it.,"This movie is really lovely and has a great feel to it. I did not read the book it was based on, but it can stand on it's own. The acting was very good as was the writing, etc. It is the kind of movie that makes you want to go read the book. For me that is the best kind because usually movies are not as good as the books they were based on. The ones that are exceptions to this rule are often superb movies. This could be one of those. The soundtrack with this movie was also exceptional. I also expect to buy that asap. I have watched the movie twice as of this writing and expect to get a copy of the DVD as well. I saw it the first time on DVD and the second time on cable. It wears well also.

18 April 2004,What a waste of silver nitrate,"Quite possibly the most overrated movie of recent times.

Eclectic but not useful in any way. So far fetched that it was untraceable.

If people believed this movie touched their hearts or some other part of their body, they may need help.

As one who can handle fantasy and bizarre themes, I was expecting, at least in some part, a movie that could give me something.

My only piece of empathy was with the son who had been lied to all through his life and could not pick fact from fiction. Everyone loves a dad who has a wild imagination and funny stories but here was a kid who still, in his thirties, had never been in touch with his dad at any stage.

And the course of the film did nothing to enlighten him ... or me!",3
12 February 2004,Burton Should Stick to Fantasy,"In this amalgam of fantasy and family drama, Tim Burton might have wanted the audience to experience two different genre films shuffled in one. The innovative storytelling, the dad modifying his experiences with his sense of wonder, is both a means and excuses to make such a unique world possible. However, with the artificially shallow father-son relationship, the family drama part, which is obviously not Burton's realm, falls apart. It makes the entire film remarkably unimpressive, while the fantasy sequences are truly fantastic. Burton should stick to fantasy, what he is good at.

31 March 2020,Hope life is a beautiful fairy,"Life should be like a fairy tale, and each encounter is a small plot in the story. You don't need to know the result, but you must believe that there is no sadness, no sadness, no misfortune in the fairy tale world. Everything is just to realize a beautiful dream that is pure, romantic and accessible. Therefore, no matter what kind of encounter, you will definitely see the most beautiful star in the sky, and you will definitely get the warmest embrace that belongs to you. That share, that share of happiness, has already been prepared for you, but the steps are not approaching, and the door is still open.

18 December 2003,Soporific - not worth the price of admission,"I found this movie boring. There is no suspense, no real plot. There are a series of loosely connected episodes that don't really add up to much. It is mildly humorous in places and syrupy music plays when anyone cries. It's well acted, but who cares? There are also some puzzling anachronisms, like Buddy Holly and Elvis music during the KOREAN War. There are also some really awful southern accents. Why do Yankees even bother? They don't get it. The humor is sophomoric and often tasteless (an Elephant taking a dump). It was like bad TV. To make the experience even more galling, Loewe's has raised its admission price to $10.25. This movie is definitely NOT worth it. If you are curious about it, wait and rent the video.

23 March 2023,Life is a ...,"... well is it a box of chocolate or was I going to say something completely different? Something that would not be sfw at all - let's just say no pun intended and roll with whatever you think I was going to write. That all being said, the movie is quite remarkable. I had not seen it, since it was released ... and I remember that I did like it ... but boy this was quite the rewatch. The imagination of Burton is quite something.

And the ending of the movie is quite amazing. Especially if you have an open mind ... something the son does not seem to have. But there is a reason for that - also if we all were the same ... the world would be quite boring. Great actors in this - seeing some of them here is reward enough ... but when the story also helps elevate everything ... well that all makes everything better too. There is so much to be said about this - family, relationships, goals, drama, fun ... fantasy! Let your mind reign ... free ... try to enjoy whatever it is you do ... never compromise and all that ... after watching the movie, you may understand and feel what I am saying.",10
30 October 2004,Brilliant slow-burner,"This is more a poem than a film. I haven't dared read other people's comments, because I want these comments to be mine, that means of course that I may just repeat the obvious. Is there a hint of Mark Twain story telling here? This a fairy tale in a modern setting, with an explanation of how the original fairy tales came to life? There are so many elements and levels here, but a real slow burner (which has put a lot of people off). A father-son film, my small son was cuddled on my lap when we watched this, which made it more meaningful. Of course it's a film where nothing really happens (or does it?), because it the end it's a film about the ordinariness of life and one man's attempt to escape it.If you didn't like this film , please give it another chance!

14 March 2005,big stinkin' fish,"i got about 1/4 of the way through this stinker. it goes on, and on, and on about nothing, never reaching a punch line, or an end to the stories. the acting, as a result of this rambling, is atrocious, boring, predictable, and point less. the DVD box advertises this as a modern wizard of oz, but this film couldn't hold Dorothy's basket.

typical tim burton over rated ""art"".. what could be told in maybe three pages of script, is told in 100 pages or more, isn't funny, provocative, or the least bit interesting. like lost in translation, it simply goes on and on, to no reason, or rhyme.

how can one come up with ten lines of text to describe this absolute waste of celluloid, film, tape, digital computer space, eye sight, time, electricity. talent, props, wardrobe, words, breath, hearing, money, space on the planet, space on the shelves, etc, etc????????????

22 June 2004,Visually magnificent as we expect with a Tim Burton movie.,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

18 October 2012,Big Fish - 4.5 Stars,"What a magical movie this is. ""Big Fish"" challenges our faith and imagination with tales that sound too marvelous to be true, too extraordinary to be believable. But the strongest emotions are found between the broken relationship of a dying father and his doubtful son. After years of no communication, they are reunited when human age reaches its fragile state. The son sits on a chair as he observes his weak father, who lies in what could be his deathbed.

Old Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is a devoted storyteller who believes that true stories could use a little fiction for entertainment purposes. On the day his only son, Will, was born, he was out of town selling home appliances. Not a very exciting story for such a very momentous event. When Will is set to be married, his father shares with everyone the false account of how he caught a really big fish with his wedding ring the same day Will was born. This draws smiles from his listeners, but not from Will, who has heard the same lie repeatedly throughout his life. He walks away. And he doesn't return until old Edward becomes confined to his bedroom.

Other than the tale about the big fish, Edward has shared more of his past experiences with Will, which he starts to recall in great detail. A series of flashbacks begin, and we are introduced to the mysterious memories of Edward, which gives an opportunity for director Tim Burton to indulge in his obsession for all things weird. Edward narrates as nostalgia kicks in, but it's Tim Burton who supplies the imagination.

1 July 2019,never disappoints,"My favorite Tim Burton flick by far, which is a high bar indeed. Holds up over time & with repeated viewings. Unlike some of Burton's efforts, there are no wincing moments in the grand Southern Fable. Top shelf performances from all, with a distinguished cast, pulling out all the stops. Bold & stunning cinematography from Philippe Rousselot matched by the superb set/art work/special . Daniel Wallace's Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions, proved the perfect vehicle for Tim Burton's over the top directorial magic. This story requires concentration, but gives back great dividends for the effort expended. Almost bought me a Red Dodge Charger on account of this epic, elegiac, feel good flick. An all time great, IMHO.

15 March 2014,Moving and visually stunning,"Moving and visually amazing drama from Tim Burton. Burton is renowned for his quirky comedies but here he manages to mix that with raw emotion. A family relationship drama mixed with fairy tales (or are they?).

As you would expect from Tim Burton, the special effects are amazing. Throw in a good soundtrack (by Danny Elfman, of course) and you have a well-crafted, visually appealing, often light-hearted yet emotional movie.

Good performances by a host of stars: Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Billy Cradup, Helena Bonham Carter, Marion Cotillard, Robert Guillaume, Danny DeVito, Alison Lohman and Steve Buscemi. Also includes a 10-year old Miley Cyrus in her first cinema movie role (though I am not sure this is anything for the movie to be proud of...).

Only negative is that the ending lacks punch. Having set up the intrigue with the interesting tales and snippets of the father's life, the conclusion is not that profound and feels a bit predictable. It's as if Burton focused most of his attention on the first and second Acts and relaxed on the third.",8
21 June 2004,Brilliant & Absolutely Gorgeous,"Tim Burton did it again !

In his own unique way, with his inimitable blend of humor and pain and fun and bleakness, Burton gives us another Gem of Make Believe.

How many movies will leave us with goose bumps all over, moisture blurring the view and a broad smile on the face while the end credits are rolling ?!?

Of course, it's not just all Burton's doing. The cast does not have a weak link. The cinematographer works wonders. The special and digital effects are pleasant. And the story is sublime.

The combination of all these strong points has given us an incredible film. Unique. So very good and handsome. So poignant and unforgettable...",10
21 November 2019,Doesn't hold up,"I remember this film fondly as a kid, it was so mystical and wonderful. I watched it recently and honestly, it's kind of a nothing movie. It has excellent moments, but as a whole, it's isn't very well paced or written. Your memories of this film are much better than the actual film. If you have memories of this film, don't watch it again.

24 January 2004,Throw This One Back,"I can't believe I saw the same movie as all those who have already posted comments. Basically it's a crock. The expression mish-mosh springs to mind. Ewan McGregor is off the credibilty scale followed closely by Albert Finny. There's scarcely a believable character/situation from beginning to end. It's like a bad trip after finding some mescalin left over from the 60s. If Burton was fishing for compliments he sure fooled lotsa folks. Give us a real movie, Timbo, fish or cut bait.

30 August 2010,Tim Burton's Tall Tale,"A change of pace for director Tim Burton, about a young man (Billy Crudup) trying to come to terms with his father (Albert Finney) by bonding with him over his father's tall tales about his past.

Ewan McGregor plays Finney as a young man, and the story sequences give Burton free reign to indulge his penchant for fantasy and surrealism. The present-day portions of the film, which also feature Jessica Lange as Crudup's mom, are a bit more heavy handed and sappy, the sentimental overdose barely kept in check by the good actors.

Danny Elfman provided the Academy Award-nominated score.

Grade: B+

27 September 2022,"Hmmm, Fantastical, peculiar, Idealized","Charming and silly. Anything is better than 90% of movies that are about drugs, murder, theft, liars, bad rich ppl, helpless poor people, and everything swims with violence and explicit nudity and/or sex.

I love movies that are fables or morality stories of some kind, because when are they not helpful? Even as reminders of what's important.

The ugliness of humanity is front and center of daily news and tv shows. I prefer shows that give us a break, making us think, teach us about the world or even...giving us hope.

This movie has the greats acting so, I will keep watching. Worth it. No idea what's real though, maybe that doesn't matter.

Now at the end. Well done. Reviewers were 10 steps ahead of me. How delightful.

Too much Kleenex now. Got it. I get it! My Dad, my mother. Even me. Hard ending and yet terrific. It is hard to watch as my parents are on the cusp. Me, not long after I think. And, there you are. Howl!",7
26 September 2021,there are so many good messages in this and this is definitely an underrated Burton film,"Big Fish (2003) is a movie I recently watched on Amazon Prime and tells the tale of a man whose father is dying of cancer. His entire life the man hasn't felt close to his father because he's a traveling sales man who speaks in robust stories instead of straightforward and to the point. The man tries to share some of these stories with the audience while trying to uncover some truths abut his father before it is too late and he can't tell his own children about the man that was his dad. This movie is directed by Tim Burton (Edwards Scissorhands) and stars Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting), Albert Finney (Murder on the Orient Express), Steve Buscemi (Reservoir Dog), Danny DeVito (Batman Returns), Jessica Lange (Tootsie), Helena Bonham Carter (Sweeney Todd) and Matthew McGrory (House of 1,000 Corpses). The narration in this is fantastic and the movie is very well told with fascinating settings, random scenarios, larger than life characters and magical events/circumstances. It is impossible to not wonder what's going to happen next. I also loved the analogies and metaphors throughout the film. This movie is very smart and well written. The cast is also outstanding and everyone delivers remarkable performances. There's some great relationships depicted in this between father/son, wife/husband and friends and how being a good guy and yourself can be perceived as both positively and negative depending on the audience. Overall there are so many good messages in this, definitely an underrated Burton film. I would strongly recommend seeing this and score it a 9/10.",9

27 December 2003,"Big Fish, Twice The Man","Greetings again from the darkness. Macabre director-extraordinare Tim Burton delivers his most mainstream, warm-hearted film to date. Based on the Daniel Wallace novel, ""Big Fish"" is a wonderful double-edged story of the tall tales told by Albert Finney/Ewan McGregor and his relationship with his son played by Billy Crudup (""Almost Famous""). The film features a tremendous cast including Jessica Lange/Alison Lohman as the wife of Finney/McGregor, Burton's real life wife, Helena Bonham Carter (also in a dual role), Danny DeVito, (an overacting) Steve Buscemi and Loudon Wainwright III (of ""Dead Skunk"" fame). I do not wish to give anything away but the story is a mixture of ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Forrest Gump"" and ""The Princess Bride"". Burton's remarkable direction, mostly top notch acting, and an extremely entertaining story make this a ""must see"" for film goers ages 13 and up. Younger kids would probably have a difficult time keeping up with the pace of the story. I keep patiently waiting for Billy Crudup to become the star he should be. Why must we be inundated with Ben Affleck films when Crudup is much more talented? Also, Alison Lohman continues to put together an impressive resume, building upon her success in ""Matchstick Men"" and ""White Oleander"". It is a pleasure to watch her development as an actress.",9

22 December 2003,A winning whopper,"BIG FISH (2003) **1/2 Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Helena Bonham Carter, Danny De Vito, Robert Guillaume, Steve Buscemi, Matthew McGrory, Loudon Wainwright III, Missi Pyle, Marion Cotillard, Ada Tai, Arlene Tai. Engaging yet meandering bit of tall-tale telling envisioned by Tim Burton's adaptation of Daniel Wallace's novel (screenplay by John August does it's best to get the whimsy balanced with poignancy) about an estranged son and father (Crudup and the always watchable Finney) who try to re-unite before it's too late  the dad is dying  despite the non-stop whoppers told over the years that blend fictional fantasy into fact.

Embued by a fantastic ensemble (McGregor uncannily channeling Finney from his heyday in the flashback narrative and Lohman becoming Lane) and a unique production design by Dennis Gasner creating a parallel universe of sorts only shows the weakness of the long-windedness of the narrative that at times creaks along in its gradual pacing which hinders the heart of an otherwise exceptional  and this time very personal  take by Burton.

17 September 2023,"That is all it is, a big fish","(2003) Big Fish FANTASY/ DRAMA/ ROMANTIC

Adapted from the novel ""Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions"" by Daniel Wallace which even after my second viewing after many many months, about artificial and impossible events happening to just one person (Albert Finney) often told to, to which his biological son questions since it defies physics and common sense is kind of delusional making viewers asking if the already grown up son doesn't believe half the sh-t that's been told to him by his father instead of just going to some of those places and find out. The film is also very picturesque and self-indulgent, almost like showcasing an fortunate person when s/he wins the lottery. The second of seven movies actress Helena Bonham Carter collaborated with director Tim Burton.

4 February 2006,Boring collage,"There is a certain type of good musicians who want to compose, yet are able only of bunch of good overtures never a self-contained solid piece. The movie feels like being itself a product of this kind of creative mind. Moreover the idea is presented as stories of one character who is the crazy storyteller himself. It is a mixture of picturesque stories that built an ego of an old chap who happened to have an eager audience in his own family. This is how the film gains sentiment and integrity. I can't believe that this sentimental crap got 8 points. The start is very puzzling. First 15 minutes I had a tough time to orientate myself ..it looked just like a big challenge or a big hype....the latter it was. Credit goes to the form.

14 March 2022,A fisherman's fable of big adventures,"""Big Fish"" is a wonderful film about story-telling. It's a drama, comedy and adventure film built on fantasy. Every dad should have such stories to tell his sons. A tremendous cast populates the screen in this story about a father and son falling out and then reuniting. This is a film best seen on the big screen, as I first did. But it's okay for any size screen. It stars one of the new rising stars of the 21st century, Ewan McGregor; and one of the greatest actors of all time who never won an Academy Award, Albert Finney. Among the rest of the star-studded cast are Jessica Lange, Billy Crudup, Helena Bonham Carter, Marion Cotillard, and Danny DeVito.

This film has a very enjoyable mix of fantasy with some dazzling glitter and adventure. The drama takes place as the dying Ed Bloom (Finney) recounts more of his many past exciting adventures to his son (Crudup). As the young Bloom (McGregor) stars in baseball and football, parachutes into combat in the Korean War, pursues his wife, Sandra (Lohman and Lange), joins a circus and rescues a town from a giant, Ed's stories first regaled Will when he was young, but soon turned him against his father as a big fabricator of lies. Only in his dad's illness, with Will and his wife staying with his dad and his mother, do the two men reconcile.

Then, the very nice surprise ending has a large assortment of characters of all kinds coming to pay respects to Ed, and rekindle Will's interest in his dad's fantastic stories. This is a fun film that should entertain movie fans for decades to come. Anyone who's ever told a whopper about the big fish that got away should find a little satisfaction in this amusing and warm film.",8
10 March 2016,Big Film.,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

28 December 2005,There are stories and there are lies and they are different,"Big Fish is about a man who tells stories. He does not utter untruths with the deliberate intent to deceive, he merely embellishes what is already there to make it more interesting. His son (and some reviewers) does not understand this. The story about Edward Bloom is told by himself, in the form of his stories rather than as a straightforward narrative of his life. There have been lots of traveling salesmen who have mad a middling success of their lives. The world is full of their grandchildren who do not even know their full names, much less anything interesting. My grandfather was on the first trip an electric car took the length of the state of Connecticut when he was 20. Not much there. My grandfather was a charter member of the American Automobile Association, known as the AAA. Back in the early days AAA members would survey routes and contribute their notes to the AAA travel books. And thus a story begins. Beats hell out of that other one-sentence narrative, and it is not a lie, it has decorative flourishes. And that's what Edward Bloom was about and that is what his son learns about his father who was loved by many more people than he suspected.",10
27 February 2004,A Modern Munchausen,"Tim Burton is generally at his best directing quirky, offbeat films such as `Edward Scissorhands' or `Ed Wood', and less entertaining when he moves into the mainstream. His two `Batman' movies, although better than their successors and containing some original touches, were just another manifestation of Hollywood's long love affair (dating back to the original `Superman' in the late seventies, and still continuing) with the comic-book superhero, while his recent `Planet of the Apes' was an example of a redundant remake of an original that never needed to be remade.

`Big Fish', however, is a film of the type at which Burton excels. The central character, Edward Bloom, is a Baron Munchausen type character, much given to telling entertaining tall stories about his past. (It is interesting that several of Burton's films have a central character named Edward). These stories, however, are not always appreciated by his family, especially by his son William. The film opens with a quarrel between the two men at William's wedding when Edward tells a story about how he once caught an enormous fish which had earlier swallowed his wedding ring. After this, the two do not speak to one another for three years and William only returns home when he hears that his father is seriously ill.

William is a rather prosaic, priggish young man. If Edward is a Munchausen figure, William is the spiritual descendant of Dickens's Thomas Gradgrind, a man for whom everything other than hard fact is either nonsense or a lie. He complains that Edward's fictions have always prevented from getting to know his `real' father and wants to be told the pure, unembellished truth about his father's life. Even in the final days of his life, however, Edward persists in telling his old stories, and William tries to make sense of these in an attempt to get at the facts. (It is perhaps ironic that William lives and works in Paris- in American films generally the city of romance and dreams- and even has a view of the Eiffel Tower from his office window).

The film proceeds to tell Edward's life-story as narrated by himself, intercut with scenes set in the present day. The earlier scenes relate a series of bizarre adventures reminiscent of `Alice in Wonderland.' Edward meets a witch whose glass eye can foretell the future, befriends a twelve-foot giant, stumbles across an unreal, eerily perfect village where there are no roads and everyone goes barefoot, works in a circus to win the love of his life, serves in the Korean War when he has an adventure involving a pair of female conjoined twins, and takes part, together with a poet, in an unsuccessful bank robbery. This part of the film is shot in a surreal, dreamlike style with some striking visual images- most notably the shots of the village of Spectre and the scene where Edward woos his future wife standing in a whole field of daffodils (which he has been told are her favourite flower).

All of the parts are well played, but the best acting performances are from the two actors who play Edward. Albert Finney plays the ageing Edward as an entertaining old rogue, and Ewan McGregor plays him as he was in his younger days, or rather as he would have liked to have been in his younger days- smarter, better-looking and more successful than he doubtless was in reality, and possibly younger too. It is notable that Ewan McGregor appears to be around the same age as Alison Lohman who plays Edward's wife Sandra as a young woman, whereas Jessica Lange, who plays the older Sandra, is markedly younger than Finney's character. In some films I would have put this discrepancy down simply to lazy casting, but here I suspect it is a deliberate way of increasing the film's surreal atmosphere.

As the film progresses, there are indications that there may be a core of truth in some of Edward's stories- William discovers that his father did indeed serve in Korea and that Spectre is a real place- but we never find out exactly how much is true and how much is invention. Nor are we meant to. The central theme of the film is the importance of the imagination. The truth about a man cannot be discovered from bare facts of his life alone without taking into account his imaginative inner world. The `real self', if it lies anywhere, lies in this inner world and in the private mythology which we construct for ourselves. The film comes to an emotionally satisfying conclusion as the world of real life and the world of Edward's imagination fuse together, Edward's life comes to a triumphant end and William comes to accept his father for what he is. I would rate this as the best movie yet that I have seen from Tim Burton. 9/10.",9
7 January 2004,You may be ready to understand your parents better than you thought possible.,"A fable about a fabulist told by a fabled director. Tim Burton's `Big Fish' is an imaginative rendering of children's universal longing to know their parents fully before the final separation. Equally as important to anyone who tells stories, like creative parents, writers, and directors, is the film's depiction of the complex relationship between the storyteller and the audience. Burton carries both themes in his characteristically flamboyant (`Edward Scissorhands,' `Batman') style that includes fairytales and outright magic realism. `The Wizard of Oz,' `Fisher King,' and `Princess Bride' come immediately to mind of other American films that have succeeded in a genre perfected by Latin artists.

Storyteller Edward (Albert Finney) is on his deathbed. His son, Will (Billy Crudup), who long ago discarded his dad's fabulous stories and his dad, now tries to understand who his dad is underneath those lies by questioning dad and searching family history for clues. The magical scenes of dad's meeting a giant and tree monsters in a forest, and conjoined singers at a Red Army talent show, experiencing an unreal but perfect town called Specter, and getting involved with a bizarre circus are successfully rendered by a director whose dark but lyrical side is well documented (`Nightmare Before Christmas, ` `Sleepy Hollow'). The question about the truth of the stories becomes academic because son must meet dad on his fabulous terms or forever hold his peace.

As Ewan McGregor (the young Edward) did in `Moulin Rouge,' he can walk between innocence and experience as well as any actor today. Albert Finney's Southern accent from his British mouth is flawless, just like his uncompromising take on a father whose tall tales demand respect for the wisdom they offer and the truth that may lurk underneath them. On the level that requires a détente between father and son, Burton marvelously takes no sides: When father asks son who he wants him to be, the melancholic truths that father may have hidden behind his stories all his life are balanced by the need for a son to accept a father on his terms, not the son's.

Burton is far less clear on the matter of the storyteller's relationship to the audience. It seems that if the listener suspends disbelief, the story will enrich the present and future with meanings heretofore hidden by the dull demands of the quotidian. A story about an elusive `big fish' becomes more than a child's fish tale; it reveals truths about ambition and cunning and generosity, with a subtle comment on the sanctity of marriage (a marriage ring is prominent, not far from the figurative subtext of `Lord of the Rings').

Even Burton's choice of actors underscores the conjunction of real and unreal: the actors in the different eras of the family's life look remarkably like their young or old characters, an uncanny touch to test our skepticism about all the tales. What's real and what is not matters little when you confront a parent you have never understood or a story you are struggling to tell. Homer's Odysseus travels to the world of giants and sea creatures as well in what turns out to be a journey into understanding himself as adventurer, storyteller, and husband. Burton is brilliant, maybe not Homer, but for the 21st century, he is the pre-eminently fabulous storyteller. The film's weakness of never letting us know why dad tells these endless stories can be borne only if you enjoy the tale and the journey; you may then be ready to understand your parents better than you thought possible.

As Will puts it, ""In telling the story of my father's life, it's impossible to separate fact from fiction, the man from the myth."" We all could say the same.",
7 May 2013,The tears are earned - not extracted,"At first glance, Big Fish seems like a Tim Burton film grounded in reality; a picture of his that finally abandons his unconditional love for fantasy in favor of a more realistic, recognizable world. However, the fantasy is even greater here, and only uses its reality and recognizable qualities as a backdrop for a moving, poetic parable on life itself in one of the grandest ways.

Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is a middle-aged man who has long been in a strong relationship with his mother but not his father. His father has a way of attempting to generate connection and likability through stories that seem to only serve as charming, whimsical little tales to amuse a small child. When his father becomes bed-stricken, he desperately wants to know more about who he is. He is tired of having a father/son relationship solely built on what appears as a mutual understanding between two people that live in the same house.

Of course his father, Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), gives the explanation the only way he can give it - through a larger than life story. In these flashbacks showing his young life he is played by Ewan McGregor, a perfect fit for the enigmatic Edward. These flashbacks detail persistency, young-love, passion, and several other themes and morals better than some films do on their own. Often, we'll pounce back into reality with Will taking care of his father or furthering an attempting at long overdue connection.

I know I""m not the only soul who can relate to Big Fish's portrayal of father/son disconnect. Even as I continue to live with my father in my teen years, I can't help but think of him as someone I know very well rather than my all-powerful father. I love him, certainly, but our drastic difference put us at what I call a quandary that is unable to remedied. The film succeeds in showing that even if there's no spark between you and a parent, you're only given one set of biological parents and you should make an attempt at the strongest connection possible.

Big Fish is visually marvelous and explicitly potent when it reaches the flashback sequences. Burton isn't as dark or as Gothic as he could be and simply enjoys emphasizing the unique, vibrant environments of each specific flashback. I feared early on that this film would be one I could only admire, as alienation began to sit in. And yet, Burton - a true cinematic auteur - doesn't keep viewers at arm's length with the material. He has his own tricks of pulling an audience-member into the film and it definitely shows here. I can't recall another film when I went from alienation to comfort so quickly.

The concept of a father attempting to provide his son with insight and significance of his existence - and his ability to connect with others on a personal level - is not different from what renowned Swedish director Ingmar Bergman captured beautifully in his film Wild Strawberries. The story concerned a daughter, now well-grown and a functioning adult, attempting to get closer to her father who has always been able to generate smiles and charm from strangers but not close family. One strength it possessed over Big Fish was its lack of ambiguity and abstraction. Ultimately, these features give this film one of its greatest strengths and, simultaneously, one of its greatest weaknesses. The abstraction makes the film not open to one interpretation, but it also somewhat prevents strong connection with characters.

Big Fish benefits from a strong sense of imagination and emotion, which comes through in the very wend. It's less surprising but very moving, and is captured in an unconventional way. It doesn't feel like tears are being extracted, but earned and deserved as the film doesn't play the game of emotional manipulation. Burton erects a nicely-articulated, magical wonderland with flowing music and limitless characters. Just in that respect the tears don't seem to be obligatory.

15 May 2004,uneven but ultimately moving,"`Big Fish' is the latest bit of calculated whimsy from famed director Tim Burton. With a screenplay by John August based on the Daniel Wallace novel, Burton tells the tale of Edward Bloom, a man whose whole life has been one `big fish story' after another. Now old and facing death, Bloom needs to come up with a rousing finale to cap off his largely fictionalized life. Bloom's son, William, a realist and pragmatist, bitterly resents the `lies' his father has been feeding him ever since he was a boy, and yearns, in these last moments together, to hear the `true' story of the old man's life. But, in his investigation into the veracity of all the tall tales he's been told, William discovers that there may be more truth to these myths and legends than he has ever allowed himself to believe. He also realizes that, in debunking all the whoppers, he will be depriving his father of the one real trait that defines him as a person and that distinguishes him from everybody else.

The title of the film actually functions on two symbolic levels simultaneously. On the one hand, it reflects the fictionalized nature of Bloom's life and the grandiose egotism of his character. On the other, Bloom is, himself, the `big fish' in a small pond, as he leaves his mark on the world around him. `Big Fish' is actually most effective in the scenes set in the present, as father and son come to terms with the quality that each dislikes most about the other. William feels deceived by a father who, despite the fact that he made himself appear to be a larger-than-life heroic figure, was actually just a mediocre, often-absent dad, too busy with his secret `fantasy' life to make time for his own lonely son (the story has strong echoes of `Death of a Salesman' in its underlying vision and theme). Bloom, in a similar way, finds his son lacking in the kind of large-scale imagination that Bloom feels makes life worth living.

The film is considerably less successful in the `flashback' scenes tracing Bloom's life from his own birth to his son's early childhood. The scenes are all elaborately staged in the best Tim Burton manner  filled with hauntingly mythical settings, surrealistic events and doses of Magic Realism - but the filmmakers can't overcome the unfortunate fact that these sequences are essentially as uninteresting and irritating as real `fish stories' tend to be. Bloom's `adventures' come across as dime-novel vignettes, which is supposed to be the point, I guess, but it still means that we are squirming with impatience through large  indeed very large  stretches of the film. Every time we come back to the present  to real, flesh-and-blood human beings  our interest picks back up. That's why the film, in its latter stages, becomes such a moving and profound experience, as we finally get to see and know the real man who is Edward Bloom, wrinkles, warts and all.

Burton has assembled a wonderful cast for the occasion. The marvelous Albert Finney plays the dying Bloom and invests the film with an emotional depth just by his mere presence in the role. Ewan MacGregor does a fine job as the young, idealistic Bloom, while Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman enact the parts of Bloom's wife present and past (MacGregor and Lohman look as if they could truly grow up to be Finney and Lange). Billy Crudup brings a subtle depth to the role of William and the scenes between him and Finney truly touch the heart. Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny De Vito round out the impressive cast.

Maybe it says more about me than it does about the film that I ended up liking the parts that were the LEAST Burton-esque the best. But, then again, this is from someone who thinks that the comparatively earthbound `Ed Wood' is Burton's best film.",
5 March 2004,"I saw Big Fish, I hated it.","I saw Big Fish, I hated it. So many people liked it. This left me wondering what I missed. I sat and watched hours of this mans fantasy life but I didn't care. I know nothing about this man except that he irritated his son. What did his wife think about his behavior? What about his sons very charming wife? Why did he make up these stories? Some sappy music when he died told me to be sad, and I learned that a fantasy life had a good side as well as bad. And I was told to be glad that the son came to accept his father as he was but like the son I found these fantasies long tedious and boring, unlike the son I did not get to know the father so I did not care.

17 September 2015,The truth can be relative.,"In this film we see Will Bloom's efforts (Billy Crudup) to know the true life story of his father, Ed (Albert Finney / Ewan McGregor), who's dying and that is reputed to be a great storyteller, but never tell the truth about his own past.

The family and family ties are very present in this film, which seeks to show how important its to know and understand our family. What is the barrier that separates truth from falsehood? Can a man, telling the truth, be lying? Can what seems a lie to be the truth? The truth can seem like a lie? Who Is Ed Bloom, what's his past? That's what Will try to understand, feel frustrated that he does not know his own father, and fearing being unable to speak to his son, who will be born soon and will naturally want to know who was his grandfather. On his trip, Ed will be confronted with the lies and stories thought to be invented by Ed. A magical film, touching, that shows us how relative (and irrelevant) may be the truth when there is love and understanding.

11 May 2004,Life is a fairytale when u believe!,"Well, this one is definitely a masterpiece! Anyone who thinks it's not that good, so what are u expecting, eh?

It's got so many great lines, great philosophies, great stories, it's just couldn't be any greater. Big Fish has it all. In fact, I think this is how a great movie should be, particularly drama. No need to state specifically what is drawing me to this one, I just wanna say that I'm happy this flick comes out while I'm still alive, yea, it is that great.

Because my native language isn't English, and even if that was my native language still I can't find more words to express how much I love this BIG FISH. Of course, those unbelievably mysterious fancy stories are the coolest part of the whole movie, Tim Burton did a great job bringing those things to life, and everyone in the cast also gave us an extraordinary incredible and unforgettable performance.

17 February 2005,Emotional Truth,"The important truths of one's life are revealed in how they embellish the facts, maybe not the dry hard truth but certainly the more profound emotional truth. That's what Will (Billy Crudup) comes to realize in the last days of his dying, eccentric, story telling father, a man he feels he's never gotten to know because he believes that his father's tall tales are an annoying diversion that prevent anyone from knowing the real man. What he comes to learn is exactly the opposite, which is that his father with his amusing yarns has been telling the world volumes more about himself and the real truth of his vision than any fact sheet could hope to reveal. In essence he's come closer to baring the inner dreams of his soul than most men do, no matter how ""honest"" they might attempt to be.

This is a Tim Burton masterpiece and a gem in storytelling in itself. Of course the trademark Burton visuals are here and never used to better effect and have never been more appealing. This one stands high right next to ""Scissorhands"" and ""Nightmare"" as a film that will mark Burton's place in film history. This one's a bona fide 10. If you find a good fish story told well brings a wry smile to your face then by all means don't let this one get away.",10
9 September 2009,Life Can Be One Colourful Giant Of An Adventure,"I have loved all of Tim Burton's films (with the exception of 'Planet Of The Apes') which I didn't bother to watch) and here is another treat from the guy. 'Big Fish' is perhaps Burton's most colourful film to date. With its exquisite visuals, fascinating characters, captivating storytelling, astonishing cinematography and first rate special effects, 'Big Fish' is a heartwarming feast for the eyes. With numerous metaphors, symbolism and philosophy, Burton decorates 'Big Fish' with layers. There are plenty of references to artworks, such as the scene with the big fish in the lake refers to masterpainter Escher's 'Three Worlds'.

On the surface, it looks like one of Burton's 'least darkest' movies but as one peels the layers it becomes apparent that things aren't so black and white. Yet, 'Big Fish' is a movie about life and love. It tells the story of Ed Bloom who is a storyteller loved by all except his son, Will. Will struggles to accept his the fact that his father tells his fantastical life story as though it all really happened. From here on, the viewer is drawn into Ed's magical journey of life where we meet a ringmaster, a giant, a fish, two conjoined twins, a witch and many more curious characters and Will's journey into accepting and loving his father for who he is and what he's done.

The performances are first rate. Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor are topnoth as Ed Bloom. Finney brings across wisdom and dignity while McGregor brings a youthfulness and curiosity to the character. Likewise with the wonderful Jessica Lange and luminous Alison Lohman. The resemblance between these two actresses is eery to say the least. Billy Crudup is appropriately restrained and the lovely Marion Cotillard shines. Helena Bonham Carter is marvelous. Steve Buscemi and Danny Devito are hilarious and Matthew McGrory is very good.

For me, Burton's movies are a magical cinematic experience. 'Big Fish' is a different kind of magic because it's not as Gothic as his other works but the quality is equally superior. It's one of a kind.",
27 December 2011,Tim Burton's Masterpiece!,"Big Fish is no doubt one of if not the best movie Tim Burton has ever made. This is such a masterpiece! Maybe I say that because it's different, strange, moving, and it's not like the traditional movie audiences watch in this time period.

This is about how Edward Bloom's son is trying to find out the truth about his father because it seems that Ed Bloom always tell stories about himself and would never tell the truth.

This is a very wonderfully acted movie. I was engrossed in all the characters. Albert Brooks makes a very convincing old Bloom. Danny DeVito kind of reminded me from his role as The Penguin in Batman Returns but much more kinder.

Overall, this is a heartwarming story that people should love. Tim Burton is a masterful, visionary director. The score by Danny Elfman is one of his best too. I rate this film 10/10.",10
25 January 2019,Fascinating Attempt,"12 January 2004. A touching ""Forest Gump"" on LSD/acid trip. This movie has all those surrealistic elements as well as the emotional buttons that make for a sentimental and fantastic voyage of discovery. The Forest Gump voice-over and the tall tales as if taken from a twilight zone episode series takes the audience on a flashback and present, father/son adventure of almost magical but bumpy story (it's almost as if there were several directors changing the style and appearance of the movie).

The fascinating ending destination, the tie-ins, turn arounds are cute and heart-felt, but it seems that the whole story was destined to conclude this way (but the last tale told is from the heart and burns into memory an important relational message). The movie never quite reaches the pinnacle of surrealistic, Twilight Zone, Rod Serling brilliance, never quite completely satisfies with its erratic editing and slightly off-beat cinematography.

However, this movie does deserve an honorary mention for its almost Independent film imagery and its innovative and creative weaving tapestry with a few missed strands and threads of the needle.",7
6 April 2004,When you don't share other's enthusiasm...,"It gives a strange feeling, going to the cinema when you received so many positive comments and read good reviews and...when out...you start trying to understand why you did not receive anything from the movie. Tim Burton is a very creative director, with an explosive genius for invention, but the movie simply does give the impression to be looking to explore the immense resources of human kind but it confines itself to the level of a nice, well presented and funny fairytale, with a touch of self obligingness and a tendency to capture the tears of the public.

No, this looks like an ambitious shot which has missed his target because it was too...big.

12 March 2023,"""Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?""","Big Fish (2003) -

The beginning of this film could be described as a jumble, because it was hard to tell who was who and it jumped quite a lot, but as it developed and it became clearer, it really did enchant. Perhaps I only noticed the jumble because it was not my first time watching it.

I seemed to remember being very curious to see how things would develop from the dark and straight laced start to the magic and wonder that had appeared on the DVD cover and in the trailers. That was probably what had kept me interested the first time around, but this time around I found myself waiting for the central character, Ed, to get going on the fun journey I knew awaited him from previous viewings. The grumpy bit with the son, Will, played by Billy Crudup, just got in the way of that fun and I'm not Billy's biggest fan anyway.

As a Tim Burton production it was obviously not going to be an everyday film about a son estranged from his father.

And there were definite Burton touches to this film, things that were so specifically him that it would be impossible to say otherwise. The synchronised lawn mowing and the camera filters used for example and Helena Bonham Carter of course. Not to forget the use of brighter colours during the happier times and the greyer shades in times of trouble.

It could be considered quite a bleak film in some respects. Edward Bloom's declining health would not essentially be something that films usually celebrate, but it was used as a chance to go back over his extraordinary life which brought so many laughs and joyous moments that made it such a pleasure to watch.

Although he has been growing on me lately, I've never really been Albert Finney's biggest fan either (I quite often confuse him with Brian Cox, who plays such nasty people in things, so maybe that's why?), but the character he delivered as the older version of Edward Bloom really was superbly shaped and fun, the type of guy I'd hang out with at the local pub, to hear the tall tales.

And Ewan MacGregor playing his younger self did it with such aplomb and joy too. His chapters were all exaggerated in the way they were acted and directed, filmed, and lit, etc, which I wouldn't normally like, but it was done to show how the older Bloom liked to elaborate on and embellish the tales of his life and therefore worked really well as a contrast.

There were some elements that were a bit hard to explain or overlooked, but in a story such as this it could be forgiven and I probably only spotted them because I was reviewing it.

Ultimately the story tells of a life well lived and how we can make what we have enjoyable and extraordinary or we can have the mundane.

It was a tale that I would like to have believed was true, for all the goodness in it, or at least based on a true account, but it didn't appear to be.

I haven't always enjoyed Mr. Burton's works, but I'm sure that this film will always be on my viewing list.

30 June 2004,fantasy... what is real?,"I saw this movie today and it reminded me of childhood on how everything seemed to be a amazing story of adventures. This movie was I think one of the best I have ever seen from a Tim Burton film. I could`nt and did`nt want to move from my seat,it was a suprisingly unique film..... I`m not one to give to anything a way so I suggest keeping an open mind and take a plunge and see the movie you will enjoy it.

5 stars ***** Happy Viewing

3 April 2009,A Good Catch,"A dying man reflects on his life and all the great adventures he has experienced - or is he telling tall tales? Although somewhat disjointed and not completely satisfying, this unique film is quite charming. Finney is the old man and McGregor plays him in his younger days as a dashing hero. Both turn in capable performances, helped by a good supporting cast that includes a host of familiar faces, including Crudup as Finney's son, Lange as his wife, and DeVito as a circus performer. It's funny to see Devito tower over the even more diminutive Deep Roy. This is perhaps Burton's best film, as he perfectly captures the whimsy and playfulness of the story.

9 November 2008,We are all the mythical fish of some one else,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

28 January 2004,"""I (wrote) to say no to death.""- Cornell Woolrich","A very tall tale, indeed, told with admirable restraint.

Eight years ago, my wife and I started a writing group that meets one night a week (at a local coffee shop-cum-bookstore) to this very day. Like Woolrich and probably every wannabe wordsmith who puts pen to paper, I write to say no to death; to leave behind something more than a lump of worm-eaten landfill. Like the old man in this movie. [Or the author of the book upon which this movie is based, whose sister I met not long ago.] THAT'S what it's all about.

And you shoulda seen the one that got away...

28 April 2020,Whach it! ^^,"I love this movie because it is the freshest and most entertaining that you can see, alone or with your family, the plot keeps you between reality and fantasy and despite having somewhat funny effects, I consider it to be very well made, point for the Cameraman and production (I also think that this director and the entire cast are really good :') ), on the other hand, he always gives you a feeling of inspiration and joy, in addition to ... Can you discover how far reality goes?

11 July 2016,A Very Unique Film,"I just really like Tim Burton. Why? He makes movies that are different. Movies that don't follow the exact same pattern as every other movie. This movie is just one of his finest examples. With this movie, you just stay pleased the whole time you are watching it. Wonderful story telling. It's heart-warming, and typically I hate that type of thing in movies, but this movie makes it enjoyable. This is no action movie, I'm an action movie guy, but i love this movie. Ewan McGregor's performance just enhances the film even more, definitely his second most memorable role to me. The colors in this movie are bright and vivid during the story telling portions of the film, and I've always found that extremely appealing to the eye. Its a very adventurous movie. I mean it's hard to explain, because this movie is so unique. You just have to watch it for yourself. It's one of the best stand-alone movies I've ever watched.

23 December 2012,A warmhearted ode to versatility and individuality,"Another Tim Burton's masterpiece - and less fiction and imagination as usual, but skilled and nuanced emphases on important general topics like cross-generation attitudes, family ties, true love/friendship/commitment - included, but not limited to. The story runs smoothly and obvious extravagance provides additional value to the movie, not cutting and not impairing it. Although the background is father's lethal illness, there are lot of nice and funny moments, and the mood of the ending becomes different than the circumstances otherwise expect.

And the cast, quite a dream-team: Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Marion Cotillard, Helena Bonham Carter, Danny DeVito, Steve Buscemi... Only Billy Crudup as William Bloom seemed too ordinary among the others.

Anyway, the movie is recommended to admirers of Burton and/or those fond of warm tutorial movies.",8
16 January 2008,a larger-than-life adventure,"As a young man, Edward Bloom was always a hopeful dreamer who reached for the stars. As an old man, he's become a warm, peerless storyteller to strangers, but to his son William he remains an enigma. Through a series of vividly imaginative flashbacks, William finally comes to know the father he never knew he had. On the surface, Tim Burton's enchanting tale is a visual playground of magic and myth, fantasy and reality, fable and folklore, but at its heart is a thoughtful, endearing bond between father and son. A dazzling and touching story with unforgettable characters, quirky humor, and an overall feel-good tone. Lots of elements effectively combined make this one enjoyable from start to finish. ***

12 July 2015,Immortal Father-Son Story,"Big Fish tells the tale of Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) as he tries to learn the true story about his dying father's life. The stories that Will knows about Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) are fact and fiction blended and Will spends his time for most of the film trying to separate the two. The audience views the journey of Young Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor) through flashbacks as Will recaps the tales his father has told over the years.

Director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands) and Cinematographer Philippe Rousselot (A River Runs Through It, Remember the Titans) create a tall tale world that combines both fact and fiction, the story of Edward Bloom. It could have been very easy for the effects to feel awkward, but they truly compliment the stunning story.

The cast in the film is immense in talent. Supporting Crudup, McGregor, and Finney are: Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter, Allison Lohman, Robert Guillame, Matthew McGrory, Marion Cotillard, Steve Buscemi, and Danny DeVito. Each bring their own brilliance to the story and together they make the film shine bright.

Will Bloom has to come to terms with his father, Edward, and he has to decide how he wants to view the legacy of the man. The climax of the story places the film in the category of the last word uttered, immortal. Do not miss this beautiful film.",9
17 January 2022,Edward Bloom is heck of a character. He deserves a pat on the back and a punch to the face.,"I have seen this film twice and I have had a deeply polarized reaction to it on my two viewings. The first time I hated it. The second time I loved it. The main issue is Edward's stories-as whimsical, dryly funny and charming as they are-can come off as sadistic torment from his son's perspective. Back in 2003 I saw the film from William's perspective-and found the film deeply frustrating because of that. I just re-watched it in 2021 and I managed to see the tales with Edward's eyes and I got why the character tells the tales he does. As such I was completely charmed.

I think most people will get both reactions to various degrees. And I think the film is great because the story of the film is how to reconcile both the father's and son's perspectives. This is a surprisingly deep and complicated film from Burton-given how much Burton loves to stay on the surface of things.

For the Burton film fans this has Burton's love for the unusual, the dark whimsey of a lot of his films and of course everything is just so. It is a heartwarming film-or rage inducing-but it is still clearly a Burton film.",10
16 January 2023,Big Mouth,"""Big Fish"" seems like the equivalent of reading a hyper-linked e-book: in place of an author, who seems off in some abstracted space, is the father teller, who is even more blinkered in this tall tale narrative. To boot, this narrator has a big mouth, a folksy voice, an inflated ego, and a juvenile psyche. He seems half old and half child. And is attended on by family faeries, and a subservient pop culture audience.

We, the lucky ones, get to spend more time with his parade of cartoon floats, than with his actual spiel. Cute, sexy, prankish, obsessive, singular, impulsive... stuff so intensely felt. Acrobats, soothsayers, dog & pony shows, deviant attractions all in the medium of the grotesque, & the menacing. One thinks of what would be inappropriate stories for children in all past eras-- but not in this present one, because here the video portals are wide open, and self-surrender to these superficial, and insincere Hollywood-certified tales signifies cheer, inhibition & chic.

Magnifying the father's entertaining yarns are various electronic feats which offer a synthetic ambience, a mix of stimulation and simulation from the technologists' palette. Each of the separate links display a triumphant distractive quality--devitalized, glossy, and clever. The glib eroticism of the Siamese twins (attended by glaring racism) is rapt up in the same robo-stasis irrationality that characterizes most of this loop of semiconscious tales.

""Big Fish"" is then a coolly detached amplification of a father's unquestioned insistence that the world revolves around himself. There are no subjects, experiences, stories outside of his own. His arts-backed tales are bigger than life and apart from life. Not al all to be viewed as some nebulous pathology, but as perfectly within a societal permissibility that encourages his excessive narrator's demands.",4
13 April 2021,AWWW.,"There are tall tales, and then there's Big Fish. From the visuals to the story to the score, this is such a beautiful film. Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Marion Cotillard and the rest of the cast all bring a sense of humanity to this fantastic tale.

24 October 2021,"A good movie, that could have been even better.","""Big Fish"" is in essence a film about a father - son relation.

The son is a journalst who makes stories about reality. The father is a story teller who tries to make realities out of his stories. No wonder their relationship is complex.

The son thinks for a long time that his father hides his real personality behind his stories. Only at the end he realises that the stories of his father are his real personality.

It is clear that in this father - son relationship Tim Burton is not neutral. His sympathy is clearly with the father. Much screentime is therefore defoted to the stories of the father, which are fairytales in themselves. In so doing the father - son relationship gets a bit in the background.

A good movie, that could have been even better.",8

2 February 2004,Quirky and lovable - Burton just about carries it off this time,"One of the quirkiest and lost lovable of films, Big Fish is about a grandfather who has perfected the art of telling bedtime stories. His stories are all made up, all feature fictionalised episodes from his own past life, and polished to a degree that make them in demand to children and adults alike (except to his own grown-up children, who have heard them once too often). The second most difficult thing about grandfather Ed Bloom is that he is constantly telling these stories. The most difficult thing is that, when it comes to his own life, he tells nothing else.

Most of the film is devoted to putting these stories into pictures, just as he tells them. Fantastical, endlessly inventive and incredibly entertaining, they would be enough for a film itself if only aimed at children; but what makes Big Fish a joy for adults as well as kids is that Ed Bloom's life becomes more than that, it becomes an illustration of the fantastic within all of us and how valuable that it. He is a self-mythologizing man, a living example of the magic that can put a sparkle of wonder in a child's eye, and remind us that imagination is a wonderful thing, not just for storytelling, but to realise the greatness within each of us. It is also one of whimsical and visionary director Tim Burton's most rounded and mature films to date, and makes good use of a star studded cast that includes Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter and Steve Buscemi. A film to leave you smiling all the way home.",7
4 September 2012,Very inspiring and original,"Has someone ever told you a story that was so awe-inspiring and so fantastic that you wondered if it could possibly be true? This is how William Bloom feels about his father, Edward Bloom. So much so that he doesn't even talk to him anymore. Edward Bloom is a storytelling, eager to tell everyone about his life adventures. Will knows they can't be true and so as his father grows close to death, he decides to set things straight. This film, based on Daniel Wallace's book, is one of my favorites because it clearly portrays a life well lived. Edward Bloom is one of the most inspiring characters I have ever seen on screen because he puts so much into life; and gets so much out of it. Tim Burton's usual films are quite dark in tone, but with this, he takes a break from that style, while still managing to put his unmistakable creativeness and true sense of wonder into it. I also highly recommend Daniel Wallace's book which is just as good, if not better, than the movie.

11 January 2004,A Rigidly Brittle Defense of the Storyteller as Artist,"I know what I was supposed to be feeling as I watched ""Big Fish,"" as Tim Burton banged me over the head with his theme on the importance of the storyteller enlivening our drab existence, but he was so insistent and rigid in this that I thought the whimsy and charm were drained out.

Maybe because I was more won over more by Billy Crudup as the cynical son living in the real world than Albert Finney as the tale-spinner who straddles reality and fantasy with Jessica Lange as his still-blonde devoted Stepford wife.

I'm a big fan of magic realism, from Bedford Falls to even ""Neverending Story,"" but the fantasy elements here were too brittle, starting with Ewen MacGregor, who shows none of Finney's ""Tom Jones"" flare when enacting his younger self, and the preternaturally too bright smiles that everyone stiffly wears in the stories to match the too bright M & M artificial colors cinematogragraphy by Philippe Rousselot under too much make-up, including on Alison Lohman, though she eerily mimics Lange's body language as her younger self.

Part of the fantasy includes the very fake Alabama accents, which are Network Standard Southern, even though they filmed near Mobile.

I wasn't sure if it was an intentionally transitional point in the movie as the fantasy elements start to intersect with the real world that we jarringly hear for the first time period-appropriate songs with ""5 O'clock World"" and the Allman Brothers' ""Travelin' Man."" The closing song by Eddy Vedder and Pearl Jam was lovely.",
11 April 2020,Beautiful.,"One of the most beautiful films ever made. It is a bit too much of a fairytale for my taste, but it's the point of the movie, I just wish there were more scenes in present time. I love how this film teachers us choosing our own lives the way we want to live them. The ending is just astonishingly beautiful.

2 January 2017,Great movie,"Simply an amazing movie. Well acted, great story. I've seen this 1000 times and still get tears eyed up at the end. Every story keeps you wanting more, and the present breaks your heart. There are few movies I can watch over and over and still get excited to watch again. In my opinion there is simply not a better told story of family and regret. The casting couldn't have been any better. I get involved with the characters at the start and want to embrace the whole family dynamic. More symbolism in this movie than any I could think of. I can't remember why I watched this movie for the first time, but am so glad I did. If you are into fantasy, acting, fun, and want something to awaken your imagination i couldn't suggest a better film. Tim Burton's masterpiece.

5 July 2006,An extremely imaginative and touching fantasy.,"Starring: Albert Finney, Ewan McGregor, Billy Crudup, Marion Cotillard, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Helena Bonham Carter, Matthew McGrory, Steve Buscemi, Danny Devito, Missi Pyle, David Denman, Ada Tai, Arlene Tai, Deep Roy and Robert Guillame.

It's amazing at how touching this film really is. The main plot is a series of flashbacks told by an old dying man, Ed Bloom, telling his son fantasy stories of his life that couldn't possibly have happened. His son, Will finds his dad to be crazy, but he tries to come to terms with him. The flashback story is very odd, including a poet turned bank robber, a giant, a town where nobody ever leaves, a witch that can tell you your death and even a circus master werewolf.

This entire movie you know how it will end, and it does end how you think it will. The end is sad and touching, just like the entire movie. Without a doubt this movie is Burton's lightest project and I suggest you carry a box of tissues with you when you watch it.

my rating: 4 1/2 out of 5 stars. PG-13 for Some violence, nudity and some language. 120 mins.",9

7 March 2005,How to make a grown man cry,"I think that the male ego prevents much emotion being shown on a regular basis. Certainly, I find that that is the case myself. However, there have been a few occasions where I have found the smallest traces of water forming in my eyes whilst watching a film. Yes, I guess they would just about constitute tears! Anyway, there are quite a few comedies that have generated tears of laughter, quite a few films that have had me crying through boredom. But I don't think that any film has generated proper heart felt emotion and made me blub as much as Big Fish.

The story centres on the relationship between a dying father and his son. The father is a story teller, and his whole life as told to his son has been greatly exaggerated, and turned into a fairytale. Realising that his father is dying, the son wishes to try and understand who he really is, and to discover the truth amongst the fiction.

I'm sorry, I realise that this makes the film sound very dull, but it most certainly is not - it is both tear jerkingly sad, yet uplifting. Tim Burton again using his genius imagination to make this film, and its larger than life characters and fairy tales, really come to life. Albeit, an exaggerated lie of a life.

I won't pretend that this film would be to everyones taste, but I do think that it deals with both life and death in a very uplifting way, and as such everybody should give it a few hours of their time.",9

12 August 2004,Strange and surreal,"There are tall tales; there are TALL tales; and then there's those told by Edward Bloom (played by Ewan McGregor as a young man and by Albert Finney as an old one). His son (Billy Crudup) believes very little, but just maybe there's more truth in these stores that he or we originally thought - and, in any event, sometimes the embellished truth is what what makes life more colourful and fun. Tim Burton (""Edward Scissorhands"" & ""Batman"") is the perfect director for such an entertaining, even enchanting, world of the strange and the surreal, but I'm never comfortable with British actors as familiar as McGregor, Finney and Helena Bonham Carter adopting American accents and the conclusion is oddly down-beat.

14 April 2004,Journey to the center of your mind.,"Big Fish is a pretty incredible story that, more than anything else, makes me wonder if this is how director Tim Burton viewed the world as a child. Judging by the atmosphere of his other films, I would guess that young Burton had a more wild imagination than most. And, it made for some fine films.

The movie starts out with one too many flashbacks in the first few minutes as Will is going to tell you (in too many words) that his father always told him storys, and that these are the stories you will see as he told them to him. But, after those few minutes, things work out smoothly once the audience is able to get one track about what's going on.

Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) as a boy, enjoyed his father's (Albert Finney) remarkable tall tales about himself as a bold, adventurous young man (Ewan McGregor). But, Will, later in life, is tired of hearing the stories repeated at every occassion as his father gladly orates to eager audiences the wild stories. As Will explains, ""The thing about icebergs in that you only see 10% of them. The other 90% are under water."" He thinks that his father's stories only reveal to him, 10 percent of who his father is. And as he is visiting his father who is dying of cancer, Will pleads with him to tell him some facts as he wants to share the legacy of his father with his own child, whom his wife is expecting. But as his father insists, these tall tales are anything but fiction, and are quite revealing of the true Edward Bloom. As the story goes along, the things we think to be fact and fiction are not always so.

This is especially a great movie for young kids. The movie is quite cartoonish in appearance, kind of like the live-action cartoonish atmosphere that Blake Edwards was able to achieve in 'The Great Race,' which aids in carrying you away to the reality of Edward Bloom.

Edward Bloom (both Finney and McGregor) narrates the various comical situations he encounters in his travels as the 'Big Fish' who outgrows many environments (and thus his reason for always embarking on different, larger adventures). It is like Alice wondering through the looking glass, or Dorothy travelling to see the Wizard, as each of young Edward Bloom's always involve something incredible, and whatever seems least likely, should always be expected. Big Fish is a fantastic rendition of a modern Tall Tales.

I was a little disappointed in that the movie seems to be missing that particularly magic Burton 'umpf' that was always present in his earlier films (pre-Planet of the Apes). Something so rich and so uniquely Burton, I just can't seem to figure out what's missing or why. I think part of it has to do with the intermitten reverting back to reality of old man Edward Bloom (Finney) and his interactions with his family. Perhaps it breaks up the dreamy world of the tall tales of young Edward Bloom. I'm not sure about that yet.

But otherwise, it is was a wonderful idea and turned out to be a quite a remarkable undertaking, with Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor, who are really the major stars of the production, giving fine performances.",7
11 November 2009,Unforgettable,"He is one of Hollywood's greatest visual artists, but until I saw this I wouldn't have said Tim Burton was much of a storyteller. Big Fish gives us the best of both worlds, story and visual splendour. The movie is not just one story, it gives us four or five. Although it is set up a little like Forrest Gump and occasionally bears resemblance to the Wizard of Oz, the film has a life of its own. Funny, touching, adventurous, and low on clichés, Big Fish is a tale of near perfect proportions.

This is the story of Edward Bloom from Ashon, Alabama. A town hero, he befriended a fifteen foot giant, worked three years at a circus, won the heart of his dream girl, became a war hero in Korea, ran a successful interstate business, and saved a town from bankruptcy. Bloom was everything that a man could ask for. Except one thing, he was not an honest father. Since growing up, his son Will has hated his father's guts, because he has told him nothing but stories, and not one truth. It has been twenty years since they last spoke. Will is living in France with his wife, but one evening he receives a call from his mother asking him to come visit. His father is dying.

This pretty much summarizes the intro. The rest of the movie cuts back and forth between the story of Ed Bloom's life and the present day, where Will is trying to re bond with his father in the remaining few days he has.

Big Fish is a carnival of color shape and size, which is what you would expect from Burton, but here it is at its best. I'm surprised it didn't receive an Oscar nominating for set design. The movie acts as an ode to storytelling and imagination. Its intentions are noble, and its morals are universal. There is something for everybody in Big Fish.",
19 March 2020,Weird as frick.,"Very good movie, but you don't have to like it. It's insane.

9 August 2007,"Amazing movie of love, acceptance, and the line between fantasy and reality","I am a self-professed fan of Tim Burton (even after what he did with Batman, which I enjoyed because he did it), so I can not believe I had not see this movie before. It was one of the first things I added to my NetFlix Queue when I opened my account to correct that. I am now going to have to run out and purchase this one for my own collection. It's just that good. It has not only instantly become my favorite Burton movie ever, but has move onto my list of favorite movies of all time.

The way this movie was filmed, the sets, the costumes, the cinematography, and all of it, combined to create a magical feeling to all the stories it tells. It gives each one a different look and feel, while allowing them to also stay part of the same life story they tell. Throw in the very down to earth style used for the scenes of the ""real world"" as the son tries to find the truth about his dying father and you have a truly magical mix of styles that work perfectly together. Sprinkle in the fantastic music of Danny Elfman and you have what I can only call a perfect movie.

The acting was top notch and the story was a great mix of reality and fantasy that keeps you wondering where the line between the two actually lies. The story is about fables and folklore, which are usually based in some truth, and those who are not willing to accept them for what they are. It is about the troubled and difficult relationships between fathers and sons trying to understand and accept each other. In then end it is about love and acceptance, in a world where fantasy and reality truly mix. It is one of the few movies that actually had me laughing and crying, sometimes at the same time.

The DVD itself not only contains the movie, but includes a number of good behind the scenes featurettes, a commentary track, and a Burton trivia game that leads to one of the hidden bonuses. The commentary track, although good, is more of an interview than a real commentary on the movie.",10
29 August 2014,Great family and fatherhood movie in an adventure wrapping,"I really like how the story rolls out quite fast using the back and forth flow style but still maintaining focus and delivering just enough detail to build up at the very beginning. The next moments also introduces nice variations by having not just one person telling the stories. I like how Tim Burton can get the story to be so alive with all those fantastic details. And there is a really nice positive message conveyed through the father and son interaction scenes. Ewan McGregorr did great in making the fantastic story feels alive, while Albert Finney did nice to build the older version of Ed Bloom to have a deeper character while still retaining the story teller's enthusiasm. Billy Crudup did okay in building up the balancing angle for the story. Marion Cotillard gave a nice color in completing the whole story. Helena Bonham Carter did very nice in keeping the little girl's character, and she is also very pretty in this movie.

12 January 2004,Even with the sentimentality this film works,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

1 May 2004,"Outstanding, in spite of ...","I did not care much for the performance of Ewan McGregor and I am not a fan of Albert Finney. In spite of that, I thought the movie was absolutely outstanding. My wife and I watched ""Love Actually"" the night before and after seeing ""Big Fish"" we had no doubt that we saved the better for last. Perhaps, for those who didn't care for it, a certain amount of experience with people you don't care for until you come to understand them and then realize how nice they really are helps. The fact that it reminded me of my dad who passed away several years ago and whom I miss very much made the ending more poignant for me. But, I liked the movie before that.

In a way, the movie was a bit of a mystery with the viewer trying to figure out just what was true and what was not as the story progressed. Such clues as the fact that older Ed was always thirsty, which implied that the fish story was more significant than the others, and the obvious significance of the town of Specter gave the viewer a lot to think about. I think that for me, trying to solve the riddle was what held my attention: and then, given all that, the ending made perfect sense.",8
18 May 2009,"Very Burton, good anyway","Tim Burton is a weird phenomenon. They say you either love or hate his work, but I tend to do both. ""Ed Wood"": truly a wonderful movie, one of the best I've ever seen. ""Edward Scissorhands"": completely unwatchable pseudo-intellectual artsy drivel. I've rarely seen a director that can be so good and so bad at the same time. Either way, ""Big Fish"" is essentially just ""Forrest Gump"" with a twist, but I'll put it in with the winners. The concept of a man narrating his life through made-up stories is pretty interesting, and gives Burton the opportunity to create another fairy tale world. They're only stories anyway, he can have anything he wants happen. There are times in which you really want to believe them though, if only it wasn't for the giants and werewolves. I personally think the movie's strong point is the ending, it's a time when father and son finally understand each other. Pretty touching stuff. At no point does this movie ever become truly great (except for Steve Buscemi's performance, obviously), but it's a good watch.

20 July 2009,One Of My Favourite Burton Films.,"I always wondered what a Tim Burton film would look like without all the Gothic undertones and scenery with that scary vibe throughout. I always thought Pee-wee's Big Adventure was one of the scariest films ever made so that fits into the category as well. Well, Big Fish I think was the first film to answer my question. Don't even try to say Mars Attacks! or Planet of the Apes.

Big Fish is a spectacle to see. It's beautiful and heartfelt. Granted it still does have that Burton eerie vibe, let's face it, it will always be there, but it's also one of his more mature works. Burton has a great body of work, all of his films seem to have their place in someone's heart and Big Fish feels like one of those films that is a critical success but no one ever mentions it when they think of Burton's best work. It's a shame because it truly is.

Ewan McGregor is in the lead role as a younger version of Albert Finney who is on his death bed. His son is trying to connect to him, to get to know the real father. It seems that all his father ever did was tell this stories to his kid that were always too mystical to be true. Or were they? The ending to Big Fish is great and always puts a smile on my face. It's a feel good movie that makes you smile, even when there is tragedy soon to be seen. And yes, there is a BIG FISH in the film, so the title is relevant.

The film has a strong supporting cast, including the ever present Helena Bonham Carter, Jessica Lang, Billy Crudup, Dann DeVito and Steve Buscemi. All play their roles well and never feel out of place in this wacky tale.

With all Burton films they seem to fall just short of true greatness, just shy of being called genius or a masterpiece. I don't really get it, all the ingredients are there, but the final step is never really taken. Big Fish is another film of his that falls into this category.",9
25 December 2003,Magnificent potential sadly stupefied.,"There was just so much to like here, a great idea and then the flaws started. The middle drags so badly I thought is it ever going to pick up steam ? Poor Albert Finney's accent comes and goes with each scene change. Jessica Lange glows. The love story shines - the scene in the daffodil field is wonderful. Ewan McGregor is awesome as the younger Bloom. The scene in the hospital room is a marvel. However, the unevenness of the scenes and continuity stalls the story and the ending just whacks you over the head too harshly. I would have been more satisfied if the ""stories"" had been left as a question mark, with perhaps only Will seeing the characters at the end. 7 out of 10.

26 September 2004,Reality becomes a story that becomes reality that...,"Seeing this film is like tasting good wine. The flavour comes to life after having seen it.

We all know that our memory serve us tricks. Recalling events can be the same as mixing a drink, where the truth might just be one part of it.

In this movie, that is explored. When you where young the world seemed so big. The ride on your bike to the store was a real long way! As a grown up it was just a minutes walk.

All this, and the love and emotion is well portraited.

It is a wonderful ride. As one film critic said here in Sweden: ""This was the film I always wanted to see that I did not know of"". Or something in that line.

I agree!",10
23 February 2009,A moving fantasy about fathers & sons and storytelling,"Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" concerns a man trying to uncover the truth about his dying father before it's too late. His father happens to be an incorrigible tall tale teller; as a result, the line between fact and fiction has long been blurred. The film cuts between the father's colorful reminiscences and his last days with his wife and son.

The cast is a good one though I think that it was a bit of an odd choice to have Alabama-born Edward Bloom portrayed by Scot Ewan McGregor & Brit Albert Finney. Nevertheless, it isn't necessarily a detraction since the character is more about theatricality than realism. Billy Crudup delivers a fine performance in a thankless role as Edward's son, the one person who isn't taken in by his charm. The film is also populated with a number of well-chosen character actors like Steve Buscemi & Robert Guillaume.

Burton's direction is well-handled but I found that it took him a little while to strike the right balance between real life & fantasy. However, once the balance is struck there's no looking back. The score by Danny Elfman (which landed the film its only Oscar nomination) is alright but I wouldn't rank it among his best. More memorable, in my mind, are a handful of well-chosen soundtrack choices like Elvis's ""All Shook Up"" during a wartime parachuting mission and Canned Heat's ""Let's Work Together"" during a bank robbery.

In the end, the thing that really hooks me is the emotional content of the film. I don't know if women would react the same way but there's just something about the way that it represents the unspoken bond between a father and son.

I can only imagine why this film was almost completely ignored by the AMPAS. Comparatively, it received seven BAFTA nominations (including Best Film), which is the kind of reception that I think it deserved. In any case, I certainly recommend the film though it will undoubtedly not appeal to all tastes.",8
24 January 2004,Good Tim Burton Flick,"This movie was not like other TIM BURTON movies...with ghoulish characters etc. This was more of a FANTASY movie with many great moments. Ewan proves once again that he is the GOD OF MOVIES. Yes, you heard that right. In this movie, he proves that he can out act just about any other actor in his particular age group. The giant is the same giant from the BILLY CRYSTAL movie and has a crick in his neck or something. I can't understand that part. Also, Albert Finny delivered some goods as the older version of Ed Bloom. What I loved was the town of Spectre. This town is like NO OTHER TOWN EVER!!! I want to MOVE to Spectre! There is so much to do there!! So much GRASS TO MOW and so many SHOES to take down from the TREE!!! Way to Go Tim Burton, you showed us again, that DANNY DEVITO and the rest of your movies are the BEST!!!!!

3 July 2005,Making tall tales out of reality,"My faith in this movie was paid off threefold as I gambled on yet another Tim Burton. After being jarred(albeit effectively) by ""Sleepy Hollow"" and utterly confused and a little angry from ""Planet of the Apes"",I could've just let this one slide. But I thought I'd give this one a chance,if for nothing else,the fanciful storyline and the adept casting.

The story segues back and forth between young Edward Bloom(Ewan MacGreggor,cleaned up and un-Scottish here) and old Edward Bloom(Albert Finney,Academy snubbed here IMHO). Bloom is a legend to just about everybody,including himself,not least of which is because he can tell a great story. One of the very few to cut him much slack and is mostly distrustful of his persona is his son,William(Billy Crudup,understated,as usual). Bloom's wife Sandra(a non-aging Jessica Lange,saintly this time)has to straddle the line between being a loving,adoring wife and the hand of reality to her progressively fanciful and bombastic husband. Bloom tells tales about growing up in rural Alabama(wouldn't you KNOW that a film about tall-tales would be set in the South!),and his travails over a period of just over thirty some odd years. This film reminds one of ""Forrest Gump"" on at least a few levels:one,the larger-than-life recollections of a Southerner,set over the course of the middle twentieth century America and two,the protagonist's belief in true and abiding love. But while Gump sometimes threatened to sicken the audience with its heavy-handed pleasant,painfully simple truisms,""Fish"" is smarter in that it sticks with pure story-telling with the trust that the audience will ""get"" the differences between storied past and dull reality,allowing them to appreciate the wonder rather than get possibly bludgeoned by it. Rather than trying to merely stick a fictional figure in historic situations(a la ""Zelig""),the writers and Burton wisely chose to develop an almost ""Gulliver's Travels"" type of path. Last but not least,one watching this film cannot forget to complement the choice to film the past and present in different lights:the past as bright and dreamy,full of vibrant colors and music;the present as drab,earth-toned reality.(BTW,this doesn't mean I didn't like ""Forrest Gump"". I did,but I appreciate it in a different way.)

Some strong turns by a supporting cast featuring Steve BUscemi(always good!),Robert Guillame,Danny DeVito and Helena Bonham Carter. I cannot,for the moment,recall who played the Giant Ed Bloom befriends,but he is very effective,both as an awesome and sympathetic character.

Emotionally-based films of fancy can be tricky to keep both convincing AND authentic,but Tim Burton seems at home in this original and beautifully done movie.",10

15 April 2006,Love Thy Father,"The importance of story-telling is explored in 'Big Fish', a movie you have to keep an open mind for, to truly appreciate it's richness. When Will Bloom comes to see his dying father, he tries to get answers, and not just these hackneyed stories that his father loves to tell. The problem is of course, that Will refuses to keep an open mind to interpret these stories, as Edward's wife knows all to well, and Will's wife quickly learns as well. This is quite a tricky story to pull off, but the word 'tricky' must make lightbulbs pop in Tim Burton's head, because I have to hand it to the guy how clever this movie is. Burton cleverly shifts from present day Edward Bloom (played by Albert Finney) to the past Bloom (played with a great full-on accent by Ewan Mcgregor). During the movie, we meet a whole PILE of characters from Edward's life, all of which are highly interesting. The most interesting to me were Steve Buscemi's (no surprise there) Norther Winslow, and the Siamese Asian singing combo (!!) played by Arlene and Ada Tai. You may other favorites. There are also different stories, some of which you'll like (I liked the first visit to Spectre and the encounter with the witch (played by Helena Bonham-Carter) and some you won't (Mine? The second visit to Spectre and his visit to a girl in the town (again played by Helena Bonham-Carter). This is what I love about movies about this, there's all sorts of stories that you can attach to, and you can discuss of what you like and don't like.",9
21 July 2004,Curiouser and curiouser,"When Helena Bonham Carter recently gave birth to Tim Burton's baby and settled down to blissful (if presumably slightly quirky) family life, it finally dawned on me that we were probably not going to end up together. This was a thumping blow to say the least  I have carried a torch for Britain's most elegant and enigmatic actress ever since she flapped her arms about in a cornfield in Room With a View in 1986 - and I knew that if I was to finally allow myself to move on, I would need to stop thinking of Burton as a scheming, manipulative freak-show who was holding my precious English rose against her will and just be happy for the pair of them. So I stopped sticking pins in my crudely crafted Burton effigy and began to grudgingly concede that he was actually a pretty good director.

Still, he doesn't half take liberties with his missus: Not content with turning her into a talking gorilla in Planet of the Apes, his latest offering, Big Fish, has her playing both a scabby, one-eyed witch and a wistful middle-aged spinster who couldn't even lure Ewan McGregor into the sack.

Bonham Carter is not the only one readily jumping through hoops for Burton in this movie. He has a knack of creating unique and irresistible characters that light up his narrative and captivate his audiences. Why has nobody else ever cast Danny DeVito as a pint-sized, moustache-twirling ringleader or Steve Buscemi as terrible poet-cum-bank robber? What other director could assemble such a blistering supporting cast in what is essentially a glorified fairy tale? Big Fish was never the sort of project that was going to win truckloads of academy awards  the reason the cream of Hollywood are queuing up to be in his films is not one of artistic recognition, but because it looks like it would be a bloody good laugh.

What is also clear is that if you happen to land one of the plumb roles, you strive with every sinew to make the most of it. Albert Finney plays Edward Bloom: Charismatic, popular and richly entertaining, but dying of cancer. Billy Crudup is his son Will, who has endured a life of drudgery by comparison. Will is fed-up with his father's preposterous tales and it eventually drives them apart. As it becomes obvious Edward has only a short time to live, Will seeks reconciliation and acknowledgement from his father that his stories are all whopping great lies.

But Edward is a stubborn bugger and maintains that he only ever speaks the truth. And so, his history is recounted in a succession of vivid flashbacks where we follow his younger self (Ewan McGregor) through a life that was certainly less ordinary and frankly (to Will anyway) pretty unlikely. Young Edward, it seems, was a gifted individual to say the least: His anecdotes include a long list of sporting accolades; tussles with witches and giants; joining the circus and falling in love; escaping from the far East with the help of Siamese twin cabaret singers and saving a whole town from debt and destitution.

The tales are brought to life by Finney's sparkling voice-overs and McGregor's wide-eyed enthusiasm  Edward Bloom's past is Tim Burton's Wonderland; The town of Spectre, Alabama is his Bedford Falls, 'a place so great, nobody ever leaves!'

References and sly nods are scattered everywhere and colour and imagery stream out of every set. Here it is the present that is dreary and sepia. Edward, stymied in his later years through the relentless march of time and eventually bedridden, lives vicariously through his splendid reminiscences. Because, as Will eventually realises, his father is not interested in showing off or telling porkies  he just wants to remember the good times.

Big Fish is about cherishing memories. In Burton's book they can be as rose-tinted as you like. The cold facts are not important; feelings are what count. How he can pull off such an unapologetically sentimental motto like that without drowning in a fetid swamp of cheese and schmaltz is anybody's guess. But he does, and with his own inimitable aplomb. Burton just has this incredible imagination (although it helps that he is as mad as a snake).

My final word must rest with Helena. These pages are laced with praise for the entire cast of Big Fish. All the aforementioned actors deserve credit as well as Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange as the young and old incarnations of Edward's wife Sandra (Lange in particular is the foxiest pensioner you are ever likely to meet), but Bonham Carter proves once and for all she is one of the most talented and versatile actresses currently around. Once mocked as being fit only for corsets and period drama, she has laughed off the criticism and taken a series of challenging and thought-provoking roles. She is not afraid to experiment or risk looking silly and has a laissez faire attitude to stardom that is as admirable as it is unusual. If this film is Burton's homage to his new family lifestyle then it is a fitting tribute indeed.

OK, now I have closure.

31 July 2023,One Man's Tall Tales & Beyond,"Among filmmaker Tim Burton's unique albeit familiar filmography, one of his lesser known works would have to be his film adaptation of Daniel Wallace's novel Big Fish. Released in 2003 to generally positive reviews and modest financial returns, the film can best be described as a surreal reconciliation between the father-son relationship told through differing perspectives. While not as regarded in fame as the director's other notable works, it might be one of Burton's most sincere features to date solely on how much of a departure it is from his usual work yet stands out based on its themes and heart all the same.

The film tells the story of William Bloom, who has grown frustrated with his father Edward's tall tales in lieu of what his life was really about and tries to distinguish fact from fiction in regards to said life. From that premise alone, what makes Big Fish a fascinating reconciliation between father and son is how cathartic it is in exploring the estrangement of William and Edward. Considering that screenwriter John August identified with how much William wanted to know who his father really was beyond the alleged exaggerated tales he made up, the theme of empathizing with those who sought to tell their own stories based on their life feels as real as can be. Whether or not these stories are true or not, the many different people and lives Edward Bloom tried to make better are what matter more in the long run through small acts of kindness, regardless if he wasn't around his family as much as he could have. The film's ethos of the uncommunitable has rarely felt so genuine in any other Tim Burton film, and it's one many can relate to depending on how they've had to spend their lives around their fathers.

Speaking of the uncommunitable, arguably the film's greatest strength lies in how it effectively communicates the pathos through colorful art direction. By establishing a southern gothic setting and jumping back between past and present, the many stories Edward recaps interweave certain fantasy elements such as witches, giants, sea creatures, circuses and small towns feel appropriately grounded enough to see the humanity within them. Although many of Tim Burton's features come off as unsubtly artistic in their approach to visual emotional storytelling, Big Fish incorporates many of his trademark touches with proper care and attention to detail. In addition to Danny Elfman's tear jerkingly warm score, Dennis Gassner's welcoming production design and Phillippe Rousselot's subdued yet gorgeous cinematography bring Edward Bloom's stories to life arguably better than the already delightful dialogue and monologues. It's hard to say if dealing with the real world affected Burton for the worst or not, but his blending of what's real and what's fantastic is as pure as anything else out there.

In addition to the strong efforts from the crew, the cast are what make the film just as delightful as anything else on screen. In contrast to Albert Finney's charming mythical old man mindset in Edward Bloom's later years, Ewan McGregor showcases one of his most charismatic roles as the mild mannered yet daring younger Edward that you assume he could have been. As far as being more curiously grounded goes, Billy Crudup showcases the understandable frustration in William while also hiding the character's real secluded love for his father that he has a hard time coming to grips with. Many notable players like Helena Bonham Carter, Robert Guillame, Steve Buscemi, Miss Pyle, Matthew McGrory and Danny DeVito play distinctive roles in the many different people whose lives were positively impacted by Edward, all while standing out through their oddly charming eccentricities. Although the artistry shown on screen does arguably paint the film better than anything else, the cast are what define the stories of Edward Bloom both in past and present subtext to a wonderful degree.

By implementing the believable with the unbelievable through such raw emotional pathos, Big Fish could arguably be one of the most heartfelt feature films in Tim Burton's lustrous directorial career. Where some might see this film as cloyingly whimsy, I and others choose to see it as an earnest portrayal of coming to terms with parental closure and familial ingenuity. I recommend this not only for Burton fans unfamiliar with his lesser known content, but also those who are intrigued by the themes the film explores in many different ways. It stays true to what is and what isn't possible through sincerity unlike any other.",8
26 April 2004,"fun, fishy stuff!","I was more than excited when I heard Tim Burton's next film was to be coming out in mere months, and when it finally did, I was not let down. It has what every Burton movie has to offer, a cool script, good acting, good music, great direction and a ridiculous attention to detail and atmosphere! The film is loaded with creativity and awesome visuals, and Mr. Trainspotting is hilarious! Every time he smiles, he made me do the exact same. The end is great and the overall message of the film is to do as much as possible, be nice to everyone, and to always have a great time! That's not always possible, but Burton sure makes you want to try! 9/10

3 May 2004,"""So it's a tall tale?"" ""Well, it's not a short one...""","In an episode of ""Tiny Toon Adventures"" where the students of Acme Looniversity are showing the movies they made in film class, everyone expects Gogo Dodo's entry to be full-on wackiness - instead it's a (relatively) restrained live-action tale about two people dancing (actually a drastically edited-down version of one of the Joe McDoakes short subjects, ""So You Want To Learn To Dance""); when Babs complains, Gogo argues that he can't be expected to stay to type all the time.

This, I think, is what's behind general critical response in the UK to ""Big Fish"" - there's no acid here, no full-on weirdness, no dark, edgy atmosphere... it's more sentimental than most of Tim Burton's other movies, but does that make it bad? Or does that make it his most personal movie since ""Edward Scissorhands,"" and certainly a return to form after his sojourn to the ""Planet of the Apes""? I'll go for the latter; he's always shown some warmth in his best work when you think about it - it's just that this time it's for ""normal"" people. You could almost say that it's his lightest movie since ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure"" (another movie about an odyssey and the people the hero meets on the way).

The movie's part a father-son drama and part the ""Forrest Gump""-ish odyssey of a man through life, as told by the older man (Albert Finney) to those around him; everyone loves his stories except his serious-minded son (Billy Crudup), who's never really gotten over his dad's tendency to prefer a good yarn to the truth. But he's not so estranged that he doesn't come home from Paris with his wife to be by his ill father's side; for a lot of the movie John August's adaptation of Daniel Wallace's book can't quite find a satisfactory balance between the relationship between father and son and the tales the former tells about his life, which may or may not be total lies (it's not until near the end of the movie that we [sort of] find out for sure), but that's okay because Finney's story is so involving we wind up caring about him and the bond with his son anyway.

Burton's empathy with the strange (a giant, a circus owner with a secret, a mysterious little town) is coupled with his gift to make the bizarre seem everyday, plus Ewan McGregor's performance - his shifting accent notwithstanding - to make this journey fun and touching, even if it does seem almost as fragmented as ""Catch Me If You Can"" (though the usual Tim Burton ""Story? What story?"" approach is reined in for once). It must be said that it's not as emotional as the wonderful ""Forrest Gump"" was (hang cool, detached irony, I LOVE that movie), and Helena Bonham Carter manages to overact in one of her two roles - the one which doesn't require any dialogue, oddly enough - but like the characters in the movie, you could go on the journeys the man describes forever.

""Big Fish"" has a fine supporting cast (Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Danny DeVito, Robert Guillaume, the marvellous Steve Buscemi, the Tai twins...), striking images, and another wonderful Danny Elfman score - Elfman's finale music combines with what comprises said finale to make it a super finish to the tale - but ultimately the story is what makes this movie. Whether or not you see the movie as one big tall tale, by the end we truly see the man as a big fish - one in a big pond; it's a movie about being an individual that doesn't go out of its way to damn everyone for not being as wonderful. It won't work for the shoegazers of the world, but that wasn't Burton's aim here.",
15 February 2005,Fantastically Imaginative,"This story had a giant, a witch,a midget, and also Helena Bonhamm Carter, Whom I expect is probably the most beautiful creature on the face of our earth.

Quite an imaginative story, complete with its own version of shangri-la, and also a one sided fist fight in a field of jonquills.

A little hard to follow, but very easy to enjoy. I never really decided if young Bloom found out as much about his father as he wanted to or not, but he got to listen to a lot of mighty enjoyable adventures while he was trying.

One of the best fantasy films in a long time. Don't hesitate to see this one, you won't regret it.

27 July 2004,"Beautifully made, well-acted but just plain boring.","Okay, it must be me!

Every one else seems to think this film is great but I thought it was

awful. Beautifully made, well-acted but just plain boring.

I like the idea of the tale-telling father and the son who just doesn't

get what his father is all about. Unfortunately, the stories the father

tells all seem to be pale imitations of fairy-tales, all show and no

substance. True fairy-tales have a darkness at their heart, fables

have a moral. The stories shown here just seem to exist simply to

provide the opportunity for nice visuals.

As a time-filler for the under-tens this is fine but as a great

movie...?

Like I said, it must be me!",3
6 January 2021,The story of your own,"Every single person's life is special and spectacular, even mine, may be the most plain and boring person in the world. Everyone is the protagonist and the hero in his or her own story, and every life should be celebrated. 'Big Fish' delivers message very clearly with beautiful storytelling. However, it is too much of a metaphor, and the line between the reality and the Edward's story is so vague (I'm sure Bruton intends this way of directing to tell the audience that IS a life) that the movie is not captivating enough to be a masterpiece.

9 March 2004,Is Tim Burton dead?,"This is what came to my mind when I came out of the theater. This is a major disappointment from one of my favorites directors. I found it lame, a bit boring and more surprisingly from Burton: unimaginative. This film don't make you feel anything. What could have been interesting, the relationship between the son and the father seems realy false and dull. And I think it would have been much better with Johnny Depp instead of Ewan McGreggor (not that I have something against him). Also Danny Elfman's music is his worst composition ever. I sincerely hope that ""Charlie & the chocolate factory"" will be better as I love the book and I think Burton is only guy able to direct it right.

4 September 2008,BIG FISH has a big heart.,"My Take: Wildly imaginative story-telling. And after a second look, a truly great movie.

When we hear the name Tim Burton, we don't usually expect merriment or the cheerfulness, at least not without a dash of melancholy or the dark and depressing. This is perhaps one of the reasons why Burton remains one of the most imaginative and bold visionary filmmakers Hollywood still gives a job to. Other than two dark and brilliant BATMAN movies to his credit, he is also responsible for dark ""fairy tales"" such as EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and SLEEPY HOLLOW, not to mention clever black comedies as BEETLEJUICE and MARS ATTACKS! But much like other artists, confine Burton to some unfamiliar terrain and you either get a good experiment or a terrible film. Burton proves he can't do sci-fi remakes in his disappointing remake of the classic PLANET OF THE APES. Now Burton breaks out on his old routine once more in BIG FISH, a comedy/drama about life with a little dash of fairy tale-esquire metaphors. Despite it's nod to fantasy (one of Burton's favorite genres) and a few talks of dark elements, BIG FISH is more about lightheartedness and sentimentality, certainly not the sort of things Burton works with.

But some surprise! BIG FISH, while not pure Burton, is a terrific Tim Burton film nonetheless. It's elaborate, fanciful, imaginative and oftentimes uplifting. Above all, it's an ode to the power of storytelling. It's not in league with Burton's other films, simply parting him from his craft is sets it aside, but that may also be the reason why this film is simply stirring and curious entertainment. It's so unlike Burton that it's also unlike any film I've ever seen.

The story's about an old man named Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), already at his deathbed, and to remember him by, he tells the story of his life in a series of stretchy metaphors, much to the delight of his wife (Jessica Lange) and much to the dissatisfaction of his son (Billy Crudup). He tells, as a young man (played by Ewan McGregor), that his life was filled with adventures tied with life, love, revelations, realizations and life-changing moments. But here's the stretch: he also confronts an ugly giant who just happens to be misplaced in a small town, he also works for a carnival barker (Danny DeVito) in a carnival unlike other, he encounters mermaids & other magical entities and when they say when you find the love of your life, time stops, it's true!

Perhaps I one of the reasons I didn't love BIG FISH that much when I first saw it is that it was totally different from Burton's other efforts. After seeing it again, I accepted it's differences and was thoroughly satisfied by a fantastic and highly original work. It's treacly to be sure, something that Burton usually avoids in his other films (he usually lets us relate to his characters in pains, not comforts). But BIG FISH, with it's differences, is proof that Burton can go soft on us if he can.

Rating: ***** out of 5.",10
4 December 2021,This is just not a movie.,"This Movie obliges me to think life is really a story. Where we go their create a story. Life is a circle. Life has fun, sorrow, pain also life has an amazing moment. When we fall in love that's must be become a story. Early morning when I'm reading some birds going to find out some food. So I haven't much work to do. I follow them and I saw a strange thing. I see some birds collect food in one place and some birds bite that food and go somewhere to keep it. I am shocked. I find birds have a social process. I think they talk to me. Birds tell me,"" do you need food? Can we help you find some food? I'm surprised it's really happed. Nor I am dreaming. No one believes me but it's truly happening.

So my story end up there I came back home. Till I have finally understood is it really happens. I sit down in a place and started to think. SO come back to the point.

This movie is amazing. I am truly enjoying it. This movie story and screenplay are just out of my thoughts. Easily we can't belives in fairy tales. If a man lived in fairy tales it's hard to belives that man's life. We think he bluffing with us. If we find it's truly happened. Then we will be surprised much. The story becomes life. A man who lived a life very different way. His sons think his father telling him false stories. Which doesn't happen in life. He hates his father. They haven't talked much more. But everyone loves his father. His father was a man who loved one woman and loved her until he die. When he finds his father all stories are true he praised his father.

Life is very short. But anytime anywhere we create much more memories. So we lived in a story and the story end our life. WE are a BIG fish.",10

16 December 2021,STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...

This wonderful vision by director Tim Burton was beautifully filmed with a perfect cast that put in great performances. From top to bottom, this tall tale really touches the heart in a most extraordinary way. I can see how ""Big Fish"" is able to resonate with anyone, young or old, boy or girl, parent or child - it certainly does resonate with me. I don't give out too many full 10 star ratings, but this one has earned it and continues to earn it. It never grows old.

We are given a glimpse into the fantastical world and life of Edward Bloom, now an old man on his deathbed, as he shares his incredible stories with his family. His son, Will, is frustrated however, because he feels that after hearing the same stories time after time, he does not know the real peson that his father is, or was. Feeling his time with him is short, he searches to find the truth - only to realize that his father has never pretended to be anything other than himself.

At the heart of the story is a big fish ... it starts with one, and ends with one. The movie is all at once comedic, fantastical, romantic, dramatic, and even gothic. We are delighted to various stories told by Edward describing his life's journey in amusing ways, ways that the reasoning person would say are impossible and could never happen. But, sometimes, to get the heart of the matter, to find out the truth, we need these stories.

This comes at the highest recommend possible - a perfect 10 stars out of 10. I mentioned how it resonates with me, and it does. My Grandpa was much the same way ... a story teller with a big heart and a large love for his family. People were naturally drawn to him, and he made an indelible impression on my life. And ... he loved to fish. He always had a story to tell about a big fish.",10

Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

19 February 2004,Not Tim Burton best but a good effort anyway.,"Big fish is a pretty good film but it's more a lightweight effort than most of the other Burton films, and it's less whimsical well. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are great as the younger and senior Ed Bloom , and Jessica Lange is good as well as his wife. The balance between what is real and imaginary is really a good way to view the world through the main character eyes, and the way Burton puts that to use is a grand effort indeed.

It's a good movie but it's not Tim Burton's Best.

12 June 2022,Unique modern fairytale,"A son tries to determine fact from fiction in the tales of his dying father. Stars Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney.

This is a unique movie, like a modern fairytale. McGregor is incredibly likeable here. A great supporting cast too.

You are supposed to find this emotive but I did not. I suppose others see a beauty in it but I found it all too surreal.

Overall, worth a watch but falls short of greatness.

19 January 2004,"Big Fish, Bigger Heart","I've been a Tim Burton follower from the beginning (hey, it doesn't get much better than Frankenweenie), and I was delighted to see this film, where he uses his enormous capacity for visual originality to bring a thoroughly remarkable story to the screen.

Big Fish works on so many levels that it's impossible to truly convey to you if you haven't yet seen it what a magnificent treat you have in store. And if you're a fan of the great songwriter Loudon Wainwright, you'll be extra pleased, since he's in it, and he's wonderful in his part - everyone shines in this film, especially Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito and of course Albert Finney, who will no doubt get a Best Actor nomination for his deeply heartfelt performance.

18 January 2004,"""Big Fish""- 9/10. Wonderful story and set decoration, may be Burton's best work yet.","Big Fish (2003)

This film focuses on Will Bloom (Billy Crudup), a young man with a pregnant wife, a mother (Jessica Lange), and a father (Albert Finney). A father who told Will many stories and tall tales as he grew up. At one point, Will stopped believing his dad's stories. Then, at Will's wedding, his father tells his most infamous tall tale- the story of how he caught an uncatchable fish the day Will was born. Sick of hearing his father's stories, they do not speak for over three years, until they are reunited when his father is diagnosed with cancer. And throughout all of his father's stories- ones involving a town named Spectre where no one wears shoes, to a sideshow circus owned by Amos Callaway (Danny Devito), where his father supposedly worked for three years in order to find the woman he was destined to marry, all the way to a lonely giant named Karl (Matthew McGrory) -, Will begins to find some truth in his father, something he has never seen before.

I simply enjoyed this movie, with it's ability to dazzle you with fairy tale-like settings in his father's stories, and to it's ability to strike you with sad moments. Tim Burton created a masterpiece of cinema. I love the set decoration in the towns in his father's stories, especially Spectre, and all of the set decoration on the old trail in the woods. The movie had a wonderful ending, but I don't want to spoil this film for you- it's too much of a gem. 9/10.",

1 March 2020,Big idea's,"Burton creates one of his most Burton films in quite sometime. He brings that mixture of storytelling and folklore. The film is slightly heavy handed on the sentimental moments, and sadly can't overcome the lack of a genuine plot. Great cast of Burton regulars and an interesting role for McGregor. The film has ambition and offers Burton a chance to unleash.

29 May 2004,It's hard to describe what a wonder this movie is... (spoilerish),"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

11 July 2014,Turn up the cheese-o-meter....,"This review is from an adult perspective. Perhaps children 12 and under love this movie, and that's why it's rated so highly. I don't know. All I can tell you is that I was bored out of my mind. It's about an old guy who has told tall-tales about his life. So as he nears his end, he re-tells some of these stories to various people. So we get to see him in these fanciful situations, with fantasy special effects. Big fish, witches, stuff like that. The first story or 2 is so-so. But by the middle of the film, when he's talking about how he met his future wife, I got so bored I could hardly stand it. Long-winded, total cheese, total pie-in-the-sky over-the-top cheese. It was so bad that it really detracted from any character development. Because there was nothing else to the story. Just an old guy who told crazy stories. That's it. And that's all he does. Nothing else. The net effect is total boredom. I was waiting for something touching or heartwarming to happen, but it never did. Pointless.

8 February 2004,Fantastic,"I really enjoyed this Burton story, more so than some of his other films. McGregor is fantastic as the young, tale-telling, hero of our story, and Finney is just as excellent as him in his old age.

Featuring some fine performances from other members of a well drilled cast, Burton's ability to spin a tale shines through in what is entertaining throughout, and often emotional as the story of a son's relationship with his father is weaved throughout.

11 January 2004,Big Waste,"Big Fish is a film so startlingly awful that I wonder how it ever got made. Tim Burton, the one-time imaginative director of such films as ""Batman,"" ""Beetlejuice,"" and ""Edward Scissorhands,"" has evidently lost whatever talent he once had. After this and his mind-numbing ""Planet of the Apes"" remake, I strongly urge Mr. Burton to retire, or at least take a LONG vacation.

Albert Finney stars as Edward Bloom, a dying man with a lifetime's worth of tall tales. Billy Crudup is his son attempting to separate the fact from the fiction. Unfortunately this involves long, pointless, confusing flashback/fable sequences starring Ewan McGregor (with the world's worst ""Southern"" accent) as a young Ed Bloom. The result is a mess of a movie that is neither entertaining nor enlightening, not funny or dramatic, not even bold enough to leave you with a lasting impression.

The direction is so derivative of other popular films/styles it is embarrassing to watch. There are changing-era soundtrack songs as we move through the years, including Buddy Holly's ""Everyday"" (used first and more effectively in Rob Reiner's ""Stand By Me""), Elvis Presley's ""All Shook Up"" (used in countless films including ""Honeymoon In Vegas"") and the astoundingly trite ""Ramblin' Man"" by the Allman Brothers, used too often to name. As the years go by and the jukebox plays one cannot help but be reminded of the similarities to Robert Zemeckis' ""Forrest Gump."" And of course there are the obligatory Matrix-styled special effects- used absolutely unnecessarily- in which time freezes (!)

During attempted comedic sequences one gets the feeling that Burton has been influenced by the Coen Brother's ""O Brother, Where Art Thou."" Despite a handful of moments obviously intended to be funny I heard few laughs in the packed theater, and never laughed myself.

Then there are the tall tales themselves... clichéd, predictable and oddly flat. Meeting a giant and seeing a vision of your own death sound exciting on paper but these moments are rendered meaningless in the film. Wasted are such great actors as Jessica Lange, Danny DeVito, Helena Bonham Carter and Steve Buscemi.

My advice to anyone reading this review is to avoid the film at all costs, because I can guarantee you will be disappointed. See another movie, rent a classic or even an old favorite... do anything but waste two hours on this cinematic dead-end. Big Fish is a dull, derivative, uninspired effort from a director who once had the ability to shock, excite and entertain me. Now he only puts me to sleep.

GRADE: F

EDIT: This movie was so depressing it drained the life out of me. Now, years later, it has come to light that the film may actually have contributed to the death of actor/monologuist Spalding Gray. After seeing the film he left the theater, sent his family home, and committed suicide by jumping off the Staten Island Ferry. Look it up if you don't believe me... that's the kind of karma this movie has. Enough said.",
7 February 2004,Big Fish: 8/10,"Weird in movies is good. There's different types of weird, but it mainly boils down to two types: Tim Burton weird and David Lynch weird. Both are pretty similar, actually, except that Burton has a reason for his weirdness, while Lynch just throws it out there. I enjoy Lynch's more, but Burton's is nice to look at, and instead of creating a puzzle that seems impossible to solve, Burton creates new worlds, stuff that can never happen but is just close enough to seem believable. In his new Big Fish, Burton likes to get as weird as he can get, but has to stay within the boundaries of mainstream movies (I'll get to that).

Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is notorious for telling tall tales, which delight most people, but always seemed to annoy his son Will (Billy Crudup). He's upset because he doesn't really know much about his father. When he learns that his father is dying, he travels back to his home in Alabama, while the audience sees some of Edward's tall tales, with Ewan McGregor as the younger Ed. There, he encounters giants, werewolves, a town that seems to be taken out of something from the Twilight Zone, and a witch with a glass eye.

Burton certainly is imaginative. He has some great ideas for weirdness, which are all executed extremely well. Everything comes off well, and Burton leaves us in some weird place, and we seem to just accept it. The movie thrives on leaving the audience wondering what was about what they just saw. Unlike Lynch, Burton doesn't require us to make connections; he explains it all. But that's where the one major flaw comes in. All of the weirdness is so well done that when the necessary plot developments in today's time come along, it takes away from the flow of the story, and it leaves the audience's attention waning. The story of Edward Bloom dying is not very exciting, the story of Edward Bloom's supposed past is exciting.

Big Fish has a very intricate story. There's a slew of characters who seem to come in randomly, and who look/sound like others, and live in the same place as others. Instead of, just say, taking away development from someone who doesn't really matter, like Will's wife, they take away some connecting points that could help the story make sense. On the other hand, the movie did have some very funny moments, with odd dialogue thrown in to make it funnier. Danny DeVito, as a circus ringmaster with a very odd situation, comes off great, as does Steve Buscemi, who's a ""famous poet"" who was part of the odd town of Spectre and goes into an unusual profession now.

Everyone's been raving about how much Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney look alike, which was very fortuitous. I didn't really think they looked that similar, but that doesn't take away from the superior acting job by Albert Finney. He not only got into his role, but seemed like he had a fun time doing it. However, he's the only one who really stands out; everyone else just ""acts"", nothing more, nothing less. The score, by longtime Burton partner Danny Elfman, is barely noticeable. If there was any music in it at all, I didn't notice it.

I would like to see Big Fish again for one thing. Burton seems to be a director who has fun with his movies. He references a lot of his other movies in his movies. I caught a reference to Edward Scissorhands, but all others eluded me. Overall, Big Fish is a fun movie with some very weird qualities, but some qualities that aren't particularly great.

My rating: 8/10

Rated PG-13 for a fight scene, some images of nudity and a suggestive reference.",8

4 June 2016,"Poetic, helluva lot of fun, and whole","Another brilliant Tim Burton. The story taken from a novel, and it feels like it as we're plunged through a series of wild adventures, each one pleasantly whole and meaningful and always entertaining; and while all the action is supplied during the tale-telling, another story is being told in the actual original time and setting. Like the current and anecdotal timeframes are feeding off each other to build up the momentum for a grand ending. The film is dense with a lot of elements and pans out smoothly. Not once does it feel like there's too much or that it has too many participants. The moral is very original and not apprehended, it offers quite a lot to be discussed - the ending very touching as it is the culmination of the crescendo built progressively and patiently through the entire 2hrs+. The acting is consistently very good, and Billy Crudup does a very good job playing the jaded yet still attentive son. Overall the crux of the story, a man bored with reality constantly looking to thrill it up, is one that is very weighty with realism and implications, and this is a superbly executed version of that concept. Great cinematography, great fun; just one of these films that is quite perfect at what it sets out to do. Excellent.",9
26 March 2004,Burton goes sentimental - and I like it!,"Until ""Big Fish,"" I had pretty much written off Tim Burton; I can only watch so many freakish displays of carnival showmanship, after all. But this time, he got me. He actually injected character development and a compelling family conflict into his usual grotesque tableau of weirdness. I am officially a fan again.

Ebert says that this movie is basically just an excuse for special effects, but I would argue that it works beautifully on a fable-like level; true, there is a larger-than-life quality to the proceedings, but surely that's the whole point? Yes, the MacGregor/Finney character is supposed to be somewhat ridiculous, but he also represents Burton's answer to his critics. He proves that tall tales and fanciful images have a legitimate place in storytelling, and can in fact reflect reality in unexpected ways.

That said, the movie did get a tad heavy-handed at the end. I didn't need Billy Crudup (who has a pretty thankless, drippy role for most of the way) to explain the moral. Still, I was hooked for ninety-nine percent of the way, and of course I must recommend the film simply on the grounds that it teams up Danny DeVito and ""B"" sci-fi legend Deep Roy! Quite delightful, and another strong entry in an unusually good year for films.",9
30 January 2013,beautiful looking film fails to move,"Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"", like it's main character is extravagant, earnest, and likable. Unfortunately also like it's main character it is distant, narcissistic, and delusional. Big Fish has the wrong main character. The one emotionally resonant part of the film is unfortunately sidelined by acres of entertaining glitz. The story concerns the son of the main character {Edward Bloom, played by Albert Finny and Ewan Mcgregor} realizing how little he knows about his father who is slowly dying. That would be the emotionally resonant part of the movie. Unfortunately that is reduced to about 10% of the movies running time, the other 90% concerns the life of Edward which (like the movie) is pretty much 90% made up, hence the frustration of his son. Ideal there would have been a 50-50 balance between the real and the very unreal, though since that is not so it is often jarring when the story briefly switches gears to catch up with real life only to shift right back again. It's frustrating and unsatisfying. My thought is that Burton sees himself as Bloom, who refuses to conform to reality, in a sort of response to critics who have said that his films feel fake. I have always disagreed ( Edward Scisorhands and Sweeny Todd are masterpieces of time and place, anything but fake) though ironically this film feels at times kind of artificial. Not always though, and for the most part it's entertaining and thoughtful. With fine performances by everyone, all though Finny is sometimes garble voiced, and Marion Cotillard and Jessica Lange's characters are underwritten they do their best. Of course the film has a normally gorgeous Burton look to it, and he does a fine job of at least visually underlining the difference in feeling of reality and fantasy. Though by the time it's over your brain might be whizzing your heart will likely remain curiously untouched. At least I thought so. The ending however is pretty fantastic and would probably have had a profound emotional impact if Burton had decided to forgo some of the admittedly trite fantasy in favor of a a more full portrait of the relationship between the father and his sons. There is a heartrendingly real story in lurking Big Fish so it's a shame that Burton ditches it (until the end) for an amusingly fake one.",5
16 May 2004,Truly an enjoyable and magical film,"Big Fish is a piece of art work. Tim Burton, the master of dark films makes a great superior film that is great for the audience. I thought Big Fish was going to be a decent movie, that you could just say, "" Oh,oh well, just another fantasy kind of movie."" But no, I never said that. I enjoyed it considerably. It might not be one of the best films of 2003, but it sure was entertaining and left me with a big smile. The scenes were very cool actually. Like the big guy named Carl meating Edward, the dandilides or whatever scene, the army war scene, and the carnival scenes. All were definitely enjoyable. Ewan McGregor was excellent and same with Albert Finney. A good film that everyone should see.

14 January 2004,Tim Burton's Tall Tale,"""Big Fish"" is the latest movie directed by Tim Burton. You can tell it's a Burton film as it has his unique touch. Who else could make such beautiful weirdness on the screen? This movie has a clever, poignant story and amazing imagery. Prepare to thrill to the sight of Karl the giant, and Ping and Jing, the Siamese twins. So don't let ""Big Fish"" get away!

12 January 2004,Heartwarming and enjoyable fairy tale,"The name of the movie should have been Big Fish Stories, because it is about the fantastic and unbelievable stories of the life of Edward Bloom (Albert Finney). Edward has been a storyteller his whole life, and he has told and retold these colorful stories to his son, Will (Billy Crudup) with embellishments. The son doesn't know who his father really is, and he hasn't spoken to his father for years. His mother (Jessica Lange) calls him in Paris that his father is dying. Will, with his new wife, flies home to his father's deathbed to make things right. Edward does the one thing he loves, and tells his tall-tales about a big cat-fish, a giant, a witch, conjoined-twins, the circus, how he met his wife, and the birth of Will. Will doesn't know when his father was telling the truth or crossing into fantasy, and in the end, Will becomes the storyteller. The whole movie is Edward's stories, begun in truth and blended with fiction and fantasy, better, to Edward, than the ordinary lives we actually live. Albert Finney was great as a storyteller, and if you look at this movie as a fairy tale, then it was heartwarming and enjoyable. It wouldn't hurt if they cut 30 minutes. (Columbia Pictures, Run Time 2:05, Rated PG-13) (7/10)

6 November 2022,Typical Tim Burton's routine,"Tim Burton's tics and bestiary can arouse interest, or boredom, it depends on taste. It also depends on the films. His universe is coherent. This Big Fish is in the personal vein. It is a rather nice story that allows Tim Burton to create a tale that disturbs this deep America. There are scary places. There are supernatural and sympathetic characters, or not. And more or less scary beings, typical of Tim Burton's bestiary, mixed with the clichés of the perfect or supposedly dreamed life.

Then, the story invites a measured empathy for the various characters, led by Billy Crudup and Ewan McGregor. The character of Albert Finney is more problematic, and especially the reason for the plot, that is to say very functional, and does not arouse any empathy. As for Jessica Lange, she is less than functional. The film at least has the interest of inviting a rich and generally successful cast.

The film is saved by its conclusion, not predictable, but obvious, and all that precedes has no reason to exist except to prepare this end which is a release of the characters and the dramatic arc.",7
27 November 2007,A pleasant surprise,"Big Fish is an interesting movie for me to review. For one thing, it is directed by Tim Burton, and I generally don't like Tim Burton's movies. (What he did to Charlie and the Choclolate Factory was despicable in my opinion) But Big Fish did something that I thought any Tim Burton movie would never do: make me think that this was an enjoyable movie. Big Fish stars Ewan McGregor (Star Wars Episodes 1-3, The Island, Black Hawk Down) as Edward Bloom, a man who considers himself to be a big fish in a small pond, hence the title of the movie. Now, the story of Big Fish is told on two fronts: the first front being Edward Bloom as an old man in the present day dying from cancer, telling his son's wife all of these stories of his own youth, however, the son believes that the stories that his father tells are nothing but lies, and this whole part of the movie is the son, William, trying to know more about his father by getting his father to tell him the truth about his life before his eventual death, The second front is told in the late 1950s and mid 1960s with the young Edward Bloom living these stories that the older version of Edward Bloom is telling, even though the stories told are pretty exaggerated. There are also nice cameos of Helena Bonham Carter, Danny DeVito, and Steve Buscemi. I thought that Big Fish was a very good movie, and it easily earns a place on my Top 100 Movies of All Time list. Now this movie does suffer from a few weaknesses. One weakness is the fact that the movie has the same Burton-style animation, and I have never really been that big of a fan of his animation style. The second weakness is that I personally thought that there was a little bit of deadweight. However, I find these weaknesses to be pretty minimal. I'm surprised that this movie only got a very limited release when it first came out, because I think that it would have done very well in the theaters. Overall, Big Fish is a very nice movie, and it really surprised me, because I loved this movie. I give Big Fish 8.5 stars out of 10, and if you see it at your local video store, I say pick it up and give it a chance. It could very well worth your while.",8
26 May 2005,Another Kind of Fairy Tale,"Fairy Tales come in all shapes and sizes; we had films from Disney about relationships (Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, and Cinderella); Steven Spielberg and his Sci-Fi movies about average people seeing the impossible (Jurassic Park, E.T., and CEO3K); now in Tim Burton's film ""Big Fish,"" the imagination has gone beyond our wildest dreams, where one person stories has made a difference to others.

""Big Fish"" is a story about a father (Albert Finney) and his son (Billy Crudup) in which the son doesn't want to have a relation with his father after many of the bologna stories he has heard from time to time about the big fish, a giant, and meeting the love of his life (Jessica Lange).

The character Ed Bloom (Finney) is dying of cancer and his wife has called her only son with his wife to fly from Paris to visit his dying father. As it turns out, the son's wife is going to have a baby, and during the visit, they all want to hear the stories that Bloom has said before.

In the pastime, Ewan McGregor plays the young Ed Bloom for which he was the town's hero; he was a jock, a nerd, an inventor or a renaissance man as you might recall him. Until one day, a giant has stock upon the small town that Ed had lived and it is up to him to defeat the giant where he finds out that the creature himself is harmless. In the story, the older Ed tells stories about a young predicator; a group of townspeople that never changed, how he met his sweetheart by working in a circus, entering the Korean War and getting into business to support his wife and child.

Like Harvey Pekar from ""American Splendor,"" I can also relate to Ed Bloom from ""Big Fish"" where the character Ed was a dreamer and a storyteller who wasn't afraid to share it with the rest of the people around him. I was a storyteller in high school where I would tell stories to all the students about what happened during the early days at the school I attended to the people and the events that changed our lives; I was also a dreamer, but unfortunately, my dreams of getting the girl, getting a standing ovation at graduation or having people thanking me for all I did, didn't come true. I just pray that my final story involves my older brother carrying me, like Ed's son did for Ed, and everybody I knew would just be waving and cheering me on as I go on to turn into a fish myself.

This is by far the most personal and best Tim Burton movie I've ever seen.",9
17 March 2004,Only Tim Burton . . .,". . . and his incredibly artistic visionary could bring such a tall tale to life so effectively. I love this story's simplicity. The heart of the story is merely a question  who is Edward Bloom? Answering, however, well. . . we get far more than we could bargain for. The answer is a fantastic ride through Bloom's imagination, a very very unique answer . . . and I can hardly think of any directors besides Burton capable of capturing on celluloid a man's imagination (much less Bloom's imagination).

I love the flashbacks to young Edward Bloom, played by Ewen McGregor, and the over-the-top performance of the whole cast. Combine that with Burton's mastery of frame composition, Elfman's wonderful score, and we have a movie that's a far cry from being real. It's silly--it's impossible--but it feels so right on the screen. This is a tall tale, and there is absolutely no reason to try to hide it. Cast and crew rightly embraces the material for what it is, bringing with them a certain charm that cannot be found in straight productions . . . . . . juxtaposed to a straight production aka reality, a reality that gives a different flavor in its setting and performances--a very different end of the emotional spectrum. Through this contrast, Daniel Wallace reveals from the opening scenes why the story is told the way it is, and why Bloom tells it the way he does. There are many aspects to narrative and storytelling  some subtle, some obvious  but all must be utilized to tell a good story in a way that's interesting. Bloom knows this, Wallace knows this, and so does Tim Burton.

And I'm out of things to say about this film  what can I say, though? It doesn't have what I would consider a plot (definitely *not* a complaint), instead it introduces characters and simply explorers them, thus proving in both novel and feature film form that it is not `what' is told, rather `how' it is told. Wallace and Burton know how to tell it. Because the beauty of Big Fish lay in the `how', this is a film that has to be experienced. I could tell you about it; however, Bloom, Wallace, and Burton have proven to be a far better a story teller than I could hope to be.",
22 January 2004,WHAT A DELIGHTFUL STORY AND SUPERB ACTING,"This certainly was a change of pace from the movies put out nowadays. Albert Finney is one of our finest actors, and it is sad to see him getting older, when he was a delight in his early film with Audrey Hepburn ONE FOR THE ROAD. The two hours went fast and the direction was excellent. Go see this one if you want a movie that is not a shoot em up, blow em up movie.

Reminded me of my own father who told lots of stories I was never sure whether he was telling the truth or not. We all exaggerate the past in our life fables.

19 May 2012,An Admirable Art Form,"You can say Big Fish is a queer kind of theme for the great plot and little stories it comprises, but undeniably it is a genuine piece of art that continues to amaze viewers in personal ways for each individual. It is the kind of film that is distinctively moving, special, and special in different, varying ways for different people.

On the surface, it is a son's penetratingly emotional journey to reconcile with his father. It depicts a story that reconnects a parting relationships, and experiences that inspire. The tone is light and easily manages to pull the audience in, without the usual cheesy elements. The film starts and ends with a big fish, and in between are uncountable stories that are intriguingly touching and inspirational.

There are no easy words to describe such a vivid experience that can only be experienced first-hand through directly viewing the bittersweet journey of a man's life and the underlying reflections.",3
8 November 2005,"If you liked ""Edward Scissorhands...""","""Big Fish"" (2003): You MIGHT have to already have some experience with Tim Burton's films - at least some of them - or you'll MIGHT end up feeling baffled and unfulfilled by this one. I'm not sure. When Burton is at his best, his films are like no one else's. In my opinion, if you like his film ""Edward Scissorhands,"" you'll like ""Big Fish"" - for it is it's closest relative. The idea of ""Big Fish"" takes on a number of meanings throughout the story, and although it feels a little heavy handed at times (perhaps as it relates to the character of the Father), it's very entertaining, has some strong emotions, lots of unique laughs, people, sets, and circumstances, and ends up making it's point - with enough room left for your personal vision to join in. God Bless the story tellers in our lives. What would we be without them? Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Danny DeVito, Steve Buscemi, Alison Lohman, Ewan McGregor, Helena Bonham Carter, Billy Crudupmy god, who else do you want? (And there ARE more.)

20 January 2005,"Wonderful movie, with the Burton-esquire controls turned slightly down for a moving father-son experience","What a movie. I am not entirely sure what I was expecting considering this is a Tim Burton movie, but I was drawn to it since it stars Ewan MacGregor and Albert Finney.

What I found was a surprise. Although it packs the usual Burton bizarreness, it contained a lot of simple family drama, and in particular analysis of the ever present Father-Son relationship issues.

It struck me that the usual bizarre facet to Burton didn't end up controlling this movie, nor did it overpower the sections which contained it. In fact in the context of the story they were very accessible and unintrusive, and more to the point they were extremely relevant to the plot.

The tall tales were very much part of the story, part of the Fathers life, and this is what the Son could never understand. He felt he didn't know who his Father was, and to an extent he never. However the conclusion and how the story comes to it's double end is wonderfully satisfying, and for a man who has experienced any similar type of relationship (which could be high in the 90% mark I would think) very, very moving. I was so moved I was bubbling like mad! It's also interesting how you travel on this journey through the movie. When it began I was struggling with the story and felt very much outside it with the movie failing to pull me in. Little by little however, it did, and before I knew it I was enjoying each of the little quirky tales of the Fathers past and looking forward to the next.

The performances are very good, from MacGregor and Finney in particular, Jessica Lange also puts in a wonderful performance with little words, but pulling off a very natural and strong performance, it's hard to believe how beautiful she still looks, stunning.",8
10 May 2006,Just pitiful,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

12 March 2004,"Telling stories, storytelling and a very telling story","There are two types of ""big fish:"" one is the proverbial ""one that got away"" and the other is the resident of the so-called ""small pond."" The Big Fish in BIG FISH is both. As played by the larger-than-life Albert Finney, Edward Bloom is a teller of tall tales who maintains his status in the small pond of his life by keeping all who will listen informed about all the ones that got away. Whether he is a habitual liar or merely a rascally old coot is totally up to the listener. You either laugh with him or at him.

To his son, Will (Billy Crudup), Ed is the liar. All the tales he tells have alienated him from his son. Ed insists that his stories are who he is, they tell all there is to know about Ed's vision of the world. But Will thinks the stories exist only to hide who Ed really is from the world.

What one sees as a bridge, the other sees as a wall.

Part of the chip on Will's shoulder is made up of jealousy. Ed's whoppers about his encounters with giants, werewolves, mermaids and the like were first devised by the young Ed (Ewan McGregor) to amuse Will the child. Eventually they became fodder for parties and banquet toasts. Gifts for the child were freely shared with the rest of the world. Will wants a piece of his father to call his own. Ed doesn't have that much more to give.

BIG FISH is about walking the line between lying and embellishing. It is a thin line: a lie is an embellishment you can't accept; an embellishment is a lie you can. These are embellishments that are easy to accept thanks to Tim Burton's eye for the mystical, the bizarre and the just plain crazy. He weaves a colorful tale, and interweaves it with a touching story of a father and son reunion. It is all so beautifully done.

But BIG FISH is also a story about storytelling, be it the after dinner yarn or the multimillion dollar movie. From the latter stand point, it is Tim Burton's personal story -- and the story of all filmmakers. Burton seems to be saying ""This is me. This is my life. I am my movies; my movies are me. It's all true, with embellishments.""",10
16 April 2021,Nothing Fishy Going on Here,"Watching a Tim Burton movie and complaining about it being whimsical, that's like watching an Alfred Hitchcock movie and complaining about it being too suspenseful. You know what you're getting into. I love whimsy, done right, and Tim Burton knows how to do it.

Big Fish is Tim Burton really restrained, telling the most ""normal"" story in his career at this point. Before this, it was all Batman, Beetlejuice and anything with Johnny Depp. This story has genuine and realistic characters, but, of course, there's the stories Ed Bloom tells his son and anyone who'll listen, that's where the whimsy and wonder comes in.

But wait! Underneath all this lies a truly great father/son dynamic, one that many in the audience could relate to. I am nothing like my father either, and trying to relate to him has only gotten worse over time. This movie puts all of that in THE BIG PICTURE, and that's when you realize a lot of petty things really don't matter much at the end. It really makes me think about my life and things that have happened.

Have never noticed the similarities between Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney until now, and now I wonder why I haven't. Both are terrific in the same role of Ed Bloom, younger and older. Casting both Jessica Lange and Steve Buscemi in this guaranteed that I would see this movie. Both have smaller but vital roles in this story.

Sometimes, Big Fish seems a bit clunky and slow, but the great out weights the not-so-great, and when this movie soars, you will soar with it.

Danny DeVito has a most unexpected nude scene, congrats ladies!",9
9 June 2004,Magical movie! Nice one Burton!,"This is a typically imaginative and charming film from maestro Tim Burton. After the disappointment of Burtons Planet Of The Apes he goes back to his quirky and unique roots. Films like Edward Scissorhands, BeetleJuice, Sleepy Hollow, which are all specialities of Burton and Big Fish has that feeling. It allows him to show of his visual flair, his humour and his charm.

Big Fish follows the relationship between Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), a much liked and respected man who is allows spinning exaggerated yarns about his life. His son Will is becoming disenchanted with his dying fathers refusal to tell the truth about stories of his life. Will feels he does not know who is father really is. The film basically shows much of Eds like in flashback told in the style of one of Blooms creatively licensed fairy tales. At the same time we follow the relationship in the present day between Will and his dad as Will tries to investigate who his dad really is. As the film progresses and we see more fantastical snippets of Edwards life, from his encounter with a Witch that reveals how he will die, to him wooing the love of his life Sandra, who he married and has stayed with ever since. Will gradually begins to discover that many of the strange characters and events his father encountered were in fact real, albeit exaggerated, from his friend Karl the 15ft giant to a strange town called Sceptre. By the end f course Will starts to appreciate his fathers stories all the more and feels a connection long since gone.

This film is filled with charm and pathos and is just a really enjoyably unique film. The fact that these flashbacks are eccentric stories allows Burton to have full visual flourish. The cast are excellent. Finney is great as Ed Bloom, he steals the show. His performance is both touching and full of boisterous charisma. Jessica Lange is also good as his adoring wife. As for the younger versions of Edward and Sandra, well they are excellently portrayed by Ewan McGregor and delightfully loveable Alison Lohman. Billy Crudup is very good to as Will. There is also great support from Danny Devito, Steve Buscemi and Helena Bonham-Carter.

Burtons musical collaborator the legendary Danny Elfman gives us all another virtuoso score and one that is far more understated and low-key than Elfman usually is asked to provide. Overall this is a magical film and a return to form for one of cinemas great visual directors, Tim Burton. ****",9
4 May 2018,"Happy, unique and imaginative.","Big fish is an utterly unique film and such a feel tale. A colourful imagination makes the world a huge place of adventure, allows for indulgent story telling and injects brightness into the mundane.

1 August 2004,Touching for Fathers and Sons,"I never knew my dad. He was only a distant childhood memory. I know he got angry at me once and I remember kissing him on the cheek. Why am I mentioning this? Because it's only pertinent to me and it will (maybe not) touch those of you out there in similar situations. And so this movie goes. It was so slow at one point I started playing my computer game (Q3A).

This is a personal story between a specific son and his father... one which you can only get involved in if you lived through it. And so this is the movie's weakness - it doesn't draw you in. I was tempted to call this a ""chick flick"" b/c of it's almost sentimental feel, but in the end the movie pulled together making it not that bad to see for fathers and sons. 8/10

Danny DeVito and Steve Buscemi light up the big screen when they appear.

18 January 2004,"A beautiful ensemble of acting, writing and direction...","...""Big Fish"" is cult director Tim Burton's latest film. Unlike most of his other work (except for maybe ""Edward Scissorhands"") this film has a more happy and fun tone to it. The plot focuses on two stories: in the first (and frame story) William Bloom (Billy Crudup) visits his mother Sandra (Jessica Lange) and estranged father Ed (Albert Finney). Will hasn't seen his dad in years, so he wants to get to know him before the man passes away. Ed agrees, but his stories don't always seem as true or realistic as possible.

In his stories he is portrayed by Ewan McGregor, and we watch him travel the world and meet many interesting people. He meets a lonely giant named Karl (Matthew McGrory), works for a greedy circus ringmaster (Danny DeVito) and runs into a beautiful town called Spectre with inhabitants like would-be-poet Norther Winslow (Steve Buscemi in a delightful role). As he hears these stories over and over again, Will begins to get suspicious that his father has a double life. I wont spoil anything else for you!

The acting, writing and direction is all wonderful. The best performance of the movie (by far) comes from Albert Finney's Old Ed Bloom. The man is jolly and sad, dying and yet he has a childish giddiness to him. The role was perfect for Finney, and he was perfect for the role. McGregor also does quite well (especially with his accent), and, of course, the supporting cast shines - most notably Lange in a tender, beautiful role.

The scriptwriting is creative and clever, a definite nom for Best Adapted Screenplay (and hopefully a win). Tim Burton gives us a new view of himself, not only is he a brilliant horror director but he can also make a touching drama.

So if you're itching to see the Oscar contenders of 2003, see ""Big Fish"" first, 8.5/10.",
21 December 2003,"Yes, another dull film intended to influence children","Children enjoy films like this, and just about noone else does. Films like this contain nothing fresh. Just a database of 'programming' , from which children learn hollywood's little codified protocols as they watch what they think is an adult film. I despise bland historical fiction schmaltz like this.

26 April 2008,Beautiful is the Best Way to Describe It,"Tim Burton's Big Fish is an absolute masterpiece and one of my new all time favorite movies. I just finished watching it for the first time and I am still sitting here, feeling amazed. Tim Burton is one of my favorite, if not my favorite modern director and he shows me why with every film I see of his. This gave me the same blown away feeling as films like Edward Scissorhand, Ed Wood, Sweeney Todd, and Sleepy Hollow.

The story is the whole backbone to the movie so it has to be amazing and it definitely is. The visuals and effects are dazzling also. The acting is awesome from everyone. The direction is utterly brilliant as well. THis is a big winner according to me! Tim Burton fans, see this movie!!! Now!!! I'm not kidding!!!!

26 April 2004,A big fish of a film,"A long time Tim Burton fan, I was anxious to see this film for the story of a father who tells tales that you can't quite figure out if they are unbelievably ridiculous or true in a sense but exaggerated beyond belief. Whatever it is, it works in the way that we find out what we need to find out. Ewan Macgregor looks as though he stepped out of a 50's Crest Toothpaste commercial; Albert Finney who is always wise beyond his years. Yes there are elements of the ridiculous- Karl the giant, the Japanese twins and Calloway the circus manager (who is something else entirely by night). But it's okay-because in the end, it develops as a beautiful father/son story.

8 February 2004,"Welcome back, Tim the magician.","That's what we're talking about when we talk about Tim Burton: giant men, beautiful green-covered villages where everyone is barefoot, a world of fantasy that this man has given us, that now, after the ""Planet of the Apes"" experience, is back into the screen. Of course, the sheer poetry of ""Edward Scissorhands"" or the mythical flare of ""Batman"" are not overwhelming like before, but what we have here is a work of maturity, and the result is a work that, for the first time, creates the dream world and also the point of view that questions it. The result is a beautiful film, that allows us to dream and live reality in equal parts, trying to make us feel like the title character when we come out. How much it affects us is up to you, I was touched by the sincerity and heart of such a tender tale. No cheap morale, no unnecessary eye candy - just the world, as seen by a dreamer. And that warmness is everything that we aim for. Could be labeled as the american ""Amélie Poulain"", but is so much more...

30 April 2004,Terrific,"This movie brings a smile to your face. Albert Finney is excellent as a tall talking old man who is trying to comes to terms with his son before he dies. Ewan McGregor is also excellent as a young Finney who goes on extraordinary adventures. We know where this movie is going and yet we enjoy the ride. Will the son find evidence that some of what his father says is true? What do you think? I remember the late Gene Siskel used to say that fathers got a bad rap in movies. They were cheating and nonexistant people for their sons. Well, this movie is a coming together of fathers and sons. With way too many cynical movies out there today, this is a welcome change. I highly recommend this movie. I give it an 8/10.

9 May 2004,A Big Bore,"The best part about this movie is the end, because it was finally OVER! The sets are pleasing to the eye, but the stories are dull, and there are way too many. The movie gave me a blowhard character I didn't care about and launched into about fifty stories that served as showcases for Burton's ""magical"" wackiness. I didn't mind the acting, but more development for the Albert Finney character would've been helpful. I cared very little about the outcome and had to fight hard to stay awake during the last forty-five minutes (only out of courtesy to the hosts who invited us over to watch it). Turned out they felt the same way I did about the movie, so I could've just thrown in the towel and fallen asleep. The fact that this snoozer is in the top 250 is absolutely mystifying.

28 December 2003,Not Burton's best Work but still a Wonderful Movie,"The movie starts of with Edward Bloom(Albert Finney), telling one of his famous yet annoying stories to his son Will(Billy Crudap), who is now a grown married man and about to have a family of his own. Will can't stand his father's stories, I mean, they are just fairytales, none of the stories that his dad has been telling him his whole life really happened, right? Will and his father stop communicating for a few years but when Edward starts growing older and weaker and closer to his dying day, Will and his pregnant wife Josephine(Marion Cotillard) come to visit and the story of Edward Bloom is told. The story is mostly narrated by Will without knowing if his father's stories are true or if they are all just a big lie and part of the story is narrated by Edward himself. The tale starts of with a young Edward Bloom(Ewan McGregor) and his many adventures starting from when he was a little boy and meeting the old witch(Helena Bonham Carter) that lives by the swamp with the glass eye, to meeting Karl the Giant(Matthew McGrory) and leaving town with him, to joining the circus and finally finding the love of his life, his wife Sandra(Alison Lohman). While Edward's life might often sound unbelievable, Will believes there might be some truth to it and he is bound to really find out the story of his father's life and love him for what he was and always will be: A big adventurous fish with an imagination bigger then life itself. I am a big fan of Tim Burton and while this may not be his best work, it's certainly a wonderful movie. All the characters are beautiful and unique in their own way and the movie itself is just simply magical and filled with beautiful moments. I would give Big Fish 8/10.",8
18 July 2005,Masterpiece.,"This must be Tim Burton's masterpiece - an amazing portrayal of father / son relationships brought forward by a series of metaphors, which ends up quite surprisingly. After watching the film, I bought the novel and was (gasp!) disappointed by it. The novel is drier, a lot more realistic, and colder in its approach. Burton's movie is a lot warmer, funnier, exaggerated, and poignant. I watched this movie with my father - it was a most moving experience.

Tim Burton's style is quite a feast for the eyes, too. Combining a fantasy story with his strange, eerie vision makes the whole movie a feast for the eyes; the metaphors, combined with surrealistic settings that never seem to fit quite right in reality are fantastic. I'd find it hard to choose between this movie and ""Nightmare Before Christmas""...

28 January 2004,Moderately interesting and entertaining,"The story deals with a father-son relationship. In the son's early years -- say at bedtime -- the son was enthralled by his father's stories about his previous adventures.

But as he hears these same stories repeated (eventually _ad nauseum_), he views them as ""shtick"" -- his father's routine to be performed at any social gathering that permits it -- and he becomes resentful of his father's reliance on them. His being forced into the posture of a passive, appreciative audience prevents him from ever really knowing his father or having an adult-adult relationship with him. The stories form an impenetrable facade and shield. In reaction, the son becomes estranged from his father until his mother calls him and says his father is dying. The son returns home with his new wife, hoping to re-establish an honest, intimate relationship with his father before his father dies. His wife is pregnant and he urgently wants to accomplish this -- to form a satisfying relationship -- before he himself becomes a father.

The movie very satisfactorily develops that.

What happens next is that son gradually finds some pieces of evidence that his father may have had some adventures that formed building blocks for his father's schtick.

Burton and his movie dramatize the father's fanciful stories and that forms the backbone and length (205 minutes!) of the film.

Somehow, by finding that the stories were not _entirely_ fanciful, that there may have been some reality building blocks in them, the son reconciles himself to his father and accepts him for what he is. And at the end, at the funeral, we see a visual evidence that his father's fanciful tales had some basis in reality.

What's given us are marvelous, fanciful representations of the tall tales. And the son's brief searches for realities behind the stories also are given fanciful, fairy tale twists. What we are not given (at least not given to me) is a satisfying sense of what helps the son suddenly give up his desire for intimacy with his father and click into accepting his father's stories and his father.

IF we view the whole thing as it probably should be -- as a fairy tale composed of a collection of fairy tales -- then it makes a moderately entertaining evening. The cast was great. But it could have been more.",7
6 January 2004,nodded off,"Really wanted to like this movie, but couldn't keep my eyes open. It lacks both a compelling conflict and suspenseful storyline. Or any story to speak of. Delightful little episodes that add up to nothing and the charm wears on you after a while. Keep waiting for Billy Crudup to find a role that really allows him to shin

26 November 2011,Tim Burton's masterpiece!,"Big Fish proves that Burton is as good as any other director in Hollywood. This is a beautiful and heartwarming story that showcases Burton's oddball reality alongside fine cinematography and a beautiful script that instead of focusing on the weird, focuses on beauty and love with Burton's usual flamboyantly bizarre images thrown in. The result is a masterpiece of storytelling with McGregor in his best performance yet and Buscemi in a great comic relief piece. This is certainly an example of original storytelling, but it is also an example of how filmmakers can use different narratives to tell virtually the same story but in a stunningly fresh and witty format. Do not hold back the tears, they will come out anyway.

16 May 2004,"A Lovely, Heartwarming, Mystical Fantasy","This was the surprise of the year for me. Although I have admired and respected Tim Burton for being able to bring his ""visions"" to the screen, I have felt disconnected from his movies due to characters (other than Edward Scissorhands) that were either uninteresting or unbelievable. With ""Big Fish"" you get it all. Wonderful storytelling by an artful director, and wonderful fleshed out characters brought to life by some fabulous actors.

From the start of the movie, you pretty much can figure out how the movie will end. Think of a combination of ""The Wizard of Oz"", and ""I Never Sang For My Father"". Dying father, disconnected son. Son feels he doesn't really know his father. Son is tired of hearing father's tall tales. Mother caught in the middle. You know what's going to happen, but it's the trip on the way to the end of the movie, that makes the movie so rewarding.

So many heartwarming but never smarmy moments. The fairytale is told in a truly lyrical style. The effects and visual feel of the movie is magical. Burton and his crew have created a feast for the eyes (not to mention a ton of tongue in cheek references to other Burton films).

Finney, Lange, McGregor and De Vito are all excellent.

I wish this film would have done better in winning more awards at the end of the year. It deserved them. 9 out of 10",9
27 December 2003,"A visual stunning, well directed, and well made film by no one other than the man himself Tim Burton","Big Fish was a movie that I was looking forward too all year. I am a huge fan of Tim Burton. His work is always brilliant and completely original. I own all of his movies and three of his movies; the Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, and Sleepy Hollow are my all time favorite movies. So when Big Fish finally arrived in Voorhees, NJ yesterday I made it my top priority to rush out and see it at the earliest convenience. So today I headed all the way to Voorhees to see Big Fish.

Big Fish is the tenth feature film Tim Burton directed. It is without a doubt an original film with a lot of imagination. The film is about a man named Edward Bloom played by both Ewan McGregor & Albert Finney. Ewan McGregor played Edward Bloom when he was young and Albert Finney played Edward as an Adult. Edward Bloom was always a man who told stories about his life, which were all, mixed with Tall Tales. He never wanted to tell a boring story so he told the truth within the fiction. The movie tells the story of Edward Bloom and you the viewer have to decide which part of the story is real and which is imaginary. Big Fish is a very interesting experience and has a lot of elements I noticed from previous Tim Burton films.

The film's acting was of coarse top notch like all of Burton's previous films. The acting is never poor. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney both do a great job as Edward Bloom by living out this extraordinary life they were given. The supporting cast including Steve Buscemi as Norther Winslow, Billy Crudup as Edward's Son William, Jessica Lange as the older wife of Edward Bloom, the beautiful Alison Lohman as the younger wife of Edward Bloom, and Helena Bonham Carter as Jenny the witch all did a great job although most of the people mentioned were not in the film for more than 15 to 25 minutes.

As Tim Burton, well his imagination soared throughout this film. The film was very creative and I enjoyed seeing all these unique characters. But I think this is also where the fault lies. There are to many characters. I couldn't keep up with them all, because were so many. It was an over abundance of characters. The camera angles in this film as always were superb and the creative sets were outstanding. I really liked how this Edward Bloom's mind was so filled of this imaginary world. Another disappointment I had with the film was this, it was very upbeat and not dark like all of Burton's previous films. I am used to the darker Burton and like him a bit more. I do understand why he did make a more upbeat film because he wanted to gain more audiences because the darker films are aimed towards a smaller-target audience.

The writer John August did a great job on this script especially since this man was the one who wrote the horrible Charlie's Angels 1 & 2 and Titan A.E. You see what a good script can do with the help of a great director. It can make a film that will be nominated for Golden Globe Awards and Academy Awards. Keep writing John August and leave those bad films behind you because you have a creative mind and you sure proved that with Big Fish.

So In Conclusion, I am a huge fan of Tim Burton. I worship the man. I own all his films and collect his merchandise. I can only wish one day I can make a film 1/10 as great as this man if I ever fulfill my dream as becoming a director. Now its time for the questions: Did I like Big Fish? Absolutely! Was I disappointed a bit with the film? Yes I thought many of his previous films including Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas were a lot better and displayed more of Tim Burton's unique mind. I will be seeing Big Fish again because I think it will be better with repeated viewings since at first I had such high hopes for it and now its out of my system. Although I don't think this film is Tim Burton's best film to date, it is still an excellent film, which should target many more people than the usual Burton followers like me. Keep up the great movies Mr. Burton you will one day be one of the biggest & best directors of all time. You are already the best director to me. My final rating for Big Fish is an 8.5/10.",8
3 July 2021,This Film has EVERYTHING you need to make a Personal Story,"Big Fish is one of the best Tim Burton movies ever. Now I have only seen this, Beetlejuice, Batman, Batman Returns, and Charlie and the Chocolate factory. This is my favorite of all the ones I've seen but I haven't seen most of his movies. But I think this film is a masterpiece.

The storytelling is what makes this movie great. Even though the cast is fantastic and the shots are stunning, it's the storytelling which makes this one brilliant.

You have all of these locations, creatures, and characters that are so creatively made. Edward Bloom is a really interesting character to explore and the stories he tells are always exciting. Then on the other hand you have this depressive son who is sick of his fathers stories. I feel like some people can really relate to this story and everyone can connect to it. And the ending is just one of the most satisfying endings ever. Such a beautiful movie.

Overall, this is a great showcase of what Tim Burton can do and I love it. A 10/10 in it's genre and a 10/10 overall for me.",10
12 January 2004,Entertaining with some Burton added to it,"I really did enjoy this film. It wasn't excellent but the story was interesting and the acting was great on almost all parts. Tim Burton did a good job but it was different than most his films. This one was not as dark and was more of a drama than he usually does. People do need to see this film. It is well worth the time spent.

17 January 2004,Big Fish...Big Disappointment.,"Big Fish was a poorly crafted, waste of good celluloid. The effects were mediocre, at best and the story line was disjunct and uninspiring. If this is any indication of the future of Burton's fantasy genre, you can have my seat. I don't see how these actors, many of whom I respected before seeing them in this travesty, were willing to waste their time to contribute to such a poor film. Reviews I have read, including this site's, gave the film 4 of 5 stars. Ridiculous. You garner no points on my scale by simply saying a movie has merit because its director has had some prior successes. In my opinion, you owe the viewers an apology for luring them in with the bait of a good film, only for them to find an rusty tin can on their line when they reel it in. My vote still remains...awful!

19 January 2005,Whimsical fun!,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

20 October 2005,"Maybe I didn't enjoy it as much as others did, but I still liked it. It' s pretty fishy, too....","Big Fish is the story of Edward Bloom, and his son. The son believes that his father, Edward has been telling tall tales to explain about his life. This movie shows the tall tales and what happened. The result is a fun, but strange movie experience. This movie does show signs of Tim Burton, and you all know Burton. If not, I can tell you now, Butron is one of the most creative and odd directors alive. For example, there is a giant person in one scene, and conjoined twins in the next. You may not believe it now, but this movie is pretty weird. It tells of Edward's adventures, friends, visits, romance and life. Like the Princess Bride, this movie is pretty much a story told by one persons point of view.

The movie is called Big Fish, but everything with the fishes is unexplained. There is a fish that looks like a naked woman, a fish attracted to gold, and the ending is a little fishy too. The movie seems to fail to explain why there are so much fish, and what they do with the storyline. However, this movie is a unique and original experience that is probably worth watching.

8 January 2004,Somewhat disappointing but still very good (***),"Tim Burton's thankful return to making films in his own style after the dull, ordinary ""Planet Of The Apes"" remake in 2001, ""Big Fish"" isn't quite the fantasy masterpiece I wanted it to be, but is quite good anyway.

Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is what you would call a storyteller. All his life he has dazzled everyone around him with tall tales about his own life at the drop of a hat, and they are always the right story for the situation. According to him, he has worked in a circus, traveled with a giant, braved a haunted forest, met a witch with a mystical glass eye, found an Eden-like town in the middle of a forest where everyone is always happy, and much, much more. Now, though, he is old, with cancer, and about to die.

His son, William (Billy Crudup), was once just as dazzled as everyone else at his stories, but over time grew tired of his father constantly hogging the spotlight with his silly stories and hasn't spoken to him in years. He leaves with his wife from his home in Paris to return home and try to reconcile with his father.

The elder Bloom has always maintained that every word of his tall tales are absolutely true, that he really did do all those things, but William finally wants to hear the truth about his life. Edward, though, is still resolute that all those stories are true, and as we see those stories for ourselves (with a fresh-faced Ewan MacGregor as the young Edward), we begin to wonder (hope, actually) that some of it might be true.

If ever there was a story that was perfect for Tim Burton (""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Ed Wood"", ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"") to tell, this story, about the power of imagination, is it. However, something about it just didn't come together for me. Some of the stories just didn't engage me very much and at times the Burton-esque oddness seems a little forced.

But there are tons of good qualities, not the least of which are good performances by Finney, MacGregor, Crudup, Jessica Lange (as the elder Bloom's wife and William's mother), and Steve Buscemi (as a traveling poet). And I freely admit to crying my eyes out in the last 15 minutes, when the entire film comes together beautifully. Suddenly, right then, I felt the Tim Burton whose style I fell in love with in ""Edward Scissorhands"" back when I was 12, and that, more than anything, made it worth seeing.",7
14 November 2021,Loved the point of the movie,"Big Fish is a movie about an old man who tends to tell stories about his life that are ""a bit"" exaggerated and his son can't stand all these stories that are lies from his ponti of view. The movie is entertaining and I think can be watched without looking for some major messages but its message is what I liked the most because I could relate to it. My grandpa is like the protagonist of this movie but in a more realistic way: he tells the stories about his youth coloring the situations and making them more compelling. I perfectly know this but I accept the richer details because it's more fun, they allow me to better enjoy and remember these stories. Life is sometimes boring or sad so let's laugh and enjoy it when we can. No one will eventually care about some exaggerated details (as long as they don't damage anyone) and so let's take their entertainment. Us as a human specie like some well told stories, we need to imagine and dream and some colored details can only help.

5 November 2018,Great Heartfelt Story,"Big Fish is about a dad that tells a lot of stories. His son does not like that he always ruins his moments with his story so he tries to find out if they are real.

Big Fish is a great movie. The story was great. It was such an interesting story. Some times it was a little farfetched but for the most part it was great. The acting was great. Ewan McGregor did great is his role. He felt like a real person did all the things he did. The scenery was great. The town looked great. It looked really realistic. Some times the movie also got funny. That was a great touch to this movie. The whole time it did feel like a person was actually telling the story of his past years.

Big Fish is a great movie. On of the best Tim Burton movies out there.

29 July 2009,Quite unimpressive,"I honestly expected more from a relatively recent Tim Burton movie than this one turned out to be. Overall quite unimpressive. Ranging from the poor cast choice for the main actors, to overall weakness of the script and story, the only thing that doesn't make it entirely awful is the fact that some effort was put into creating the scenes for the different parts of the story, but it barely pulls this movie off the mark for me. All in all, the ""revisiting"" by the son of the stories told over and over by his dad his entire life makes for a predictable, closed story with a weak execution; I'm sure it may have some significance for some people, but it absolutely lacked any sort of atmosphere, magic or feeling, except for a few scenes that actually looked halfway decent.

Overall, an unimpressive rendering of an unconvincing story, with decent acting but a poor choice of cast, some obligatory eye candy, but not convincing, compelling or mood-setting enough to make a difference. A disappointment. Definitely not worth more than a 3/10, almost a 2/10.",3
10 January 2004,"Tall tales? True stories? Doesn't matter, this film is excellent!","What a great film! A great story, a fun and touching script, great acting, and a quintessential Tim Burton set design. From start to finish, this film is entertaining and if you're not moved by the ending, you have a heart of stone.

I don't think I've ever been to a film that I could not find even one little thing to gripe about. I have never given a ""10"" to a film before, and doubt I ever will. ""Big Fish"" is a class act that will be tough to follow.

I hope at least the screenplay gets an acknowledgement by the Academy.

26 May 2004,"Amazing film, Burton rules","I must say I was reluctant as I always am when everybody tells me to see a movie - you know, high expections and they almost never gets full filled...

HOWEVER - Big Fish is an amazing film; touching, well (if not even perfectly!) acted, geniously told, and a very nice twist in the end that still leaves a little doubt in my mind what it is actually all about...the kind of film that makes you leave the cinema thinking and not easily forgotten...wonderful...Tim Burton has always been a genius but to my mind this film tops it!

3 February 2004,Burton lets another one get away,"Big Fish has its moments, but they are thinly spread through this surprisingly sluggish fable from Tim Burton. Largely bereft of his customary dark exuberance, his Gump-like tale flounders where it should float, weighed down by unnecessary sentimentality and laboured scenes that lose their punch.

Nothing really happens when young Bloom gets lost in a creepy wood or caught in a storm or when he joins the circus or after he robs a bank. Somehow, his tall story just doesn't seem tall enough.

Burton's previous flights of fancy have always had a flaw that I've never been able to put my finger on, but I think I've finally got it: he shows too much restraint. Beetlejuice should have been crazier. Batman was dark but not dark enough. Edward Scissorhands was blunted by cuteness. Mars Attacks! needed more subversion. Sleepy Hollow needed more Christopher Walken. Planet Of The Apes was just a mistake. Ironically, his best film is the one most grounded in reality: Ed Wood.

Expectations are always high when we hear the words `from the imagination of Tim Burton'. It's high time he let it run riot.",
13 September 2021,Tim Burton's Most Underrated Film!,"Thank you, Tim Burton, for making this movie. While this isn't Burton's most iconic film, it's probably one of the greatest movies he's ever made and criminally underrated. I've never heard of this movie, never seen it, knew nothing before watching - so it was quite the surprise when I found myself sobbing at the end. As always, this Burton film is overflowing with a stellar cast, including the like of Ewan McGregor, Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter, & Albert Finney. I could also go on about all the symbolism that can be analyzed, but this is not that kind of review.

Big Fish is absolutely enchanting. Danny Elfman's score fits right in as we go through Edward's elaborate tales. And as ridiculous & unrealistic as Edward's stories are, there's always themes of love, friendship, & bravery. Real human emotion is displayed despite the fictional aspects. I was completely attached to every second. I connected with every character. And most importantly, I connected to the theme and the story on a much deeper level than I anticipated.

JK Rowling once said ""the stories we love best do live in us forever."" This quote made me appreciate stories in a whole new way from the moment I heard those words. The message of Big Fish is exactly that. The final quote of the film itself is ""A man tells his stories so many times that he becomes the stories. They live on after him, and in that way he becomes immortal."" We are born, we live, we die, and then are forgotten in a blink of an eye. But when we die, how are we remembered? Not every person is celebrated for some extraordinary accomplishment. But that's what is so important about a good story. Take a second and think of a loved one you lost? If I asked, could you think of a good story to share about them?

That final scene of Edward's funeral is one of the best in the movie. While we see all the characters that validate some truth to Edward's tales, we also see them tell stories about their dear friend, probably some tales we've heard before. And this touched me so deeply. I've lost people too, but I love telling others stories about them. Sharing their stories puts me back in the moment, as if I'm reliving and as if they're still around. And in that way, as Will said, they're immortal in that moment. Because ""the stories we love best do live in us forever."" If not by the whole world, then at least by the people who matter most to us. And this was what Big Fish was all about.",9
8 January 2004,A more mature Burton film.,"What can easily be described as a more mature Burton film, BIG FISH is certainly a return to classic Tim Burton elements, elements that were sorely missed in the beleaguered PLANET OF THE APES. Burton is able to wind between the whimsical and the serious and the laughable and the endearing without getting too campy, too heavy or especially too sappy, which this film could have easily become. Burton plays with the camera, the settings, even the actors, mixing up the environments, emotions and motions, but never gets too risky allowing subtle movements to occupy just as much screen time. However, perhaps some of Burton's more extravagant (darker?) motifs would have made the more playful scenes of the movie even more magical.

Some of the tall tales told throughout the film were definitely reminiscent of Gilliam's ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN, although Gilliam allowed the absurd to rule

throughout in that one. Burton could have gotten away with allowing a little more madcap absurdity to creep in a permeate tiny areas, after all Burton and the fantastical are quite the compatriots and as tight as - dare it be said - Batman and Robin.

If anything, BIG FISH proved that Burton could direct stars, stars who could act, mind you, that were as big as the movie itself. Finney and McGregor prove to be just as magical as the story itself. A twinkle of their eye, a big smile, and the audience is ready to believe anything, especially the tales of one big fish from a small pond.",8
22 May 2020,big fish,"In this world, you only need to distinguish between true and false outside of the one you love. There are all kinds of things in life. The so-called truth may be the most tedious and unacceptable. Those who are painted with rainbow colors on the outside of their lives deserve respect and trust because of their love.

5 December 2003,"Fact, fiction, or exaggeration, nothing makes a fish bigger than almost being caught.","This is what I'd call one of the most brilliantly fun movie I've seen this year. It captures the fantasy and myths that any creative mind could present. There are lots of flashbacks that not only drive the viewers to the clues to the young Bloom's colorful life. The story's full of colorful characters that are a joy to watch. And don't dare tell me that the Bloom character couldn't be anyone living within our community. Believe me, they exist. those dear souls that are only too happy to tell their tales, over and over again because some one listening had, at one time or another, seemingly had with wide-eyed interest.

This film, directed by Tim Burton, and with its story adapted from Daniel Wallace's novel of the same, is AWESOME. The storytelling process is phenomenal, with every character marching in and out of scenes worthy of a study. Although the ideas stay close to the book, some of the feelings and traits of the film's characters are personal touches of the Director and the Producer, as the Q&A with Richard Zanuck discloses. The father-son relationship is soulfully developed in the story. The audience is lead on a journey, discovery, capturing who really is Edward Bloom and what had happened to the period of his absence from his family. While the camera shots focus solidly on Ewan McGregor's and Albert Finney's Ed, they never rob me of my interest in the rest of the supporting cast and their characters. Every one and everything fits like well-fitted jigsaw puzzles needed to a fabulous and colorful masterpiece of quilt. The cinematic effects are astoundingly beautiful. and I do mean aesthetically stunning! I was sucked into all kinds of emotions as I watched the characters interact, and actually, at oft times, feeling my eyebrows rising unexpectedly.

I love everything about this movie. including its wackiness. My chest was heaving and I was unconsciously giving out constant gasps of disbelief towards the finale. The symbolisms are fun to decipher. and they leave the audience with plenty to discuss at the end. There are very few movies that allow me to react constantly to the characters from scene to scene. This is one of them. This film offered me a journey of fun, fantasy and emotions. I gasped, I sighed; I cried and laughed as reality hit me. It has a wonderful cast of actors that alone will drive one to see it. It has become a film I'd see over and over again. Indeed, a worthy Oscar WINNER! Brilliant. absolutely brilliant film with a wonderful story! Albert Finney is phenomenal; Ewan McGregor is mesmerizing.

I'd suggest reading the book after you've seen the film. the surprising twists (2 exceptional ones for me!) are what will give you a greater climax of thrill and joy at the end. This is the sort of movie I can watch over and over again.

27 February 2004,Tim Burton at his best,"After ""Planet of the apes"" Tim Burton comes back with a good story, tailored for his creativity and skills. ""Planet"" was a very conventional film, something each experienced director could have done -in fact it was a commissioned film, Tim Burton accepted to do it because he needed money...!

""Big Fish"" is a return to form. Burton transforms Daniel Wallace's novel in a very personal movie -which reminds us to ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Ed Wood"". This film is a declared fairy tale -that's its beauty! People need fairy tales and stories to live with.

Actors are all good. It's interesting to get two different generations of British actors -Finney and McGregor. They act the same role in different moments of life, they really are complementary and at the same time both bring their own charm. Danny De Vito is familiar to Burton's world, he works very well as usual. Also the presence of Helena Bonham Carter (excellent British actress and Burton's girlfriend) and Jessica Lange are welcomed.

Fanciful sets, strange people and a story which never bores. Well done, Mr.Burton! This film is definitely yours!",
25 January 2004,"Tim Burton's Masterpiece,and The Best Film of 03","Big Fish tells the tale of a young man,Will Bloom trying to learn the story of his father's life. His father played by Ewan McGregor,and Al Finney told tall tales to his son. He thinks they are not real. But when his father is dying. He learns to love him,and have a new respect for him. Big Fish is a modern classic. The Best film of the Year. The performances are great. Tim Burton has made the best film of his career,and I`ve seen all his films,and am a fan of his. You will laugh,cry,and cheer at Big Fish.

A very high 4/4!

14 August 2004,Great movie. WATCH IT :D,"This is truly a big movie about a small person with fantastic stories. The main character, tells his life story to everybody that wants to hear about them. And these are not your typical story that you father or uncle tells you. This is an amazing adventure with all the trimmings. When he tells the stories you get to see it as he meant/believed it happen. Throughout the movie you see one amazing thing after another and you are basically blown away with the story being told. This is just a very enjoyable movie from beginning to end. Lots of extreme characters, funny incidents and fantastic locations make this movie absolutely delightful to watch. It is both a fun movie, but it is also very sad at times. So if you are up for a great adventure why not see Big Fish. This is one great movie from beginning till end. . I rate this movie 8/10

21 February 2004,throw this one back?,"""Big Fish"" is a lot of fun to watch, but that's about it. It involves a father, Ed Bloom (Finney) and the tall tales he tells his son Will (Crudup), which are told in flashbacks played by McGregor. The fun in this film is watching Ed Bloom's many adventures and guessing which ones are real and which ones are fabrications. What's true and what isn't is mostly revealed at the end. This film should be classified as a ""warmedy."" It's hard to say if this film is memorable, I liked it but I'm already forgetting it. Still, the story-telling spans a whole life and Tim Burton makes the journey enjoyable. There are quite a number of complex scenes with a lot going on (the circus, the town of Spectre, etc.), that Burton pulls off remarkably well. All in all, a good film.

2 February 2005,It's not hard to catch the greatness of this film,"Big Fish is another great film from the genius director Tim Burton, who has made such great films like Batman, Beatlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, and The Nightmare Before Christmas. Tim Burton's films are conceived differently by certain people. Many people love his movies, but some think he's too bizarre and others just don't bother with his movies because they think the idea is too stupid. Those people don't understand the concept of Tim Burton's movies. His movies are kind of odd on the outside, but they have a great message deep inside. That is what it takes to appreciate his newest film Big Fish.

Big Fish is about an older man(played by Albert Finney) who tells stories about his life. These stories seem very far-fetched, but are true deep inside. This man's son doesn't believe these stories and is seeking to find the real truth behind them. While doing so, he realizes that sometimes it takes imagination and creativity to appreciate the message behind it.

In Big Fish, there is a lot of imagination and brilliant visual effects, as well as great acting and a good message. Before I saw this movie, somebody told me it was very odd. It is a different kind of movie, like all of Burton's other movies, but being odd isn't always a bad thing.

I would highly recommend Big Fish to anyone. If you experienced this movie the way many others have, then it will change the way you look at the world around you.",8
14 January 2004,"Exaggerated, But How Could It Not Be?","In the movie ""Big Fish"" we are asked to follow the life of a weaver of tall tales as described by same. What might we expect? Raised by a man larger than life (Albert Finney as the father), Billy Cruddup (as the son)has tired of his father's larger-than-life image, an image cultivated through a lifetime of storytelling. So many lies and half-truths and distortions that the son cannot perceive where the truth begins and the disinformation ends. And so the two are at odds even though the father is probably on his death bed. Director Tim Burton's fantastically exaggerated view of the father's early life is probably about right. To put it another way, how would a liar describe his own life? Well, certainly not any matter-of-fact recounting would be expected. There are enough diversions strewn in the film's path it elevate it to higher than average level. There are delightful moments punctuated by highjinks that almost elicit a groan of disbelief. Some effects look very good, the actual visual sensations illustrate very high production values - and we would expect that from Burton - yet there enough mild surprises to entertain. And enough about the relationship(s) explored to stir the cerebral in us. But what of the father? What is he really all about, what really happened and why should we care? And do we resolve this father/son dispute? Imagine a lens that magnifies a person-sized object about 1.2 times. That is what a character like that portrayed by Albert Finney appears like to a boy. And does even as an adult.",7
29 March 2004,"A Touching, Imaginative Film","""Big Fish"" is the type of movie that made me think about the good things in life and inspires me to make the most of my life. We all know someone in our lives that would tell some big stories that would let our imaginations run wild, particularly when we were little kids. ""Big Fish"" centers on a father that does this frequently and a son that doesn't know whether to believe anything his father has told him.

All the stories are fun and intriguing with great directing and imagery from Tim Burton and fine acting by everyone involved in this picture. Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor (who I just realized is one of my favorite actors, possibly because of my Star Wars bias) effectively bring the adventurous storyteller, Edward Bloom, to life. Both actors were just fun to watch in this movie as was Danny DeVito, in a perfectly fitted role as a circus owner/ringmaster, and the beautiful Alison Lohman as the object of Ed Bloom's affection.

However, there were some moments in the movie that did test my patience a little. The movie was a little long, some of the lighting in the scenes was pretty dark, and I realized I preferred watching Ed Bloom's stories acted out rather than just hearing Ed Bloom talk about them. Whenever I have talked to someone like Ed Bloom, who goes off on stories like he did, I'd probably roll my eyes and tune them out. Maybe I won't do that anymore!!

All that aside, though, this is one hell of a movie! It has a lot of heart and imagination, and it actually choked me up a little. It definitely got to me in a very good way. When this comes out on DVD, I will definitely add it to my collection, enjoy it for years to come, and maybe share the magic with others!

My IMDb Rating: 10/10. My Yahoo! Grade: A (Outstanding)",10
3 March 2005,Suddenly I love fish!,"I won't even attempt to describe the plot of this wonderfully imaginative film. Many here have already done a splendid job of that. Suffice it to say that this story about a man's failing relationship with his father and trying to make the last opportunity before he dies to set things right is a magical adventure and a sweet ride. I even love little touches like seeing familiar set pieces from other Tim Burton films (the town from Edward Scissorhands and the egg cracker, for starters.) Granted. Burton can be a tad weird as a person, but no one can deny (although some people with no sense of whimsy or imagination have tried) that he is a genius of a storyteller, and here he does it better than he ever has before. This is Burton's ""Citizen Kane."" All the elements come together like a river flowing into the ocean of one's imagination. This big fish must be caught and let go for the next lucky viewer. And if you see it and don't like it, I would see a doctor about a personality transplant. Metaphors can be incredible things when employed just right. Tim Burton comes up the right bait and reels us all in, and we're glad to be caught off guard by his fantastic film-making prowess. See it and make it your new favorite film of all time.",10
30 April 2004,Rustem And Sorab without the sad Ending...,"The movie is wild yet Oscar-ish... There was an obvious reference to ""Edward Scissorhands"" with the Handi-Matic! It has all of the classic Rustem and Sorab moves with the unusual twist that the father wasn't aware there was any kind of competition with his son.

As for Albert Finney and Ewan MacGregor - fantastic! They could be father and son, and th fact both are from the British Isles playing true homespun Americans was awesome!

Having experienced challenges with my own father, I saw the true echoes of such paternal guerilla warfare - the film was true to life in that there was no real resolution except that the son finally realises he's more similar to his dad than he is truly aware of...

A great picture for a father to watch with his son(s) whether or not they quarrel! Who cares if the tales are tall or not? It sounds a lot better that way, eh? Life's like that until you add the spice...

6 January 2004,Salmon Days,"Somewhere east of Seattle is a small town called Issaquah. Annually in this town they celebrate the return of Salmon. If you can't tell, the word Issaquah has an American Indian history. Native American people have a rich history of storytelling, and I would like to believe that this was one of their stories that got away.

Mr. Burton took the pages from this fairytale and wove a tapestry of adventure, love, patience, suspense and forgiveness. This all-star cast went back to the root of entertainment by telling a story. This was a story about a story in a story. Not since `The Princess Bride' has anyone been able to tell a seamless tale of love, life, and adventure. For fathers, for sons and family's everywhere, this was a tale of big life, big love, and Big Fish!

26 January 2016,"Beautiful, fantasy-like tale","We all have that friend that tells crazy stories that seem larger than life, but there is always an element of truth to their stories (Sometimes, you really can't make this stuff up). Edward Bloom is a masterful storyteller, who has led an extraordinary life. Coming from the small town of Ashton, he felt he served a bigger purpose than Ashton could give him so he set out on a great adventure, meeting a gentle giant, a werewolf ringleader, Siamese twins, and most importantly, the love of his life along the way. Edward Junior, his son, tires of his tall tales and becomes resentful towards his father, refusing to speak to him for 3 years until he gets a phone call from his mother, informing him that Edward Sr. is dying of cancer.

Through the stories Edward Sr. tells his on his death bed, we get a glimpse into his life through a fantasy lens, which, under the direction of Tim Burton, is beautifully done. The characters are larger than life, as they should be. And Ewan MacGregor is absolutely adorable as a young Edward Bloom. This is a story of love, a story of forgiveness and overall, a wonderful story. Nearly brought me to tears by the end. Great watch for Tim Burton and fantasy lovers alike.",8

Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito.

3 March 2004,Awful,"From the imagination of director Tim Burton. Please, make it stop. An adventure as big as life itself. What have we done to deserve this? Ewan McGregor plays a young man, with Albert Finney playing his older self. They compete to see who can do the worst Alabama accent. It's a close thing, but I think Ewan just wins it. Billy Crudup (change your name - it's awful) plays the man's son. For fans of balls-achingly dismal acting, he's something special. Sentimental nonsense from beginning to end, ""Big Fish"" is also ""heartwarming"" and ""magical"". Or, to put it another way, there are two (TWO) funeral scenes at the climax, one of them imaginary, where everyone from the geezer's life turns up to smile inanely, and one real, where everyone from the geezer's life turns up to smile inanely. And how about the ""jerk"" whom Ewan beats at everything (football, basketball, science, love)? There is no evidence that he is a jerk, just that he's not as good at football, basketball, science and love as Ewan. We have to accept Ewan's word that he is a jerk. Me, I was rooting him for him when he was smashing Ewan's face to a pulp. And what the **** is Helena Bonham Carter doing in this? Along with Jessica Lange, HBC provides an oasis of calm, unshowy acting amid the uncontrolled hysteria, in-jokes, cameo appearances and oh-how-wacky zaniness of the rest. If you can stand this slop, then you are welcome to it.",
26 January 2004,Magical,"In many ways, this doesn't even feel like a Tim Burton film. Largely shorn of the dark tones and sinister shadows of Edward Scissorhands, Batman or Sleepy Hollow, it's more like Burton via Cameron Crowe, a comparison further held up by the presence of Billy Crudup. With Ewan McGregor present, however, together with themes of love-against-the-odds and magical realism, the comparison is more with Moulin Rouge! Add all of this together and you've got an enchanting tale. But it's not flawless - for starters, it's really quite slow. (*There follows some plot details, no spoilers*) While, in the present day, we follow Crudup's attempts to get closer to his dying father (Albert Finney), the film simultaneously shows us McGregor as a young Finney, in flashbacks that are almost certainly apocryphal. He becomes a ""big fish"" in his home town, then strikes off on his own, coming to a village called Spectre. It's at this point that the movie becomes a little plodding, but it picks up a bit once he spies the love of his life... In essence, it's a slightly uneven film with wonderful moments - the popcorn, the daffodils, Danny DeVito. And it's a rollercoaster ride through Tim Burton's imagination with giants, witches, mythological beasts, circuses, romance, sky-writing and fish. The cast is outstanding, although the most memorable turns come from supporting players such as Steve Buscemi, in great form. One stand-out aspect is the way it actually gets *better* towards the end. Films never do that, and certainly not fantasy-tinged films like this! So it gains an extra point for a truly wonderful ending.",8
10 July 2021,A movie abounding in life and spirit,"Outside of the context of this movie this probably wouldn't sound that great but ''Oh, man, stories are the most wonderful and most necessary lies that we tell ourselves!'' And I'm once reassured: ''what a dreadful life we'd have without them!'' I've really enjoyed Big Fish and even if I initially disliked the romanticism (knocking at someone's door and making such a confession and she's not scared to death? ...well, giants I can accept but this is a serious stretch) I later realized that the movie was more about the extent to which we choose to transform (and even transcend, one could argue) our life through the craft of storytelling, how stories infer meaning to our otherwise apparently meaningless lives.

The narrative provides a very good example of one might choose to fight nihilism and I think a lot about what Dr. Benett said towards the end: ''And I suppose if I had to choose between the true version and an elaborate one involving a fish and a wedding ring, I might choose the fancy version...but, then that's just me''.

8 December 2003,An Instant Classic,"There is something exhilarating about riding two trains and running 27 blocks down the street to see a movie. Living 8 or so miles outside New York City has its perks for one of my new jobs. Going to press screenings of yet to released blockbusters. It's just to bad I'm at the mercy of the New Jersey Transit rail system. With delayed trains and lots of snow covering the ground of course I had 10 minutes to get from Madison Square Garden to Union Square. No small feat if you ask me.

But as I settled down in my chair at the Regal Union Square, and as I sipped on the sweet nectar of the drink called COKE, a film unfolded. A film so good, it made my mad dash to the theater worth every minute and as I reminisce about the filmed triumph that is BIG FISH, I feel a sense of awe and wonder. Tim Burton has created a film better than EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and a film that is worthy of Oscar.

William Bloom (Billy Crudup, Waking The Dead) is mad at his father Edward Bloom (Albert Finney,Erin Brockovich). You see his dad loves to tell stories about his youth. Except none of them seem true. Stories of Giants named Karl (Matthew McGrory, Bubble Boy), Circus Freaks, wandering poets, Siamese Twins from Red China, bank robberies, a witch, and a really big fish. William longs to meet the real man behind all the stories. But when Edward is stricken with cancer, William comes face to face with the man, both the real one and the legend.

BIG FISH is the kind of movie where a new surprise is hiding around every corner. From babies being spit across the hospital floor to a classic car being submerged underwater. The frame is jammed with visions both colorful and humorous. I especially liked the witch whose one eye could tell you how you would die. What an eerie and yet oddly beautiful old woman she was.

I also loved the tender moment that Edward and his wife Sandy (Jessica Lange, Titus) had in the bathtub. It's a scene full of both raw emotion and sweet reflection. Here's a woman who's watching the man she loves die right in front of her face. Every moment counts, and every word and breath sacred.

Ewan MacGregor (Star Wars: Attack of the Cloans) does a fine job as young Edward the adventurous youth of all his older counterpoint fantastical stories. His performance strikes the right cords at the right moments, allowing the audience to take hold of a man who may be the fabrication or the true version of a man who's telling the story.

Tim Burton's directing is top notch. He's proven that he's a master of the visual image, and BIG FISH is the perfect film to allow people to sit up and take notice. He strikes the right cord between humor and tears, joyous circus's and scary forests. His deft eye even takes us behind enemy lines. In a scene that is both inspired and quirky all at the same time.

BIG FISH is also a film about heritage. What's more important in the scheme of things, how we lived or how people remember us? It's a little of both, and this film puts us right in the middle of it all. Watching a life unfold around us.

BIG FISH is the reason I love going to the movies. Sure sometimes you have to dig through the trash to find a gem and this is a gem of a motion picture. If you see one film at all this year BIG FISH is worth a trip, even a whirlwind 27-block sprint to your local theater.",
13 January 2004,A Love Story Of Multiple Depths.,"I have always been a fan of Tim Burton's films. From ""Batman"" to ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" to ""Edward Scissorhands"" to ""Sleepy Hollow"", his films have been some of the most whimsical and stylish I've seen created. And ""Big Fish"" retains those elements. But this film has so much more of a ""grown up"" feel to it, yet it retains those child-like moments of wonder Burton is known for.

At it's heart, ""Big Fish"" is a love story. It's the story of a man trying to reconcile with and get to know his father. But it's also a story of a man's single love and devotion to his wife. But it's also a love of life. A love of stories. And the belief that nothing is impossible to attain if it's really wanted strongly enough.

Edward Bloom (played by Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney - both excellent) tells the tale of his life's story, a tale that walks the fine line between truth and fiction. Every obstacle and challenge is met with McGregor's grin and the belief that any obstacle can be overcome, often with humorous or surprising results. This is a very light-hearted film, taking even its most serious moments with a grain of charm, sentiment or playfulness. It gets emotional, but never delves into sap. And you can't help but cheer for this likable character who ends up touching so many lives. The world he grew up in may or may not be real, but the devotion and love for his wife and son are truth.

While different in overall tone from his other films, Burton still adds his own trademark touches. Cast usuals like Danny Devito and Helena Bonham Carter add to the diverse cast in this film, and Danny Elfman provides another excellent score. The acting from all the cast members were really well-done, whether they were cameos, or full roles. Burton has always chosen an eclectic cast for his films, and this film is no different. Everyone, even at the most basic level, shines.

There are so many words to describe this film: Funny, touching, eccentric, uplifting, sad, artistic, inspiring.... but this is the type of film that can be walked away from with a sense of satisfaction. Burton attempted something very different for him, and yet managed to retain all of the elements that make his films so appealing. I think this film will force critics to view his films in a new light, as he has once again proven to be a more than capable director. It's a remarkable work of art, utterly charming, and very highly recommended.

One of the best pictures of 2003.",10
17 September 2010,"Beautiful, but imperfect","This movie is absolutely beautiful and full of creative ideas. The visuals are so great, that alone they make it worth it to watch the film. The fantasy parts of the movie are amazing. - I wished that the movie would have only consisted out of them. The reality part has been my big problem. It didn't fit to the fantasy part perfectly. To me it felt, like the movie was trying to ""explain fantasy"". But isn't fantasy fantasy because it can't be explained? - The cheesy ending destroyed every potential the story had left. Yes, the whole plot didn't convince me.

Ewan McGregor and the beautiful visuals still saved the movie. I just hope John August will never again write the screenplay for Tim Burton movies. I absolutely hate how he dismembered Charly and the Chocolate Factory. He did it almost as bad with the Big Fish novel.

27 September 2020,Emotional ending but not much depth,"If you want a fantastical story about someone's life then watch Forrest Gump instead. The moral of the story is that having wonder at your own life is important, even if it means occasionally embellishing the truth. I don't think that's a super important message and they only land it half decently. It did make me reflect on my relationship to my own father though, and genuinely consider wether my parents take comfort in the idea that when they die I'll carry on their legacy.

7 February 2004,Big DISAPPOINTMENT!,"This movie was a huge disappointment. The editor of the trailer should be given an award (or shot) for making this movie appear to be entertaining. I appreciated the story & the relationship between the father & son, but more than once during the movie I just kept thinking of how the movie ""Magnolia"" dealt with the same themes, but in a much superior way. If you liked this movie, and you haven't seen Magnolia, then you should definitely check it out. An All Star cast, great acting, better writing, and all around a better film. I guess the most I can say about Big Fish is that it only succeeded in inspiring me to go & rent Magnolia again. And for that, I am thankful.

21 February 2021,Beautiful In So Many Ways,"Tim Burton is masterful,

A poignant journey done so very well, without the need for hyper exaggeration. No gremlins, no witches, no shock moments - the essence is in the subtleties.

Didn't know what to expect, but was a moved a little more than I'd like to admit. An exquisite story told by an exquisite storyteller.

We can all take something from this story. I think we find ourselves immersed into some aspect of this movie and rekindle happy memories or long for happier memories than we have.

A beautifully told story by one of my favourite storytellers - Tim Burton.

28 January 2004,"Count on Tim Burton to Bring You Something Different, Mystical and Magical","This is a movie that takes a little getting into, but by the end of the movie you'll realize how fabulous and special this movie is to view. Using style all of his own Tim Burton assembles an all-star cast to tell the story of a son, Will Bloom (Bill Crudup), trying to get to know his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney/Ewan McGregor), who is dying of cancer. The ensemble also includes Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter, Robert Guillaume, Steve Buscemi, and Danny DeVito, among many other fine actors and actresses.

Burton mixes fantasy with reality and spins tall tales, based in truth, as recollected by Will Bloom and re-told by Ed Bloom. He uses color, symbolism, music, and pageantry throughout this amazing movie to paint the vivid pictures that only words can fall short in describing. Even with all the unusual and bizarre images used the picture never crosses the line to become truly macabre.

The movie also sends a deeper message. Do not lose sight of what really makes people who they are by getting so caught up in the factual analysis of everything you've ever heard and seen. You might just end up losing sight of what really matters until it's too late for words. This is an original well-done movie everyone should go see.",9
2 April 2007,Glorification!,There's no harm in glorifying everything a little.. This is stressed in the scene where the doctor relates to will bloom the events as they happen at the time of his birth and then tells him people actually like the version that his father( Edward bloom) tells everyone that involves the story surrounding a big fish that invokes in people the interest to listen to the story of the otherwise not so interesting story of the birth of will.. This is the scene where the essence of the story lies.. The whole story is about the trade off between what actually happened in the life of Edward Bloom and what he tells everyone about his life. Everything he relates is the truth but not without a little glorification. Everyone except Edward's son seem to enjoy his stories while Will refrains from talking to his father because of his habit. But finally realizes that his father wasn't lying about anything and therefore starts liking him. The very last scene is the best scene by far in the story where we get to see the actual characters and we can make out the difference between the real life personalities and the ones in Edward's stories. The giant is actually around ten feet but in Edward's stories he is portrayed as a twenty odd feet giant which makes him sound dangerous.. Also the twins are actually not conjoined but in the story he describes them as having only two legs between them. This is by far Tim Burton's best film. The films draws comparisons with Forrest Gump in more ways than one. Both the stories are the biographies of diverse personalities. But one of it is glorified and the other is true both great in their own respects. Either watch the movie for its brilliance in creativity or watch it simply for the brilliant portrayal of the role by Ewan McGregor or watch it for its brilliant background score. If that is not reason enough to watch the movie you are missing out on something in life. This is a must-see movie is all i can tell. Enjoy!,9

10 May 2004,"A Wonderful Story, A Captivating Film","In short, one of the best films I have ever seen. The story is funny, but not comic and very touching, but not sad. It caught me from the beginning and held me, captivated, through the end. The distinctions between reality and fantasy are clearly defined and beautifully intertwined. I should think that all who see this film, with the exception of the young perhaps, can relate to some our all of the emotional aspects behind the story. In fact, the film has made me anxious to read the novel. Having not read the novel I can only comment on the story itself and hope that the screenplay represents as much depth as I anticipate that the novel will. The cinematography is stunning and at times breathtakingly beautiful. The acting is superb, especially from Finney and McGregor who complete the main character both precisely and with supreme conviction. The entire cast simply fit in to the story, made it real and brought it to life. The direction? Well it is Tim Burton after all and that is what really drew me to see the film in the first place. So being a fan I can't say that my opinion would be completely objective but I believe this to be perhaps his best work to date, in the commercial realm at least. Well done once again, Mr. Burton! This film, much as the life of the main character, will live on for a long time. I certainly will carry this story with me, like a few of the more flamboyant and colorful people in my life, in my heart until I can't remember anything anymore.",10
1 August 2004,A good yarn,"There are only a few directors who could make a movie like ""Big Fish"" and make it work. Fortunately, Tim Burton is one of them. With his penchant for the beautifully grotesque and the grotesquely beautiful, Burton is able to fill the screen with captivating images, while at the same time understanding that there must be something solid beneath all the style.

The film's central character is Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor as the young incarnation, Albert Finney as the elder). An expert storyteller, Edward is forever spinning tall tales with himself and his associates as the central characters. Many people, like his wife Sandra (Alison Lohman-young, Jessica Lange-old), indulge his eccentricity, but it rubs his son Will (Billy Crudup) the wrong way. He's heard all these stories a hundred times; why can't his dad tell it like it is for once? After years of estrangement, Edward's illness provokes Will to come home and make one last bid to understand a man who's deliberately woven a series of exaggerations, dreams, and half-truths around his life.

The movie is best when we enter the world of Edward's stories, a place of magical realism where the rules of reality are are bent, but not beyond all recognition. Colors are brighter, time literally slows to a halt and speeds up alarmingly, and giants, witches, Siamese twins, and other strange sights cross the screen. At the center of all this, McGregor is an ideal protagonist--a cross between the way Edward was and the way he'd always wanted to be. Burton handles all of this with skill and sensitivity. He understands, as Will does not, that the stories present a more complete picture of Edward than mere facts ever could. They reveal his memories, perceptions, dreams, and outlook on life. When Edward courts Sandra by filling fields with flowers and writing her name across the sky, we know that we're not seeing what happened, but what would have happened if the prosaic rules of reality had allowed Edward to express the full extent of his feelings.

So charming is Edward's altered truth that it's a bit jarring when we come back to the real world, where the movie slows (mostly as it's driven by Crudup in the role of the requisite wet blanket). But the ending is excellent, weaving together fantasy and reality in a way that's touching and satisfying.",

26 January 2004,"Oversentimentality is the only flaw, albeit a minor one.","I say this as a warning to anyone who tends to avoid films that blatantly and shamelessly pull at one's heartstrings. But this film does it in such a creative way, and only in parts, that it would be a shame to miss out on seeing such a whimsical romp. Actually there is one other flaw: You don't put Jessica Lange in a movie and then underuse her! Shame on you, Tim Burton! (If in all her scenes, Lange leaves you wanting more, you MUST check out the HBO bittersweet drama, NORMAL.)

That being said, allow me to rave about Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor. They are just as successful at playing the same character at different ages as Judi Dench and Kate Winslet in the wonderful IRIS. Finney has lost none of the charm that made him an international star FORTY years earlier in TOM JONES, and McGregor, well, he's the ONLY major actor of my generation whose presence alone is reason enough for me to see a film, and I mean ONLY. He does not disappoint. Billy Crudup tones down his normally sexy persona and plays a stuffed shirt adequately. Marion Cotillard as his wife is lovely, could've used a little more of her. And Helena Bonham Carter? Don't get me started on how great she is in her supporting performance, hopefully this film will get her noticed and back into the leading roles she deserves to play. Matthew McGory and the up-and-coming comic actor Missi Pyle round out an incredible ensemble cast.

Burton takes all of the actors' strengths and puts them in visually splendid settings, creating a fantasy world that works perfectly for the narrative he sets up. This is one of those films like E.T. that you just have to go with, and the journey the audience makes with Crudup's character is definitely worth taking. I was worried this was going to be Schmaltz City, but with Burton at the helm it steers clear of that 85% of the time. If you don't mind that other 15% this film is for you, and it's a great film for families as well.",9
7 May 2004,A tall tale told too tall,"Tim Burton's Big Fish, is basically a tall tale told by teller of tall tales. The segments of fiction were brilliant, but a movie which blends reality with outright fiction needs to keep the reality real. Otherwise the audience get lost.

So . . . Paris to the US flights happen during the daylight hours, and despite the best intentions of Mr. Burton, Alabama in the 30's 40's and 50's was segregated. Even in the fictional story that fact needs to be either addressed or explained lest the viewer start to wonder what is wrong.

The fact that Helen Bonham Carter played two characters was explained even when it wasn't purely necessary-there is no way that a listener would confuse the little girl grown up with the witch. We do of course, because we have seen both characters, but Billy Crudup's Will Bloom wouldn't realize that there was a problem he has never seen the witch.

All of this is too bad, for otherwise it is good story well told and the acting is fine all around. Ms. Lange looks too young to be the elder Bloom's wife of contemporary years, but who will begrudge her that?",7
5 January 2018,Boring.....,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

20 February 2004,Uncatchable Fish.,"Giants, werewolves, witches, and some rather big fish.

Half of this movie is about a grown man brought up by a storytelling father who seems to be obsessed with the fairy tales he creates. Now, with the father on his deathbed, his son feels as though he doesn't know him at all and so attempts to bridge the emotional gap while recalling the fairy tales that his father told. And this brings us to the other half -- the fictional fairytale stories of the young Edward Bloom, who is everything from a soldier in Vietnam to a human cannonball to a bankrobber to a wealthy landowner ... he faces all kinds of fantastic creatures and people throughout his life, and befriends all of them.

The Father/Son relationship is easily one of the most over-explored in Hollywood, and more often than not signals schmaltzy background music, tender moments and a lot of heartfelt talk about baseball. Bleurgh. However, ""Big Fish"" actually manages to try something different with a tired old formula and actually pull it off superbly well. This movie is actually a lot like ""Forrest Gump"", what with the accents and the comedic, fantasy retelling of a person's life -- certainly not a project you'd associate with the Master of Darkness, Tim Burton.

Contrary to what some might say, Tim Burton just doesn't make bad movies. He makes great ones, and decent ones -- usually one after the other in sequence. As his previous movie was the heavily-flawed and ill-conceived ""Planet of the Apes"" remake, this one was due to be a great one anyway. It doesn't necessary feel like a Tim Burton movie the whole way through... sure, you've got those weird trees, some slanted houses and plenty of surreal, Gothic darkness here and there, but much of it could just as well have been a Spielberg project, particularly in the Father/Son sequences. The main difference, though, is that Burton doesn't pile on the Schmaltz as another director would. Even the inevitable death sequence is both abrupt and tasteful, and no longer than it needs to be.

This is another entertaining and heartfelt film from Tim Burton, at least of the quality we expect from this great director. Everyone should see this movie.",9
26 April 2019,Candidate for worst movie of all time.,"How did this get made? It's a complete and utter mess of hollow characters and bad story telling barely put together. Each viginette in it's own right is totally unwatchable but together they create one of the most worthless stories of all time.

18 January 2004,"Big fish grabs you: Hook, line and sinker.","It's the life of a salesman wrapped in a fairy tale that absolutely delights. The premise: If you knew how you were going to die . . . what you'd be doing, where you'd be, who you'd be with at the moment of passing  how would you live? Would you shun that situation like the plague; be the bravest guy in town in all other things? Big Fish earned an 8 / 10 from me for taking me down that road.

This salesman (Finney) is a salesman / storyteller distanced from his son ostensibly for telling tall tales and stepping on the kid's moments growing up. So what did that salesman see in that witch's eye when he was a kid anyway?

Listen, who hasn't dressed the facts to dress an otherwise boring story? This is a film about perspective  perspective in life. If 3 people are in a 7-11 hold-up, the police will hear multiple versions of `what happened' sure as shootin'. Your eyes - my eyes (your mind vs. mine) see events uniquely based on the sum of our personal experiences. Positive, negative, surrealistic spins come into play. The raconteur's art is his voice, passion; the details told vs. intrigue born by those withheld  it all counts. Stories retold consistently become myth; myth : legend. If you believe the legend, you're psychotic or blessed, depending on your audience's perspective. Big Fish teaches you how to do it right.

On that `10"" scale, more than one `5' and `6' moments come along. A stingier editor would have decorated the floor with many more frames. But those cuts would have been a mistake. Its ending works (ranking a `20' on that 10 scale) because the story meanders. Big fish had me hook, line and sinker.",
12 January 2004,Burton's best,"I have seen several Tim Burton films (Batman, Edward Scissorhands, A Nightmare before Christmas). I must admit that my opinion of him was primarily shaped by the look and feel of Batman, which I found far too dark and, above all, cluttered. I was thus delighted by Big Fish, which I found light, airy and sunny by comparison.

The two people I saw the film with were less than enthused. Both felt that running time was too long at almost two and a half hours. One thought the film's flights of fancy were a little too fanciful for his tastes. But I felt the length (and pace) were exactly right for the story Big Fish has to tell, and ditto for its fancifulness. If you're going to tell a tale, as Edward Bloom (Albert Finney/Ewan MacGregor) does, you might as well make it as tall as Paul Bunyan and as big as Babe the blue ox. If Edward Bloom's tales were shorter and more down to earth, they would be nothing more than a traveling salesman's jokes -- and his character would correspondingly be reduced in size and stature to that of a mere mortal, not a man among men.

The casting of the film is phenomenal -- by this, I mean the physical resemblance between the actors and actresses who play Edward Bloom (Albert Finney/Ewan MacGregor) and his wife Sandra Templeton (Jessica Lange/Alison Loman). Finney is endlessly fascinating as the raconteur and should be remembered at Oscar time. MacGregor is charming as always as the younger Bloom. Jessica Lange says remarkably little, but conveys in nonverbal ways Sandra's loving indulgence of her husband's big fish stories.

I defy anyone to see this film and leave the theatre dry-eyed. The final sequences certainly left me with a tear in my eye and a lump in my throat. And that is because the film made me care about its hero as a real human being, however unreal his version of himself may be. More than that -- the film taught me a valuable lesson for my own life, one I was much in need of being taught again: that we must accept people on their own terms, for who they are and aspire to be -- not who we would like them to be. And how often can you say of a Hollywood film that it has had an impact on your life?",
21 March 2006,A World Of Fantasy,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home.

2 March 2009,An Adventure Of A Life Time,"Big Fish certainly remains as one of the greatest adventure movies ever told. Tim Burton again directs a inferring classic as we separate fact from fiction, father from son, mystery to myth - Big Fish hails us on an adventure as big as life itself. It's a real feel good movie in some cases, but you also witness a very powerful, emotional and grueling tough side. Big Fish redefines the genre ""Adventure"" which in some cases was nearly dead a couple of years back. It sort of reminds me of Forrest Gump, they're certain similarities found in this movie, so Forrest Gump fans, give it a watch! There is excellent acting, good use of effects and a overall classic movie for the whole family to enjoy.

29 July 2005,Tim Burton creates another masterpiece,"'Big Fish' is a lush and beautiful fantasy from director Tim Burton, and it's one of his best films. Granted, I'm predisposed to like a Tim Burton movie (heck, I even liked 'Planet of the Apes'), but you can't deny that this is a great film.

Edward Bloom (Albert Finney as an old man, Ewan McGregor as a young man) is at the end of his life. His son, Will, is tired of hearing the tall tales his father has told so many times over the years, and now Will wants ""the truth"". But, as Will learns, sometimes fantasy is more interesting than reality.

The acting is really wonderful in this movie. Albert Finney is, of course, a blowhard, but he's so full of life you just can't help but like him. Ewan McGregor slips into a Southern accent and gives a better performance than in any of the 'Star Wars' prequels. Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange both play Sandra, Edward's loving wife who understands that, yes, he is a storyteller, but she still loves him. And how about the supporting actors? You've got Danny DeVito as a circus ringleader with a secret, Steve Buscemi as a poet who robs a bankrupt bank, and Matthew McGrory as the gentle giant Karl.

The movie delights in it's odd characters and situations, and Tim Burton clearly loves the fantastic. The story is unexpectedly heartwarming, and I didn't think Burton could make something this benign (not a bad quality, you understand). All of this adds up to the genuinely moving conclusion, which nearly had me in tears. 'Big Fish' is a terrific film.",10
9 January 2004,The Moose Hole - Review of Big Fish,"`There are some fish that can't be caught. It's not that they're bigger or faster then the other fish, they're just touched by something extra.'

Does Columbia enjoy sitting on their butts while the other studios gather Oscar praise? They started 2003 off not so promisingly with Darkness Falls and Tears of the Sun while limping through the summer with sub par hits like Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle and Bad Boys II. Is it that they have no more ambition left in them to put forth the effort? Was it the tremendous embarrassment of Gigli that is the true cause for their lack of marketing strength? If so then that is too bad. No, not because of real Oscar hope for Mona Lisa Smile (Julia Roberts doesn't need another Oscar statue) or Something's Gotta Give is gone but the fact that the studio may have had a real chance with Tim Burton's big screen adaptation of a not so well known tale, Big Fish. It may seem ordinary on the surface, the usual father/son emotionally driven story, but it is the whimsy and the magic that sets this one apart from the rest. Burton, who has had a real success for quite some time, is drawing doubt if he can bring a heart-felt tale to the screen with his track-record of weird projects but the way Columbia is looking for Oscar night at this point, it could hurt to find out.

Big Fish is based on the novel of the same name by Daniel Wallace and it discusses a son's journey to discover who he father really was after years of hearing nothing but tall-tales. Edward Bloom was too big for the small town he grew up in. That was due to his high ambition, or so that is the way he tells it. William Bloom never really knew his father. Edward was either off on business trips or telling the same elaborate fantasies that his son had heard his entire life, more then once or twice. After a couple years of broken communication between them, William returns home after his mother informs him that his father is slowing dying and may pass away soon. The son returns home for one last chance to discover the man his father really was. Going through all the magical and extraordinary adventures once again, William discovers that the truth of his father was there all along, he just needed to know where to look. The story for Big Fish takes several different and elaborate stories, some that work and some that don't, and brings them together in an enjoyable heart warming feature. At times, Fish's plot seems too high for its own good and the huge elaboration of simple stories seem way over done for many to take seriously within the context of what the filmmakers are trying to get across. This leads for some scenes within the film to not come off as effectively as others. Luckily this doesn't happen too often with the course of the film.

The cast consists of only two main leads (three if you count two people for the same role in different time periods) but the supporting roles provided by various talented actors and actresses are nearly as entertaining. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney share the role of Edward Bloom in various part of his life, the latter actor portraying the character as a dying old man. Finney's performance is nothing short of spectacular as Edward Bloom deteriorates as the feature moves on and as he struggles to get his son to understand the meaning behind his tall-tales. The last scene involving Finney will have anyone reaching for a tissue. That is a guarantee. McGregor provides that personal charm and spunk that makes the fantasies involving the younger Edward all the more memorable and captivating. Billy Crudup, who portrays William Bloom, seems okay but there is nothing in his performance that really stands out or equals that of Finney's performance along side him. Danny DeVito gives a delightful performance as Amos, the circus ring-leader who eventually hires Bloom to work on his show. Despite this charming performance, be warned! Unless you want horrible images of Mr. DeVito's rear end embedded in your mind, best to keep your eyes shut during a certain portion of the film. Nothing extraordinarily long but long enough. And Steve Buscemi's performance as a less then talented inspiring poet is one of the bigger highlights based on background characters.

Overall, Big Fish manages to swim above its own high-watered ambition despite a flop or two too close to shore. Going into this film, one has to understand this: almost everything in the individual tales is a metaphor for something else. The conjoined Japanese twins, for example, aren't actually conjoined in real life but they are so connected to each other, despite their own personal differences, that it seems that way. Many of exaggerations within the film are marvelously well played out but there are moments where you'll be questioning what the filmmakers are trying to do. The most prominent moment(s) involves the naked woman in the river that the young Edward Bloom sees outside his car that has been submerged by a great rainstorm. Of all the other fantasy sequences, this is the one that made the least amount of sense and probably wasn't necessary. Even with a pretty well balanced two hour time length, Big Fish fluxes between consistency and incoherence with some tales struggling to keep the pace more then others. Outside of those issues, Fish is a wonderful surprise from the man who has brought us dark classics such as Batman and Beetlejuice. It manages to be funny and heartwarming without losing its message in its own sea of ambition.

My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B+)",8
27 February 2005,excellent fairy tale that makes you think,"I knew this film was brilliant just from the trailer. OK, so I'm an Ewan McGregor huge fan, but had the lead actor been someone else, I'd still love this film nonetheless.

I've watched this several times and it made me choke with tears every time towards the end of the film. I don't cry over films, but this one made me have to sink down my seat and swallow my tears. Apart from touching, another strong point is how the visuals are much like those of a fairy tale. Edward Bloom's world looks surreal but warmly believable. You'd want to believe his world. You'd wish your world is like that. You'd fall in love with Edward Bloom.

His relationship with his wife is very romantic as well. It's far from the usual shallow Hollywood-romance-type of love. Their love is very dreamy and daring, but is that not how love is? Their romance might be one of the greatest on-screen romances of all time, although it's not the main plot of the story.

And, this film makes the audience contemplate of whether or not they have lived their lives to the fullest, like Bloom has.",10
15 November 2004,Big Liar,"While it's visually stunning and exceptionally filmed, this piece is a little sappy for my tastes although it certainly shows some promise. Being a fan of Burton's previous work, I figured this was worth a look, and while I did enjoy most of the film, especially the visuals and scenery....I had problems with it's sentimentality and the basic underlying story which consists of a pathological liar promoted to a hero. Sure, not all of the stories were complete lies, and I realize that, but I feel the movie was asking me for more than I could give it to succeed.

The appearance of the film and characters within it are truly great to watch, particularly Helena Bonham Carter's witch character. The environments and landscapes are filmed with precision and masterful technique. The overall cast is great, although MacGregor has trouble with his Southern accent. The stories are rather boring but all have a whimsical feel to them, which makes them just bearable. However, it really ruins itself with the vomit inducing ending. If you liked Steel Magnolias, you should love this. I felt dirty. Average at best.",7
10 November 2005,A lovable fairy-tale,"I had no expectations before watching this movie, but it impressed me in every way. A really nice feel-good movie.

Big Fish tells the story about a son who's been told all kinds of fancy stories by his father, but as he grew older he started not believing the stories anymore. When he returns home after three years his father is dying and he realize he never knew the truth about him, just the stories. He starts a search to find out as much about his father as possible before it's too late.

This is a very well written story. The story it self is incredible, original and interesting and John August has made a pretty nice script from it. It has a very good drive in it and it's always moving forward. It's not about reaching the goal, but the journey to get there. It's a nice mix of the present and the father's stories, reality and fiction. The characters are interesting. Ed Bloom is a very special character witch you get to know at the same time his son get's to know him. The son is also a interesting as he is changing throughout the movie. The rest of the characters are great support for these two leads.

Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney does good jobs as Ed Bloom. McGregor portrays the young, a bit cartoonish, adventurer very well and Finney brings out this experienced, old, a little mysterious old storyteller very good. Billy Crudup is good as Will Bloom. He manage to portray his character a little more serious than the father and manage to follow his character as he develops. As for the rest of the cast they're good and does a great job in supporting the two leads.

The cinematography is good. The lightning is nice and so are the colors. The different moods and look of the stories and the present is well captured. In addition, the design of the sets and costumes are also responsible for making this a really good looking movie.

The effects are kind of cool. They're good, could maybe have been done a little bit better, but you accept it as there are no focus on them and the rest of the action is so surreal. They don't stand out compared to the rest of the movie and don't go against the current look. The story is strong and the story makes the effects, the effects don't make the story, they only build up around and support the story. They don't over do it, It's just as much that it's cool. All in all, good effects work.

This movie has changes in mood and theme as the stories are a little fairytale looking and the story got both joy and sadness. The score manage to bring out the mood and the feeling of the stories and the reality in a good way.

Big Fish is really one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in a long time. You get caught up with the story as it's touching, charming, surreal, mythical, funny and a bit sad. All mixed together to a nice juicy mix. This is a movie I recommend!",10
9 February 2004,"OK, kind of forgettable","Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home.

Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

3 April 2006,an epic achievement in mediocre film-making,"Anyone who has followed Tim Burton's career should be able to see this movie as what it is: the half-assed product of a director well past his prime attempting to recreate and collect pieces of his former films (most notably Edward Scissorhands and Pee-Wee). Throwing shallow rehashes of previous cinematic glories at a strip of celluloid is no way to make a film, but it is a good way to trick a lot of people into thinking they're seeing something of substance (or, dare i say, ""genius""). The lack of cohesion is only surpassed by the awkward acting of the father and son leads.

What's most offensive about this film is the heart and sincerity that it tries so hard to put across to the audience through the story, when none of those passions seemed to be present in the people who actually made this epic piece of mediocrity. Tim Burton long ago forgot how to make a good film. His projects of the past ten or fifteen years have felt more and more like the products of a detached assembly line. it's sad that this former, unique visionary in mainstream cinema finally allowed his art to be wholly corrupted by Hollywood and settled on making filmic equivalents to Disney World rides.",3
1 July 2004,'Tis Like a Fine Irish Tale,"If you're Irish, you realize that the story is the key. If you're not Irish, we'll pray for you. 'Tis said that the Irish never allow the truth to get in the way of a good story. A very logical and pragmatic son has struggled with a great story teller of a dad and doesn't know fact from fiction about his father. He comes home as his father nears the end of his life and begins to investigate to try to separate the truth from the fiction in his father's tales. Tim Burton directs a wonderfully suited cast in telling this tale. As the story unfolds, the son discovers that his father isn't as crazy as he has thought and discovers a message about life that his father had been trying to pass to him. Fortunately for the son, he finds the message his father wants him to find and thus inherits a wonderful legacy of enlivening the dullness of routine existence with the wonder of fine story telling. Perhaps, for the more rational mind, the father had failed in his quest to share who he was and denied his son many years of closeness. I can certainly see that point of view. But, as a story teller myself, this movie will become one of the shining stars of my collection and I will share it with my grandchildren in the hope of widening their visions of life and their abilities to see beyond the obvious and the mundane. What a boring world it would be without great story tellers. The imagination is a wonderful thing that allows us to probe beneath the obvious. This is a wonderful film. I highly recommend it.",
22 January 2004,I have not been affected this much by a movie in a long time,"I think any guy who has unresolved father issues is going to be affected by this movie. Normally, when we go see a movie like this, I grab some extra napkins because my VSO will get puddle-eyed. She did, but I wound up crying like a baby at the ending and using up all the napkins.

This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Ewan McGregor has really developed into a fine actor and performances like this will insure that he does not get typecast as Obi-Wan Kenobi. And I had never seen Matthew McGrory in a movie before. He is a good actor; you really get into his character as the giant.

Go see this movie, several times. I'll be the guy in the 10th row sniffling and sobbing.

7 June 2005,Tim Burton's Best Yet,"If there's one reason to see Big Fish it's because it's like nothing you've ever seen before. I love the work of Tim Burton and that's what mostly drew me to this movie. I honestly don't know where to begin with this review, there is just so much to say about the story and the dilemmas between the father(Edward) and the son(Albert). The movie mostly fixates itself around the stories Edward has told to his son. It begins where Edward tells the story of the day Albert is born, and how his Edward caught an uncatchable fish. During this it goes through a montage of years passing and eventually ends up where Edward is telling the story at his son's wedding and Albert not liking it. Believing that his father has lied to him throughout all the years Albert and Edward go their separate ways for a few years before Albert gets a call from his mom finding out that his father is on his deathbed. Albert decides he has to go see his dad before time runs out and find out the truth behind all the tall tales. The movie really is a very heart warming story and by the end I was choking up. The ending is really good, it's something you'll never see coming. I can see why it was nominated for 4 Golden Globe Awards and got an Academy Award Nominee for Best Original Score. The acting in this movie is outrageous. They couldn't have picked a better cast. The adventure int his movie is out of this world, and I'm not exaggerating on that. The adventure is very big indeed. Out of all the movies Tim Burton has done, Big Fish shines in his collection.",10
6 February 2008,"Great, great, great dream movie ...","These days i'm watching Tim Burton's movies i watched the 2 batmans, Edward scissorhands and ed wood and i was a little disappointed by them, because i had higher expectations.After seeing those movies i said to myself that Tim Burton is perhaps one of the most overrated directors of our time.Then i wanted to support this statement with seeing Big Fish but ... my plans failed, i was watching the movie and i didn't believe my eyes, it was so capturing, so magical, so wonderful, so ...

everything, the story is absolutely amazing, it's so fanciful and at the same time so real, great characters, great music, great camera, great acting, the film is also so touching and emotional because it deals with us, humans, our life, the adventures we have, the stories we tell, and what is left behind, when we're gone ... 10/10

21 May 2007,Simply Wonderful!!!,"Every once in a good while, the impact of a particular entertainment format is wholly contingent upon the emotional tapestry the viewer/listener brings to it.

This is a classic example.

In one of the most un-Burtoneque projects to come from Tim Burton, ""Big Fish"" is a mesmerizing fairy tale wonderfully reminiscent of the underrated ""Edward Scissorhands"" more than a decade ago. Depending upon where you are emotionally, this can be not only a satisfying viewing experience but an equally thought-provoking one that, chances are, will leave an indelible impression.

This time around Tim Burton abandons his usually dark fare for the southern tall tale. He brilliantly brings to realization this regional cultural phenomenon with aplomb and moreover, with no condescension whatsoever for a very important art form. As a southerner, I was quite pleased with the respect granted to an age-old southern tradition that shows us the consequences of not being able to see the forest for the trees.

In a nutshell, the story follows a son's last attempts to discover who his father really is as the son insists that during his upbringing, his father has hidden his true self behind his tall tales. The son and the father have their final confrontation on the father's deathbed and it is here the son finally realizes the time he has wasted because of his ""inability to see for looking."" Albert Finney is simply captivating. I have never seen him in a southern role and he was just wonderful as were the supporting cast. While the brooding son, Billy Crudup, was most effective, this was indeed Finney's moment and proved to be a fitting vehicle for his remarkable talents. Ewan McGregor personifies charm as the young Edward Bloom.

This is a wonderful dissertation on the intricate, intimate, and often complex father-son relationship. It is also a wonderful movie for families to share together.

Visually, Burton put his stamp on it as he helped to realize Edward Bloom's (Finney) tall tales as the special effects were dazzling and wonderful in helping the audience to see very well the kind of man Edward Bloom was. While the end of the movie was somewhat melancholy, it was right on target and did not descend into maudlin sentimentality - it proved to be the natural order of events.

I highly recommend this as you will enjoy viewing this one over and over again. I have never been more pleased with a DVD purchase than I have with this one and suspect already as I write this review that it is steadily becoming one of my all time favorites, not only for its entertainment value but more so because of the valuable insight it provided into my own situation.",9
13 August 2010,Tim Burton's Finest Work,"Tim Burton is a great talent. To say that ""Big Fish"" is his best work till date would be making a big statement, but that's the truth. Forget his Johnny Depp's featured fantasy stories; ""Big Fish"" is the ultimate work of Tim Burton. Starting from the story to casting to editing to score, it's all a genius at work.

Cast wise, PERFECT. Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, Billy Crudup, Marion Cotillard etc. were just perfect. Albert Finney's performance is bound to bring tears in your eyes. Ewan McGregor was the core of the film and his talent is capitalized so well by Tim Burton that one feels whether he had an insight telling him to cast McGregor instead of usual Johnny Depp in the movie.

The screenplay top-notch, the editing flawless, the acting first-rate, the direction at its best; ""Big Fish"" is a delight to watch. The final 20 minutes of this movie is so powerful that it will warm the heart of even the meanest Scrooge. The climax where Albert Finney is led by Billy Crudup to the river surrounded by all the movie's characters is one of the best of all time.

Overall, ""Big Fish"" is a memorable film. It's a treasure film to be kept in collection and memory forever.

My Verdict: 10/10",10
27 September 2013,Autobiography of a B.S. artist,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

22 June 2004,"Most directors will tell you stories straight through. It won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.","Think about all the directors in Hollywood. How many truly unique talents are there? Not many, I'd say. And how many directors actually have a recognizable style? Even fewer. Steven Spielberg, Quentin Tarantino, the Coen Brothers, the ZAZ team... Those are the names that come to my mind. But there's one person who rises above all the others, and that man is Tim Burton.

I have been a fan of Tim Burton's work for a long time. I've seen all of his full-length movies expect ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" and the only one that doesn't really feel like a Burton flick is the watchable-yet-disappointing ""The Planet Of The Apes"". It was okay for a summer blockbuster, but it lacked that special Burton magic. All the other movies of his are as Burtonesque as they could possibly be. I even like ""Mars Attacks!"" a lot which is a movie Burton fans either seem to love or hate. It's hard to name my favorite of Burton's productions, they are all quite different in spite of having the magical Burton touch. In Tim's movies fantasy meets reality and the results are like fairy tales with dark undertones. ""Ed Wood"" is Tim's most realistic film to date, but it also manages to be more than just a typical biography movie. It might have been shot black-and-white, but it's definitely one of, if not the most, colorful story about a life of a person who actually existed.

When I first read about ""Big Fish"" I was a little skeptical because I thought it would be a typical family drama. But thank God it was Tim Burton who was directing it. All my doubts disappeared when I saw the trailer for the film. Having seen the film itself I'd say that the trailer is actually one of the best I've ever seen.

It's really refreshing to see a movie which is sad, funny, touching and heart-warming at the same time. I don't think the film ever turns into a tear-jerker as the ""realistic"" parts of the film are very life-like. And in the hands of a bland director the ""fantasy"" parts could've become a real mess. But with Burton at the helm, we are treated to his greatest hits. We get weird and captivating characters (witches, Siamese twins, also a werewolf...), stunning images and colors, Danny Elfman's gorgeous score, the exactly right amount of humor and those wild stories. The stories Ed Bloom tells might not be 100% true, but they sure are entertaining!

And the cast... Tim Burton once again got a great team to work with. The main players are Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor who are both outstanding and worth at least a few awards. Smaller roles are played by Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito and Helena Bonham-Carter. Their roles might be small, but they all contribute something special to the story. Many people have complained about Jessica Lange being wasted in such a small role. I don't think she was wasted at all. The most beautiful scene of the film has Sandra Bloom getting into a bathtub fully-clothed with her dying husband and only a few words are spoken during this scene. More dialog is not needed as the two highly talented actors show what they are capable of.

""Big Fish"" is a movie that will definitely become a Burton classic. It would have deserved bigger box office grosses, but as one reviewer put it, the movie will more likely become more popular on small screen and gain more and more popularity over the years. It's a bit sad that people spend so much money on totally forgettable ""entertainment"" and let true jewels like ""Big Fish"" pass by. On the other hand, those brainless productions will be forgotten in a blink of an eye while the gems will live on. Just like Edward Bloom's stories in the movie.

Full points. It's a classic.",10
18 August 2004,Brilliant,"This is by far Burton's best. While there are dozens of self confessed chick-flicks' (I did not invent the term), this is definitely a film guys will relate to at a deep level. The whole movie struck a cord with me and certainly the end made me declare that there was something in the air irritating my eyes. Seriously, if father-son relationships tug at you, you MUST see this movie. I thought about this movie for quite some time afterwards. I have not done a power calculation to see if this is statistically significant or not, but almost every guy I asked loved it and almost every woman thought it was dumb. I think if you go into this thinking/hoping it will be a fantasy film you might be bothered by the weighty elements (which are really the core of the movie supporting the more fantastic elements of the film). 9 out of 10

31 December 2003,Highly Entertaining But Drawn Out,"A delightful film, full of flight and fantasy, with a collection of memorable screen characters and tall tales. My only criticism is that there were scenes that went on too long, which distracted from the flow of events. But nonetheless a film well worth watching. And the ending of the film ties all the loose ends together quite well.

10 July 2011,A Heartfelt Modern Day Fairy-Tale,"Big Fish is the story of a storyteller, Edward Bloom, who loves to exaggerate otherwise simple stories of his life. This causes his son, Will, to feel distant from his father because he thinks his father hasn't told him a single fact in his whole life. Their relationship is strained, but that doesn't stop Edward from relating his life experiences to Will's wife and others who will listen. He tells such stories as meeting a witch, befriending a giant, working at the circus, being part of a war, and meeting the love of his life. All these stories are greatly exaggerated but the fiction is sometimes more interesting then the fact. Next to Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish is probably the most emotional film done by Tim Burton and it's not like most of his other films. The real world is mostly just plain and not really exciting to look at, while Edward's stories take place in exciting and beautiful scenarios. This film is very different from Burton's usual work and is a joy to watch through and through.

20 September 2019,Fiction is the truth inside the lie.,"Life is boring, we all know that it's is the very reason most flock to the realm of fiction, why stories exist. To escape, to break through the boredom, and find the realm of journey underneath. This is an old statement, all know it by now. What is perhaps less known is that the stories often tell truths? They exaggerate, sure, but they give the feeling of life, brought up more, enhanced, to make entertaining.

This whole movie bases itself around not that idea alone. It makes a lesson from it. Stating within that if you listen to these stories you'll realize the truth in them, what they meant to the subject, how they have a power that can last forever, based on that truth.

It says about how feelings are misplaced, Repackaged, told out of order to serve these means. What is a myth, what is the fact? What is a metaphor, are these all literal? These stories, can they help to understand in depth what mundane reality can't touch. Throughout the story of Mcgergors character, we see that yes indeed it does, and can last forever. Movies like this are teaching good morals, executing them well, and getting to that sentimental side, and reminding of the realness within, that makes a great juxtaposition and a brilliant movie.",10
16 January 2004,A Bit Too Tall of a Tale,"""Big Fish"" as directed by Tim Burton pays lavish attention to detail, and that alone makes for this to be an enjoyable and entertaining film viewing experience. The renderings of the fantastic tales of the elder Mr. Bloom are very visually rewarding and interesting, and the plot-line of the son's reconciliation with the dying father (and all of those tall tales) is a reasonable enough framework on which to have constructed the movie. In all that detail and elaborate storytelling, however, some elaborate threads are left dangling, some storylines seem to have been changed mid-movie and some, briefly alluded to, and left sadly unexplored. These deficiencies do not prevent the film from being sentimental fun, creatively satisfying and well worth seeing, but nonetheless hold it short of attaining the distinction of a ""great"" movie. There is enough symbolism and allusions to previous movies (his own and others)to keep film students and movie buffs busy analyzing and debating for years, but maybe Mr. Burton should have kept his eye more on the actual telling of the storyteller's story, rather than on constructing some of the perhaps too clever asides. I hate to say it, but there's just something fishy about that.",8

7 April 2004,Tim Burton finally comes of age. Perfect!,"So many times before I've been in the situation, where you're sitting in the cinema, three-quarters of the way through a film you think could be a masterpiece, and hoping deep down the filmmakers don't screw it up in the final reel, only to be hugely disappointed when they do.

Not Big Fish. Not by Tim Burton. Not this time.

This time he's delivered a perfect, timeless, inspirational piece of multi-layered celluloid, full of whimsy, comedy, fantasy, pathos and humanity, that for two hours I had this huge grin on my face and for the final five minutes I cried my eyes out (only the 4th film out of thousands seen to have this effect on me).

Hats off to the entire ensemble cast too for memorable performances, particularly Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor.

Forget Burton's many previous juvenile efforts, this is a mature piece of filmmaking to be enjoyed by audiences of most ages, but especially by anyone who's lived life a bit. Outstanding. 10/10",10
13 April 2009,Tripe,"A bunch of talented people get together and make a putrid film and they title it Big Fish. Everything about the script is ghastly and it is put on the screen with great skill and professionalism. Full of thudding metaphors and, heaven help us, symbols, that might seem profound to high-schoolers but are simply cloying if one is over the age of consent. Very poor casting of Finney (who looks pretty well-fed for a man dying of cancer) and McGregor who tries way too hard to be charming. To say nothing of the extreme inauthenticity of both as southerners. Over-designed and under-written it ends with an image straight out of Kinkade. Emblematic of the film's aesthetic is the transformation of Jenny's house from a ruin into something out of a Pottery Barn catalog. The movie mistakes prettiness for something more. And its 'exploration' of the relationship of an estranged father and son is simply laughable. Kitsch masquerading as art. Ugh.

5 October 2004,Big Fish,"Walking into the cinema I didn't really have a clue what this film was about! Not a thing. The only things I was aware of at the time was

I) Starred Ewen McGregor

II) Directed by Tim Burton

III) Featured a bloody tall guy!

This movie is one of the finest films I have experienced. The adaptation is brilliant. Tim Burton fails to disappoint this time around ('Planet of the Apes' re-imaging) and even Helena Bonham Carter is good! (exception to my criticism 'Fight Club')

Moving performances by Finney and Crudrup along with excellent support by the odd characters within this tale.

Everyone should have a copy.",7
1 February 2022,"Quirky and heartwarming, clouded in sort of a haze that's hard to untangle but I don't feel compelled to untangle it","This movie really was unlike anything I've ever seen-quirky and heartwarming, clouded in sort of a haze that's hard to untangle but as the audience, I don't feel compelled to untangle it. I think it's really the best Tim Burton output that I've seen, a work that expands beyond the aggressively weird remainder of his filmography to reach a more mainstream audience, while still retaining that signature weirdness factor that makes Tim Burton Tim Burton.

Visually, I think this is where the film shines brightest. Some of the cinematography and set designs are some of the most beautifully whimsical images I've ever seen in a live-action film-that shot of Ewan McGregor standing in the field of daffodils was instantly iconic and well-worth the effort to create said field. While the overarching story felt pretty touch-and-go and the film felt a touch long on the journey to the end, the individual vignettes of stories from the old man's youth themselves were engaging and well-written, and honestly, the ending tied it all together into a much better final product than it would've been otherwise. I enjoyed this movie.",7
28 January 2004,A Brilliant Masterpeice!,"I loved this movie. Everything about this movie was awesome. It had a little bit of the different Tim Burton moods in it. Some parts were colorful, similar to Pee Wee's Big adventure and Mars Attacks. Some of the scenes were very dark similar to Sleepy Hollow and Batman. I believe Burton is the greatest director of our time. Some may argue the point that Speilberg is the best, but I beg to differ. After Stanley Kubrick passed away I think Tim Burton took the throne as the best director, but i believe that I am the only one who would think so. Hopefully people will begin to realize his brilliance when Charlie and the chocolate factory comes out. Anyways, Ewan Mcgregor was great in the movie and I really liked Albert Finney as well. Hard to believe he was Daddy Warbucks in Annie. Mcgregor's role was just magnificant. He made the story very believable. I hope to see more of him. His roles in trainspotting, star wars, moulin rouge, etc. can not be ignored. I recommend this movie to all people who have a good heart.

7 January 2010,"Tall tales, tall order","The teller of tall tales takes on a tough task (besides risking too much alliteration). The tales have to be exceptionally creative, because they are supposed to surprise and delight. But their fabulist nature also makes it more difficult to affect the audience emotionally. The audience knows the stories are fake and thus have no anchor in real human need and motivation.

Tall tales also tend to become highly episodic. Made up of bizarre and outlandish events, they highlight a moment or a single image instead of a steadily building web of cause-and-effect.

Big Fish doesn't know how to solve the unique problems of the tall tale. It's a patchwork script, and its attempts at solutions just make the problems worse.

The writer tries to affect the audience emotionally by framing the fantasy story with a son's attempt to get close to his storytelling father. This line is psychologically real but boring in its execution. It also feels like much ado about nothing. So what if dad likes to make up stories and repeat them a few too many times.

What's worse, this technique of a second, realistic story line backfires. Instead of anchoring the tall tales in some recognizable human emotion, the realistic line cross cut with the fantastical line seems like two different movies stuck together, and neither is done well.

An even more serious flaw with this script is that the tall tales aren't that delightful. This is where the fantasy game is won or lost. In Big Fish we have a giant who doesn't do much, a big fish, and a parachute drop behind enemy lines where the hero encounters a woman with two heads.

There is a Utopian town, which is quite common in fantasy and can be very powerful. But this town is never explained or given any larger symbolic meaning.

The first lesson here is simple. If you are going to do tall tales, do them all the way. You're in the fantasy genre, and once you get the audience in its own fantastical world, you have to keep them there.

In the Fantasy Class, I talk about the fact that fantasy is more dependent on the premise set up than any other form. If you don't get in and out of the fantasy properly, you can't build the fantasy and you can't make the necessary emotional connection between the fantasy events and the characters' psychology in the real world.

The second lesson is: once your audience is in the fantasy world, you better tell the most imaginative tall tales anyone has ever seen. Great fantasy is about showing people possibilities they never even dreamed of. That's a high standard, but in this form it's the only one that really matters.

10 January 2004,Believe It Or Not: Fact or Fiction,"When someone tells a story, the listener must decide for himself (or herself) how much of the story is fiction and how much is non-fiction. Often, the line between fantasy and reality is a thin one. Tim Burton explores this line beautifully in ""Big Fish.""

First of all, the direction and cinematography, especially during the flashbacks, helps maintain a dream-like quality throughout the film. Philippe Rousselot plays with a variety of bright colors, like a joyful memory where you remember everything brighter than it actually was. Yes, there are dark moments in the movie, but those too seem less like a nightmare and more like a daydream. Danny Elfman's score also fits the movie and its subject matter very well.

Second of all is the acting, which keeps the movie a good distance from its potential. It's not that one character's acting is horrible, but certain scenes seem to take the actors to a ground on which they are not as easily able to stand.

Third, the idea of the movie of alone makes it worth watching. It is only the way in which it is executed that keeps the movie from perfection.

Final Grade: B+",7
19 January 2004,Personal myth makes great film a reality,"Beautiful story giving the importance of storytelling and perceptions of our lives in the limelight.

Often Burton can be style over substance ( re: his appalling Planet of The apes) but in Big Fish the material really requires the surreal style of this film maker.

Like Edward Scissorhands - Burton's other successful film, Big Fish is an exploration of the magical place were myth means life, were fairytales interwine with reality.

The scriptwriter and writer of the original book require more kudos than Burton of course, and the charming performance of Ewan MacGregor dds a huge amount to the excellence of this film.

Go see it - it's suitable for everyone.

18 July 2019,Before Watching: Big Fish (2003),"""Big Fish"" (2003) is a charming movie about a dying father and his confused son. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:

This movie is directed by Tim Burton. If you are familiar with Burton's other movies, that explains it all.

If you are not familiar with Burton, however, his characteristics are a plethora of witty, weird and wacky moments. Things do not always make perfect sense, but they do not have to. The sweet, charming feeling that surrounds all those small moments is more that enough to compensate for any potential, nick-picky irregularities - if they are even there.

Big Fish is certainly a Burton-movie, and a great one. Expect all of the above, along with some surprisingly profound moments and dialogue that might change the way you think about things. As far as warnings goes, there are a few butts shown throughout the runtime, but nothing more than that. The ending could come off as emotionally intense, but in all, Big Fish is a pleasant ride.

My personal grade: a gleeful 8/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",8
18 March 2005,Another great Tim Burton movie!,"I remember when this was in the theaters. Unfortunately, I didn't make it to see it there. It's a good movie though! I really liked the storyline. A son separates himself from his dad until it's almost too late. The father tells a story that is supposed to have been his life. The son, not believing much of what his dad tells him, listens to every word that is being told. Some interesting characters are told in the father's story that is almost believable. Every now and then, you see a flash forward to modern time when the son is getting married. This movie, like any other Tim Burton movie, is a ""must-see"" movie! I'm glad it was made!

18 January 2004,Burton makes a good film... The end must be near!,"As you no doubt would guess from my summary, I am not a Tim Burton fan. To tell the truth, the only reason I went in to see this movie was because I had a free pass that was about to expire and then this one used a great song (Peter Gabriel's ""Solisbury Hill"") in its commercials (I agree, that is the absolute dumbest reason to see a movie that there is; but it's the truth!), so I went to watch it. I cringe whenever I hear that Tim Burton is working on a film--especially since he managed to take a masterwork of American literature in Washington Irving's ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" and turn it into an atrocious assault on the filmgoing public named ""Sleepy Hollow"" that hardly even resembled the work on which it was based. I hate everything of his I have seen except ""Batman,"" which I like just for pure fun. However, I have always enjoyed his use of color and lighting and so I have been hoping for a long time that he would work from a great script once so that perhaps he would make a good film.

He finally has done both with ""Big Fish."" This film is an exercise in mythmaking--something that filmmakers should be interested in doing and yet somehow are not. While it isn't the grand, ancient, epic mythmaking that Tolkien did with his ""Lord of the Rings"" novels and then Peter Jackson later did with the film adaptations, it is the same basic concept--creating a piece of folklore. It's obvious in its themes and story, yes, but that's part of the point: folklore and myths are always obvious. The characters are flat, but they really don't matter as much as they do in more modern forms of storytelling. (As Mozart says in ""Amadeus,"" mythical characters are ""so elevated they sound as if they [crap] marble,"" and most people ""would rather listen to your hairdresser than Hercules."") So, the obviousness and character flatness is intentional and is part of creating the world in which this film resides, which is not strictly the real one.

There isn't much to the characters, which then of course renders the actors incapable of putting in impressive performances. As I've said, it's not about characters. This is not an actor's movie (hence it will be ignored by the Oscars--if you read this after them, you'll be able to see if I'm any good at prognisticating such things), but I do want to point out the thoroughly enjoyable performance of Ewan McGregor He seemed to be thoroughly enjoying himself the entire time and played up the cheese in the story to the hilt in a wonderfully entertaining way.

Burton creates a beautiful, colorful, obviously not-quite-real world for this film that works perfectly for the storyline and keeps the film in this other world in which it does exist.

Overall, it's a fun movie. You can start attaching significance to it if you want and searching it for symbols and mythical archetypes, but I personally just enjoyed it. It's nice-looking, light-hearted, and funny. From what I have seen (which is most of the Oscar contenders), this is the second-best movie of 2003, a worthy film, and the picture that proves Tim Burton CAN make a good movie if he's got subject matter with which to work.",10
11 March 2004,Good but could have been way better: 7/10,"I am a huge Tim Burton fan. I am a sucker for stories of unbounded imagination. I love warm feelings.

Well, this film has a bit of all - but it could have been way better, I think. Yes there is the Burton touch, but far from at its best. Yes there is some imagination, but far from being imaginative - if I dare say. Many of the imaginary (or not) events and places are modestly surprising, when I was expecting much more (remember Terry Gilliam's Adventures of Baron Munchausen - now THAT was wild, and in the end also the doubters were in for a surprise). Even the warm feelings, while there, and the father and son story, while there, are a bit diluted, not as efficient as they might have been in the hands of a Tim Burton at his best.

I guess it just goes to show that even Tim Burton cannot always get it fully right - and/or it goes to show that Tim Burton has continuously raised our expectations about his talent, which increases the risk of disappointment.",7
8 June 2005,Magical...,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home.

Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works.

The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

27 January 2004,Another great Tim Burton movie,"Scot Ewen McGregor and Brit Albert Finney star as Edward Bloom, a ""big fish"" in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama. Edward's tall tales impress and entertain everyone except his son Will. Will is most bothered that, at the age of 30 and about to have his first child, he still knows little of who his father really is. So when Will gets a call from his mother (Jessica Lange, looking great at 55) saying his father is dying of cancer, Will used the opportunity to get to know the truth about the man.

Told completely in flashback from several characters, Will learns of his father's successes and failures. From his childhood, when he and four friends visited the local witch (Helena Bonham Carter), who could predict when and how he would die; to his adolesence, when he starred on the high school baseball, football, and basketball teams, and then befriended a wandering giant; to his adulthood, when he roamed around Alabama, finding the perfect town of Spectre, joining the Calloway (Danny Devito) Circus, seeing the love of his life (""White Oleander""'s Alison Lohman), and spending the next three years pursuing her.

Worth mentioning is the supporting cast, a fabulous array of famous actors and unknowns who contributed to ""Big Fish."" The visual effects were done perfectly, just enough to enhance the story without taking control of the movie.

Much like ""Forrest Gump"" with Burton's trademark quirkiness, ""Big Fish"" is a trip through time as seen through one man's life.

Rating note: There is some brief nudity, without which ""Big Fish"" probably could have gotten away with a PG. But this is far from a kids' movie. Suggested ages: middle school and up.",8
3 January 2004,A great cinematic journey,"I haven't read Daniel Wallace's novel yet, but the film reminded me of a fairy tale -- albeit much abbreviated -- version of Thomas Wolfe's ""Look Homeward Angel"" in that you're not moved so much by huge plot points or revelations, but by the beauty of the somewhat ordinary yet strangely huge stories Finney's character spun. I suppose I was also moved by the father-son relationship since I've been estranged from my own father for some time. On top of that I saw this a few days before Xmas, which is a very emotional time of year for me (not a fan of the holidays with all its commercialism and my emotions seem more intense then for some reason).

On its own, the film is technically well made and wonderfully easy to watch -- there are the surrealistic touches you expect from a Tim Burton movie, but they're not over-the-top or accentuated like in his past movies, and I think that's why some rank BIG FISH lower in comparison to his other films. Fair enough.

But in comparison to all the other films I've seen this year (I go to the movies at least two times a month), this was the one rare time in 2003 where I felt like I was ""IN"" the movie, not staring at my watch -- and the ending just blew me away -- it's very simple yet captivating. I once had a dream that my life would end in a similar fashion, so again, my reaction to this movie is filtered through my own experience. Yours may be different. I still think this is one of 2003's best movies and you'd be remiss to pass it up.",
10 January 2004,"An Adventure Big as Life Itself, No Matter How You Tell It","Big Fish is a superb film with adventures that may seem like exaggerated stories, but it doesn't matter. Tim Burton was always good with fantasy and Big Fish is one of his classic films. We remember Edward Scissorhands, A Nightmare Before Christmas, Beetlejuice, and many others all shown through the imaginative perspective of Tim Burton. Big Fish is enjoyable for all ages with superb stories of fantasy and romance. Definitely the best picture of the year yet. Superb performances from all the actors and the most superb performance of Edward Bloom. There are many adventures in life and in each one, there's uncatchable fish to be caught. This is definitely a story as big as life itself. A 10/10 rating and added to one of my favorite movies. If you want superb fantasy, watch Tim Burton's Big Fish.

12 January 2004,"Drags on, no surprises","After the first 20 minutes of the movie you can pretty much tell how the rest of the movie is going to go. The giant was the worst special effects I have ever seen, especially the scene when he first meets Ewen MacGregor's character. The perspective was all wrong. First you see the cave entrance, and it looks just a bit taller than Ewen, so at that point you expect the giant to be crouching or crawling when he walks out of the cave. Instead, he's standing straight up, implying he's the same height as Ewen. But then in the following scenes he's much taller. It was very poorly done, and that set the tone for the rest of the movie. Ewan was wrongly cast for the part I think, as he was for Moulin Rouge as well. His smile is just too corny and his teeth aren't straight.

26 August 2007,One of My Favs...,"I wanted to see this movie as soon as it came out, the trailers grabbed me instantly. When I saw the movie, I could not believe how INCREDIBLE it was. After recommending this movie to anyone and everyone - the general consensus was the people either loved it or hated it. I LOVED IT! Obviously I own it and watch it regularly and I never get bored of it.

a) the cinematography is fantastic b) there are so many underlying themes that I think one view of the movie just does not pick up on c) it has so many messages, it makes you think and think some more - a lot of movies don't do that

It is truly up there on my list of favourites, but ever since I saw Big Fish for the first time, I don't seem to enjoy other movies as much....That's just my opinion!

1 March 2019,Alireza.Akhlaghi.Official,"I want to tell you from the world that his creator is tim. His world is exclusively personal and compilation, and he can make the world better than imagining, dreaming and watching. His ability to portray content and creative imagery is not in vain, and he unveils a trunk of a dream that his fans are waiting for. In fact, he opens the world for you to get out of there for a dilemma and a dream come true for you and you know that you have to stay. You must stay and enjoy your world. The great fish unveils the world of imagination and inner humanity that is not very acceptable. She is not confirmed by her single son, and he still drops the pain during the film. Of course, this dreaming is acknowledged emotionally by his wife and bride, but since part of the focus of the story depends on the presence and attitude of his son, the movie's pretender is arranged so that he and his dreams are not recognized. But not matters. Tim Burton, with all its existence, shows a picture of his man, who is heavily bound up with determination to dream. The dream that ultimately brings to the film, and it means miracles. The miracle that comes from belief and dreaming is beyond the reach of the general audience. Something over to our recognition. tim unveiled a large fish of its own world so that we understand that he, like Ed Bloom, has an unlimited limitless dream. All his work is the result of this attitude. He is the author of the film, and the style of Tim Burtonism is at least in the minds of fans. see this film and other activities of the team surly.",9

15 May 2004,"The Meaning of ""Myth""","In this lovely, heart-warming film Tim Burton explores the meaning and importance of myth in human life. To many people, the word ""myth"" is synonymous with the word ""lie"". Nothing could be further from... ""the truth"". People, (in this case Ed Bloom, played superbly by Albert Finney), use myth to describe that which is most important to or about them. Whole civilizations have and do the same thing. So, to know Ed one must understand the myths he has created to show us and his son (wonderfully played by Billy Crudup) that which he holds most dear. I have admired Ewan McGregor for many years and his performance in this film serves to only increase my respect. Sit back and let Ed reel you in.

4 August 2007,Some words I like,"And then I realized, this wasn't the end of my life. ""This isn't what I die."" Edward Bloom If I know when, and where, and how I die, that would be fortunateness for me. I would not be fear of anything. With great courage, I can do every thing I want.

""I am destined to marry you.""Edward Bloom How can you know that, I have never got this feeling.

I discovered most things that you considered evil or murderous are simply lonely and lacking in social intercourse. Edward Bloom Beautiful world! They are sick. We have to help them.

""Fish looks different to different people.""Jenny The 8-year-old girl is beyond our imagination. I'm sure you will be in love with her deeply.

I advise you watch the film twice at least. I made it four.

31 July 2007,"Fantastic adaptation, very touching","When I began watching the movie I thought it is just another ordinary comedy, but surprisingly it was mush more than that.

The director did a very good job trying to reveal his ideas of life and love.

The acting was rather good either, and Billy Crudup in particular was magnificent. Actually the only movie I saw for Billy was Almost Famous and maybe he was good but in Big Fish he was someone else, his acting is so sweet and gentle yet powerful and very emotional.

The screenplay was amazing; it really is a one of a kind story about life,death, joy, love and family.

And the most interesting thing is the non-stopping music by the genius Elfman from start to finish; it is fitting perfectly with every scene. Well deserved academy award nomination.

This is really a very rich experience that is not to be missed.",8
17 February 2004,Close but not quite there,"I'm sure that this read better as a nove with BIG FISH is that film fantasy sequences have been now, so much better. After LORD OF THE RINGS, it's hard to impress with fantasy sequences. So they fell kind of flat, rather than wondrous, or whatever they were supposed to be. I think it would have worked better if the father's stories were less fantastic, more realistic.

However, the ending really did work for me. Not to spoil it, but the scenes of the people from the father's life coming together and telling THEIR stories of HIM ... now that was heart-rending.

However, I have to ask (rhetorically, of course). Ewan McGregor after 30, 40 years grows older to look like Albert Finney. Danny Devito (etc) after 30, 40 years grows older to look like ... Danny Devito with grey hair??

27 June 2018,Life as a big fairy tale,"This is a beautiful story about a man with the rich inner world, which was not understandable to his son. Developed by his imagination, the whole life he told an incredible stories to the others. And so, his ordinary life in a small provincial town,he painted with unreal colors, and made an unfinished fairy tale. On the other hand, there is his son, who, due to his father's frequent absence, was forced to relate his life to the fantastic stories which his father left him, instead of reality. And he trusted him, until the moment when he realized that he had believed in only one great fairy-tale throughout his life. And then there is a split in him and he rejects his father, because of his own misunderstanding of the specific personality which his father has. As a result of circumstances, he begins to realize that his father was in fact all his life, one honest person, a man who always helped to the others, who was always guided by goodness and courage. Because all of our lives are actually how we seen them, and if someone wants to make his life as a fairytale, let him do it. And whats happened at the end? Using the same formula, out of love as a base, not wanting to disappoint his father , he told us the incredible story of his father's end, seeking to round up the magical world in which his father lived. And the fairy tale story continues to live, through the unrealistic adventures that the son is now transmitting to his son. A wonderful story indeed.",8
16 March 2009,Big Fish - Truly an influential!,"I usually don't fancy movies that are based on Fantasies, but this movie made me change my mind possible. I haven't read the novel too, but the movie is at its best in showing the entire fiction in the given 125 mins. The credit may go to two people, Tim Burton and Ewans, who are really behind the success of the movie. Both have done their best. The other key thing which also has contributed to the movie's success is the back ground score of Danny Elfman, who has really made the audience taste the ambiance of the whole scenes.

The movie is combination of Art, Fantasy and Music. Overall, the recast of the written novel is awesome!

But this is by far his most excellent film. It really captures both Daniel Wallaces and Tim Burton's wonderful imagination is this outstanding tale. If you have never have the pleasure of seeing this film, do so. I loved this movie, and have yet to find one that has been better. And i don't expect Tim Burton to do anymore wonderful than he has done with this film, which is one of the best movies i think, EVER MADE. With great acting perforemances by Billy Crudup, Alfred Molina, Ewan McGregor and Hellena Bonham Carter, this is a true diamond in the rough of a film. 10/10

31 December 2003,"""Big Fish"" in a little pond","""Big Fish"" seems to be a departure from Tim Burton's usual fantasy fare. Of course, there are fantasy elements especially in the flashback sequences that illustrate the tall tales told by Ed Bloom (Albert Finney playing the old Ed and Ewan McGregor portraying the young Ed Bloom), but the story deals more with how one views life and not telling bold face lies to bolster one's image. The latter is the thinking of Ed's estranged son (Billy Crudup) who returns after 3 years to reconcile with his ailing father and find out who the real Ed Bloom is but finds himself hearing more ""exaggerated"" tales. The film is sad but at the same time life affirming. The son finds it difficult to understand his Dad's view of life until speaking with some of those whose lives had been touched by the man. The fantasy sequences are well done and the acting is superb. Ewan McGregor plays a likeable younger version of Ed Bloom and Alison Lohman is easily believable as a youthful version of a still youthful Jessica Lange as Ed's wife. The movie plays out as a fairy tale but also deals with the strained father/son relationship and the realization that one's perspective on life can make it interesting rather than mundane. Nice departure for Tim Burton and fine performances by the whole cast.

23 December 2009,Mesmurising...,"What can I say? I'm a stuffy 13-year old teenager who doesn't take the time to gaze upon life knowing its surreal beauty. Even when my English teacher introduced this movie to the class for us to watch, I groaned. ""Big Fish?"", ""Gonna be a sappy old fairytale!"". And how stupid was I to even think that? Right from the very first minutes of the movie, I was compelled. My only words for Big Fish were ""Beautiful, amazing, incredible...a sheer masterpiece!"". It's weird to say because I never looked at a Tim Burton film that way. I've watched titles such as Edward Scissorhands and don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it immensely but it never really affected me that much. It's the same with fantasy, watching films like Narnia, I can never compare it to the beauty of Big Fish.

This film looks at life in a very passionate way. With the character of Edward Bloom as he introduces the true importance of life, looking through it in a very child-like imaginative way. I am a kid myself but I have never considered to look at life that way, which really opened my eyes. What I like about this epic is there are three different stories. One of Will's life, who's trying to know more about his father, one of Old Edward, as he lies on his deathbed, and one of Young Edward, who foresees the excitement and adventure. And what's great about it is that the film makes the best out of the three plots without creating any diversions.

We explore Edward's adventurous past as he goes through situations and sacrifices. The film is made with such precision and care as it stores the moments and delivers its material very well.

We get to know the characters a little bit as well. We investigate the true analysis of Edward's past and we see the helpless Will who is also trying to investigate Edward, but there is no need of investigating... just the situation of believing. Their relationship was very heartfelt. The character of Edward Bloom is astonishing. The lack of determination he had in the movie makes him a one of a kind inspiration. + Kutos to Ewan McGregor for committing to his character.

Billy Crudup was also great. As for Albert Finney, he gave a flawless performance and it showed the Edward who had done the exploration and seen the life.

Other characters like Helen Bonham Carter and Jessica Launge were fantastic too. Kutos to Carter as she had the task to play three roles and she managed it with consistency. Plus, it was a treat having Danny DeVito in the film as well.

Bottom Line: From an adults perspective, Big Fish sort of brings out the child in you; it makes life look so beautiful. All I would say is that I would strongly recommend you watch it; just let loose and enjoy.

5 December 2003,BIG surprises!,"Or not. I mean, this is Tim Burton we're talking about. Imagine a film that makes Edward Scissorhands look tame. A lot of familiar Tim Burton motifs such as use of trees, small dogs, and wisdom from the mouths of children.

Big Fish is profound, and profoundly twisted. Reality bending. A mind-bending experience. I was surprised this film didn't get released for Cannes, this is Palm D'Or material. I saw this at a professional screening and the usually-jaded audience was stunned. It is sentimental, and it got me. I had non-stop tears streaming down my face for the last 20 minutes. A 15 hanky picture.

Danny DeVito blew my mind. This is his greatest role - but it's difficult to single out any one performance because every frame of this masterpiece is balls-out brilliant and the cast are incredible. Especially Helena Bonham Carter of course, and she parlays her multiple roles with inspired grace.

I am not sure how this film's gonna play in Peori. Expect the critics and pundits and awards-mongers to be in love, but will the great gross middle American proletariat get it? Tough call. The numbers will tell.

But it's amazing. One of the first movies in a long time I've wanted to double back to and see again.",10
17 December 2005,"Deeply moving, a wonderful celebration of eccentricity","Tim Burton is such a rebel with his films, his imagination is so brilliant, he honestly pisses over half the Hollywood crap that comes out these days. I was initially caught up in Matrix fever the year this gem came out, and missed it. But here two years later, i slipped it into my DVD player, i experienced a beautiful movie. Edward Blooms deep naivety to his own brilliance is so brilliantly captured by Ewan Mcreggor, the cast in general are all so brilliant. This film was relatively overlooked when it came out in 2003, undeservedly. I simply can't recommend this movie enough, go out and buy it for goodness sake. A Masterpiece

2 March 2004,Burton has done it again.,"This film was to be directed by Steven Spielberg, but it soon went to acclaimed director Tim Burton, director of Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice and Sleepy Hollow. I, found that Spielberg doesn't hold a candle to the unique style of Tim Burton. If Spielberg directed it he wouldn't have the creepy production design that is seen in Tim Burton films, and he would probably mess it up by getting people like Leonardo DiCaprio or Tom Hanks. They are good actors but they are not as great as Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney and Helena Bonham Carter. They have a style to the way they use their talents in movies and I applaud Tim Burton for using them in his film. Spielberg would have also gotten John Williams to do the music to the movie, who is a talented composer but not as unique as the mind of Danny Elfman who is my most favorite composer. I highly suggest this film to anyone who is a Tim Burton fan.

18 January 2004,Magic on the Big Screen,"Big Fish (2003/Tim Burton) *** 1/2 out of ****

The great director Sydney Pollack once said that musicals aren't made that much anymore due to the fact that today's society has lost a lot of it's innocence. I feel the same way about films of the fantasy genre. They represent that childhood nostalgia type of magic that isn't found in today's films. Probably the last well made fantasy I saw was ""Pleasantville"". That was until yesterday, when I went to see ""Big Fish"".

""Big Fish"" is about a southern man named Ed Bloom (played greatly by Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney). Ed spends all of his adult life telling tall tales to his son, and just about anyone who will listen. But eventually his son gets older and stops listening (and is played by Billy Crudup). Once he finds out his father is dying, his son Will intends to seek the truth of his father's life. After hearing many stories, he soon realizes that maybe the 'big fish' stories were the most important thing about his father.

Never before have I seen such a film that is so bizarre, odd, random...yet so colorful, likeable, enjoyable, and rewarding. It is a nice feeling to go to a movie and be taken away by such magical scenery and extraordinary characters. Tim Burton does a great job at bringing this magic to the screen. The performances also stand out. Ewan McGregor turns in a tour de force performance, so great that you automatically like him, and root for him the whole way. The rest of the cast do a great job, including: Albert Finney; Jessica Lange; Helen Bonham Carter; and Steve Buscemi. The score, cinematography, writing also contribute in making this film one of the most magical experiences you will ever have at the movies.

""Big Fish"" is being compared to ""The Wizard of Oz"" lately, and it is almost an updated version of it, that still has charm and innocence, yet a solid story with a sense of humor. One of the best films of 2003, and a definte must see!

-30-",
11 April 2004,Magic!,"What an amazing film. The stories told throughout the film are a really interesting adventure. It all begins when Ed bloom (in his older years) falls ill. His son wants to hear the truth about his life, and so Ed tells his stories. So we flash back to when he was young, and take a magical journey with the young Ed Bloom and all sorts of interesting characters. Ewan McGreggor is terrific. He takes the role and carries the movie with such enthusiasm. The locations/sets/props and costumes are superb. I am very interested in picking up the novel from my local book store, just to be able to take these adventures again. While the film is also very dark, there is also a bit of humor. Just sit back and enjoy great story telling for 2 hours. A simply Magical Film experience.

24 January 2012,The Art of Storytelling,"It is easy to forget that most people originally start liking films for their stories. When you are little, you are not concerned with 'who directed what?' and 'who is in what?', as you are with 'what is it about?'. This is a movie filled with magic. It is a simple story about a man desperately trying to get the truth about his dying father, whose tall tales of his life seem far too interesting and surreal to have happened. To say anymore about the plot would ruin it. There is no movie quite like this - which captures the essence of childhood magic and which exhibits the best traits of pure storytelling, and contrasts it brilliantly with the bleakness of how most lives are actually lived on this planet.

Surrealism has never been more real.

23 June 2007,A lovely fable by the modern master of fables,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

25 January 2004,An emotional masterpiece,"This was a great show. Solid storyline and great acting from the whole cast.

Tim Burton scores again with a story that is a wonderful blend of both comedy and drama.

One of the best dramatic movies I have seen in a long time. 10 out of 10.

6 November 2010,Amazingly creative and carefully portrayed,"Big Fish is a timeless film. The story of a struggling father/son relationship can be had in any family, past, present, or future. Director Tim Burton does an amazing job combining humor, wit, and emotion in this film to create characters that almost anyone can relate to. Will Bloom, played by Billy Crudup, and his father Edward Bloom, played by Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor, have a chemistry throughout the film that is enthralling. The relationship they build and portray is believable, realistic, and genuine.

As the story begins, we learn that Edward Bloom is quite the story teller. His embellishments are the reason that his son feels he never really had the opportunity to learn who his father is. Edward's extraordinary stories are portrayed as flashbacks as he recounts the remarkable events of his life to his pregnant daughter in law, Josephine (Marion Cotillard), as he lies sick in bed. He tells tales of how he met his beloved wife, Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange), and of his adventures as a traveling salesman, that which include giants, two headed women, werewolves, and a bank-robbing poet. These tall tales build Edward Bloom into a lovable character and make us want his failing relationship with his son to work out, but for this to happen, Will must first learn to not take life so seriously and accept that sometimes, the big-fish tales can be healthier for the soul than reality and facts. A second theme in Big Fish is that of unconditional, nonjudgmental love. Will must learn that he does not need to change his father and instead, should accept him, because the stories may not be as embellished as Will believes. Comparable to the main theme in Little Miss Sunshine, this theme resonates with the idea that pure, honest love is unrestricted, unreserved, and tolerant.

Beyond the basic elements of film, this movie illustrates unique techniques to depict the storyline and themes. The texture of the film is distinctive to Tim Burton. The flashbacks of Edward Bloom's life have a surreal, fairy-tale dream feel to them. While most films subtly walk the line between fiction and reality, this film visually embraces it. In the scene where young Edward first sees his future wife, a modified freeze frame allows us to focus on Edward's thoughts and emotions as he approaches the girl of his dreams, only to be snapped out of it as time races to catch back up. This scene begins Edward's reckless journey to find his true love. Another cinematic device used in this movie is voice over. The use of voice over in this film is vital to the storyline. Since a number of the scenes are stories that are being told, the voice over narration helps transition between scenes and gives essential background information. The film begins as being told by Will as the story of his father, but after the intro scene, the remainder of the narration is by Edward, until the final scene, where Will again narrates the final story. This final scene is when Will realizes that the tall tales truly are an amazing, powerful part of his life.

Overall, this is a heartwarming film. The combination of real life conflict and dramatic fairy-tale stories is touching and uplifting. It also is a wonderful reminder that acceptance, approval, and abandon can enrich all of our lives.",10
12 December 2004,Surreal movie but very touching,"I watched this movie with a good friend recently, and I couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it. I've been a big fan of Tim Burton's eccentric films (Ed Wood, Mars Attacks), as well as his atmospheric ones (Sleepy Hollow). This one had the feel and look of a movie that was made 30 years ago, though the whole movie had a surreal and dreamy feel to it. The storyline is simple, with a young man (Billy Crudup) trying to get to know his father (Albert Finney), a man with some wild stories, as he lies on his death bed. Of course, that wouldn't do the movie justice, as the quality of film-making is very Burtonesque, so it's hard to pigeonhole.

The main thing I want to say about this film is that Ewen McCregor is one heck of an actor. He plays the young Ed Bloom, a gifted, smart, fearless, man with a heart of gold, flawlessly. The adventures of this young man are so poignant and well articulated, I can't Burton didn't get more acclaim for this flick. Albert Finney is remarkable in this role and I'm really surprised he didn't noticed for his work. I'd probably give this film a 9 out of 10, as it did leave me a little bit confused at times. However, I was speechless for about the last 30 minutes, as the movie really comes to a head and grips you. I would recommend this movie to people that like touching movies with an extrinsic feel to them.",9
21 October 2005,....and then there is Tim Burton!!!!!,"This movie is very hard to place, is it comedy? is it farce? is it melodarma? or is it a nut's nice nightmare turned good? If Albert Finney, Ewan McGregor and Jessica Lange wasn't such good actors as they are this movie would have tipped off very early! That Tim Burton can fill the screen with loads of interesting things, everybody knows by now. (boring Batman wasn't my cup of tea) This movie was such an enormous joy to watch, that a few flaws is excused.

And don't forget! the city of Spectre!!!! It would be wrong to say this is a laugh-fest, it's not, but it certainly a movie where the smile is on most of the time.

24 January 2011,Like watching a dream,"Tim Burton is a genius, with a child like imagination that translates onto the big screen blissfully. Big Fish is an incredibly imaginative portrayal of the book version, with a refreshing style, and beautiful cinematography. Big Fish is a movie that takes you on a dream like trip through incredibly unique worlds. This is a movie that really sucks the viewer in, allowing them feel every emotion, and inspiring them to never give up their ability to imagine.

The casting was incredibly well done. Helen Bonham Carter, just as she is in all Tim Burton films plays her characters wonderfully, giving us her dark side, and her light side. Billy Crudup was an excellent choice for the bitter son of Albery Finney. Ever since seeing him in Without Limits, I have really appreciated his acting. His frustration with his fathers overactive imagination and his search for answers runs smoothly with the fantastic plot of this story.

We also are lucky enough to catch glimpses of Steve Buscemi, Missy Pyle, and Danny Devito who really fit in with the feel of this film.

If you want to laugh, even cry, and ultimately be inspired, this is the movie for you. It will leave a mark on you and you will keep coming back to it. It begins well, and ends perfectly. I recommend this movie to everyone!",9
21 September 2014,A Flawed But Touching Story,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home.

26 January 2004,Most of you guys are right on the money,"What a weird movie experience this was. Not weird in a typically Tim Burton way, but weird regardless of who the director was. You have to look at this film two ways--as a movie, and then as a Tim Burton movie. It isn't exactly successful as the first, and it is radically different from previous efforts as the second. I can't exactly recommend it, but it was certainly interesting to see, and I look forward to some enjoyable heated discussions with people over the years about it.

The main problem is the pacing. It dragged terribly through the entire second act and most of the third. I mean, it lumbered, and I am not one who needs a lot of action or even dialogue to be riveted by a movie. He tried hard to weave a convincing narrative, but gets mired down in ideas that aren't fully developed and ultimately, the movie collapses on itself.

It also turned itself upside down trying to make a point that ultimately isn't made very convincingly, largely due to skeletal dialogue Billy Crudup's character has to mouth rather lamely. He wants to know the real guy his dad is...dad never told him the truth...he never talked with his dad...did it never occur to him to talk to his mother? Visit all the people his father told him about a thousand times? He finally goes to see one person when his dad is on his deathbed and I really saw no point to the entire encounter. Given that dad is a guy who never shut up and obviously worshipped his family, I found it hard to believe the whole ""I-resent-you-Dad"" shtick.

What I love about Tim Burton's work is the visual element. I say to people all the time that half the time, I just throw in a Burton DVD and hit the mute button, looking at his films like art instead of movies. I have never felt that he was a particularly engaging storyteller, feeling instead that his movies all relied so heavily on the visual that it was a lot like eating too much candy...afterwards, you're still hungry and kind of queasy. This movie suffers from a bit of the same problem. The visuals are more whimsical than we're used to, more naturalistic but the overall sense of imagination that makes me gasp from Burton normally isn't present throughout. There are moments of inspiration--the popcorn, the daffodils--but overall, I get the impression that he is just trying too hard.

The performances are sublime, with especial kudos to Ewan MacGregor. This man is simply celestially talented. He lights up the screen like a supernova. Jessica Lange is wasted, and Alison Lohman is so eerily her spitting image that I think she must have been cloned. Albert Finney is terrific, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito seem to be having the time of their lives, and even the mostly wooden Billy Crudup acquits himself well at the end.",
12 March 2004,"Delicate, poetic... fabulous!","This will be for sure one of the top ten of 2004! I loved Big Fish! Burton's back with his traditional symbolic tale, so full of poetry, so delicate in it's metaphores. It makes you smile, it makes you feel good... and it makes you think. Ewan McGregor is very good, and so are the other actors, with an exception maybe for Cudrup, who's a bit too fake and makes a bit too much the ""serious son"". Dialogs are excellent (I love Senior Ed Bloom, who ALWAYS has a story ready, an answer ready!), scenes are excellent and the whole movie is drowned in Burton's poetry. Excellent movie! Definitely a ""must"" of the year, and not only for Burton's fans.

28 January 2021,A Journey as beautiful as it is bizarre,"If you've ever lost an elder that told the most amazing stories about their life, this will leave you sobbing, but in a happy way.

It's simply a magical journey packed with all kinds of tales about one man's life ranging from half truths to downright absurdities. You will need to pay close attention as the plot does revert between past and present. But there is no other way to tell this story effectively.

I sat down infront of this movie having absolutley no idea what it was about. Coincidently, I had just farwelled my grandfather, who also told incredible stories about his life (none so wild as portrayed here, of course).

The conclusion of this film left me with watering eyes and a greater sense of closure that came with his passing.

It's simply a beautiful film.",9
13 July 2008,Found it much deeper on my second viewing than I originally did.,"When I first saw this movie in the cinema, I was a mildly bored teenager who, though enjoyed the movie, didn't find it very memorable. Several years later, after hearing a lot of great stuff and realising it was from one of my favourite directors Tim Burton, I decided to grab it and give it another watch. I am definitely happy that I did so. I got so much more out of it when I watched it a second time. I'm not saying every teenager will be bored when they watch it, though. Probably the opposite. I'm the first to admit that my taste in movies at a young age wasn't exactly the best, but even at that stage I was able to look back and see the good in the movie.

The movie revolves around the stories that father, Ed Bloom (played by Albert Finney as an old man) told his son, Will Bloom as a child,(who as an adult is played by Billy Crudup) who has now grown up and looks on those stories not as nice exaggerated tales, but as lies that he was once foolish enough to believe. Throughout the movie, you are shown various stories from Ed Bloom's (played by Ewan McGregor throughout his adult years) life, where he meets lots of colourful characters and affects their lives. And you also have the side of the story Will Bloom dealing with a tattered relationship with his father.The story is nice and sweet, with lots of touching moments. I'll avoid much more about the plot, so I don't take anything away from the joy of watching it for yourself. I will just say it's a great plot, and I loved watching all these far-fetched stories come to life.

The characters and acting in the movie are great. The character of Ed Bloom (in the stories) was very well written, and very likable. Ewan McGregor plays him perfectly. Will Bloom, wasn't exactly the most likable character in some ways, but the aspects of his personality were important to the overall plot. He was played well by Billy Crudup. The supporting cast was really great, with very interesting characters played by actors like Danny DeVito, Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and the late Matthew McGrory. Considering the large cast of characters in the movie, they were all handled very well considering their stories were all being told in one movie. That is another positive point of the movie.

Visually, this movie is fairly different from most of Tim Burton's movies. It lacks the Gothic theme that almost all of his films have. It was a bit of a change for him, but he handled it really well, and I look forward to seeing him take on some more movies in a similar style. This movie has become one of my favourites and is definitely in my top five Burton films. People of a really young age may not enjoy the movie much, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under the age of about ten anyway, since some of the scenes may be a little mature for them. My advice would be that if you haven't already seen this movie, it should be near the top of you ""Films to Watch"" list.",9
24 January 2004,a great new tall tale movie,"This is a teriffic movie. Entertaining, quirky, sad, but above all it is a movie for folks who love to tell and listen to stories. It is a movie about tall tales and how they often manifest some version of truth. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys romance and humor with an edge. Tim Burton's best movie yet. Hope he stays on this track and makes more.

13 July 2018,Tears Were Wept,"I'll admit, the film didn't arrest my attention right off the bat. Into the first 30 min I was certain this was going to be a 4 out of 10 star movie but man, it just got better and better, and the ending was surprisingly clever and far more endearing than I originally thought this movie capable of.

That's not to say that only the ending is good and the rest of the movie is bad or sub-par; it just has a certain style and panache to it that takes some getting use to. Since watching 'Big Fish' a few months ago it has quickly become one of my guilty pleasure films; it's so bright, colorful, and overall humorously zany. I've come to adore this film.

I'd give it a rating of 7 1/2, but since that isn't an option, I guess 7 will have to do.

29 December 2004,"Big Fish, Big Film, Big Impression","Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home.

11 January 2004,Bad Casting,"Albert Finney is a great actor, but he ain't from the South, no way, no how. Five Southern kids in the woods, with four of them white and the other black; it may be politically correct, but it's not correct for the time and place. And a black physician treating an elderly white guy, see problem above. Don't get me wrong, I actually liked the movie and found it quite moving at the end, but I think there were some major gaffes in it. Believe it or not, I actually found Nicole Kidman and Jude Law (in Cold Mountain) more believable as Southerners than Albert Finney.

22 May 2004,Big Something,"Perhaps this movie should have been titled ""Big Meander"" because that's what the plot spends it time doing. The acting from the outstanding cast is great. The storyline could have been good, but I'll never know because I couldn't suffer through to the last minute. The movie didn't provide me with any sense of satisfaction, that something about life was being explored or communicated. There are a lot of fantastic story elements: whimsy, personalities (Albert Finney wins), courage, social and personal challenges, etc. And there are a lot of well conveyed pieces of the story. But the plot is ponderous. You don't feel that there is ever going to be a climax or point to the film, it's like a bunch of incomplete short stories jammed - not joined - together.

There was a lot of story material and resources (actors and budget) to work with, but this is not the tightly constructed art, for which director Tim Burton has gained fame - Edward Scissor Hands, Ed Wood, etc. Responsibility for the failure of this film rests in the direction, clearly the cast and crew did a marvelous job.

4/10 for the package",
10 January 2004,More than just a Tim Burton movie,"Most Tim Burton films are wild fantasies glorified by the elaborate characters and settings. While this film had all that it also contained something much more, a human element. Films like Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow had this element, but it was always on a much darker level. Big Fish makes the viewer look at themselves and their family. How does that person relate to his or her father? That's the truly lasting element of this film is the way it can strike a cord in the heart of the viewer. Compare that with Burton's other films and it's just a little bit more.

26 April 2004,Pure Philosophy,"What a great movie! - What an intelligent comment on life and existence - I have always sensed great talent in Tim Burton, but this movie tops it all. It's a rare combination of a fantastic story, a magical adventure, a wonderful gallery of characters and a sense of detail, long sought for.

I'm left with a feeling, that something large has just been shown to me. - Don't take everything too literally - Why is it so wrong to fantasize a little - why do we always, as reasonable human beings have to live strictly in the world as it is? - It is escapism and i think it's healthy

I hope this film makes it clear to more people, that life is too precious to spend without use of your imagination!

I felt like a child again, i fact I am one - i wanted to be a hero after i saw this picture - I wanted to go on wonderful magical adventures too - I wanted to live life and feel happy!

Good Work Mr. Burton!!!",10

30 July 2004,Wow!!!,"After this movie Tim Burton is definitely in my top 5 list. I liked many of his other movies, but this one is, in my opinion, his best. Big Fish caught my full attention for it's entire duration and left me with a feeling I had just watched something special when it ended. Everything about it was great.

Great direction and editing. Beautiful images, some very powerful and emotional scenes and fantastic use of flashbacks. Great acting. Every actor in the film delivers a solid and balanced performance. Great story. A beautiful and entertaining story and a very good script to support it. Great effects. Very well done special effects that fitted perfectly with the story.

This movie is interesting, thought provoking, funny and touching at the same time. Not many movies can claim that. I can't recommend it strongly enough. Go watch it now. Or watch it again, I know I will. I give it 10 out 0f 10 (my first 10).

30 December 2003,Holy crap this movie was really sweet!!,"Yeah so, this movie is not kidding, eh, its really about a big fish and it's very cool and stuff. I think the acting was so good and so was the directing and the musicing. But I didn't exactly see the whole thing but it was awesome! The thing is I was watching the movie and there was this scene with this giant fish, and I mean huge!!! Not just big, but like friggin real big giant type big humungous and shizz. Seriously, see it just for that cuz this fish is way bigger than you are even imagining no matter what. But anyway, so's I'm getting some bad indigestion like I do sometimes and I start with the bad gas too and these people behind me who seem to be really serious about movies start telling me to get lost and stop farting or they're gonna beat me up and stuff and I'm like 'hey it's a free country' and they're like 'free enough for me to beat you up' and I'm like 'screw off you're giving me gas' and anyway they made me leave the theatre so I didn't see the rest of the movie but I sat in the lobby and got 3 free refills of my large coke. But that fish was mega-huge and my friend who wasn't farting told me it was really good after the fish part even though some of it was like totally not realistic. So anyhow, I recommend it so much that I will go see it again probably.",10
29 April 2004,Heart-warming tale,"I bought Big Fish sight unseen because of the trailers I saw on it and because I am a big fan of Tim Burton and Ewan McGregor. This film was delightful and was more of a mainstream drama than anything I have seen Tim Burton direct before. Granted, there were some mystical characters in the film, but overall it was very much a well done story about a grown man who desperately wants to find out who the man who is his father really is. His father played by Albert Finney as an old man and Ewan McGregor as a young man tendency to stretch the truth a bit about events that occurred in his life. The son played by Billy Crudup appears resentful and embarassed of his father because his father won't answer a question with a straight answer. The whole film is a combination of flashback and current events documenting the life of a truly remarkable man, whether the fathers stories make him more interesting or not, the man himself is remarkable simply in his ability to spin yars like he can. The movie has a rather undramatic ending but it does leave the viewer with closure as the son finally understands who his dad is, even if he was reluctant to believe the story at first. Tim Burton does a very good job in guiding this film from start to finish. It is comical at times, heartfelt at others, but at no time does the story seem so completely out in left field to be unbelievable. I was leery of taking my children 11 & 6 to see this film as from the trailers, it appeared to be somewhat scary, however after seeing it, I feel I would be comfortable in sharing it with children.",9
30 June 2020,A very good movie.,"This is a very good movie. I must admit i watched this movie when i was 13 and i didn't understand the ending, nor the meaning of the movie. I still enjoyed the movie very much, making this one of a few movies that have a deeper meaning but are still enjoyable without figuring out the meaning of it.

19 January 2004,"Rather magical, highly enjoyable","I don't know if I agree with people who say this is Tim Burton's finest, but `Big Fish' is certainly a wonderful, enjoyable movie. It's not perfect but it is bold, creative, funny, and incredibly touching. I found myself crying through much of the movie, which focuses on Edward Bloom (Albert Finney, who brings humor and touching gravity to his role), a dying man who loves to tell stories, and his relationship with his son (Billy Crudup). Because `Big Fish' mostly details Edward Bloom's life, the movie has brilliant style, although some parts were a little too stretched out for my taste.

`Big Fish' deals with flashbacks that look at Edward's life through his stories. Ewan McGregor is wonderful as the young Edward Bloom. McGregor has a great gift for facial expressions, so he is a delight to watch onscreen. Most of his adventures are particularly wonderful, especially the one about how he meets his wife, gets to know her, serves in a war, and returns to her. I was crying my eyes out throughout the entire sequencebecause the story is so shockingly inventive and so heartwrenching. It kills me just to think of it. Their love for each other withstands time (something beautiful it itself); there is one scene with the old Edward and his wife (Jessica Lange) in a bathtub that is absolutely gorgeous in its simplicity. And, like some of Tim Burton's other movies (like `Edward Scissorhands'), the heart of the story is `love,' love between a man and wife, love between a father and his son. I love how Burton has interpreted it in `Big Fish' and showed it to us through Edward's crazy stories. 8/10",8
31 August 2005,The Truest Story of his life within the Stories he told...,"Aside from the aesthetics of set design, effects and unbelievably stylistic hallmarks of a Tim Burton masterpiece, what I took most from this film was the story within the stories within the movie story by Daniel Wallace. It was the story that bore the touching element of one man's life story that read like a mantra on 'Living life to the fullest', and against the odds. Carpe Diem. It raises values, ethics of work (hard work), true commitment and love, father son relationships, wide horizons, and a whole new perspective for looking at things, and each day. The main character harnesses so much, never looking at problems like problems, with a four dimensional way of looking positively at things, all the time. Unjudgmental and fearless in the pursuit of his ambition even if it was partly meant to be mythical.

From his, ""What I learnt from Sunday School was that the hardest things in life often yielded the greatest rewards"" and bashing through the arachnoid jungle to find Sceptre, to his turning around and challenging fate and eschewing self-defeat by declaring: ""Sandra Templeton, I love you and I will marry you!!!"" It was the one truest story of his life within the stories he told within the story of the movie.

But then again, I never quite was the logical type...",8
26 December 2017,Lying as a life,"I find it fascinating how the movie is able to deliver a message about life's own struggles and its joys with the ""lying"" in the center stage. The movie walks us through the essence of life while still being funny and light. As a young person sometimes these kind movies make you thing about the purpose of living or simply put ""Why we live"" and what lies in the core of humanity. Sometimes it makes you sad and sometimes it makes you appreciate your life much more.

12 February 2005,The most accessible of Tim Burton's films,"A familiar tale which seems more a Spielberg's movie than Burton's.But i think this movie was snubbed at 2003 Oscars.OK,this is not the usual dark and bizarre world of Burton,but hey,this movie is like an American Fellini,a wonderful tale that debates the lack of illusion in our lives.The movie is also a wonderful portrait of a father-son relationship in an honest way.All the actors are very good(I've never seen Billy Cudrup as good as here) and the performance of Albert Finney is timeless.The movie has a magical quality that can be seen by anyone.That's why many people say this is the most accessible of all Burton's movies.I suppose that is not critic's like,but this is a movie that will age in a very good way.

14 March 2023,I watched it so much that different people indicated it to me.,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

21 January 2004,Burton's most accomplished work,"Just watched 'Big Fish'. Admittedly I am a complete Burton fanboy, so it's with great delight that I report 'Big Fish' is a stunning return to form after the disaster that was the 'Planet of the Apes' remake. Some people have been questioning Burton's skill since Apes, with reports of remakes abounding - the much-hyped Johnny-Depp-starring redo of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', and also his ability to appeal to the mainstream and keep the studio's happy. I think 'Big Fish' will silence his critics once and for all.

In my opinion 'Big Fish' is easily his best work. Both mature and delightfully childlike I think he's been watching a lot of Jean-Pierre Jeunet films. It has the same hyper-realism and surrealism as Jeunet's work, but retains everything that makes Burton's films so unique - his own brand of off-kilter story-telling, slightly off-centre humour and childlike wonder.

'Big Fish' is also Burton's most commercial piece of work, and I suspect it's going to be a massive hit with everybody - critics and audiences, young and old, film buff and film newbies. You can't help but get pulled along by the youthful exuberance of the whole film - it's like 'Amelie' on acid. One critic dubbed the film the new 'Wizard of Oz', and I'd say that's pretty much spot on - both films are a delight to watch, are visually inventive, and bursting with happiness.

Story wise it's pure Burton. Tall tales, bizarre misfit characters, but heart-warming and uniquely beautiful. There are no real ""stars"" in the film, as it seems to go beyond any one actor or actress... so real commendations to all involved as it takes some doing to make you believe that your not watching ""stars"" Jessica Lange, Ewan McGregor, and Helena Bonham Carter. The rest of the cast is equally sparkling, cameo's by a whole host of players at the top of their game. Albert Finney get's the real kudos - he plays the old dying 'Big Fish', Ed Bloom, perectly... with the perfect balance of emotion, charm and wit. I have little doubt that he'll walk away with a paperweight or two this awards season.

I think 'Big Fish' is a timeless masterpiece. A film that parents will show their children, and children will show their children. It's pure cinema magic, and I don't often say that... you really do get a real sense of magic and wonder while watching it, the ""time stops"" sequence is as perfect a piece of cinema as I've ever seen. So a welcome return to the boy-wonder Burton after a brief spell in the wilderness. So now I'm going to be waiting on the remake of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' with baited breath... it'll either be simply amazing or astounding awful, Burton never does things by halves.",
9 May 2023,I caught a fish!,"Living your life is so important there's no reason you should go through life with someone else telling your story tell your own! This movie illustrates a boy going through life with his dad always telling the story of him being born but it's not quiet what you think it is! This movie was good but super weird and hard to catch on to when you had so many stories going on. The overall thought is don't try to get things right when you have no time left start early and make things how you need them to be! I recommend this movie to anyone wanting life motivation or someone's who's at home life is not the best and needs reassurance. Overall this movie is was okay and it's something that you should watch at some point!

10 May 2023,weird,"This has to be one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen in my entire life also I am pretty sure that it will be different from what you have seen before. Now given that this movie is directed by Tim Burton that may give away how strange this movie was. However I am someone that did not grow up seeing a Tim Burton movie so when I first saw this I was deeply disturbed. With that being said, this movie was one that just weirded me out too much for my liking. If you like Tim Burtin movies then go right ahead and watch it but if you have not seen a Tim Burton movie then you have officially been told that the movie was weird.

11 July 2004,Moving,"There isn't much to say about this movie because it is so hard to describe. As a big Tim Burton fan, I just had to see it, and I wasn't deceived at all.. I was pleasantly surprised. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes to add a bit of fantasy to their lives, because this is what the movie is about.

This movie is about a man who is trying to learn more about his dying father. It's about his quest to understand his father as well as his universe. This whole universe created by Tim Burton for this movie is just fantastic and the actors have adapted well to this world.

This movie truly deserves a high rating. Everything in this movie fits, the music, the actors and the background. It's a work of art. Even though the movie isn't preachy and doesn't force a lesson down our throat, I think that you can learn a thing or two by watching it.

It's a beautiful movie, really...",8

8 May 2023,The new title is 'A Goofy Movie',"One word to describe this movie is goofy. This movie is so so so goofy and it works! The reason why it works so well is because that's the entire plot. The fairy-tale events and all the stories make this movie work. Even though there are story-tale plot events and it's so very unrealistic, it's not just a kids movie. The whole plot with the son and the dad just makes the movie able to connect with a larger audience with a bigger age group. The effects for this movie aren't even bad, it didn't take away from the movie. Overall this movie is fun, silly, goofy, and really effective. I will most likely watch this on my own again.

29 January 2004,Another great Joseph Campbell movie,"Following on from his success with Star Wars, The Matrix, Lord of the Rings and possibly others, Big Fish is another great Joseph Campbell movie! This is a wonderful version of Campbells 'Universal Myth', this time stressing the importance of personal mythology. Other reviewers have noticed a cameo appearance by Campbells book 'The Hero with a Thousand Faces', which sits on the bedside table during a father/son reconcilliation scene. I'm afraid that I didn't spot this, but on leaving the theatre I commented to my girlfriend that Hero with a Thousand Faces contains Big Fish and all of the movies listed above.

This is one of the deepest movies that I have ever seen - another masterpiece for director Tim Burton. I loved it!

22 August 2004,Pointless...,"I had high hopes for the film as I imagine most people doing seeing as its been getting good reviews.

If anyone could give me back the two hours I just wasted I'd be most appreciative. The stories told were uninteresting and pointless, the characters were paper thin and I was not given the chance, nor wanted in the end, to get to know them and actually care what happened to them.

The acting was good, the cinematography was good but sadly thats where the good bits end. I'll be the first to admit I'm not a massive fan of Burton but even then god knows how he got away with this. It was just totally uninspiring, uninteresting, unengaging and down right boring. The story was predictable and simple with nothing to entice the watcher into he world he was trying to create with each story piece.

Personally I'd recommend watching something with a lot more thought to it, if you like the fantasy type genre then Princess Mononoki is a prime example of great story telling and well executed drive.

Big Fish - 3, and if the actors were bad, then it'd have been a 1. Seriously.",3
8 May 2023,Wise Words from C.P.A,"Big Fish is to sum it up nicely, one of those movies I will remember forever. And not only because I really liked the way it was just told and presented but because of the life it showed. Edwards' life was that full of crazy and unbelievable things full of love, heartbreak, gain, and loss. That life and much more was what Edward wanted for his son's. He wanted his life to be full of life so alive it couldn't even pass as a fairy tail. Excitement and joy would also be a treat along the way for his son; but he wouldn't want that to distract him from what was unbelievably in reach. The idea that Edward wanted the best for his son sounds like an insult because he wanted it to be more than that; he wanted him to have everything and more even extraordinary things on levels unimaginable.

11 December 2003,a love story in which the love story is shoved to the background,"Poor Billy Crudup. This graciously natural actor is stuck in a miserable role in Big Fish, playing William Bloom, the stick-in-the-mud son of a very ordinary man named Edward Bloom, who has enchantedly imagined his entire life as a gloriously giddy myth. But William, who grew up to be a newspaper reporter (he specializes in facts!), can't accept his dad for who he is. And so while Edward spins wonderful gold out of the straw of his life, William the wimp rejects him totally until Edward begins to die, when William comes home to America from Europe, with his French wife. What for? To grill Edward for the ""truth"". What a jerk!

Nobody who goes to see Big Fish is going to like William. So it's unfortunate the whole movie is set up with William as the hero - he's the one who's going to grow and change, he's the one we are going to wait for the whole film until he catches up with what we already know from scene one: he's got a wonderful dad. No matter how talented of an actor Billy Crudup is, every time he's on screen in Big Fish you just want him to shut up and get lost. William is a loser.

His father Edward is a champion yarn spinner. But the character we actually love most in Big Fish is Edward's wife Sandy, because Sandy loves Edward for who he is and can follow with her heart what her eye cannot see. Now that's extraordinary vision! Unfortunately for Big Fish, Sandy doesn't get as much screen or story time as putzy William, and the movie suffers, because the two best scenes - involving the young Sandy (Alison Lohman) crumpled on the front lawn of her home when she thinks Edward's been killed in the Korean War, and the older Sandy (Jessica Lange) climbing fully clothed into a bathtub with Edward - are all we have to hang our hearts on in this movie.

There's several surface treats, fueled by Tim Burton's fanciful eye and Phillipe Rousselot's quirky and handsome photography, but they don't have a strong rallying point - which should have been the love bond between Edward and Sandy. But Big Fish ultimately misses the boat as well as the golden ring it symbolically tries to swallow in the first scene.",5
8 May 2023,Fig Dish,"Big Fish is an interesting movie. It feels like a fever dream that never really happened and while it can keep you entertained it makes your head hurt with all the confusion. I wouldn't recommend someone to watch this movie unless they are desperate for something to entertain themselves and even then it's a last option. This movie isn't just not good but it physically hurts to watch it. Once you have watched it you will have to keep Advil nearby for at least the next 12 hours. I can understand the overall story and see the potential it could have been but the execution of this movie is awful. The story in the middle of the main story just confuses everything and makes absolutely no sense. It has no structure and no logical explanation of what occurs. I know some people enjoy watching a movie like this but in the modern day this movie does not hold up. I wouldn't listen to the friend that suggested this movie and said it was one of the best because they were 100% lying.

8 May 2023,The Giant and the Big Fish,"To start things off, this movie is a strange one. I feel as if it applies to a certain audience. And unfortunately, I'm not part of that audience. The movie was creative and interesting here and there. But I couldn't follow the plot throughout the whole film. There were so many different little side events that kept happening that threw me off. I will say, it was cool how the movie was filmed in Alabama. I feel as if the message of this film was friendship and following a journey while making friends along the way. That is why I feel the giant was brought up during the movie. I like the overall concept and idea of the movie, it was just too strange for my liking.

5 January 2004,The best film I've seen this year!,"I saw this film last night and I must say, I thought it was brilliant! This is the best film I've seen in the past year. It was absolutely wonderful from beginning to end.

I can't really think of anything bad to say about this film. The plot was perfect, no part of the story is left open. The acting was fantastic! Albert Finney and Ewan MacGregor both gave Oscar-worthy performances, and the supporting cast also produced strong performances. I think this is Tim Burton's best film to date. I also think this is one of Danny Elfman's best scores.

Definitely DO NOT miss this film. I recommend this film to everyone!

8 May 2023,Big fish,"This movie is just as amazing to watch as it was when I was younger. The story of Edward Bloom is one of hope and love that you don't get from the average story. Edward Bloom shows us that our reality doesn't have to be so real. This cast is jam-packed with incredible actors who portray this story so well. This movie would not be the same without the direction of Tim Burton. He adds a sort of whimsy and uniqueness that only he can create. The shifts from the present day to Blooms stories keep you interested and never lose sight of the plot. It all blends into a beautiful story full of heart and full of hope. I highly recommend this movie.

27 October 2005,Between the reality and imagination,"I really like Tim Burton movies.When I see this movie first on title I undoubtedly want to watch it because I know Burton's style.He likes fairy tales,surrealism,animation and make funny movies.Big Fish also contains some stuff like this.The topic is focused on the line between reality and imagination.Secondly comes The relationship between fathers and their sons and maybe the biggest problem between them ""Not to be tolerant to personalities"". In this movie for example; The father is very imaginative, rather frequently storyteller man but the boy is realistic and unhappy because of his father is a storyteller in his all dialogs.This is basically the topic of the movie.Also Burton is very good at taking people's attention to movie with it's ability of storytelling and make it into motion picture.

Secondly the visuals of the movie is very nice, there are very different and fabulous characters and places in the movie.These are adding a dream atmosphere into the movie.

Finally this is a great movie.Sometimes dialogs are boring and always focusing on to the main character but stories in the movie are very nice, visuals is great so this is a movie that you shouldn't be skipped.",7
3 June 2004,See this fish and believe,"This is a movie to prove that civilization is not an empty word. Tall lies, horror snippets, humor, family joys and troubles, relations and work, war and peace ... everything parades in front of our eyes. The circus, engagements rings, a normal Giant, a Giant, cutting the lawn, earning your first buck, learning the name of your love, we are talking Big Fish here. And, oh boy, you ain't seen nothing you ain't laughed yet you ain't even cried yet. Funny thing these tears. They seem to come up in so many situations.

Dear Tim Burton, Actresses and Actors, Support characters and crew, thank you for this Classic of the 3rd Millennium!

8 May 2023,Big fish review,"This was a heart warming and exciting film to watch. A beautiful story about the relationship between a father and his son told using tall tales and metaphors. I like how each story he explained they had a whole separate scene for it. Defenetly a top 10 movie in my books. Although some stories didn't add up and had me confused this film still surprised me. Even the ending, one in more scenarios would seem more sad, ends on a happier note celebrating the fantastical life of a good, intelligent and hardworking man who made more friendships and happy people than most could ever hope to. I will happily watch this movie over and over because I will never be dis like it.

10 May 2023,It was certainly something,"I had never heard about this movie until now. According to those around me, it was ""the movie ever"". As someone who doesn't watch films as often as I used too, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and went into this film blind. I have to say I liked the beginning of the film and how the dad's story about catching the biggest fish was told while showing different periods of Will's life and how the magic of the story started dwindling as he got older. That perfectly set up the entire film with the theme of Will being so indifferent about his father and how he didn't want to be like him since he and his wife were expecting a kid. I think that this movie perfectly shows how being on one side of a spectrum to the extreme can lead to different outlooks on life. On one end we had Edward, the free thinker and the other end was Will, who was more of a logical person. Although., I will have to say that I did not like how the stories that Edward told were directed. It felt choppy and sometimes really fast. I get that it's an older movie but I just can't get over that part. Overall decent movie, probably will not watch again.

10 May 2023,Small FIsh,"This movie, Big Fish, was not good in my opinion. At first I was enjoying it, then it just started to get a little weird and confusing. I couldn't tell if the old man was the main character or if it was his dad but either way I had no interest in this movie. It was very different from a lot of movies that I have watched and I would definitely not watch it again. I guess the director had the right idea for it but it was just poorly executed. There was just so much confusion and something different happening in every scene. I really don't even understand what ""Big Fish"" is supposed to represent.

5 January 2004,I'm a big fish,"I'm a big Tim Burton fan, but Big Fish was a huge disappointment. All of the actors did an amazing job, but the story was lacking in so many ways: there wasn't enough Tim Burton imagery, some of the timelines didn't make sense, the development of the father/son relationship was lacking, and I wasn't convinced that I should care about any of the characters. Bottom line on Big Fish: yes, it's pretty because it's a Tim Burton film, but viewers are the big fish for being lured into such disappointing movie.

8 May 2023,a mans reality and his stories he tells,"This movie is sad and happy. It shows how a man can live his life happy and not look at it with regrets, deulsions. We truly do not know what the life of the dad was like other than bits and pieces that are either the truth or the story he made up. Though however we know that some happens but we can see that it is exaggerated to some extremes excspecialy the big fish part, but that is more like a metaphor than a story he makes up. I see the metaphor as something that you can get that will keep you happy for the rest of your life like a person is the best explanation that I can see. This movie feels more like a dream rather then stories great presentation and plot.

21 September 2008,How can anyone give this less than 10/10?,"It was brilliant. I am a huge Tim Burton fan, I love just about every film he's ever made with the exception of 'Mars Attacks' but this was of extra high standard.

It tells the story of a man called Edward Bloom except at the same time it doesn't. The story revolves around the idea that Edward likes to make up stories to make his life more interesting. No-one seems to mind, his stories have a certain charm to them, no-one except his son that is who goes to visit him on his deathbed in the hope that he might learn something true about his father. Besides the human relationships side of the story is a charming fantasy side including giants, Siamese twins and a poet turned criminal.

It has to appeal to everyone surely? It looks amazing, the story is brilliant, its highly imaginative, features fine performances from all the actors and simultaneously brings a smile to your face and a tear to your eye.

It is without a doubt in my top ten favourite films and that means quite a lot coming from me, I have seen a lot of films a lot of which I like.

Everyone should own this. It was so good I didn't want to watch it the next day. Does anyone know what i mean by that? I want to ration it somehow. I'm like that with Tarrentino films, you want to let the first one sink in properly before you move onto the next one.

It was brilliant. Don't even rent it buy it and watch it and enjoy it. Oh and at the bits that might seem a little confusing just go with it.",10

28 April 2004,"Moving film, should not be missed.","""Most men, they'll tell you a story straight true. It won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.""

Big Fish is a film all about such stories not the straight true ones but rather the interesting ones. Stories as they were told by Edward Bloom to his son William, since the day Will was born. The stories are tall tales of adventure that several fathers tell their children (as the movie opens) either around campfires, as bedtime stories, or as anecdotes at family gatherings. Edward's stories are filled with fantasy, danger, excitement, humour, and even romance.

These stories, to Will's dismay, never stopped. Edward told them well into Will's adult life, and often to Will's embarrassment, and ultimately forced the two to stop speaking with one another.

Now, due to Ed's failing health, Will returns home but is persistent on knowing the truth about his father. He insists that his father put aside his tall tales and come to grips with what really happened in his life. Will wants so much to know who his father really is before he dies, that he won't even allow his father his final days as he would prefer.

The story switches back and forth, from real/present time, and back into Ed's stories. Even through the fantasy and exaggerations, we learn more about Ed Bloom through his stories than we do from anything else perhaps because this is all he has left.

Tim Burton has put together an amazing tale in Big Fish and has displayed it in an amazing way. We get to see first hand (so to speak) Edward's stories in all their exaggerated fantasy as only Edward Bloom could have told them.

At the same time, we get a very REAL story about a son and father who have drifted apart. They were ""strangers who knew each other well"" as Will puts it, and brought back together because of his father's illness. It's not that Will doesn't love his father, but he so much wants to connect with him that he gets frustrated when all Ed wants is to live in his stories.

As Ed's stories are brought to life on screen, they are perfectly crafted and shot vibrantly (when vibrancy is of essence). Of course, these images are extraordinarily bright and at times exaggerated, but justly so, as we expect that this is the way the stories were told. Tim Burton is well known for his unique imagery, and Big Fish takes full advantage of Burton's visionary and imaginative talents.

The characters that are included in Ed's stories, including the younger Ed Bloom himself (played by Ewan McGregor) are also a bit exaggerated, but they need to be for the purpose of the stories. The characters in real/present time are truly believable in their feelings toward with the bed ridden Edward Bloom (played by Albert Finney). His wife, Sandra (Jessica Lange) loves him dearly his son William (Billy Crudup) although frustrated loves his father and Will's wife, Josephine (Marion Cotillard) who doesn't know Ed, seems to enjoy his charm. All have their individual and distinct relationship with Ed, throughout the picture.

Big Fish is an exceptionally moving film. It's charming and fantastic enough to share with your children, warm and romantic enough for couples of all ages, and touching and moving enough to knock down even the strongest of viewers.

Although the film was out last year, I didn't catch Big Fish until its recent release on DVD. As such, it is the best film I have seen so far this year. Big Fish is available for rent or purchase on DVD. It holds my high recommendation and should not be missed.

I'm granting it an IMDB rating... 8.5 out of 10",9

8 May 2023,Big Fish Movie Review,"This early 2000's Tim Burton movie is a fantastic one to say the least. It tells the story of a father and son's complicated relationship through the fathers bizarre tales. The film follows the exciting life of Edward Bloom as he experiences out of the ordinary things that sound too good to be true. I thought these actors and actresses did a great job, every character had a meaning in this movie. I found this film to portray many great lessons that anyone could benefit from. It is a great reminder that the stories we tell are not only to entertain but also to teach and inspire us. Overall, ""Big Fish"" is a compelling film that is sure to captivate audiences throughout all ages.

8 May 2023,who is the big fish?,"This movie is very weird. It's hard to understand and if you know who the director is you will know why it is so strange. But it is actually a good movie. It has a lot of amazing actors and actresses. And the theme of the movie is so cute. Does it make worldly sense? Absolutely not; but you know what, I still loved it. At the beginning there is a lake and this guy is telling the story of THE BIG FISH. They say it is a guy that died and that's why none can ever catch this fish. And the only bait that will work is gold. The main character's dad tells all of these elaborate stories about this life and I'm still not sure if they are true but they are still cool stories. He is telling a story about some town that he lived in and he was so cool and everyone liked him and he was just everyone's hero. This dog gets eaten and then this giant comes out of nowhere. And no it's not a guy on stilts or a robot. He is a real guy! He was 7'6!!!!! HUGE! Anyway they become friends and go on adventures. The dad goes to the circus and sees a gorgeous girl and doesn't leave till he finds her. He was there for TWO YEARS without getting paid!!! No thank you!! This movie is weird and kinda creepy but I like it and you should watch it! GO BIG FISH! Also the end is soooo sad.",7
10 May 2023,This movie was alright,"This movie was okay but it was extremely weird. If you asked me what this movie was about I wouldn't exactly know what to tell you because I had no clue what was going on for most of it. This movie although it was weird it was not boring and kept me occupied. This has to be the weirdest movie that I have ever watched and the switches from story to story were not smooth and left me even more confused because I didn't know what was going on. I'm not gonna lie if you told me you were switching back and forth between two different movies I would believe you because that's how confusing it was, but overall the movie was okay.

22 March 2004,"One Life , a million story's","I saw this movie today and I had certain expectations when I sat in the movie theatre, because I know some of Tim Burton's work ( Batman , Sleepy Hollow , Nightmare before christmas and Beetlejuice too I think... ) and I really like his view on fantasy and imagination. I didn't really know what this film was about so I just went and saw it. I must say it's really really good! Gave it a 10. The perfect storytelling movie... I won't go into detail because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. But I'd recommend it to every person that has a touch of imagination and likes good movies! The story itself is about one man, who everyone likes because he can tell pleasant story's and is a likeable guy... and so his life goes. Also nice romantic feel to it.

To end I just wanna say this film is wonderful and my expectations for another tim burton movie are gone because he has my respect that it's gonna be a good movie anyway...

12 May 2004,Embellishment,"Big Fish is a unique and fascinating movie. While the comparison to The Wizard of Oz may be a little high-reaching(in 1939 The Wizard of Oz was a landmark film beyond what Big Fish is today), I can see why people may make that connection. They are both whimsical tales of adventure. Visually, it is fictive, but not in the way the Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter movies are. The chimera in Edward Bloom's mind is understated. We see what we are meant to see: an embellishment of what really happened. Yes, many of the scenes representing Bloom's stories are impossible, but they are not as incredible as other stories and fantasies.

William Bloom(Billy Crudup) is a fellow who started viewing his father as an extraordinary hero, then a tall tale teller and finally as a liar. During his wedding night, William is perturbed when his father tells a story about catching a gigantic fish with a wedding ring. One he's heard since childhood. William feels he is only a ""footnote"" in the story and his father is telling it merely to stroke his own ego. After this event, William and Edward(Albert Finney) do not speak for three years. When William's mother, Sandra(Jessica Lange), calls to tell of Edward's poor health and ensuing death, he decides to see his father and find the truth about the man he knows only through the outlandish stories he's heard.

The opening scenes show that William is not only upset with his father for telling him these stories, but he's tired of hearing them told to his friends, dates and anyone else old Edward can get an ear from. Flashbacks abound throughout. We soon delve into the visual presentation of these stories as they are told. As William makes it home to see his dying dad, we go back in time to see Edward as a young boy and then as a young man, played with jocund bravado by Ewan McGregor.



As we begin young Edward's adolescence, he is talented at basketball, football and baseball. He, in his own words, is the biggest thing the town of Ashton had ever seen. We are immediately taken into the fictional parts of the tales. First, Ed Bloom encounters a witch, a giant: a man as big as a two story house. An enchanted forest is next, then a werewolf and on and on we go. The town of Spectre is seen like everything else: through the embellishing eye of Edward. This is an important part of the film because it is a place like many may stop in their lives. Its a town that seems like a great place to stay. Yet something is calling Edward somewhere else. It is looked back on with nostalgia and as a would-be wonderful final destination, but not a place to be when you are young and filled with ambition and adventure. This resonates deeply with anyone who has ever found themselves in an unexpected town or city that seemed terrific, yet they knew they had to leave.



One of the most remarkable things about the film is the resemblance between Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney as well as Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange(young and old Sandra). This is simply perfect casting. Many films lack this. They use the same actor for young and old roles. This works much better.



Another of the endearing qualities of the film is that as William slowly realizes his father isn't the liar he thought, the flashbacks become less fairy tale and slowly seem more realistic. This intertwines beautifully. Finally, we see the giant as just an abnormally tall man of about 7'6"". We see that the twins from his military exploits aren't really conjoined, but simply identical twins. So in the end, William sees his father for what he is. He's not a liar, and he's not the hero he was to William as a child. He's a tall tale teller. A man who romanticizes his stories and embellishes them so that they are a bit larger than life. The question is, is there any real harm in that, or does it just make life a little sweeter?",8
22 April 2004,Big Leap Forward For Burton.,"Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" is a dramatic film set in reality with tall tales interspersed throughout the narrative. Director Burton's created a handsome, storybook fantasy that's delightfully pure of heart, thoroughly entertaining and gently humourous. This is perfect subject matter for him and recalls some of his previous movies, especially ""Edward Scissorhands"".

Billy Crudup's estranged from his father, Albert Finney. They haven't communicated in years, living on separate continents. When Finney falls ill, his son returns home to hopefully patch up their relationship with his main agenda being to find out the truth about his father's fantastical, earlier life. Crudup feels lied to and embarrassed by his father from childhood into adulthood. Spending time with him, searching through his personals, he begins to see his father for the man he is and learns to accept his exaggerated anecdotes.

Ewan McGregor plays the young Finney in the flashback sequences. He's completely believable as Finney's younger self and is optimistic, charming and larger than life, much like his adventures. The bed ridden Finney is also up to par and adds a welcome dose of prestige to the film due to his prescience. His loving wife is adeptly played by the glamourous Jessica Lange and her younger self by the talented Alison Lohman. If you thought McGregor and Finney were perfect casting, Lange and Lohman as the same character is inspired. Crudup has the more serious role rooted more in realism than the other characters. While ""Big Fish"" is primarily about Finney and his overtly embellished stories, it is Crudup's film, his search for the truth of a man he hardly knows, his own father. Crudup's realism is the grounding force, the one character we identify with. Duel player Helena Bonham Carter, the hard working Steve Buscemi and Burton regular Danny De Vito are swell in support.

Screenwriter John August, who wrote the original comedy Doug Liman's ""Go"", has been wasting his time of late writing or doctoring the Charlie's Angels movies. It's good to see that his sense of humour is still in check and that his talent of writing intelligent, non-linear screenplays is as sharp as ever.

This has elements of the kind of film that Burton does well. It certainly is an improvement over his last movie, the remake or retelling of ""Planet Of The Apes"". While the fantasy sequences are expertly handled, this is the first film Burton's done that's been established firmly in reality. He did direct the Edward D. Wood Jr. biopic ""Ed Wood"", but that film was stylised, shot in black and white with an over the top, caricature portrayal by Johnny Depp. This is Burton's most down-to-earth film and shows that he's capable of making intimate dramas other than the sci-fi/fantasy genre that's become his trademark.

Overall, this is a tried and true Burton fantasy mixed with a parental drama he hasn't tried before. All the performances are right proving that Burton isn't just interested in the weird and the surreal. This is a giant step forward for the director and is a defining moment in his oeuvre.",8
17 May 2004,A delightful and charming tale,"A story isn't just a story. A story is shaped by the people who lived it, the people who heard it, and the people who repeated it. And that's what the movie Big Fish is all about.

I love stories. I love hearing them, telling them, reading about them, ect... And when the main character of the stories is Ewan MacGregor, you've got me. All of the actors did this story justice. I especially loved Jessica Lange and Albert Finney. I truly believed in their love for each other. Bravo, actors! A job well done.

The movie did start a bit slow; it took me about 25 minutes to really get into it, but then it took off, and I was enthralled. I loved the ending. This was one of those cases in which a ""happy Hollywood ending"" was not only expected, but needed. I loved it.

Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

10 December 2003,Terrific Tall Tales Told Well,"Wow. A whole lot of fun on so many levels.

At its core, Big Fish is a series of tales told by Edward Bloom (Finney) that are throwbacks to a time when the ability to tell a tall tale carried some weight. (Pecos Bill, Paul Bunyan, Uncle Remus, etc.) The plot is exceedingly thin serving as a string to hang the tales on and nothing more. (Why the hell can't William Bloom/Crudup, get over it?! Oh yeah, we need a payoff in the end.) Still, this is a comedy/fantasy so don't look for Macbeth. Besides, the actors in these tales don't need a greater purpose other than to astound and amuse. And they do. Terrific performances by all the principals but special credit to McGregor and Finney for diving into to the part of Edward Bloom and making him a real person.

I can't think of a better director to handle this material. This is the gentle Tim Burton of Edward Scissorshands and Pee-Wee's Big Adventure in control here. The dark Tim Burton of Planet of the Apes and Batman are nowhere to be found.

For movie lovers, Burton throws several references to other films for your delight. Tip: The banjo player IS the same fellow who made the music famous 20 years ago. Trust me, you will get this when you see it.

In this season of major releases with casts of (CGI) thousands, it is fun to see a film that uses the location as a character and special effects that don't rely on computers to make them magical.",8
19 December 2005,Nothing but sheer BURTON Genius!,"This movie is incredible! The imagination it took to create the book and movie is astounding. Tim Burton puts his ""always amazing"" touch on yet another movie this year. There is such a feel-good air about this movie with an ending to leave none disappointed! (Except for the fact that it unfortunately does come to an end). This movie definitely hits my top five and I believe it always will. Ingenious! Nothing but shear genius! I went into this movie wondering how good it was going to be because of the cover...but I soon found out...(to use a cliché:) never to judge a movie by its cover. This movie left me wishing I had seen it in the theatre. If only I had the ability to create such amazing tales. To sum up the movie in one phrase: Simply one of the most interesting and beautiful stories ever told!

30 September 2013,The Story of the Life,"Will Bloom, a journalist, had been told the stories which his father, Ed Bloom, made up when he was a child. He is fed up with them and ashamed of him. When Ed makes a speech in the wedding party of Will and his wife, Josephine, he tells all the guests his story – ""Big Fish."" Will cannot help but go away from the party because he doesn't want to listen to him. Will knows his father who is in the tales Ed tells. However all he wanted to do is know what his father really is. The relationship of Will and Ed is getting worse but Ed's disease makes it changed.

This story is fantastic, amusing and moving. The film has all of them so I had been excited while I was watching it. There are several stories and each of them is related to the others. Taking it into consideration, the stories are elaborate. It is one of the reasons why this film is interesting.

I think that Ed doesn't make up his past. Though, of course, he doesn't talk the fact, he tries to tell his life to his son and everyone in his way. If only what someone says is big fish for the others, he only knows what it means. In fact we may be deaf ears to his story.",9
4 July 2008,Incredibly Amazing,"This movie takes you on a wonderful, amazing journey Tim Burton style, of course. ""Big Fish"" is a movie I love watching on a lazy Sunday afternoon because it just is that kind of movie. It's probably a rent more than it is a buy but it is still worth those hours of your life. It's such a cool adventure and the places it takes you too are all so unique and interesting you want to be there. The characters are all so different from one another and they kind of make you want to meet them yourself. I also loved this movie because of the way Tim Burton used the technology in such a way that you forget he even had to use any at all, it's just that believable. You want to catch this movie if you get the chance.

14 March 2004,Go see it. I don't see how you couldn't enjoy it.,"`Most men, they'll tell you a story straight true. It won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.'

Director Tim Burton's films never follow traditional guidelines. His past films include Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Ed Wood and Sleepy Hollow, to name just a few  all of which have imaginative storylines and wonderfully strange characters, of which Big Fish is certainly no exception.

Ed Bloom (Ewan McGregor as the young Ed Bloom / Albert Finney as the senior Ed Bloom) is a man who has always told amazing stories to his family, friends, and anyone who would listen to them. His son Will (Billy Crudup) is frustrated by his father's stories; unable to work out what was real and what was made-up about his father's life. When he finds out his father is dying, Will returns home to try and find out the true story of his father's life. What follows is a tantalising and colourful journey along one man's life as a travelling salesman, seeking the woman that he loves and having an adventure on the way.

Big Fish is rated PG and while children may find this film hard to follow with regard to storyline, they will be entertained by wonderful visual imagery and colourful characters; the latter including a Circus Manager known as Amos Calloway (Danny DeVito), a famous unimaginative poet called Norther Winslow (Steve Buscemi), a giant called Karl (Matthew McGrory), a pair of Siamese performers known as Ping and Jing (Ada Tai & Arlene Tai) and a witch with a glass eye (Helena Bonham Carter) that bears prophetic messages, mermaids and of course: big fish.

It is so hard to write a review on this film  not due to lack of detail, but because I want to tell you everything (and I mean everything) about it  but if I were to do that, it would dampen your experience of the film  so without wanting to do that, I'm not actually going to tell you much more than what I have already.

Go see it. I don't see how you couldn't enjoy it.",9
12 November 2021,Pulchritude,"This film was fine as if a concinnity waltz and Alison Lohman was as a real fairy in it.

At first glance, the filter of this movie was not good. But as storyline went on, we could feel the warm and magic of it.

11 January 2004,What to make beautiful,"I've always felt like Tim Burton is a director much like a football team. They win games, they lose games, but the fans go crazy either way and are always there to cheer. Tim Burton fans admit what's bad that he's made, they've accepted defeat in certain aspects of his film career. As for Big Fish, it was a game where it went ahead by a few points... then in the story scenes would fly ahead uncathable... then the present would come, that's when things would start to fall apart a little. Things started to grow tired. Nothing was really being done with the present time. The present time could've been done with a big moral all in itself. I just felt a little angry at it. It is a wonderful movie though. Tim has a lot of potential. He needs to expand his creativity just a bit more.

1 January 2007,"Moving life-story for everyone, albeit socially defected","Big Fish is a very moving story suitable for families. It is not really just about one father and one family, but about most of everyone with a big heart and desire to go beyond the usual... Escapist in nature yet extremely enchanting as yet another typical ""American Dream"", the myth and adventure as told by the father very precisely describes one's often untold mixed feelings about life and death, about sudden adolescent growth and the sweet sorrows of love...

What weakens the film most is the over-simplification and Cold-War depiction of a demonetized war-time ""exotic China"" in which the hero suddenly becomes unnecessarily aggressive. At the same time, while the daffodil-filled scene of love and romance is detailed and touching, the over-quick solution of another layer of the story, i.e., the witch/girl/other-woman image, proves to be too shallow in terms of social awareness. There were many allusions to American history particularly in the story of bank robbery and the changing role of poet which, if more adequately explored, could have made the film a much greater one, elevating itself towards many deeper-thinking American social-critic dramatists and European philosophical buldungsroman.",6
6 April 2004,The Storyteller,"It's rather ironic that Tim Burton has found himself making `Big Fish.' He's famously known for utilizing attention-grabbing visuals to slide the story into a slightly offbeat fantasy world and is often criticized for being more in tune with the esthetics rather than script details. Still, he works under scrutiny from the critics in a medium that tells the tallest of tales but to an audience that is divided over the best way of telling them. Some love the storybook method of adventure and the fantastic, while others don't buy into it and prefer a movie with a heavy foot planted firmly on solid ground. Those of you in the latter will not enjoy Burton's movies but may tolerate them. This is the message in `Big Fish.' It is between Edward Bloom and his son, Will. They both have different perceptions of what is important and what is baloney.

The fantasy genre is slowly making a stand for itself after years of being second to others in the Hollywood vocab. In `Big Fish' they make extra evident that fantasy is far more intoxicating than reality and that you can find boundless pleasure in its escapism. Yet `Big Fish' not only tells an entertaining story but it also invokes the imagination. Tim Burton is a very good storyteller, I think, because his visual eye is perfect for the big screen. This time Burton and company manage to combine the best of all elements and make a truly amazing film.

This whimsical Tim Burton movie keeps a finger on the human elements, emotion and spirit. The manner in which it is told, with amazing characters found in tall tales, is inherently likeable, as a good yarn has always been over many generations. There is nothing too deep here, just a good story to be shared with the world. And that's the fundamental nature of going to the movies in the first place, to listen to an entertaining story, and this one is told with enthusiasm and heart. `Big Fish' will be as good as you want it to be. The general message is this and it's important to appreciate how the way a story is told can effect your very perception. You must first give into it, kind of like a leap of faith for some, but once you've let go of the world the story will happily reel you in hook, line and sinker.

8 May 2023,If you dream it you can believe it,"Wow. I liked this movie way more than I ever thought I could. It made me laugh, cry, scratch my head in confusion, and it made me want to see the world the way Edward Bloom did. I went into this and to be honest most of it was really weird. I didn't understand or believe any of it yet I wanted to hear more. That's the good thing about good stories, they don't have to be true to be interesting. I loved hearing this strange old man tell exaggerated but colorful stories. The soundtrack was whimsical and beautiful and fit the theme of Edwards tales perfectly. The cast was great and I can say this was probably one of my favorite Tim Burton films yet. I loved seeing everything tie together in the end and watching the two worlds of Edward Bloom come together. It cleared up enough of my confusion without ruining the curiosity and I will definitely be watching this one again.

10 January 2004,"Wouldn't have believed it, but this one reeled me in!","Like DUETS, which many reviewers called a ""road comedy,"" not a tragic homage to music's transforming power, BIG FISH is being called a fable and a lot of other nonsensical things.

""Big Fish"" in a little pond called Ashton. This was a father-son reconciliation story told in parables (golly, am I sounding biblical?). With wit, humor, charm and suspense, Tim Burton made me a believer as question after question was posed - what is the truth about who we are? If we dramatize and enlarge stories, is our essence forever lost in them or can we, with desire and patience, at last discern who we are and who the people we love are, understand and be understood.

My bet was that I wasn't going to like this movie. Tim Burton's work has usually had too dark an edge for me. Even here we're dealing with death and understanding our lives and their meanings. But Tim Burton hit every mark for me - acting,story, direction, et al. Tears began rolling down my cheeks as the son takes over the telling of his father's last story, finally understanding that he really does know and love his father. The son completes his father's death story/image for him in a beautiful reconciliation sequence, and life continues.

Aint' that the truth!",10
4 October 2008,Movie Magic,"You can put this delightful drama in the same level of classics like Forrest Gump (from which i think was inspired), Rocky, To kill a mockingbird and One flew over the cuckoo's nest for it's incredible way to entertain and like Forrest Gump it's surreal life is a special delight like it is the life of Edward Bloom it's a great fantasy of life which contains sympathetic characters begin from Edward Bloom's character till Karl the Giant's character and even De Vito's character was good.Make a favor to yourself and watch this incredible drama with a great touch of comedy and fantasy and sure will make you smile and you will want to see it again.

16 January 2004,"WITHOUT A DOUBT , THE BEST MOVIE I EVER SAW!!!!","I don't know where to start, but I'll make it brief. I never go to the movies ever, but I knew this was a winner and it was beyond. Went back to see it the next night. It was a movie that tapped into all of your emotions and left you living vicariously through ed bloom throughout the movie. The last 20-30 minutes left me in tears. The end of the movie is the best as well as the part where ed bloom tells us how he feel in love with sandra at the circus and how he won her over in college(what an imaginary tale).

It has been two days and I can't stop thinking about how the movie moved me, and how it starts making you think about life in a big picture and what's really important, and to always believe and act upon your imagination, hence making your dreams reality!!

This movie will remain in my heart 4 ever.

Thank you Mr. Burton, Thank you

1 May 2004,A Big Tall Movie....,"`They say when you meet the love of your life. Time stops. And that's true.'  Ed Bloom.

What a great screenplay adaptation by John August! I don't know who he is, but this is the beautification of a simple, yet endearing story between a dying father, Albert Finney, and his son, Billy Crudup, who is dying for the truth. It deals with the age old question of what reality is and makes you believe that if you tell a tall tale often enough, it will still be a tall tale, but you will be always immortalized for it.

This is an excellent movie for parents, especially dads, to see with their kids. Given our society, it is especially warm and unusually rare to see the portrayal of a father in a such a loving and even innocent way.

I loved the role of Ed Bloom. There is an Ed Bloom in all of us. We all dream like Ed, and sometimes we'll even tell a tall tale or two like him, to make life more entertaining. More important than the obvious is what the movie gracefully whispers in your ear: Judge a person by his character more than by what he is saying. In this case Ed Bloom's character was that of a fine man. He may have embellished, or just plain lied on some of his `stories', but he was a father who loved and cherished his wife and saw to it that his son was always entertained.

In the beginning of the film, you the audience will scoff at the stories which Tim Burton injects to us ala Forrest Gump. Like his son, we were all cynics. Yet, I guarantee that you wont be able to wait to see what happens next. His fascinating stories drew me in, and made his character all the more loveable. After awhile, one could care less about the stories, as you do about the man who is telling them. His positive strength, the key factor here. Even if he did not always choose the right path, his heart and conviction were always in the right place, as he always professed this to those he loved.

To me, the most heartwarming subplot of all, was Ed's recounting of his quest for Sandra. Sandra was his love-at-first-site, one that he would never give up on (hooray). A love that would have him do whatever it took, regardless of the insurmountable odds . Regardless of whether you believed all of the details regarding his quest for Sandra or not, there are some of us who really have a `Sandra' in their lives, and would do the same or more if the opportunity presented itself.

`I just saw the woman I'm going to marry. I know it. But I lost her. I'm going to spend every day of the rest of my life looking for her. That, or die alone.'  Ed Bloom

After everything that Ed goes through, including coming face to face with the `all-american' jerk that was engaged to Sandra, what a great sub-ending we witness when he finally wins her heart and hand in marriage. Score a big win for the underdog! That is what life should be about, and the powerful message of this alone I think overshadows the son's struggle to learn the truth about his Dad. Sandra, by the way, is played by Jessica Lange. She does a wonderful job portraying the loving, stable force in Ed's life. We should all be so lucky to have someone like a Sandra in our lives. In fact, it makes you think that all of the crazy things that he did to win her over, were very well justified. Therefore, another positive and subtle message: If you want someone or something bad enough, you will do whatever it takes.

The young Ed Bloom is played Ewan McGregor. He does a fine job, even though I kept expecting him to pull a light saber at any given momentlol



The movie's end is predictable, but still powerful. The audience will mature as his son does at the emotionally charged ending. Get some hankies ready, once we finally see the passing of the torch. This happens when his son relents, and make a big tall tale of his own to satisfy his father's final request.

In the end, the movie brilliantly establishes the fact that in life, character has nothing to do about what kind of truth in stories that a person is telling, but what kind of truth in a person does his or her stories tell.

18 July 2005,Now I see what the hype was about,"I was constantly hearing about this movie from friends for a long time after it came out. I went to rent it and forgot to watch it at all. However, it has recently been on HBO regularly so I've caught a couple times now. It's another creative masterpiece straight from Tim Burton. It follows Edward Bloom, a small town Alabama man who has big hopes. Although he lives a full life, he eventually falls sick and his son comes to visit him. His son doesn't see eye to eye with him and feels as though he is a liar and that the stories he tells are all tall tales. The movie is well casted and it's pretty funny. The guy that plays Obi Wan in the new Star Wars plays Edward and thats all I really remember about the names of the cast. The movie is definitely worth the two hours.

5 September 2005,A delightful tale from a modest man's imagination,"where to begin, and where to start....

This movie deals with a simple life story of a simple man with an extraordinary imagination..... an imagination that sheds a warm ray of light to our ordinary day-to-day life to make it .... colorful.... wonderful... beautiful... rejubilant ... and worth living. It also deals with a common conflict between a man and his growing son.... put together with simple, yet very meaningful, abstract to make a marvelous 2hrs movie.

The director, Tim Burton. This man's mind is full of fantasy and imagination that he can accurately depict in his pictures. One will get drawn into the story, virtually, from the first minute.... till the last. The camera shots and the angels taken takes you right into the movie and makes you live the story with the actors. Not to forget the slow, but never boring, pace in Tim's pictures that gives you time to relax psychologically and absorb the story more.

The cast; they all did a great job, and delivered to the standard of Tim's imagination. Their facial expressions, their tone of voice, their complexion and their accent... all fit together in harmony and synchrony beyond any other movie.

The music; as perfect as the cast. It provided the movie its dream-like pace.... and bestowed upon my heart a calm rhythm.

In short... a great movie, so worth watching... and definitely worth owning.",9
27 July 2019,Good bc of Burton,"This is the least movie I liked from Tim Burton. But when there is Burton, there is art and fantasy as we used to.

12 January 2004,Billy Redden is Hopelessly type-cast,"This movie is rich with humanity, and is a refreshing breath of fresh clean air in American Film making. The wonderful cast takes a back seat to great storytelling to weave a quilt that in the end is just a great movie. Subdued performances from both Buscemi and DeVito were nice surprises and help made this extra touching.

The film reminds us that the good old days never were, but they were wonderful all the same; and that memory is just as important as food clothing and shelter. Thank you Mr. Burton, I'll put this one on the shelf somewhere between `To Kill a Mockingbird' and `The Princess Bride'.

Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito.

18 January 2004,Tim Burton is the best!,"This is just an incredible movie, and Tim Burton is just an incredible director. He just seems to be able to get the most out of his stories and the most out of his actors.

In Big Fish, he expertly crafts a warm story of family reconciliation with a surreal journey into the past of the family patriarch, Ed Bloom. Burton is able to get the most out of both the story and the actors. There are no weak performances in this movie. Everyone from Albert Finney as the older Ed to Billy Crudup as his estranged son to Ewan MacGregor as the young adventurer to Danny Devito as the carny ringmaster are ideally cast.

I had only moderate expectations when I went to see this movie, but I came out of it as one of Tim Burton's biggest fans. He just may be the biggest fish in the current generation movie making pond!

13 July 2017,The best movie I have ever seen,"Big Fish is an optimistic masterpiece that combines adventure, drama, suspense. romance and of course tons of fantasy. I believe that the thing that makes it so special is its originality.

Tim Burton ,the director of the film, has given his best shot in order to make a film that has nothing to do with any other film, staying loyal ,of course, to the peculiarity of his own unique style.

The positive aspects of this film are numerous. Firstly, the story is interesting and at the same time moving. Then, the special effects are stunning, considering the period in which the film was created. Moreover, the score, created by a usual suspect when talking about a Tim Burton's film, Danny Elfman, totally deserved the nominations it received.

As far as the interpretations of the actors are concerned, they are all flawless. Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter as well as Marion Cotillard, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito are not only big names but also great in their own way. They achieve to make the character they play appealing to the audience. Speaking the truth, if I had the chance I wouldn't replace any of them as the roles were tailor made. By this I don't mean that this film gives them the opportunity to unfold every aspect of their talent but that they meet perfectly the expectations created by their role.

This film is a proof to the theory that great films don't always receive Oscars, Golden Globes or other important awards, despite the fact that they deserve them. I sincerely cannot justify why this film is so underrated.

For all the reasons above, I strongly recommend watching Big Fish. You won't regret it!",10
16 January 2004,A warm and fuzzy story on a bitterly cold night,"I had the choice between Big Fish and Cold Mountain. I don't know how Cold Mountain stacks up, but Big Fish thoroughly met my expectations. This being a Tim Burton movie, I expected larger than life characters, implausible situations and great camera work. I got all that, plus a touching and fantasy-filled story. Just what I needed, with the wind howling and -30 C weather outside.

After seeing this movie, I realise that when my kids ask me what happened when they were born, I need to come up with something better than ""Your mom was in labour for 24 hours, see, and she was screaming bloody murder and then you were born.""

23 February 2004,"Forrest Gump + O Brother, where art thou","Sorry folks ! Tim Burton is clueless since ""Ed Wood"" and gone is the creative magic touch of ""Edward Scissor Hands"", replaced for cheap melodrama. This movie is plain boring with its overblown sentimentalism and takes too much from the universe of ""O Brother where art thou"",(magical realism and typical USA southern characters) and from ""Forrest Gump"" (the main character bends the world reality, creating your own). I was a great admirer of Tim Burton past works and make this comments was truly very painful to me. FG

15 July 2012,a really nice movie...,"Well, what do you do when you are tired and frustrated- it's midnight, dark and you are suffering from the bouts of Insomania- you watch the Big Fish by Tom Burton- well it ain't no Sherlock Holmes but Big Fish is a tale of a tale-yarner: a story teller. Well, in the back waters, a man wished to catch the biggest fish in the river- how he finally did catch it on the day his son was born and let it go after the fish had grasped his wedding ring. This story teller is a man who had sucked everyone with his story telling charms. The only guy unimpressed by his tall tales is his son- who feels that he had never been able to hear the true story of his father. He thinks his father is a megalomaniac and the world revolves around him......... So this story is basically a search- where his son finally discovers the true threads of the story- when his father is nearly dying. To his amazement, fact and fiction mingles and he could not believe his eyes when all the characters- giants, two headed Vietnam sisters, The Poet who went to the Wall Street, the Witch of his Father's stories pop out right at his funeral. Ultimately his son realizes- the wild imaginations that his father engulfed in were far vibrant and romantic than the real life monotony. He becomes a believer.

And the story-teller becomes the story.",8
29 December 2004,Well done Tim Burton,"This movie I wanted to see because it seemed like a good film at the time, but it was a tragedy to see this film crash and burn, there wasn't anything wrong with it, the story was inspiring and trust me once you watch it you become part of it.

The story is about Edward Bloom (Albert Finney/Ewan MacGregor), a man who has been best known to stretch the truth. Now he is ill and his only son Will (Billy Crudup) comes to visit him in his last dying days, during that time Will begins to learn more about his father by hearing his tall tales of his life which included meeting his wife and many friends.

Basically the film is a series of flashbacks of Edward Bloom's life, which we the audience become a part of.

If you're a big fan of inspirational films, this one is for you.

All in all, I give it a 10/10

Thank you",10

It more than met my expectations for the fun you'd expect from a Tim Burton film, but then became more and more personally touching as the movie went on.

10 December 2003,"It Leaps, Glistens, and Snaps","Some critics complain that the movie lacks Tim Burton's customary darkness while others kvetch it's so twisted, it undermines its own aspirations to the light. Mixed Reviews, shmixed reviews. Big Fish is so blatantly hyperbolic in its optimism, it has a sinister undercurrent, even as it sparkles before eyes fatigued by bloated studio monstrosities and too much arthouse pretension.

One esteemed writer for a powerful daily is unhappy that Albert Finney's/Ewan McGregor's compulsive storyteller may not really be such a nice man. Hello! Obviously, we're not sure about him, even as we're falling in love with the guy. The character is a descendant of Mark Twain's go-getting charmer in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court; he's too ruthlessly determined to be entirely trustworthy. And yet, like America itself, he knocks your socks off with his driving energy and star-spangled grin.

It goes without saying that Big Fish is beautifully designed and shot, and Burton, generous in a way that he's never been before, regales viewers with images they've never quite seen. On top of that, the picture is the best re-invention of the American Tall Tale (one of the wellsprings of American storytelling) since Pulp Fiction.",
12 January 2004,One of the Best I've Ever Seen,"This is an incredible piece of film making. The story, the casting, the acting - EVERYTHING - is exactly as it should be. Every scene exists to support the story line, and nothing even remotely gratuitous manifests itself.

Congratulations to all involved in this great film for giving us a unique story, and presenting it in a perfect manner. A ten out of ten.

10 February 2006,An immediate classic that works on both a visual and emotional level,"The grass is so green / The sky is so blue / Spectre is really great ~ Norther Winslow

Tim Burton is a director famous for his visual style, but his storytelling abilities have always been a bit...off. Classics like Edward Scissorhands and his two Batman films are memorable not for the stories they told so much as the flair with which they were told. With Big Fish, this is not the case. With his father Edward (Albert Finney) just away from death, Will Bloom (Billy Crudup, Almost Famous) returns home to finally set the record straight. Sick of being upstaged by the old man's tall tales, the father and son have suffered a falling out, and before it's too late, Will wants the truth.

Through flashbacks, we see the stories the old man's told a million times (here played by Ewan McGregor). He's a high school sports star; he rids his town of a troublesome giant; he stumbles upon the paradise town of Spectre; he works a beat-job in the circus. The main thread through all of them: love, in the form of Sandra, played by Alison Lohman in her early days, and Jessica Lange in the latter ones. Each sequence more unbelievable than the last, Burton brings his visual flair to a story that would have worked without it, and there are few Burton films for which this statement hold true. The result is his most touching and effective film.

OVERALL SCORE: 9.2/10 = A

A tough call on whether or not this is Burton's best film, as his filmography is so deep. But rest assured, it's up there. The cast is rock solid across the board, but Steve Buscemi steals the film as poet-turned-bank-robber Norther Winslow. Big laughs and heart-felt drama, the movie works on both a visual and emotional level. An immediate classic.

Roses are red, / Violets are blue... / I love Spectre. ~ Norther Winslow",9
13 May 2004,Relentlessly Uninteresting,"I should sue each and every one of the 14,692 IMDB members who voted this movie to an ""8.0"" rating. I cannot recall seeing a movie I felt was so vastly overrated. This could be yet another case of a moviegoer (that'd be me, folks) seeing a high rating and building his expectations so high that they are bound to be let down somewhat. Even if those set of circumstances do exist in this instance, that does not make the feelings boiling in my craw any more palatable. This movie is better than I think it is, I'll give you that. But an ""8.0?"" No, sir. I look at where this film resides on the list of the Top 250 and I see a list of films like RAIN MAN, MIDNIGHT COWBOY, NETWORK, GANDHI. BIG FISH does not belong among that company.

After all this negativity you might be wondering what it is that I didn't like about the film. I must admit that I have nothing original to say about that. My gripes are the same ones you've already heard before: the stories Ed ""Big Fish"" Bloom kept retelling throughout his life were amazingly boring. The acting was superb, the sets and effects were perfect, the characters were well-written and believable, but all those tall tales were less fascinating than a pair of Dr. Scholl's foot cushions. Speaking of ""tall tales,"" there was a film in the mid-90's called TALL TALE (starring Patrick Swayze) which covered pretty much the same territory in terms of storytelling. Older guy tells outlandish stories to an unbelieving youth who comes to realize there were large nuggets of truth in each tale. Come to think of it, there have been quite a few films with that storyline. BIG FISH reminds me more of TALL TALE than the oft mentioned WIZARD OF OZ.

The other main storyline deals with the redemption of a father-son relationship. This was a far more compelling aspect of the film than the yawn-inducing fish tales. However, it was handled in such a low-key manner that it felt as if Tim Burton borrowed a page from M. Night Shyamalan's ""Subtlety Playbook."" Unfortunately for Burton there have been some outstanding films dealing with father-son relationships. If I had to rank them I'd put BIG FISH in a distant Fourth Place behind THE GODFATHER pt. 1, THE CHOSEN (a must-see, if you haven't already), and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. You read it right, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK! The relationship swings between the Bloom men can't hold a candle to the ones between the Skywalkers. Whereas Will Bloom severed communication with his father for three years because of an inappropriate wedding toast(!), Anakin Skywalker severed his son's hand in a bid to lure him into an evil partnership that would take over control of the galaxy.

BIG FISH is worth seeing, if only for the all-around cast performance. Of special note is Matthew McGrory, a 7'6"" giant whose typical character is named something discreet like ""Human Sasquatch."" Here McGrory gets to play a character who, although he works in a circus sideshow, is a 'real,' likable person who blends in well with the rest of the cast. At the same time he redeems himself for having anything to do with HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES.

The film is visually stunning, true. Tim Burton is a great director, and a great visionary, who can easily be forgiven for the mess that was PLANET O' THE APES. I'll keep my fingers crossed for his next effort. Hopefully he will be teamed with screenwriters who DO belong in the same room as him.",
9 January 2004,Cold Fish,"Surprisingly, Tim Burton's new film is quite lifeless outside of its breathtaking visuals. There are moments when the movie is sugar sweet in its attempt to

depict the fantastic world of Edward Bloom, but the eye candy doesn't seem to have a lot of emotional depth (although it strains as hard as it can). The toggling of the narrative between Bloom's older self (Finney), who is disconnected from his grown son (Crudup), and his adventurous younger self (McGregor) is

uneven and tries so hard to form an emotional experience, but ultimately is so thin that there is no great payoff. It is odd that Burton does not succeed where his film ""Edward Scissorhands"" did. They similarly rely on elements of fantasy and reality cross-pollinating.

The biggest fault lies in the miscasting of McGregor, who labors with his

Southern accent and never seems at home in any part of the film. McGregor,

who has had some brilliant performances in his past, most recently in ""Young

Adam,"" is unable to be effective in his role. Miscasting plagues several other areas of the film, Helena Bonham Carter being the most glaring. Yet, there are some very nice moments by Allison Lohman, Billy Crudup, and the actress that

plays Crudup's wife. Finney has been better in a myriad of films, ""The Browning Version"" being one of his overlooked gems, and Jessica Lange has no

character to sink her teeth into and is quite wasted in this film.

Of course the film is littered with outrageous characters: Danny Devito's

carnivale ringmaster, Carl the friendly giant, and Steve Buscemi's poet laureate (sp?) to name a few. And while there are warm moments for each of these

characters to show their eccentricities, they don't add up to a very involving movie. Given all the praise this movie is getting, it seems odd that it seems hollow. Instead of ingesting this confection, it is well advised to watch

Zemeckis's ""Forrest Gump,"" Burton's ""Edward Scissorhands,"" or even Burton's

""Pee Wee's Big Adventure.""

Although I will note that several people I have talked to vehemently disagree with my reaction. It seems to be one of those movies that affects people or

leaves them unsatisfied... or even dissatisfied. I fall into the latter camp and warn others that the gooey praise heaped on this film is unjustified. I have a feeling that Burton has followed the pattern of many 70's directors who had a decade or so worth of great product in them but faded into mediocrity (Coppola, Cimino, Raefelson, Friedkin, Lumet, De Palma, etc.).",

20 December 2004,"Finally saw it, and couldn't get enough","I remember seeing a trailer, or a commercial, for this film in 2003, which turned me off and I saw it only after a recent recommendation from a trusted friend (with similar tastes). Score one for recommendations. Yes, some of the images are bizarre and look goofy taken out of context (as in a trailer). But on DVD, within one week I had watched the film, again with the director's commentary, again with intermittent trivia, and any other way possible. Probably one of my top 15 films of all time. Many scenes and dialog resonated like a handbell choir. Come to think of it, Tim Burton's films are always at least good, and I've liked them before (including Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands). As I get older it seems like I'm more and more jaded and am moved by less and less. But, I connected the dots in this film/story, and wept at the end (while more overtly sentimental movies leave me cold).

5 March 2004,A message from one artist to every other about immortality,"I have to say this movie is easily the most inspiring I have seen as an 'artist' - a writer and story teller, and it seems as if the movie while being wonderful as a simple 'movie' also sends an important message from Tim Burton to others about just how one's work really immortalises oneself.

The simple premise is that one's creations be it a simple piece of fiction, a piece of art or a music will take a part of the creator, and everytime someone looks, hears or reads it, the creator lives again through the work. So years after he is gone, how he felt, his emotions his personality and his creations exist once more.

And even beyond that there is the simple fact that the 'father' in the movie is a teller of 'Tall Stories' about his supposed life but the question lies - which one of us ever tells the complete truth? Our memories are hardly photographic and there is little doubt that when we think back on the times, they are always a little bit more polished, often the better times are more 'rosier' - not done conciously but just how the faded memories are interpreted. So really, which is the truth.. the one you tell everyone, or the one that really happened? Does it matter? The one you tell everyone is going to last much longer than the truth ever did as part of your memories and thus the listeners, and really which would you prefer? Life in its boring harsh reality, or a 'better' version with a rose tint and a bit of warm 'humanity' and 'fantasy'?

This movie is based around that whole premise, and is truly heart warming, tear jerking and very funny - a true fairy tale that only Tim Burton can create. And as always, there is much to think abd talk about once its over - at the start one tires of the old man's stories and how surely they must be fabricated, but I bet that everyone wishes that he would continue telling them at the end of the movie :)

I think this movie got a lukewarm welcome at the theatres because it is so 'unique' - there is nothing like this movie and people are not happy to embrace such things. But a guarantee is that when you finish watching it, at the very least you will have enjoyed the ride. At the most, you will take away something much more from you and maybe like me, some inspiration to be a story teller with the heart of the protagonist in the movie!

Superb acting by the cast of course - Ewan McGregor has somehow perfected a smile that could melt a damn snowman, his older version played by Albert Finney manages to make you listen to his every word no matter the fact you know that he could be making it all up, and of course Helena Bonham Carter and Steve Busemi play their roles to a tee. And how can anyone ever forget Danny DeVito?!

The cinematography is always a trademark of Tim Burtons - beautiful landscapes and visual feasts are in store. Nope, definitely one of my favourite films because it is such a personal one for me but even without that, it is worth every minute of your time.

When else will you ever see a movie with the disclaimer similar to 'Most of this probably didn't happen' by the narrator and you were still mesmerised? Only once and this it it! Enjoy and thanks Tim Burton and the cast and crew. *standing ovation*",10
14 June 2004,Burton's fairy-tale,"Movies don't get better than this.

Essentially a love story (both romantic and father to son), Big Fish is a wonderful, imaginative fairy-tale, regaling the viewer with story after story. Any fans of strong cinema or fans of good story telling will love this movie.

Director Tim Burton (Batman, Sleepy Hollow) is a talented, original film-maker, and was a strong choice to direct. He often makes fairy-stories, and here he has left behind much of his trademark gothic darkness, replacing it instead with light and cheer and simple imagination.

(Big Fish is also a return to form after Planet of the Apes - but let's not go there)

Billy Crudup plays Will Bloom, who returns home when his father Ed (Albert Finney) has cancer. He feels as though he doesn't know his father, who only tells tall tales  embellished stories to entertain.

Based on the book by Daniel Wallace, the inventive and clever plot revolves around the story of Ed Bloom's life (Ewan McGregor plays the younger Ed Bloom), and his love for his wife Sandra. It's almost like Forrest Gump, in that Ed enjoys a rich and exciting life  which may never have really happened. Midgets, cars in trees, picture-perfect towns, big fish and giants all meld together with remarkable fun.

Albert Finney and Jessica Lange portray their characters with realism, and sitting that style of acting against a fanciful plot works cleverly. The acting and the plot offset and compound each other, making the movie stronger.

This is sheer genius movie-making, and interestingly, works without violence or the need to shock or scare. Brilliant work.",9
9 November 2009,Amazing form of storytelling,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

So for this movie I had some high hopes, and even though some people have complained that it's bad, I liked it. It's cool, it's pretty, and I thought it was quite funny in parts (I laughed out loud several times.) I thought it was a lot like Princess Bride though so maybe that's why I liked it so much. Oh, and Ewan MacGregor as well as everyone else did a really good job--his accent may be corny but he pulls off a larger-than-life character just fine... or didn't you see Down with Love?

28 January 2006,Americans do not read books,"This movie is a very good paraphrase of Baron Munchausen by Rudolf Raspe. The main character is a great liar who sees the world differently; nobody believes him but eventually his lies prove to be true - who is that, Ed Bloom or Baron Munchausen? Both. The stories Ed Bloom tells are the same stories Baron Munchause told - with the small adjustments: the car risen up on the tree by the flies substituted for the original horse. The director, Tim Burton was making fun of his illiterate compatriots and the audience bought it. Had he made a footnote or give a credit to the book author who lived in Germany in the 18th century, that would be an honest attitude and a few professional movie critics might go to the library and read the book afterward. Since he pretended he never heard the name Baron Munchausen, the movie remains a straightforward plagiarism.

19 August 2006,An Extraordinary Tale of a Seemingly Ordinary Man...,"I loved this film. Tim Burton was a great choice for director. He tells his stories so well and in an amazing way. This movie is definitely worth watching.

The Jist: A man tells his life story to his son through tall tales. When the son is young, he loves hearing of the amazing adventures of his father. As the boy gets older, the stories start to seem too extraordinary, and he begins to think that maybe he really doesn't know about his father's life as it truly happened. He thinks he is nothing like his father, and begins to become irritated at the tall tales. After not talking to his father for a few years, the son hears of his father's bad health and goes to visit in hopes of hearing his father's true life story. What he finds out is even more amazing.

This movie is truly worth watching, but you must sit through the whole thing. I tried to get my mother and friend to watch it, but they couldn't sit still long enough, so they never got the whole story. I finally got my Dad to watch it with me. He sat through the whole thing, and by the end, he was kinda getting into it. He ended up telling me that it was a really great movie. In the beginning, it seems like just another father/son tale, but it is really much more.

I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did.

26 December 2003,Visually stunning is just the beginning,"Big Fish really has been one of the best movies I have seen this year. The story is simple, so anyone who cannot put a cap on the constant search to watch something absolutely original should probably avoid Big Fish.

However while the story is simple the way it is told is original in its own right. Fairytale like touches through out a variety of embellished life stories bring an enchanting feeling to the entire movie. Admittedly slower paced, I do not feel that Big Fish is so void of substance that its unbearable, but rather the pacing allows us as an audience to become completely engaged with the movie. I did not notice any poor performances from the fantastic cast. Reviews in which people have picked out time line flaws and swaying accents only prove that they walked into this movie to find flaws and not to enjoy themselves.

Big Fish is a love story in part but mostly a life story at heart. If you cannot appreciate what simple story elements Tim Burton has successfully brought to life, then you quite simply have not lived life enough to find beauty in Big Fish.",

12 February 2004,The secret to good story-telling; build up slow and then reel'em in,"We all know Tim Burton's work. He is possibly one of the few contemporary directors to whom you can attribute a definite style. The wildly immaginative approach to most Burton films would appear to be a perfect match for a film which takes place largely in a fairy tale world.

Burton does not disappoint, delivering a tale which catches you by the imagination and dangles the unbelievable in front of your eyes in such a warm and gentle manner that you have no choice but to be entertained.

The film itself explores the dynamics of storytelling, demonstrating the simple fact that the subject matter doesn't matter a single bit, it's the way that a story is told that determines a classic from the Kurt Russell film, Soldier. (A nice idea for a story but very badly handled.)

This is possibly where I can draw the only fault of the film. The non-linear editing of the beginning of the film may seem like a clever idea in other films but here it seems a bit confused and slightly muddled. Once the film gets into full flow, jumping from present day to the 'reality-enhanced' world of Edward Bloom's past, it is highly enjoyable.

Albert Finney is good as the older Bloom but Ewan McGregor completely outshines him and i'm delighted to report that his Alabama accent is spot on throughout the movie and in no way as irritating as I had assumed it would be.

The supporting cast is fantastic as well with Danny De Vito and Steve Buscemi really standing out.

Big Fish is a film that is well worth the admission fee and will leave you with a great sense of satisfaction. The imaginative plot and creative characters bring you right into Burton's fictional world and you will leave much happier.

Big Fish reels in a whopping 8/10",
20 January 2004,"The ""lure"" of Big Fish","Which came first? Is it the size of the fish or the size of the pond? I guess in this case size does matter. Since I'm kind of a perch in the game of life, I can only imagine how the size of my pond would affect my outlook. Great movie. 8/10.

6 October 2021,wonderful representation of Grief,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

21 August 2014,This story is about the whole life of braggart man,"Will is fed up with his father'S habit. His father, Edward always tells a lie to his family. In Will's wedding party, Edward talks that he fished big fish when Will was born to audience. This thing made Will anger, their relationship broke. This story is about Edward. This film is one of the fantasy movie. The director is Tim Barton. Direction is very good. Especially, the conversion about past and present is excellent. In this movie, real world ans fantasy are intermingled. Gradually we can't judge which is true. My best scene is the first meet for Will and Sandy. When he saw her, the time stops except him. They met in a circus. All audience and entertainers stopped their act even popcorn. Only Will was absorbed in Sandy. He push his way through popcorn in the air. Just as he tried to talk to her. This scene describes how wonderful thing occur for Will very well. Surely everybody is charmed this movie.

15 September 2015,Talking About a Life,"A son does not like his father because he always tells a story about his own life as if he read out a fairy tale. The son considers the story as ridiculous therefore he is fed up with the attitude of his father. However as he listens to the story more times, he little by little understands what his father wants to say.

What the film shows that; regardless of whether it is true or not, when we get on the edge of death, it is important how we can talk about our own life as a great, bright and happy one. The father's smile in the last scene probably means this.

After watching this movie, I cannot help but think about my own life. Though I have not lived for so long, I wonder if I have stories which I will be able to talk to others with smile and proud. Maybe now I do not. From now I will create the story and when I am 80 years old, I hope, I may tell it to my grandchildren.

21 December 2015,Title's nice,"There is a man Will living with his wife. His father Edward is always telling some interesting exaggeration talks to people around him. Even in the wedding of Will, he is like this. Will doesn't like such stories so much, and he is on bad terms with Edward. However, suddenly he hears that Edward fells down, and will die soon. Then he and his wife go to the hospital where his father is staying. Will is going to find the fact related to Edward's talks, and realizes something new. I don't tell the ending, but probably, it was my first time to see this kind of movie. I don't know how to explain, but it might be fantasy and something. It is interesting to watch, because two types of stories such as real one and imaginary one are in it. What I was surprised is the title ""Big fish"". Of course, there are some scenes related to fish. But it has different meaning, which is big talk. When I know the exaggeration talk is as same meaning as fish talk, I thought how things are going well. I don't know much about his movies, but the film director Tim Burton is such a famous person, and I thought his creative ideas are very nice.

10 January 2004,Excellent!,"I don't think I've ever weeped so many tears of joy despite the sadness of the situation. I've stood up all night thinking about how this story has touched me as it is one of the best stories that has ever been told in film. The story mixes in the great things anyone can do in their life despite the teleological limit we have in this existence. To tell you the truth, I really don't think there will be another movie like Big Fish. It is truly one of a kind!

8 May 2023,Danny Devito,"This is by far the weirdest movie I've ever watched. Absolutely none of it made sense to me in the beginning. When I read the title I just thought it was going to be about fishing, which is kind of lame, but it was something else entirely. I liked all the stories the dad had to tell, especially the Circus one with the one and only, Danny Devito. One thing I didn't like about this movie was that the son sucked at acting, he showed no emotion and his voice was just so monotone throughout the whole movie, I hated him. Overall though I think this was a really good movie and I would definitely watch this movie again.

6 July 2004,Impressive,"Imaginative Tim Burton has created yet one more visually attractive flick. After a disappointing ""Planet of the Apes"" it basically restores Burton as a master at crafting fairy tales which deliver strong poignant messages about life, skillfully blend fantasy with reality and on the top of that are absolutely hilarious. In spite of that, ""Big Fish"" with its sublime story and stunning cinematography is far from being a masterpiece. Its shortcomings mainly originate from uninteresting flat characters (especially the ones from Senior Edward's tall tales) which struggle to carry the movie along. If you want to see Burton's fantasy classic, rent ""Edward Scissorhands"". If you want to see Burton at his best, get your hands at ""Ed Wood"". However, if you are a devoted Burton fan ""Big Fish"" is a must see.

10 January 2004,One of burton's best!,"I'am a hudge fan of Tim Burton. I think he is the only director out there with the guts to do something different. Some of his movies I would only recommend to fans of his(Mars Attacks!)but his really excellent ones(Edward Scissoerhands, Ed Wood) I would recomend to anyone. Big Fish is one of Burton's really excellent ones. Big Fsh was a truely marvelous movie. I have seen it twice in the theaters already and will probably see it a third time. I don't want to give anything away but just take my advice and see it. It without question deserves a best picture and best director nomination at the Oscars.(For once the Academy better give Burton some credit).

18 December 2003,Pure magic by Burton,"Lets clear one thing up before I start. I am a big fan of The lord of the Rings movies, the books, etc. I saw the first two multiple times and plan to see the third many more times to come(I saw it opening night). Return of the King was a masterful work of art but I cant help thinking I would have enjoyed it more it I had not seen Big Fish the night before.

The story begins with Edward Bloom(played masterfully by both Albert Finny and Ewan McGregor) telling a story at his son Will's wedding, of how he caught the biggest fish going the day of Will's birth. Edward loves to tell stories of his life, all seem to be too amazing to be true. Everyone seems to enjoy them, except his son . Both have not spoken three years since his wedding night so when Will finds out his father is dying, he sets out to learn the truth about his father. The film is told in series of flashbacks as we learn of young Edwards extraordinary achievements, as well as his failures. He meets all kinds of colorful people, from a friendly giant to a witch with a special power to the love of his life.

The film has spectacular acting all around. Both Finny and McGregor give the performances of a lifetime. Both Oscar worthy. The supporting cast including but not exclusive to Danny Devito, Alison Lohman, Jessica Lange and Billy Crudup all do their best to show off, and do a good job of it. Two scenes that particularly stood out were the bathtub scene and the one where we find out just what Edward saw the day he met the witch.

This is without a doubt, Tim Burtons best film to date. The film can make you laugh and make you cry in a heartbeat. The chemestry between the characters feels so real, you would swear it was not a movie.

I usually must wait a few months or a year and view a movie multiple times to really say that a movie is one of my absolute favorate films. With Big Fish, I have never in my life, as a child or as an adult been so blown away by a film before. As I said, I am a HUGE 'Rings fan and the feeling I got seeing all three of them combined, could not compare to the awe I felt seeing Big Fish. It is simply the best movie I have seen this year(close by The Magdalene Sisters, Lost in Translation, Kill Bill, Mystic River, Return of the King and Matchstick Men, okay so I see lots of movies) and in a years time, I may say its the best movie I have ever seen. Well maybe not THE best but a favorate.

10/10- Go see this film as many times as you possibly can.",10
31 January 2004,Tall tales without substance,"The trailers have you expecting a great adventure story mixed with a lot of tall tales. This is the story (sort of) of a guy whose dying father told a lot of tall tales, which he relates to you (sort of).

These tales include a mermaid, a witch, a Giant, Siamese twins, and a fantasy town. (among others), but absolutely nothing of interest happens with these characters. I mean he goes on a walk with the giant and finds him a job, he asks the Siamese twins to help him escape a POW situation, and you assume they did help because he's there to tell the story. but the actual story is never really told. The mermaid swims up to his car one day when it's under water. that's it! No story. A lot of interesting characters with the hint that there is a story there. but the story is never told. big disappointment.

21 May 2004,"Loved it, but makes me wish I read the book first.","I loved Big Fish.

This is a father-and-son movie, about the distance that often exists between a father and a son. In this case the distance is caused by the father's tall tales.

The story is simple: The father is dying and the son is sifting through these tall tales in a search of who his father really is. The main themes about a fish that outgrows its pond is repeated throughout the movie and makes me wish I read the book first.

For some reason the movie reminded me of ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"", but I consider Big Fish to be a slightly better movie.

6 September 2010,A masterful story,"I didn't think I would like this, a friend of my son recommended it and I was pretty sure our tastes were totally different. I was wrong.

I rented this movie on a cold, snowy, winter weekend when no other major releases had come out and had seen all the new movies that looked interesting. I watched it twice before I took it back two days later and asked the clerk at the movie store if it was for sale, it was. I don't buy many DVDs but this one is a keeper, a great story, interesting characters, good plot and subplot, in other words a great movie made for movie lovers but everyone in the family will enjoy. If you have to wait for a snowy day to watch it, fine. Just make sure you watch it.

6 November 2004,Awkward Forrest Gump Wannabe,"I've been a fan of Tim Burton ever since Pee Wee's Big Adventure was released on VHS and have followed him through his many genre hopping, each time finding something wonderful, quirky and twisted to share with others and marvel over. Case in point; Beetlejuice. Nuff Said. Like most people I was amazed at how mature Burton's take was on Planet Of The Apes, and the timeline twist blew me away. I was set up for a great Big Fish experience, only to be shot in the foot with a piece of awkward garbage. It feels as though Burton compromised his vision to accomplish something that was forced upon him by the studio. That's right. Forced. Nothing flowed in this movie, everything felt awkward and unnatural. The movie's only saving grace was the acting of Helena Bonham Carter and Albert Finney. I felt sorry for Karl the Giant as the actor who plays him must live with the great deal of discomfort. The movie had it's moments which leaves me sitting on the fence. Two and half stars out of five. Rent a backup movie so you don't feel obligated to watch this.

17 October 2006,Fact or fiction?,"Was Ed Bloom making up all the tall-tales in Big Fish? Or, could they really have been his life experiences? The ending of Tim Burton's film leaves that up to the viewers. This ""open to interpretation"" ending will reveal those who are more down to earth and those who are more liberal minded. But regardless of the extraordinary elements in Big Fish, there is plenty of entertainment for both sides. I'd like to be Ed Bloom. Whether or not he's inventing all these stories to bury some kind of childhood trauma or something like that, he still believes he's lived all that he says. I think this character is rather refreshing; of course, for some, he may be irritating, and I respect that position. Instead of just telling everyone, while recounting his childhood, that he and his friends had a lot of goofs together, they met a witch. Instead of saying that he got tired of his home town and just left, he actually rid the town of a big bad giant and had to leave with him. And instead of merely dying on a hospital bed like everyone else, he was carried through his wishful memories and left this world in the arms of his son, surrounded by people who hold him as a king. And what if he isn't lying? As a matter of fact, all the people Ed talks about actually exist. If he isn't, then Tim Burton constructed a beautiful and credible world of magic, bizarre creatures, people and towns (Specter). Believe it or not, it doesn't hinder the film. The acting is strong, especially by Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor. The latter makes the surreal events in the film look completely natural, and Finney plays old man Bloom to perfection, masterfully relating to us that he is totally convinced that his tall-tales are fact. Interestingly, Burton doesn't really choose a side. He gives huge hints that Bloom's are just ""enhancements"" of reality, but then again, we're talking about Tim freakin' Burton here. He never takes us once for fools. He seems to tell us that since we've been putting up with such lousy, half-baked films lately, then he's going to reward with something special, a treat. And indeed he does. Take the scene, for instance, when young Ed Bloom meets his true love. The script clearly states ""They say when you meet the love of your life, time stops. And that's true"". Burton does not allow himself to merely point this out to us and proceed. He acts it out; he actually makes time stop. Now, this isn't so-called ""ingenious"" film-making, but it is truly unexpected and quite hilarious. So, why such a high grade for Big Fish? I guess I'm a sucker for these films. It's getting harder and harder to make feel good movies, that is, without falling into the ""corny"" category. So when one comes along that is so visually agreeable, well performed and clever, I fall for it.",8
18 August 2013,inspiration 9 - entertainment 7 Great dads movie,"Tuck your cynicism. Put it all away. This is a good family film about the legend of life itself. The story of the image of the world created by a child-turned father, as seen by his son, who heard the stories. Problem is, like most of us today, the son grew up into a world different from the father's. Different values, ways, habits and stories. And like most children, the world of the parents loses credibility, meaning and value, when the child learns cynicism, separates true from false, and in general, makes his own choices in life. Choices of belief. This film is a beautiful fantasy that bridges the reality barriers between the generations and brings the son back to his father's world, and more important, the father, back to his son's. This movie makes me think of the ways I father my children and makes me want to become better in the ways I put meaning into the process. Not my beliefs. My children will choose their own. Not my way in life. They will have theirs. The immense importance that they, and the role I have in their lives, means to me. That is, in my opinion, what this movie tries to pass on to us.

9 March 2010,A Fairytale meets the real world,"Big fish is definitely one of my favorite movies of the 2000's. It blends creative storytelling with captivating visuals and direction. It has dozens of memorable character and performances and it has several amazing set pieces and an amazing variety of styles and scenery. From war, to flowers, to a car in a tree, to a circus stopped in time. This is definitely a film you shouldn't miss. Especially if you enjoy fairy tales, coming of age stories, life stories, or generally any kind of movie. It has something to offer for everyone. If it wasn't for the incredibly on the nose ending it might have been my favorite movie of the decade.

1 October 2004,The best film in years,"This is the first that made me cry in years! This film made me think that our life is too short to waste it on little things, like: fighting with the family members/friends, thinking at what I'm going to eat tomorrow or I'm going to do tomorrow at the office. What I like at this movie is it tells a man's life like it was a fairytale - and our life is a fairytale if have a moment to think of it. Take a moment to think what happen in your life and you'll see that there were great moments in your life that you didn't cherished as you supposed to do.

Albert Finney is playing very good - the same for Ewan McGregor. They tell the story as anyone could - I guess. Go and see this movie - it's worth it.

26 March 2004,"Enjoyable movie, not the best ending...","There are comments here that suggest you not to see the movie. But, looking at the rating which is high, I thought that I should see it. The movie is enjoyable. The fantasy is very well mixed with real life. The flashbacks are made very well. You will have a great time watching it and it's very funny at most parts. I see no reason why someone could hate this movie or just not enjoy it. In my opinion, the ending is not the best that could be made for this movie. It wasn't what I wanted to see as the ending. It could end with something interesting. Something that made you come out of the theater very excited. But well, it isn't that way. But that's my opinion. There are people that liked the ending the way it was. Want my suggestion? Go see it, it's a ""must see"" and you will hopefully like the ending! I give it 8.5 out of 10.

17 June 2004,What a film.,"Seeing this film at the cinema, I thoroughly enjoyed it. One of my favorite films of 2003, it is full of quirky interesting characters who make it come alive. I loved all the characters but it was Karl, the giant who stood out for me, with his lopsided head and gentle nature. The story is that of a man who feels he hardly knows his father. His fathers tales of his life, seem so unbelievable and unreal that the son refuses to believe him and seeks to find the real man. However the evidence points to his dad telling the truth. Evedince in his shead proves that he did indeed fight in the war and was presumed dead, that he did try to sell hands with utensils on and that specter was a real place for which he had property deeds. The flashback scenes showing the circus and the fathers life were particularly enjoyable especially when time is frozen so he can get closer to the girl of his dreams. To his annoyance time then speeds up and she is gone before he can touch her. What he would have done with her if this state continued, I don't know because she would have been frozen like that for however long. Getting all the circus people to freeze must have been a challenge though because, thats how it was done. They simply froze stiffly and diddn't move whilst he walked carefully amonge them. I liked the caravan scene. You are ment to think the circus guy is in with a lady doing you know what but then he bursts out as a werewolf It makes me wonder how much of it could really happen in real life. Could someone really stumble upon an idyllic little village like spectre where they don't need shoes to get around or any of the other things? Comparisons to the book. The book was small and a Quick easy read, with not enough interesting bits whereas the film had expanded on the book and joined it smoothly together to make a wonderful film. OVERALL My favourite bit was the birth of the baby who comes ouy cleanly and shoots across the floor into the arms of a nurse. How come the umbilical cord was already detached? It reminded me of an ad on TV where a baby boy is born and he shoots through the air growing into a man as he goes.

Basically SEE THIS FILM!! I did.",

19 November 2013,Fantastic Film!,"Tim Burton did it again! This movie was packed with such truism and metaphysical meanings that it touched your heart and made you really think about life in a different way.

It is a very deep and warm movie, making you think about the stories being told in the movie and how real it is to life.

The tales told through out the movie were extremely artistic and many times during the movie you saw yourself in those tales.

The entire cast of this film was remarkable and gave an excellent performance. Tim Burton did a wonderful job on this film.

We highly recommend this movie. It is not a movie to miss.",10
24 November 2005,To tell a tale...,"Storytelling is a craft that many of us do on a daily basis, whether it is when we're relaying the happenstances of our weekends or telling the time-hazed tales of our childhood. Very few, I find, actually pull off as an art form. One of the most important factors one will see in a real storyteller is their own belief in what they are relaying to the listener/reader/watcher, whether or not the tale is made up of myth or of fact.

This film is one of those magnificent stories told by master modern-yarn-spinner Tim Burton. It being a tale about a man who's largess, personal mythology, and popularity appears to hinge on his whopping fish-tales and fibs, Burton has chosen the loveliest of ways to relay his message to the audience - simplicity with dashes of spicy exaggeration.

Often, when we think of Burton's directing, we picture something stunningly stylized, and, though this film does possess touches of Burton's trademark scenes ans settings and iconic characters, none of this interferes with this moving and heartwarming film as it moves smoothly, like a good bedtime book.

I called my not-in-the-best-of-health father as soon as I exited the theater to tell him that I love him. If a flick can make me do this, then it has a huge place in my heart!

In our day and age, the power of the myth is oft forgotten and neglected. This film will hopefully re-instill in us the joy of the heart of our live's stories, and the importance of looking beyond the smoke screen to what lies beneath in others.

Best, T.Paul

28 March 2010,Tim Burton's Best Film?,"Perhaps Tim Burton's best film, ""Big Fish,"" I believe, is his most personal. It seems to have more heart and visual originality than his other pictures, and it was the beginning of his lasting partnership with John August. ""Now wait,"" you say, ""I think his style is unique to him."" That may be the case nowadays, but go back and watch any of the German expressionistic or Universal horror films and you'll see where his inspiration originated.

The story of ""Big Fish"" is phenomenal and the visuals really complement it. Albert Finney, Ewan McGregor, Billy Crudup, and Marion Cotillard are phenomenal. This is by far, Burton's best overall cast he's worked with.

In the hands of any other director, this film would have been good. In the hands of Burton, the film becomes great! Not everything he touches becomes gold, but in this case, it did.

I wish the film would have gotten more academy attention, but Burton hardly ever turns their heads for anything other than his technical achievements. I hope that one day he can get recognized by them for his talent AND visual grandeur, but I think he'll have to direct another film of this caliber to get that recognition, and a film like ""Big Fish"" doesn't seem to be in Burton's future anytime soon.",
12 April 2004,An enchanting fantasy. Ten out of ten.,"From the imagination of Daniel Wallace (novelist) comes an extraordinary fairytale, adapted for the big screen by John August, and directed by Tim Burton.

Albert Finney takes the helm of this wonderful story which chronicles the life and loves of Edward Bloom. Edwards' son, William (Billy Crudup), has had quite enough of his father's childish fairy stories and never-ending quest to always be the centre of attention. After hearing his father's story about the infamous `Big Fish' at his wedding, William vows never to speak to his father again. It's not until Edward is diagnosed as being terminally ill that the pair once again meet.

William is determined to hear the true story of his father's life before it's too late. The only problem is separating the truth from the fiction.

Ewan McGregor has a fantastic role as the young Edward Bloom. After conquering the town of Ashton, Alabama, Ed realises he has out-grown the small town life. With the arrival of Karl the Giant (Matthew McGrory), Ed leaves Ashton to find his fins in the Big Wide World, armed with enthusiasm and the knowledge of his own death, which he has seen in the eye of a witch (Helena Bonham Carter).

During his journey he encounters Spectre (a perfect village filled with charming people), and the circus, where he falls madly in love with his future wife Sandra (Alison Lohman, later played by Jessica Lange).

This is an enchanting story filled with fantasy, drama and comedy. There are a few twists along the way, and the ending is certainly worth the wait. Ten out of ten.",10
11 March 2006,A great Fantasy Movie,"I watched this movie with my dad and its sentimental and very nice, i enjoyed it so much, its a fantasy movie with some drama and comedy, i think it combines many genres together with each other, and it's a movie that makes u think after it for like 15 minutes even after the credits.

Tim Burton is a gr8 director with a very wide perspective on his movies, take corpse bride 4 example which is on of my favourite animation movies.

overall i think this is 1 gr8 movie and is recommended for almost everyone.

27 April 2004,Wonderful!!!,"Tim Burton has created another, wonderful, modern fairy tale, in the spirit of Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow.

This film will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you dream.

Is Burton the only director with an imagination?

And how does he create his amazing characters?

I HAVE met these people before. Maybe in my sleeping hours. Or perhaps, in

another life. But they all seem familiar. It seems as though Burton has read

Lewis Carroll and Carl Jung, as these individuals reach deep into the

universal unconcious being.

Excellent! ==============================",10
9 January 2004,"Big Fish flops, gasps for air","What an awful disappointment. The Ewan McGregor segments were whimsical and fun. The father/son segments, tedious as all get-out. And what a stupid, trite Hollywood ending, which you could see coming a mile away. Bor-ring.

2 January 2004,A Much Better Movie Than Reviews Imply,"I was gladdened to read the many positive reviews of this movie on imdb. Based on the reviews, I was expecting a disappointing Tim Burton effort which gets bogged down in the Billy Crudup/Albert Finney sequences.

But this was one of my favorite films of the year. It's absolutely magical and very, very touching. I have a feeling that it will be reevaluated at a later date--possibly as soon as the video release--as an underappreciated masterpiece.

Albert Finney deserves an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor. He is so devilish and charming, and very funny. I'd also got the impression from reviews that Jessica Lange is underutilized by Burton but, in fact, she has a large, featured role in which she doesn't put a foot wrong. If anything, she's underutilized by filmmakers in general in that she doesn't appear in many movies these days, sad to say. She's a wonderful actress and the relationship between her and Albert Finney's character is very moving.

I loved this film and highly recommend it. Sometimes I wonder i the so-called ""serious"" reviewers don't just base their reviews on other writers' opinions. They got it very wrong this time.",
3 January 2004,Definitely Not a Masterpiece,"I agree with one of the earlier reviews which pointed out that the reality sequences weren't balanced enough with the tall tale sequences. This makes the reality sequences fall short in comparison. Also, I didn't think the tall tales were that great either! The war sequence was especially confusing, since I couldn't figure out which war it was. I knew it had to be either Korea or Vietnam, but the music was not right for the period. Also, after the war he's driving a car from the 70's. Also, I thought the special effect of the ""Siamese"" Chinese twins was poorly done and looked fake, not to mention in poor taste, considering the sexual nature of the song they were singing. Back to the confusion thing, I'm thinking it was Vietnam, because if it was Korea, what happened to him in the 15 or 20 years between the two wars? Continuity-wise, this is a big problem for the movie.

Another problem is that it was adapted from a book. Burton probably wanted more of the fantasy than reality, so cut out some of the reality stuff that would have made the real (i.e. not tall tale) scenes work better. Someday I'll have to read the book to see if it works better than the movie.

Overall I think this movie comes down to what you value more: the truth or pleasant stories. I value the truth more, so I was disappointed in this movie. I think people who are heavily religious will love this movie (since what is religion but tall tales that people choose to believe are literally true?), and also die-hard Burton fans. I am a fan of Tim Burton, but I guess not a die-hard one.

Strangely enough, the character I liked the most was Billy Crudup's pregnant wife. She was sweet and charmed by his stories, even though she didn't believe they were true. I wish I could have been charmed by this movie, but it didn't quite cut it for me. About a 6 or 7 of 10.",
20 August 2008,"Big Fish, Big Burton","Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors. I really love the way his films look, his characters, his storyline, his feeling for fantasy and of course the way he directs Johnny Depp en Helena Bonham Carter, two of my favorite actors.

Anyway, why I really really love Big Fish is quite simple really: how Burton tells this warm-hearted story about a man who wants to know what's real of the stories his dad used to tell him. I work at a videostore and every time people ask me for a good movie, I tell them to go watch Big Fish. It's sad that when, the most of them, they see the cover of this film, they put it away and say: 'No, I don't like fantasy-films.' They think they've got a film like Harry Potter or Stardust, but you can't even compare those two with the wonderful Big Fish. Why? Because Tim Burton doesn't make purely fantasy: his films are more. Harry Potter is purely fantasy. I believe Stardust is also, but I can try believe that there's a higher message in that one. Anyway: Big Fish is serious in the fantasy. Burton doesn't handle the fantasy like fantasy, but as something that's serious and it is in Big Fish, because it has a very big role in the lives of the son and his father. These aren't just some stories told before going to sleep. It's part of two lives, and it made those two lives misunderstood by each other. That's also why I love Burton so much: he doesn't take fantasy as something light, he gives it meaning. I'm a writer (a Dutch writer, that's why my English is so bad ;)) and I find it most important to show everyone how important it is to use your imagination/fantasy. Not only because it's fun, there's more to it. Burton understands that and you can see it in his films. Especially in this one and in Edward Scissorhands.

Burton's main character is set to go on a wonderful journey, where he will learn the meaning of so many things. Things that go, yes they really do, beyond your everyday life, simple because you forgot about their existing. Things you don't stand still by anymore, these days. In Burton's very own unique way, he shows you the love of a father for his child, and the love of a child for his father, meanwhile showing how understanding for the father grows. It's a journey of growing up, but also one of staying a kid, and the importance of staying a kid.

This really is one of my favorite.",10
24 July 2004,"Different, but in a good way.","Someone told me that this film was different. They were right too. It's hard to categorise this movie and that's something I actually despise. It's a comedy (occasionally) and a love story (also occasionally). It's a Tim Burton movie, and maybe that's enough information. That means that you don't know what to expect.

I hate categorising films. They should be recognised on their individual merits, not filed in a box so you know what to anticipate. What should happen is that someone should seat you in a cinema, or stick a DVD in your player and tell you nothing else and allow you to watch it in its entirety.

I almost tried to ignore the rear of the case and pretend there was no synopsis. The friend that told me it was different knew what he was talking about. There's an all-star cast and the ""unknowns"" are equally as impressive as those whom you expect to shine.

I'm not about to announce the storyline here. Again, it's one of those movies that you need to sit and watch from beginning to end - release yourself for two hours and let yourself immerse into the story. The comedy sprinkled throughout is enought to keep you entertained - add the original story and you have yourself a gem of a movie and it's the sort of film that you'll enjoy showing friends for the first time and see their reaction, even on the same scale as Fight Club or Sixth Sense, both for the same reasons. This film has no twist, but it's interesting to see someone's reactions to different areas of this film.

Tim Burton never ceases to satisfy. Listening to his commentary, he took this movie very seriously and had some great motives for making it. It was hardly highly publicised, but that increases its value in terms of watchability. I highly recommend it for an alternative - if you're considering a Hollywood blockbuster for a Saturday night, try Big Fish - you'll be pleasantly entertained.",
9 February 2004,Where's lisa marie?,"After a promising start, the ongoing moments of extreme visual magic were not enough to lift the narrative to greatness. I even found myself looking at my watch somewhere around minute 87 ... at a Tim Burton film. Blasphemy! The ending hits some strong points and wraps things up satisfactorily. Legend of Sleepy Hollow, a critical ho-hum, definitely had me more on the edge of my seat throughout. With Burton, we expect great things. This one is a ""not quite.""

9 July 2004,Glad I Caught This One,"Solidly acted and enjoyable throughout. Albert Finney, Jessica Lange and Ewan MacGregor were all wonderful, and Billy Crudup was very nice to look at.

The story keeps one guessing right up to the end - and I appreciate the trailers for keeping it a mystery. The ""fantasy funeral"" scene near the end segued perfectly into what followed.

A sweet, very imaginative movie. Anyone who liked ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Secondhand Lions"" will add this one to their collection. Finney's performance also reminds one of Jack Nicholson in some of his more recent works, such as ""About Schmidt"" and ""Something's Gotta Give.""

24 January 2004,"Big Fish is half excellent, half good","WARNING: Newspaper-style movie review, including plot discussion.

Tim Burton is an acquired taste. His flights of fancy and flourishes of eccentric style make him one of the most divisive directors in cinema today. Big Fish, the director's latest, is actually half Burtonian and half family drama. When the images and occurrences are larger than life, the film zips along with plenty of eye candy to sweeten one's taste buds. When the film lurches into the dramatic, the pace flags despite solid acting and a story that's a step or two away from touching. On the whole, because it is so uneven, the two-hour film feels overlong in spite of all the pieces being in place for greatness.

Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is a man who loves to tell tall tales about his life experiences. His energetic delivery and unmitigated exuberance leave his audiences, disbelieving though they may be, uniformly rapt. That is, except for his son William Bloom (Billy Crudup), a straight-laced reporter who feels that he has lived his entire life without ever knowing the truth of his father. Upon hearing about Edward's impending death, after three years of silence between the two, William travels to his father's bedside with his pregnant wife in tow. There, in Edward's final days, William tries to finally break through the fairy tale facade he's always lived with to understand the stranger he calls dad.

Though Edward is weak, he can't resist spinning stories to his son's French bride. The film traces Edward's life as a young man this way, featuring Ewan McGregor as the young wanderer. This is probably McGregor's best performance to date, because even though Moulin Rouge is a superior film, this role is more focused on acting and a pure emotional connection with the audience. McGregor succeeds on both counts, creating an extremely likeable and always fascinating character to observe. It is a testament to the quality of his performance that he is never overshadowed by the oddball characters he comes across.

And speaking of oddball characters, Burton really shows his stuff when young Edward is traversing Alabama. The impressive array of people he meets includes a giant named Karl, a one-eyed witch (Burton's real-life love Helena Bonham Carter), Japanese Siamese twins, a swarthy old-time carny (Danny DeVito with a wavering Southern accent) and the bare-footed residents of the idyllic town Spectre. This portion of the film includes a haunted forest, a prophetic glass eye and more fantastical fun. Undoubtedly the strongest portion of the film, these flashbacks are both beautiful and energizing.

Tim Burton, who reportedly had a rocky relationship with his father, found his a very personal project and cannot be blamed for turning on the sentimental waterworks near the end of the film. However, after having so much fun with Ewan McGregor, the viewer doesn't want to shed a tear with a dying old man and his stuffy son. Our reluctance to accept the film's tonal shift probably explains why Big Fish isn't as moving as the recent Monster and House of Sand and Fog are. The film is pulling in two different directions at once, and invariably, the weaker side ends up being dragged in the dust.

Big Fish is certainly worth seeing, and if the personal connection is there for you, it may work as well as it obviously hopes to. For me, the happy-go-lucky filmgoer, I would have traded the hour or so of Finney/Crudup for a half-hour more of Ewan. After all, if you aren't going to a Burton film for magic, why bother going at all?

Final Grade: B+",
22 February 2004,Fabulous...,"Absolutely heart warming and fabulous...

One of the weirdest movies - but it almost makes you cry and I have no understanding how or why this movie manages to have such an outstanding emotional effect but an amazing tale told in the uniquest way possible...

Go watch it - best 2.5hrs i spent in the past few mths.

24 February 2004,Big Mole,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

Title (Brazil): ""Peixe Grande e Suas Histórias Maravilhosas"" (""Big Fish Abd His Wonderful Stories"")",
15 January 2005,An adventure in fantasy,"Tim Burton has completed his masterpiece. We see so much symbolism along with all the heartwarming messages. Ewan McGregor plays a man from a small town who sees a world that is so big and wants to explore and experience everything he can. Through many adventures, he finds hardship in some, but life changing experiences in all. Aside from the brilliant writing of the script, the use of color certainly boosts the viewers interest. I have watched this movie several times. Often, If I come across a friend or family member who has not seen it, I will set aside time to watch it with them to see their reaction. Everyone I have watched it with has truly enjoyed it...some more than others. But I would have to say, I recommend this film if you have not had the chance to see it.

30 January 2012,Escapism Personified,"This truly great tale follows the life of a young Edward Bloom (played by Ewan Mcgregor) growing up in the very small town of Spectre. His adventures are brought to us from a much older Edward(played by the excellent Albert Finney) as he regails his stories to his now grown up son Will Bloom, and his wife played by Marion Cotillard. As you can imagine from any Tim Burton film, the bulk of the story is set in an imaginary world filled with interestingly brilliant characters. But the centre of the story is Edward Blooms son trying to connect with his father, trying to determine fact between fiction. This film is definitely one of my all time favourites. It is a film that should be on everyones 'films to watch before you die' list. I feel with some Tim Burton films, he gets lost in trying to create these amazingly detailed worlds of his, but this film he really finds the perfect balance between the story and the setting. I would recommend that everyone watch this film, even if you are not a big fan of the actors in it, or the director himself. A perfect film to forget about your troubles, and get lost in Burton's vision of the world. I would also suggest that anyone who watches it, then listens to the song 'How i go' by the band yellowcard. Perfect song, for a near perfect film.",10
30 September 2013,The work which can enjoy two world,"This is the story that a son and a father reconciled, but is a work having the big theme, reality and the fiction.

The charm of this movie is scene constitution distributed neatly. The scene of the reality that there are flashback that is the fantasy which father Edward talks about and son William is repeated in turn. Only a story of the fantasy does not need to extremely advance. William says a story of Edward is lie and he wants him to tell about truth. However, I think; ""then what is lie? And truly what is it? "" For example, I tell a person to have watched a 2 meter-long snake yesterday. The person thinks it is lie, and it becomes the lie among the people at that point. In fact, the snake which I thought to be length of two meters was the snake which had only length measuring 1 meter. However, this is never a lie because I think that I when I tell him am a snake measuring two meters.

As for my having learned by this movie, the standard to ascertain a lie and the truth is that different by a person after all. We live by matching it with the person of the circumference.",8
21 December 2004,An inspiring and profound optimism,"In a literal culture, metaphor withers. Once in a while it bubbles up to the surface and gives us hope that something can exist free from the stifling demands of logic-bound slave of the tangible and known. A fabulous example of this occurring is Tim Burton's BIG FISH, a simple tale of one man learning that his father's being prone to exaggeration was a way the man honored ordinary greatness. The stark contrast between the hopeful fantasy life of the father and the dull real world of the son are a perfect illustration of the world where people accept the mundane without challenging it, while dismissing the ordinary as boring without ever appreciating it. The film inspires one to follow their own path with an optimism that appears earnest and simple, but is actually profound in its bottomless well of imagination.

15 January 2006,11 out of 10 !,"I'd rate this movie a 11 out of 10, only IMDb doesn't go beyond 10/10 !

Bob the Moo has reviewed this movie very well, and I feel that he's not taking proper credit for describing a movie that is, simply put, indescribably great.

I understand that this movie is based on a novel called Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions by Daniel Wallace. I haven't read the book, but I must say that director Tim Burton has done a wonderful job of picturising it. And kudos to the Writer. What a story! It had me listening and watching like a wide-eyed kid. Each and every minute of this fairy-tale was precious, and I just wish that a few more movies were like this. Hey wait a minute, there are !!! Forrest Gump for instance.

The entire movie seems dream-like, what with the fantastic occurrences and characters that slowly get woven into a beautiful yarn. Discovery. Wonder. That's what the movie is about.

The only place where I disagree with BobTheMoo is about the ending. The ending moved me, to say the least, and I doubt whether a better ending could be possible. Sure, if Edward Bloom were a real character, he just might have spun a better ending. Nonetheless, the movie finishes well.

Watch this movie. Add it to your collection. If you don't have a collection, start it with this one, and a few others. Forrest Gump, Meet Joe Black...",10
4 February 2004,A charming & witty emotional 'fishing trip',"Big Fish is a very clever, but not at all pretentious story-telling film. The reviewers that have not enjoyed or understood it reflect a need to be spoon-fed a story without room for interpreting & relating to it emotionally. How sad for those writers, and the potential audiences who have therefore passed up this wonderful film.

Hopefully Mr. Burton & other film-makers will not be deterred by the few who prefer not to think while experiencing a film, because this style is sorely missed by most of the industry & audience.

Probably not his tour-de-force masterpiece, nonetheless a beautifully made film with very touching and moving characters. The masterpiece itself is yet to come, but it is great fun to enjoy the results of the 'learning curve.' His touch is indeed unmistakable throughout this journey, yet more subtle than blatant here.

Anyone who doesn't get at least a bit choked up by the end of this story needs to have their pulse checked!",10

This movie is tender, has a marvelous story to tell; it WILL move you, will make you laugh, keep you glued to screen, will warm your heart, will make you sad, you will become a part of it and it will stay with you for quite some time afterwards. Superb acting, superb sets, superb story, equals superb movie.It has everything for the entire family; romance for the mommy, action and the witch for the kids, and the father son relationship for the dad.I think if I state that the whole movie is completely dominated by the acting of Ewan McGregor and the rest of the cast is supporting him, I don't think I may go much wrong.

16 November 2009,Excellent!,"I'm not usually a big fan of Tim Burton films but I have to congratulate him on Big Fish. Ewen McGregor was the perfect choice for this movie.

When Will's father falls ill he returns home to be with him. He wants to know how many of his father's absurd stories are true. Through story telling, flashbacks and a little investigation, Will is able to piece together the strange and wonderful life of the young Edward Bloom, played by Ewen McGregor. He finds love, adventure and even meets a giant, played by the late Mathew McGrory.

Its a wonderful story and the end is very touching. Burton's scene setting makes the movie very memorable.

6 August 2011,storytelling at its best,"Rating: 9/10

Directed by Tim Burton, Big fish revolves around a dying father, Edward Bloom, and son, Will Bloom, who tries to learn more about his father by putting together pieces of myths and stories he has been telling him from the day Will was born. Will Bloom has a rocky relationship with his dying father as he believes his father has been telling lies all his life. By reliving stories and myths Edward Bloom, told about his life, Will learns more about his father and discovers who he really is.

Big Fish is storytelling in all forms and aspects at its best: the cinematography, sound effects, special effects, the story itself, acting, and directing. Everything is beautifully put together which in the end produces one of the greatest piece of arts ever put on screen.

The acting in this film is spectacular. No one stands out in particular as this is an ensemble piece or work. Everyone brings their respective roles to life with perfection: including Ewan McGregor as the young ambitious Ed Bloom who is determined to do anything in life. Albert Finney as the old Ed Bloom who has a special talent of telling stories, Billy Crudup as Will Bloom who wants to get to know his father, Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman as Ed's soulmate. Other great performances include Helena Bonham Carter, Marion Cotillard, and Matthew McGrory.

As I said, this film is an ensemble piece of work and it wouldn't have worked if anyone in the cast doesn't deliver. Therefore, I feel like it is my responsibility to mention them all. And it doesn't end here. I believe everyone on this project deserves recognition. The writers of this film including Daniel Wallace (novel), John August (screenplay) did such a great job that I was not once bored while watching the film. And the beautiful direction of Tim Burton only made this film better.

Big Fish is divided into two main sections. One is the story that the dying Ed Bloom told about his life. And the other is the reality where Ed is dying, and Will wants to mend his relationship with his father. These two realities balance out so well that I was never bored with either one of them. I was always curious what's going to happen to the old and young Ed Bloom next. And seeing those two realities connect each other is just so fascinating. Kudos to the exceptional work the writers did in this film. It truly is beautiful.

I believe that every film has a message it is trying to send whether intentionally or not. And I'm a sucker for this kind of thing. Big Fish sends out a touching, beautiful, and meaningful message about life. That life is as boring as the people living it. If you enjoy life, you will make ordinary things extraordinary. Life is what you make of it. It will surely leave people with a smile on their face as it did on mine. You will have such a good feeling towards life in general. You will want to just get out there like Ed did and live life the way you've always wanted.

I had no problem with this film. Everything is perfect. The acting, writing, directing, score, special effects. It's beautiful. Everything is masterfully put together. I had a lot of fun with this film. I laughed a couple of times. And I cried a couple of times. It surely is one of the best films of the 2000's. Please check this film out if you haven't already.",
30 December 2003,Pure cineMAGIC,"This film is full of heart and soul and emotion. I loved it. Every single actor does an exceptional job and Burton's direction is perfect and gentle. I got choked up many times at the sweet and magical way our humanity is so beautifully portrayed. I can't wait to see it again. This story has what we need more of in the world: LOVE and MAGIC.

6 May 2004,One word Brilliant!,"I was so happy when I saw this film advertised. I love Tim Burtons work and was really looking forward to it. I entered the cinema expecting to see a funny and happy movie I did not expect to be in tears by the end! But it was one of the best films I've seen this year. I love the fact that in was fiction and non fiction. Was Ed Bloom lying or just bending the truth? I enjoyed the fact that it gave you a chance to use your own mind; the storyline is not just laid out in front of you. You have to work some things out yourself. It is enjoyable, entertaining and humorous at the same time. So if you're looking for a film that the whole family can enjoy then this is it!

3 April 2005,Never wrong about Tim Burton.,"Most people think that the acting is a little more important than directing. Well, I love Tim Burton because every time I see one of his movies, he proves other people wrong. Just like Big Fish. Every actor and actress in the movie are wondrous stars. Still, as you will -or did- notice, the acting is not the ""point"" in the movie. The story is so breath taking, so extraordinary, so dreamy that you cannot understand the fact that this unreal tale cannot be true at all.

Even though you can't see the colors Burton has always shown us in his movies, Big Fish's color correction is so precise for its genre, that it lures the audience right into its beauty of shiny, not-so-Burton color. And the editing was well placed during those leaps through past- and right into the dream world of Ed Bloom.

Tim Burton has shown us his mastership at every aspect of making a movie again. His thoughts, ideas and his weird -and full of surprises- dream world continues to create as we watch them amazed by his skill of expressing them. I can see no flaw in this movie, as I never did in any one created by his mind. Long live Tim Burton!!!",10
17 July 2015,Burton uses his amazing imagination to execute a brilliant movie,"This is my favorite Tim Burton movie. It always has been. Of course I like Batman and stuff but I think this one really shows us his imagination and how good his, well, weirdness is.

The film is about this man who's father is dying. He goes to visit him and he tries to figure out fact from fiction from all of his fathers stories of his life. The cinematography is extremely stunning and amazing. The acting is pretty much perfect from every character (especially from Ewan Mcgregor and Albert Finney). And honestly is just a heartwarming tale that I think everyone should watch at least once or even twice in their lifetime.

5 May 2022,"O Big Fish, Where Art Thou?","I recently learned that Spielberg was originally slated to direct. Which makes sense - the themes of family and adventure with a Vignette structure to Forrest Gump, which he produced. But I'm glad he didn't direct. While toned down, Burton's gothic visiual sensibilities and love for all things creepy and weird are still present, and they add a certain edge to this movie that heighten the intentionally exaggerated nature of the story. It's one of those stories about Storytelling, like Princess Bride, where you're viewing the unfolding events in two minds: as the direct viewer, and the viewer of the viewer. What am I getting out of the story, and more importantly, what are the characters listening to the story getting out of it?

11 August 2005,An film as fascinating as life itself,"This movie simply impressed me. I know it's not a good start to a commentary, but I've just been bursting to say (type) these words and can't possibly submit the comment without them.

The plot is very imaginative and the order of all the events in the movie simply has to be praised. The movie starts when Will Bloom visits his dying father one last time to get all the answers about his life from him. As his father, Edward Bloom, only told him fairy tales-and nothing but-about his life. Will is desperate to get the answers before he dies... and the answers are far more interesting than he expected.

As I said before, this movie simply impressed me. I've read the script and am trying hard to get the book written by Daniel Wallace. This is Tim Burton's finest movie, better than Edward Scissorhands and the rest. Well done, Tim! Well done Ewan! Well done whoever watched this movie! Well done whoever enjoyed it! Rating: 8/10",8
27 April 2022,It's important that tall tale's live on,"This movie mad me cry! Tim Burton did an awesome job, the sets were amazing and the story was quite heart wrenching. Ewan Mccgregor was excellent and played a southern accent very well.

18 January 2004,Truth in Fiction,"A culmination of sorts for director Tim Burton's career-long obsession with refashioning the fairy tale for modern, movie-going audiences, Big Fish is a delight. And like the quintessential tall tale of the big fish that got away, the real life of main character Edward Bloom is ultimately less important than the stories he tells.

Part fact, part fiction - perhaps not always truthful, but ultimately full of truth - Bloom's stories loosely tie Big Fish together. The basics - growing up, getting married, having a baby - are made magical and arguably, more meaningful here as Bloom (Albert Finney at his most likable) tells them. But his son, Will (Billy Crudup) feels distanced, cheated even, by his ailing Father's unwillingness to give the family the facts, and not the fantasy, of his life. And where there's fantasy, there's Burton at his best: a witch, a giant, a werewolf and even a Siamese chanteuse. All are misunderstood creatures who want nothing more than a sympathetic ear, and a life that matters. In this respect, the odd assortment of characters that populate Big Fish are no different, yet perhaps more fully formed, than Burton's Edward Scissorhands or even Ed Wood.

But the real magic of Big Fish is, oddly enough, the goofy enthusiasm of Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom. Embarking on each successive adventure with pie-eyed optimism and a sense of wonder beyond all sense and reason, McGregor adds much needed humor and a jolt of vigor to a picture that could have easily tipped the scales too heavily in the direction of absurdity or treacle. In that same vein, watch for Steve Buscemi as poet/thief/tycoon Norther Winslow - hilarious, and a nice balance to a film that is otherwise Burton's heaviest and most profound.

If Big Fish can be faulted (and it can), it is for the heavy-handedness of many of its themes. Still, Burton's tale of fathers and sons and the stories each tell to make sense of their lives is an ambitious work. It's Burton's best, and quite an achievement.",
19 January 2004,"This movie defines, One Of A Kind.","A while ago me and a few movie-buff buddies were talking movies. OK, it more like recently. And it wasn't really talking, it more like, raving. But regardless:

""Coming of Age"" movies were brought up with a reference to The Sandlot. In quote, I stated, ""Yes, The Sandlot, one of the 3 greatest 'coming of age' stories out there."" The other 2 being, The Goonies, and Stand By Me.

Just saw this movie today. Now I say: ""One of the 4 greatest...""

This movie defined 'coming of age'. It really did.

Those who say this movie, ""sucked"" or ""didn't live up to..."" are trying to compensate for the fact that they didn't understand it. Simple as that. This movie was every bit of great-ness that the trailer and critics have given it. It is a masterpiece. It is a modernized Wizard of Oz. It was, in short, perfect.

I won't dally with, ""I believe it.."", or ""I think it..."" I am going to cut to the chase. It IS perfect. Put aside your plans, play with your kids later, poker night can wait another week. Go see this. You'll be a better person for doing so.",10
11 July 2020,The best movie to watch with family or couple,"Nowadays there are very few movies like this. Nice plot, well made and intelligent scenes. It shows the way you can be a good person with principles leading you to a happy life and beutiful love story.

21 March 2009,This Is Beautiful,"This is a good family movie about relationship between father and son. It is full of magical surprise and wonderful effect. Romance and family value blended together with cute and warm imagination from the writer. For anyone who loves to watch fairy tale, i mean modern fairy tale, then this movie is for you. There will be giant, werewolf, witch, mermaid, legend, humor, twins, war and so on. I don't think someone with clever thought will hate this movie as the real tag line for this movie is ""If you know how you will die, you will know how you should live"". Beautiful and i assure you an entertaining journey of fantasy. 9 out of 10!

must be one of the few British actors who does a great American

story line on 1st viewing. Excellent cast carries this film through to

be a fine and entertaining movie.

26 December 2013,A Unique and Inriguing Picture with Way Too Many Voice Overs,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

2 January 2004,Tim Burton proves his flexibility and his softer side,"Tim Burton has proved he is not just about making noir films. The script and the story are utterly lovable. You really identify with this movie if you've ever had any disparate feelings about your dad, and wondered what he really did when he was away. Second, but most of all, the special effects enhance this story instead of upstage it. Finally have we reached the time that effects arent all about explosions and big guns. They can really help to tell this story. I highly reccomend seeing this before it leaves the big screen, because that only makes the movie that much bigger. A+

12 July 2004,Ordinary Fish Tale?,"At first I just saw the movie as really good. It entertained me while I began to wind down from a sunny summer Sunday of church, friends and bike rides. Then I began to look deeper. Just below the murky surface of the Mississippi river. I began to see more than just a grand tale. There is something fishy about this story. I began to ask myself some questions.

Do we sometimes take life a little to seriously? Do we ever leave out details that are important to save time? Is it sometimes hard to tell the whole truth? For me all these things are true. Big fish isn't just a fish story. To me, it's about loosening the firm grip on the facts and just having a good time with a story. Learning how to truely live. Making people smile. A really good tale can do all these things. You'll see... In the end. :)

8 January 2022,"Wacky maybe, but desperately sad","The movie, on face value, is a light-hearted comedy. Following Tim Burton's classic expressionist approach, the situations are exaggerated and arguably overacted, however the precise writing and the artistic set pieces take the movie to a whole new league. Tim Burton chooses to abandon his greys and blacks and opt for a saturated, almost fairground-like aesthetic. There are still, however his gothic undertones and it becomes apparent that Burton is using this movie as a vessel to share with the audience a heart-wrenching relationships between a father and his son, riddled in lies and mistrust. Though slapstick and jolly, you will be left pondering for days.

28 November 2003,Burton back to his best.,"Astonishingly original.

Messr's Wallace and August have provided Burton with a script full of warmth and just quirky enough for Burton to cut loose on. Assured direction, aided by fantastic production design from Dennis Gassner and some beautiful cinematography bring out the best of this story and its characters. At some points some characters are deliberately fantastical, the gloss serving to draw smiles ever more willingly from the enraptured audience.

That is not to say that the film is without its mischief. To my mind, one of Burtons's greatest and most defining traits is his ability to quite sharply and deliberately sidestep the proscribed path and follow it at a tangent. He was denied this opportunity by the conformist powers that be for Planet of the Apes, and the film suffered for it. This film contains some of the most delightful examples of said mischief yet, in particular the achingly funny resolution to Ewan Macgregor's confrontation with two martial arts masters in a tent. Tops the Raiders of the Lost Ark ""shoot the swordsman"" scene for sheer sight gag delight, and is especially biting in this age of wire-fu and CG super-brawls.

So people will insist on throwing hyperbole and comparisons upon this film. The hyperbole will largely be down to the relative lack of pre-release exposure for the film, and the comparisons to other films of fantasy and life stories can largely be ignored. This film is as original as any major studio release since Adaptation, and people's wish to pidgeonhole it or stand it up against films which are a mile away tonally, in content or execution might eventually be its downfall, which is a crushing shame, as it deserves so much more than that.

Burton's assurance on this film has resulted in his best of recent times, evoking memories of The Nightmare before Christmas and Edward Scissorhands, but ultimately Big Fish is far warmer than these, or indeed anything he has ever approached before. Let us hope that with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory he will continue to pick up where he left off in the early nineties.",9
16 January 2004,A great film about a father and son relationship,"I really enjoyed this film. Being the father of a young son and an occasional story-teller, like my father before me, it really hit home.

I thought it was well acted, especially by Ewan McGregor and Jessica Lange. I thought the story line to be original, though some compare it to Forest Gump, I think that would be like oranges to apples.

The tall tales envoked a fantasy setting, though with a charming down to earth style. You really wanted those stories to be true. And in the end, it was hard to tell the fact from the fiction, perhaps lost in time.

It's the story of a son who just wants to know the truth about his father and is fed up with all the tales. A no-nonsense guy who has to come to grips with the fact his father is dying, yet he has never been able to understand him or all the stories.

Wonderfully told.",
23 June 2009,Loved It!,"The first time i saw this movie, i thought, it was just a little bit too strange, i was a lot younger then. Upon watching once again, and taking note of many symbols throughout the movie, not only am i entertained by the plot, but moved by the characters. I highly recommend this movie as a family film, it's funny and tragic and beautiful. Ewan McGregor is absolutely amazing in his role, and I'm shocked he didn't win an Oscar for it. In fact, had this movie come out in a different year i think it would have won best picture. (Taking into mind that The Return of the King came out this year and pretty much took every Oscar available.) It definitely takes a chance, going pretty far out there with some of its ideas, but few movies are good if they don't take a chance. One of the few Tim Burton films i am extremely fond of. I liked most of them, love a few, but this one rises above all he's ever made. I encourage everyone to see this movie for not only its excellent visuals, but also for it's complexity and message.

14 December 2003,Booooooooo,"""I wish I was like you, easily amused"" - Kurt Cobain.

I am, again, disappointed to see nothing but praise for a movie that I very much disliked.

This movie, like the past few from Burton, is visually stunning, but that's all. The story is crap. It's not AS bad as some of the most recent failures from Tim Burton such as Planet of the Apes and Sleepy Hollow, but that doesn't make it worth watching. It's just boring.

The beef of this film is in the retelling of tall tales, none of which got more than a chuckle and a shrug from myself and the two friends I saw the movie with. It just doesn't grasp what it's reaching for. The magic is not there. It's also draaaaaaaaaaaawn out, and aimless.

The main character, Edward Bloom, is an ordinary guy who tells hugely exaggerated stories of adventures that may or may not have happened to him. And the main point is that everyone, except his son, loves Edward Bloom and wants to be around him. The problem with this is that the character is NOT loveable or even likeable. I found him mostly annoying, in fact.

I love some of Tim Burton's earlier movies like Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and Beetlejuice. I don't know what happened to him. Why can't he make good movies anymore? I hope he doesn't ruin his upcoming project, the remake of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.",
12 January 2004,It makes my Top 10 movies list.,"I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, so I'll just say that I was highly amused from beginning to end. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney were great

sharing the role of Edward Bloom, and I think they should receive consideration for Oscars for their performances. After I saw the previews for Big Fish I knew I had to go see it. I wasn't disappointed at all. We relive all these magical stories and you don't really know whether or not they're true. There are a number of times I was laughing out loud, and I wasn't really expecting this to be a

particularly funny movie. It automatically goes into my top ten list, but the reason it doesn't go straight to number one is that it almost began to drag out at the end. That, and I didn't like the actor who played the son. But I would strongly

recommend everyone go see this masterpiece.",10

24 May 2004,Big visuals and big heart,"Throughout his life, Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor) has always been a man of big appetites, enormous passions and tall tales. In his later years,(Albert Finney) however, he remains a mystery to his son, William (Billy Crudup). Now, sitting by his father's deathbed, Will is forced to get to know the real man. By piecing together a true picture of his father from flashbacks of Edward's amazing adventures, he is finally able to understand the great man that his father was. Big Fish is a movie that is as dazzling to watch as it is moving emotionally. I love how it's slightly exaggerated in certain parts and the humour is very subtle. The cinematography is fantastic, the scene when Sandra opens her window and sees Edward standing in a field of daffodils planted there just for her is just incredible. The film has a great cast of actors. Ewan McGregor is probably the best thing in the film, not just because he's basically the life of the story, but the guy can anything, any role he takes on he shines. Albert Finney is also pretty good, I love the scene when he tells Josephine about how he and Sandra met, how he sort of flirts with her at the beginning. I must admit that I'm not the biggest Tim Burton fan, although I do watch his films, most of them anyway. I think Big Fish is one of his best, it's got a bit of everything. Emotion, humour and of course the Tim Burton touch with the surreal visuals. Overall, Big Fish is one-hell-of-a good movie.",
15 December 2003,A delightful treat from the mind of Tim Burtan,"I've always been a fan of Tim Burton, he's one of the few directors who is able to put himself into his films without jeopardizing the story, that said, I have never thought of him as a great drama director, his movies are fun to watch, but you rarely have much emotion for the characters.

Well after watching Big Fish, i take that back, Tim Burtan can make an emotional drama, you care for the characters of this film, and you want to learn more about them as the films goes on. The story is great and its still got that lovable Burtan quality and feel to it.

The performances are also great, most notable Ewan MacGregor, if he doesn't get an Oscar nomination then i will finally be convinced that the academy are just a bunch of fools. He proves in Big Fish that he is one of the best actors of his generations (and he should also shut up those who were hard on him for his performance in the star wars films)

This is one of the best films of the year, and a real treat to movie goers, go see this, its a film for everyone to enjoy",10
5 September 2004,Not just another big fish story ... or is it,"Some people are big fish in a small pond, their own world of family and friends. Some people tell 'big fish' stories, the 'one that got away' and all that. Both kinds of people are Edward Bloom, the central character in the movie I saw last night, named, you guessed it, Big Fish. Previously, I was hesitant to see it. I knew the basic premise of the story and I thought it might be a bit overly sentimental even if the director was Tim Burton.

I'd heard it was good. Then I read a review by a good friend of mine, someone who's opinion I value even if I don't always agree with it. He gave the movie top marks and though didn't give much of the plot away, reminded me that Tim Burton has never made a conventionally sentimental movie in his life, to my knowledge. I had an email from a woman I have known since school and we made plans to see it since she hadn't seen it yet either. When we left the theatre last night, we were both very moved by the words spoken by the narrator at the ending but she did comment that she wasn't sure if she loved the movie, or hated it. I said, wait awhile, I think it needs to sink in.

I was right.

The movie is about Edward Bloom, now dying of cancer, and the efforts of his son who is trying to reconcile the man he doesn't seem to know very well with the man he wants his father to be. Edward Bloom tells stories. He tells exaggerated stories and spins fantastical, hardly believable tales about things that happened to him in his life. His son, William, is about to become a father himself and has been estranged from his dad for several years, embarrassed and frustrated by his father's stories, or, 'lies' as he sees them. His father was away a lot while his son was growing up which further aggravated the resentment William has always felt.

The stories are told in flashback, with Ewan MacGregor playing the younger Edward Bloom, played in the present by the wonderful Albert Finney. Jessica Lange plays the love of Edward's life, Sandra and Marion Cotillard plays Josephine, William's wife who provides a buffer between them, guiding William to his discoveries of his father's life and personality. All the actors they cast to play various younger versions of the adult characters look eerily like their grownup parts, I found, which made for great continuity.

It ended much as I expected but I won't spoil it, a fine mix of fantasy and truth. The flashbacks, the tall tales and characters that inhabit them, are wonderfully quirky. The scene that had me dangerously close to being unable to stop giggling involved two Chinese soldiers and a pair of night goggles. The love between Edward and Sandra was touching, evident even as Edward's life was ending. I imagine that William's childhood was further affected by the devotion between his parents that might have shut him out a bit.

The ending had us both in tears and if you have a father or relative that loves to tell stories, stories which become family legend, you will understand. The movie is classic Tim Burton who saves it from being overly sentimental with his off center sense of humour and classic Tim touches of the macabre at times. Is it weird? Sometimes, but you will enjoy it. Just sit back and let it carry you away and enjoy the ride.",
17 January 2004,2nd Best Movie of the Year,"If there had to be a feel good movie of the year, Big Fish would be that movie. This emotional rollercoaster of a film is a delightful fantasy about the adventures of a man(Ewan McGregor/Albert Finney), as told through the bed time stories he would tell his son (Bill Crudup). As the son grows up his belief in his father's tales fades. His father remains steadfast to his stories as truth and a rift is formed between the two. This rift is only reborn when they meet again as the father is dying of cancer. As both the story and the father's tales progress, his son discovers just how true his father's stories actually were. All the performances in this film are very good and Burton hits a homerun with the cinematography and music use as well. It truly is a touching story and is good for any sort of movie fan. i personally think it is just slightly better than Cold Mountain, but not as impressive as ROTK. Big Fish is a fantastic film and one of the year's best.

9 March 2004,Fine visual fantasy in allegory of men's emotions.,"Sometimes in your life, you remember a person for their life and sometimes you remember them for the stories about their life. There may be a little gap between the facts of their life, and there may be a yawning chasm, so you have to look at the person and the situation, and figure out if there's a big difference, and if it matters.

That's what is going on in Big Fish, the latest from the creator of the first Batman movie, Edward Scissorshands, Sleepy Hollow and the Planet of the Apes (2001).

Ed Bloom (Albert Finney as the mature Ed) is a tall-tale yarn spinner who has a favorite story about the big one that he caught, and then threw back. He's gotten through life quite well with a wink and a tale and a lot of hard work, and he's loved every minute of it. I agree with him, life's too short to not enjoy, and if it needs a bit of embellishment to get the joy out, then go with it.

Will (Billy Crudup) is his son, who feels that his dad is forever hiding behind the tale of the fish, and wants to get behind the story and get to know the real man who is his father. Will's a wire service journalist in Paris, and luckily he's married to a French woman Josephine (Marion Cotillard), who loves a story and a sentimental person full of love. On his own, Will would be too pragmatic for his own good, and would stay angry with him as he lay dying. Josephine melts the ice of resentment between father and son, and Will gives his father the love that the man has always sought from him.

There is lots of sentiment played out in the story, and fantasies of allegory are all around, as the reality of the relationships is defined by the relationships in dad's world. Along with the allegory, we get sentiment. Altogether, it's a heady story, and seems to sweep me along in waves of loving emotion. Ed Bloom is a man who loved with all his heart, but didn't say `I love you' easily. Instead, he made up a story that included a person in allegory, that was his way of paying homage.

In the end, everyone pays homage to him back, as he returns to his story, now to become the central figure for the first time. Along the way, he reveals that his big fish story was allegory for people close to home, and that he let things happen in a very complex way, with his simple love of people.

Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

30 June 2005,Enjoyed it,"Not usually a Tim Burton fan, although I can never really complain. I thought the Big Fish was original and told a warm story that will connect with anyone who has loved a parent as any child does and then lost them.

Big Fish will remain with me for a very long time- a true keeper.

Now, if we could get Follywood to endorse/produce similar art, then perhaps their movie attendance would creep back up.

(Apologies for the soap box)

2 September 2005,Just GREAT!,"It's good when you expect something from a movie(or something else)and it turns out it's classes above your expectations.""Big Fish"" is the perfect example! It's good to know there is something more in today's Hollywood productions,that not includes really GOOD guys,really BAD guys,a plan to destroy and then another to save the world...everything that BLOCKBUSTER stands for..... ""Big Fish"" is unconventional story about ordinary people.But when you see the name ""Tim Burton"" you just know it won't be another boring or dull film,trying to ""catch"" you with A-list celebs and special FX. Instead you'll see something you have never imagine to see on the big screen.A film filled with metaphor,original vision,a real relationships! It's hard to get even a tiny bit of those three in most of the movies these days! The most valuable thing in the movie is the ""things beneath the things"". The messages you'll get while watching-the magic of life,the worth of existence. What more can I say?!This is a movie you'll remember!!!

10 June 2006,Beautiful but too corny at times.,"""Big Fish"", as most people know, is a Tim Burton film. Tim Burton proved himself a great director with movies like ""Edward Scissorhands"" and the recent ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". So when I sat down to watch ""Big Fish"", I expected magical and enchanting characters to float out of my screen and set my imagination off to a different planet. But it seriously disappointed me and here's why.

The movie is about William Bloom (Billy Crudup), a married man with a baby on the way, who finds out that his father, Edward (Albert Finney), is dying. He returns home to see him as he feels very distant from his father and wants to reconnect with him before he dies. The reason he is so distant from his father is because his dad is always telling exaggerated stories of his magical past and William doesn't appreciate the fact that his dad can't be normal and serious like everyone else. (I know, what an idiot.) Most of the movie shows us Edward Bloom's wonderful tales, with Ewan McGregor acting as young Edward (with a Southern accent!). So the story is basically about William Bloom trying to decode his father's complicated past. What he's really trying to do though, subconsciously, is to prove his father wrong about his ""made-up"" past, so that he can rightfully accuse his father of being a liar since everything he ever said was just triggered by his wild imagination.

So that's my first negative point. I hated the concept of getting all teary-eyed over a guy who can't connect with his dad. Alright, so it's nice to have an old man tell stories of his past but why add on tasteless, corny sequences of sons and fathers fighting and not talking for three years and then meeting in a hospital as the father is dying and etc., etc.!? WHY RUIN SUCH A (potentially) WONDERFUL MOVIE? The magical characters of Edward Bloom's stories were all amazing, though. Danny Devito played an eccentric circus owner while they got a real-life giant man to play the Giant in the movie. Also, Danny Elfman was great with the music as usual and Burton did an *ASTOUNDING* job with the visual effects. The only thing that TOTALLY ruined the movie for me was the corny Hollywood plot. But two thumbs up, to quote my fellow reviewers Siskel & Ebert, for everything else, especially the casting.",7
11 January 2004,The first movie to make me cry since Forrest Gump,"It was simply a wonderful film. The movie really could have been directed by anyone, but the Burton touches were nice. I recommend seeing this movie immediately! Another interesting thing is the fact that Elfman did the soundtrack but it doesn't sound like him.

30 January 2004,Stays with you even after you leave the theater,"There are many movies that you watch, enjoy, and then think about for only a short time after leaving the theater. Big Fish is not one of those. This movie stays with you for a long, long time after viewing; and the more you think about it the more you like it.

The basis of the film is that Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) has been told tall tales all his life by his father, Ed Bloom (Albert Finney/Ewan McGregor), that he eventually believes to be fictitious. The result is that the two men do not speak to each other for over three years until Ed is diagnosed with cancer and is on his deathbed. Will Bloom feels that he doesn't know his true father, and he begins to search for his father's true self. As he does so, he realizes that not every story his father has told him is untrue, and the result is that he comes to understand his father more than he dreamed possible.

I can't find any criticism in any main aspects of this film: the plot and characters were well developed, the acting was superb, the sets and costumes were visually breathtaking, the score was subtle yet strong, and the sound/lighting/cinematography/you-name-it was all good as well.

Perhaps what I liked best though was the way that the overall story line was developed. This truly was not like most movies you see these days. The story develops gradually, and the viewer really doesn't have any idea what any of what they are seeing means or why it has significance until the end (and I will say absolutely nothing about the ending since it is, in my opinion, one of Hollywood's finest endings). The last ten or so minutes wrap up the film so nicely that everything makes sense, but the viewer is left to interpret so much on their own... which is a good thing. I haven't been able to stop thinking about everything since I left the theater, and my friends who have seen it and I all have a good time comparing our own perspectives.

If you haven't seen this film already, go see it. It's definitely worth it. You'll come out of the theater having a better understanding of your parents and you'll see a little more fantasy in everyday reality.",10
6 March 2015,Big Fish In A Small Pond!,"Owning so many movies of different genres, I always find it difficult to choose something to watch. I was looking for something to enjoy on a Thursday afternoon having nothing on my agenda due to work being called off. I am a fan of Ewan Mcgregor & also Albert Finney. Brilliant character portrayal by both. Without talking about the movie too much, It has elements that make for wonderful viewing. It Captures the imagination of Children AND Adults with the vivid story telling and re-enactments. All in all, with the Father/Son relationship, A man's journey, elaborate ""Tall Tales"" & the mystery behind it all, this thought provoking movie is definitely worth the watch and maybe another...

25 September 2006,Big fish.....Big movie!!!!,"This movie is just great. A fairytale with strange characters and a great story. I must say, stories. Because this movie will present you different stories, beautiful directed by Tim Burton. Well acted and visually very strong. I wasn't impressed by ""planet of the apes"" and ""Edward Scissorhand"" but with ""Big Fish"" Tim Burton has a new fan on his side. I just loved it. Not the mainstream pulp that is coming to us every week on DVD or in the theater! No, a beautiful touching movie full of laughs and tears. A story about a son trying to learn more about his dying father by reliving stories and myths his father told him about himself. I'm will not waste any more time for you. So go....run to you local videostore and rent it. You won't be disappointed! I promise you! Have fun, enjoy!

29 December 2005,Imaginative and Fresh,"I have to preface this entire post by saying that I am NOT a big fan of Tim Burton. I don't think he ever does ANYTHING new.

For goodness sakes, the man has had Danny Elfman compose the scores for ALL of his movies, and recycles half of his cast from movie to movie! With the aforementioned disclosure off of my chest, I have to say that this was an unexpectedly fantastic movie! The concept was fresh, the storytelling was genius, and this vehicle lends itself perfectly to Burton's style.

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with an adult (read MATURE) mindset.

4 January 2004,Not a traditional Tim Burton movie but still works very well,"The week before watching Big Fish, I watched Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas. Both have a more twisted aspect that make the movies absolutely thrilling to watch. Big Fish had a totally different approach.

In a year of remakes and sequels, Big Fish stands out as one of the most original movies around. We follow Will Bloom, son of Ed Bloom, and his journey to figure out who his father really is before Ed dies. In order to do so, he must look into the tall tales Ed told him to find the truth behind it all.

The movie is spectacular with awesome film work, lively tales, and many fun characters to look out for. The final revelation at the end is very moving. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has a sense of adventure (or, like Will, is looking for one).

26 January 2004,An incredible journey through a man's memories,"This wonderful movie takes us on a journey of a man's life and through all of wondeful memories. Between a wondeful cast, brilliant directing, and an exciting screen play, this masterpiece leaves you ready to watch it again. It tells the story of a man who's father is very ill, a father who he has lost connection to. How much of his wonderful stories are acutally true and how much has been made up or exaggerated? The big question is: does it matter? DEFINATELY GO SEE IT!

10 January 2004,Mad Crisp Dream,"Big Fish is a good flick. It's seems to me to be Forrest Gump meets Pee Wee's Big Adventure or rather Big Top Pee Wee considering the amount of circus involved. THis movie struck a chord with me because I had a father like Ed Bloom which made the ending for me pretty touching. Albert Finney and Ewan Mcgreegor were awesome in it and Billy Crudup despite critics bashes kiscked ass as well. The only thing i didn't love was that I was a expecting a surprise ending but I got an emotional one.

13 June 2004,Tim Burtons Greatest,"Before seeing this film I was decidedly underwhelmed by Burtons recent output. Certainly Sleepy Hollow had a surreal charm, but overall it lacked a spark and some sections of the plot were deeply cliched.

Planet of the Apes was a disaster, and Burtons previous films seemed but a thing of the past.

Then I saw this, and I adored it for so many reasons.

1) Albert Finney/Ewan Mcgregor - Put together fine performances that complement one another, one the idealistic young man out to face the unknown world outside the perfect small town. The other, an aged, dying man forced to come to terms with his almost non-existant relationship with his son.

2) Danny Elfman - Back with a vengance after the boring sounds of Spiderman and Hulk, Elfman has always found a great collaborator in Burton and here is no exception.

3) The ending - Up with my top ten endings of all time. There is no way I shall spoil this for anyone who hasn't seen the film, but it is worth your time and effort JUST to watch these last ten minutes or so. They are among the greatest ten minutes committed to film.

In short, this is among my favourite films now, maybe not top ten material...(except the ending)...but still well worth watching. Especially if you are a fan of Tim Burtons...",9
11 June 2004,Emotionally and visually beautiful,"Tim Burton has been making visually striking films for years and over the course of his career has developed a huge fan base for his eclectic film making and unique style. However following the widely criticized ""Planet of the Apes"" re-make, people have wondered whether Burton had lost his edge and given in to studio pressure. Well fans can rest easy as ""Big Fish"" is a remarkable return to form. Often criticized for concentrating on visuals rather than storytelling (although I'm sure ""Ed Wood"" demonstrates a fantastic marriage of both) ""Big Fish"" not only has a touching human story at it's core, but supplies the material for some of Burtons most beautiful visuals so far. Edward Bloom (Old: Albert Finney, Young: Ewan McGregor) has told the story of his life with a mixture of truth and ""amusing lies"". His stories entertain and endear him to everyone he meets, save for his son who has not spoken to him for years. However as he lies dying of cancer, his son returns home to try and discover the truth of his fathers life. It is through Edwards conversations with other characters that we are treated to his tall tales. The stories, ranging from Edwards short lived circus career to his adventures as a traveling salesman, treat the viewer to a group of beautifully realized characters brought to life by a fantastic ensemble cast such as Danny Devito, Steve Buscemi, Alison Lohman, Helena Bonham Carter, Billy Cruddup. However for me the two best performances come from Albert Finney who has more than enough charm and charisma as the old Edward, and Jessica Lange as his wife. Their chemistry is great and you never doubt their love.However I found the whole cast to be spot on as were the visuals. While the story is told, Edwards embellishments mean Burton can still display his trademark Gothic visuals (the witch, the introduction to the giant), but now also creates sun kissed beautiful images (the town of Spectre, the car underwater). So while this film is not as dark as previous efforts, it is no less beautiful. Long time collaborator Danny Elfmans score is uplifting and one of the most distinctive of the past year and the special effects spot on serving only to compliment the story.

Some may find this films irregular narrative difficult or simply not appreciate the eccentricities of the film. However if you enjoyed Burtons work such as Edward Scissorhands or Ed Wood, you'll find a hugely enjoyable film just as great on repeat viewings.",8
7 July 2022,Delightful,"I loved this tale. My wife... not so much. The only complaint is that some of the tales dragged on a bit. Lots of very funny bits. A good lesson on being positive.

9 January 2004,9/10--A Breath of Fresh Air,"It's too bad some people don't like this movie. With the attention span some people have nowadays if there isn't an explosion or nude scene every 5 minutes they lose interest.

This movie was great. Albert Finney (the older Bloom) was superb and makes me wish he was my father. It would be great to have a relative with such a vivid imagination and rich life. It's the kind of film you need to watch a few times to see the connectedness of the different parts. I loved it.

2 January 2004,"better than ""just the facts""","Tonight I went to Tim Burton's latest film, Big Fish. I highly recommend seeing this movie.

The film is masterful storytelling - masterful in the way the Bible is, or the ancient historian Herodotus. Most people today would never accept Herodotus as a historian, but those are the people I would especially like to have sitting in front of Big Fish. Story is not something less than the facts, it is something more.

I began counting the number of homilies that could be drawn from the movie - and I stopped counting at 15. This is a movie with some wisdom in it.

The acting was brilliant... with the exception of one brief moment by Billy Crudup in the first ten minutes, and this was completely excusable because of the brilliance of the rest of the film. And probably the weak moment was due to a momentary slip in the editing room.

Visually, the movie was stunning, as one might expect from a Burton film. I was particularly interested in the way the movie depicted the human body, and the couple of ""nude scenes"" that will inevitably make some Christians uncomfortable. I count this movie among the few I have ever seen that included nudity in a non-violating way for both the actors & audience. Later this month, I will begin presenting a 15-week series on John Paul II's TOB (Theology of the Body) at Family Theater in Hollywood, and I will definitely be citing this film as an example of several TOB themes.

I left the theater wondering why I plan to become a screenwriter, when I know that - even if something I write makes it to the screen someday - nothing I create will reach the level of artistry I witnessed in this film. I guess I will just stick to the maxim (from Chesterton? or Eliot?) that if a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly.

At any rate, this movie has my highest recommendation.",10
11 January 2004,"A Magical, Mesmerizing and Moving Masterpiece!","The greatest movie I've ever seen! Big Fish will have you laughing, whooping, clapping and, at times, crying through a tremendous grin on your face. It's poignant, funny, romantic, and inspirational at every turn.

Big Fish is a Tim Burton film that doesn't constantly remind you it's a Tim Burton film. Possessing the brilliance of Burton's ability to create pure magic, it also draws you into a very real place--your own heart. You believe these characters, you *know* these characters. Edward Bloom (young) is the eager kid we all once were--full of promise and aspiration. Edward Bloom (old) is the person we all aspire to become--loving and loved, a man who lives with no regrets...and the best darn story-teller to ever draw a breath of life.

This film is splendidly written, acted and directed. A must-see for everyone! As soon as the end credits rolled, I was ready to watch the next showing.

29 December 2003,Enthralling and Awe Inspiring,"This movie was everything I thought it could have been and more. Although Tim Burton does have a reputation for being somewhat strange, he fit this offbeat film perfectly. Ewen MacGregor had an outstanding performance, and was completely believable. I also loved the way you could see the old and young Edward Bloom believeably are the same person. Albert Finney and Billy Crudup both put on great performances and I was a big fan of the somewhat realistic special affects, that left the viewer to decide whether what happened was real or not. I felt this was an overall great film that kept me interested until the very last frame.

31 May 2004,All Tim Burton,"I always like Tim Burton's work, and this film is no exception. He has a darker vision than most directors and a strong grasp of the just-over-the edge life, plus some humor about it. Big Fish is nearly allegorical in it's structure and narrative, and for the most part I appreciate the obvious effort at FILM MAKING, but despite the strong directing and generally very good acting, this film didn't really satisfy. This is a good film, but not in the same league as Edward ScissorHands or Beetlejuice. All in all this film seems more commercial than some of his other work, and I guess I'd like to see him do something with less playfulness and more edginess next time. Burton unleashed would make a great film.

14 January 2004,Sentimental drivel about the stupid white man with the big heart.,"Painfully sentimental, this vapid tripe pays homage to Fellini via circus freaks and surreal worlds. The meaningless storyteller redeemed by his stories is a great theme but this film fails to put it to good use. If you liked Forrest Gump you'll like this. The heroic American white male rules despite his inadequacies. The armed bank robbery scene is uniquely warm and fuzzy.

22 December 2004,"Great Acting, Great Mini Stories, Never Ending","I thought the movie had great characters and everyone performed well. The characters were all unique and had a mystical era to them. After the first few characters were introduced I was interested in who Mr. Bloom would meet next.

I liked the mini-stories, but I fealt like they caused the film to go on and on. There wasn't ever a real climax. This seemed to make the movie drag and you couldn't tell when it was coming to an end.

I was a little disappointed with the music because lots of it was derived from ""Edward Scissorhands."" Music helps make the mood of the movie. The music fits to it, but when I hear it, it reminds me of Edward Scissorhands, which isn't Big Fish. I thought it should have had its own original music.

12 May 2007,A Tim Burton Masterpiece,"My current personal favorite movie of all time. You either get Tim Burton or you don't. If you ""get"" him, then this is a must see. If you don't ""get"" him, watch it anyway, you might enjoy. Not as dark as most of his flicks and great performances by just about everybody involved. Very funny and very moving at the same time. Ewan McGregor was especially good. After seeing him previously in only his Star War flicks and several other films, I was not particularly impressed with his acting. This film gave him a chance to show his true ability. Would like to see him team with Burton again. Steve Buscemi's performance was also impressive, as usual.

9 February 2014,a tall but magnificent tale !,"'Big Fish' is like taking a trip to the circus where fact and fiction are molded into a reality which most viewers will thoroughly enjoy.It has shades of 'Forrest Gump' in it(how every scene jumps from one place to another) and shares much of its brilliance.

But behind all the adventure is a very heartwarming story of an ailing father and his son. It is a picture for everyone but more so for those who have ever felt estranged from their own parent(s).This movie alone is great but anyone who can emotionally connect with it will find a personal place in their heart for Tim Burtons finest film.

An easy 8/10

16 March 2004,Something`s missing...,"This Tim Burton`s realization had to be one of the better in a film production in 2003. Gathered an excellent actors crew, Burton was reached the goal, concerning their particularly roles were convincing. Albert Finney is so good, perfect. Ewan McGregor shows some new, very cute moments in his mimics and body movements. Very good, Ewan! I`m also happy that I can say that Helena Bonham Carter is the one of best actress nowadays, though in The Big Fish she just confirmed my earlier opinion of her good acting. The movie is technical correct, music is fine, the fabula is interesting, but something is missing. For, through all of those blooming colors, small fine details, Will Bloom`s (Billy Crudup) searching for the reality in his fathers stories, I did not find any of development, neither deeper devotion to the main issue, nor the point which could to endure such a quantity of varies scenes, placed in the different times and places, yet not to be faded away, even quashed. It`s a pity, for it could be a great film.

22 March 2004,An excellent movie,"Big Fish was an excellent movie. I came close to crying, which I rarely do at movies. The movie is kind of similar to Forrest Gump-only this time ""Forrest"" is a dying man and the ""person on the bench"" is his son. The dying man tells his life story, which is very make-believe, to his son, who does not seem to believe them. The film has awesome cinematography and acting and should be on your don't miss list. It has a good but somewhat predictable ending. It is a good family movie even hough it is rated PG-13. I highly recommend it. 8/10 stars

12 August 2005,Fantasy of fairy-tail proportions.,"Big Fish. A fantastic modern-day fairy-tail. The story, told mostly in flashback, about Ed Bloom (Albert Finney), an ageing father whose whimsical, though unbelievable, stories about his younger years are told to entertain at various celebrations, much to the chagrin of his son, Will Bloom (Billy Crudup). The stories tell of young Ed (Ewan McGregor) leaving his home town taking a much feared giant, Karl,(Matthew McGrory) with him. Intertwined with the current-day situation between Father and Son, the young Ed Bloom goes on to meet various interesting characters, that nicely dovetails into the ending of the movie. Both funny and touching, this movie is a must-see for everyone. 10/10.

9 March 2014,Amazing Movie!,"This is a great and very under appreciated movie about a guy who doesn't believe his dad's various ""tall tales"" or ""big fish stories""... he decided to leave his little town for some adventure. He falls in love and then suddenly, problems with falling in love are romanticized come by the bucket loads and he learns all about his and all of our human shortcomings as well as the shortcomings of his dad with his tall tales and his own especially for not believing anything his dad told him or believing IN him enough. Most of all this movie is about love and the nature of love with one's parents/dad or children or the man or woman you meet and choose to spend your life with.

1 April 2023,Is it just me or everyone is crying,"Ok i should tell you I'm a callous boy and it's the end of movie yet I'm crying like a little girl and I don't know why. It's not a sad story but i guess everything about this film is so beautiful that makes me cry.

So if you are at home and feeling blue and need something to trigger you to empty yourself, i definitely recommend you to watch this movie by yourself. I assure you you will not regret it.

It's the story of a men's life since the beginning of it and the trouble he's having with his son and how they came through with it at the end.

I can definitely say this is my favourite Tim Burton's movie among all of his films.

19 January 2004,Tall tales but true....,"I loved this film. Reminds me of how my own father tells stories with slight embellishments (and we're all guilty of it at some time or another) that make a story more exciting, but also makes me think how much of it is probably true. A delight that will be enjoyed by all.

26 December 2005,Nowhere near as magical as the book.,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

23 November 2020,"When Fantasy, Drama, and Adventure Collide","To begin with, this film brings laughter, joy, and inspiration to the viewers. I love how it was mixed with drama, fantasy, and a little bit of comedy which turned out to be a great combination. Burton switched up his signature trademarks in his past films to do something unique for this, which is cool. A great film for all!

31 May 2007,very creative story,"I don't know what was true and what wasn't true, but it was very charming and sweet. The main part of the story was a son learning to trust and love his father--as eccentric as he seemed.

Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney both played Edward Bloom with a great deal of charm. Ewan played young Edward Bloom, and it was almost as if he were a part of some grand fairy tale--as is tradition with Tim Burton. Albert Finney played older Edward Bloom, and he showed again his limitless power and charisma.

Helena Bonham Carter was both a young woman in love, and an old witch in this film. Her role, although memorable, was confusing to me. She meets Edward as a girl, meets him again as a young woman, and then becomes the witch that he had met as a boy. I don't get it. But it doesn't matter. I don't get cartoons either, but I still enjoy them.

Note to Tim Burton: I could seriously have done WITHOUT Danny DeVito's naked butt. But thanks for the charming story.",7
9 January 2004,Brilliance...I wish I was Edward Bloom,"Big Fish was just one of the most unbelievable films of the year. I absolutely love Return of the King, I am a LOTR nut, but I have to admit, Big Fish was just as good. It was just a purely amazing experience, touching every part of a person. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are by far the best acting duo of the year, spectacular, and Billy Crudup is also just wonderful. The whole cast is amazing, and Burton for once matches his style with substance, a whole world of substance. Not to say the visuals weren't pleasing, it was classic Burton, however it is my favorite Burton flick of all time because it amazed my eyes with the visual brilliance, while still touching my heart with the simple story of a man, his son, and his life. The ending will forever stick with me, in short...I wish I was Edward Bloom. What a man he was.

10 out of 10, one of two this year for me.

17 January 2004,One of the Years Best,"This is by far Tim Burton's best work. It gets you involved in a character more than any other film this year did. The story was also unique as much as the end was unpredictable, which is hard to do if a director follows conventions. My hat is off to Mr. Burton, may the oscar gods smile favorably in his direction.

19 January 2004,Altogether a wonderful film,"I was biased towards this film by my love of the combo of Tim Burton's films and Danny Elfman's music, but I've been recently disappointed. I went to see Big Fish with little expectation and came out greatly rewarded by this ultimately simple story with beautiful music and ""wallpaper"".

That said, I believe there was some bad acting (with the exception of Ewan McGregor, who played a wonderful part) and some awkward dialogue, but while this took away from the story somewhat, Big Fish was still a great viewing experience.

The point of this story, without giving away anything, is that life is ultimately as beautiful and grand as we choose to make it, that we make our own immortality, if not through our actions then our words. Any one who has loved Burton's films in the past won't be disappointed.

7 February 2004,One of the movies that you have to see to judge,"Mind you, I like movies that leave me with the urge to find out more and to analyze. I spent countless hours reading and reflecting on Mulholland Drive and Momento (and enjoy doing it!). This isn't one of those movies. I started out thinking it but realized very quickly that I don't care to figure it out. The truth is all there but it's not that important, really. I think it was a wonderful movie. Some people won't ""get it"", but then again, how can a movie be that great if it's designed to please everyone? Tim Burton has created a movie that speaks to people with a unique attitude about life, and I for one enjoyed it, from deep deep down my gut. Once you put aside wanting to figure out what's real and what's not, it's superb entertainment with great stories (I'm a sucker for good stories), great acting (I'm a sucker for MacGregor, Bonham-Carter, Buscemi) and wonderful imagery. It's a love story between a father and a son (along with a love story between men and women), and I have yet to see many movies that can handle this topic with such delicacy, humour and caring devotion.

23 December 2003,Beautiful and moving,"This is an absolutely amazing, beautiful film.It was the most highly anticipated movie for me this year and it fulfilled my expectations to the fullest, although I prefer the ending of the D. Wallace novel better, as it is more liberating and open to everyone's imagination.Burton's direction is one of his best, so is the wonderful Pearl Jam song, Elfman's music and the cast's performances.MacGregor is a true star, Lange is absolutely lovely and the great Finney has little to do but it does it perfectly!I just hope the Academy and the rest of the lot will appreciate this fine film as well.

12 January 2004,*sniffle* what a great movie,"`Big Fish,' stars Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, and Billy Crudup with Danny Devito in a smaller role. In this crazy movie about Will Bloom, Crudup, who tries to learn more about his dying father Edward Bloom, Finney. The story is told through tall tales of him as a boy to a man, played by McGregor, filled with witches, giants, and towns where no one wears shoes. Through all of this, Crudup begins to understand about who his father really is and accept what kind of person he is. The way the film was presented was magical, and the imagination took over as he wove wilder and wilder tales. The potency of what he was communicating to the audience was huge. He was really stressing the fact that it was good to stand out and make a difference. In one part of the film, young Edward Bloom explains that he is like a goldfish in that they grow if they have a bigger space, so therefore he would go out into the world and grow also. McGregor as him as a younger man is a joy to watch onscreen as he has such a positive outlook on life. He already knows how he is going to die so he is fearless and takes the path less traveled by. Whenever he gets scared he realizes that he will be fine because this is not the way he saw himself go.

Crudup as Will Bloom is really quite a foil to him as he is very logical and he feels like he has been lied to all his life. He doesn't understand why his father can not just tell him what actually happened, instead of telling elaborate stories that he has heard a thousand times and doesn't believe. He could have come off as stiff or boring but instead he just tries to grasp what really happened because it is hard for him to understand his father as he does not function on the same level. Finney as Edward Bloom as him today is a kid at heart who really enjoys life to the fullest and has a unique outlook on life. He is a story teller and loves to tell stories about his life that are only part truths but he revels in the telling and really needs listeners to hear his great epic tales. Critics are calling `Big Fish' one of the best films of the year, and with four Golden Globe nominations it is sure to be an Oscar contender as well. Tim Burton, the acclaimed director of `Edward Sissorhands,' directs `Big Fish.'

i wrote this article for my high school news paper so i thought i might as well post it here too!",
3 February 2004,It's a wonderful film,"I was a bit concerned about what I was about to see when I found myself surrounded by children when I went to see this at the weekend...a Tim Burton kids' film?!!! But in the end, I was overjoyed at the work I saw on the screen, and I can't help wandering what those poor kids were thinking.

Despite the adverts, this is not a piece of whimsical storytelling. This is a story about the part stories play in helping us through the dull details of reality, and how magic can be found in a story we have heard a thousand times, but never really listened to.

In this film, Burton has finally found the right blend of vision and plot, allowing his characters to breathe as fully-developed people, whether they are the family doctor or a giant in a cave. And this means that you care not only about what happens in Edward Bloom's (Finney & McGregor) tall stories, but in his relationships with his more mundane family. This is also aided by the sterling work shown by all the cast.

This is a perfect film, presenting us with a vision of life full of breadth but at the same time, always striving to be that little bit more colourful.",10
19 January 2004,How could you not enjoy this movie?,"""Big Fish"" is a wonderfully made film. It's almost impossible to not have liked this movie. It has everything. The thing I liked most was the great amount of romance that could be felt throughout the movie. The tales that were told were very entertaining and I couldn't wait to hear the next one. Tim Burton knew what he was doing when he made this film.

4 March 2013,The Story of a Lifetime,"So i bought this movie expecting greatness and what i got was greatness with a moral message tucked hidden inside. At first the movie was nothing special...but then it hit me. Big fish is truly a remarkable story that everyone should experience. It shows that one mans elaborate story might seem like a lie but in actuality is a piece of gold that if looked at it through the eyes of the beholder can provide a wondrous spectacle. The values this story displays are fantastic and should be spread about the world. Tim Burton has truly conjured up a heartwarming movie that will bring you to tears and in my eyes is considered a dazzling master piece of originality and moral fiber.

It is like a fairy tale and dream film. I don't understand between start and finish time how it's passing. I don' think, in this film, which is so smooth tale, is not possible to get bored.

20 February 2004,Great comeback,"Tim Burton's big comeback.

The stories are entertaining on their own, and the first few stories did stand independently from the rest of the plot (present and past) in my mind. But as the characters developed more in the present, the stories of the past carried more meaning for me and tied the emotions felt by the young Ed Bloom to those of the old, sick man in the bed. That's what's important, and that's what I took away from this movie; the stories conveyed the same emotions with added grandeur in their deliveries and made me realize how much life meant to the characters.

Best movie I've seen in a long time.

From 1990, with Edward Scissorhands, Tim Burton as been improving his technique so that he can create in a movie what seems like a strange and amasingly beautiful inner world, which he carries around with him. His films have been fabulous, each one in its genre, but Big Fish is in fact his best work ever, the most moving, the most beautiful and the most seductive ever. Don't miss it.

10 July 2006,Big Fish an Excellent Movie...and that's no Tall Tale!,"Tim Burton has done it again. He is such an amazing director. One of the reasons he is so amazing is the creativity and originality his movies have. And this is the most creative, original movie of the 21st century. The concept to this movie is brilliant and Burton takes that concept and turns it into one of the best movies I've ever seen.

I think one of the reasons this movie draws us in so much is that we can all relate to some level with it. We all use hyperbole to exaggerate the truth, but it doesn't change the fact that there is a depth of it which is true.

Also, the acting in this movie is superb.

If you're looking for something different from the remakes and same old ideas, this is the movie for you. I could watch this every day and still not get bored of the story...it's that good.",9

27 January 2004,Deeper water for a big fish,"This film is quirky. I love quirky, but I caution those who don't to be aware.

Big Fish is flagrantly whimsical, balanced with the very serious human drama of the end of a life full of love, though he is somewhat misunderstood. Albert Finney is fantastic and Jessica Lange is truly stunning. I was amazed at how well cast was Alison Lohman to portray the younger Sandra Bloom. Ewan McGregor seemed at first an odd cast, however I thought he was wonderful, romantic and perfectly ""comic"" in his ""perfectionism.""

Tim Burton really has struck a certain chord with this film that will be appreciated by most, though not all. And there is no shame in that! A 9 of 10.

Based a the novel written by Daniel Wallace, ""Big Fish"" is a great story about a man ,Ed Bloom, who tells many people stories of his ""fairy tallish"" life, and how he and his son , William become estranged due to the son growing weary of his father's ""tall tales"". When the Ed becomes sick his son William comes to his father while he is on his, what might be, his last days to life. William soon finds out that he's father's stories weren't as fake as he thought.

With an excellent cast, featuring Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Helena Bonham Carter, and Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito, and others that I did not mention, this movie becomes one of the best the movies of the year. The great acting by Crudup and Finney makes it feel that they are not fictional characters, but real life father and son. The other acting performances are nice and exquisite, and the dialogue is nice and fresh. This movie is always full of symbolism, and a lot that I probably can't figure out on my own. This wonderful film also had a good amount of scenes that had the audience, and me, laughing, without crude humor.

I believe that this film will stand the test of time, and I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to watch movies.

20 April 2017,Best film ever,"This is my favorite film ever, every aspect of the movie is so great that I can watch it over and over for the rest of my life.

I love the story and the ending is so (un)expected, you can catch a tear dropping on your cheek without even realize before, it's so beautiful, you feel so in touch with the main character and forget everything, just dive into the plot.

3 January 2004,Fair emotional warning,"If you have a father that is the spitting image of Albert Finney, your father is ailing and your father is often bedridden drymouthed, with ashy skin and the skin pulled down to the pillow, you won't leave dry eyed. My father is ailing and has the same facial sag and hair as Albert Finney. I was teary eyed at Finney's first introduction.

This is a fun serious Tim Burton film. It's different for him, and in some ways is uneven in it's presentation. I sometimes felt he was singing the delta blues when he usually sings pop music, if you get my mixed media metaphor. Some of the riffs might feel a little plastic, but overall it's a satisfying film. There are varying degrees of acting talent, but nothing I didn't forgive by the end. Ironically for a Tim Burton film, I felt some of his more surreal story scenes weren't as strong as the more real parts. The circus scene when he meets his wife is a gorgeous work. It all works in the end though, and does so quite well.

The archstone of talent in this movie is Albert Finney. Without him, everything else would be just Tim Burton design and a somewhat clunky film. I'm no Finney afficionado, so I can't compare this performance with others, but he really got me. I couldn't look at the screen sometimes when he was bedridden, it was just a little too personal. I don't like to even think about it. As the senior Ed Bloom, or should I say the real Ed Bloom, he draws all the other characters, even his younger self, together. I know that is an obvious statement, but it is an important feat in a movie that tries to reconcile fragments with the whole.

If you're looking for an objective view on Big Fish, I can't give it. It's a personal film, and I've only seen it once. I'm never a good judge of movies after only one viewing. But I am going to have to wait until DVD so I can get all verklempt in the privacy of my own home. I do recommend seeing it. A legit tear jerker that had people sniffling all around me.",
18 December 2011,"An amazing film, if you can appreciate it","Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

Title (Brazil): ""Peixe Grande e Suas Histórias Maravilhosas"" (""Big Fish Abd His Wonderful Stories"")",10
7 November 2012,love it!,"Tim Burton creates a phenomenal movie with believable acting, imaginative cinematography and costumes, and a touching and irreplaceable narrative. The movie is about William Bloom, a young man who never really knew his dying father, Edward. William only knew tall tales about his father's life. Edward told William elaborate stories about growing up, making his way in life, and meeting his mother. During Edward's last days, William and his wife Josephine stay with him as the old man recollects intricate memories of his youth. The unique plot creates a journey that is unexpected, enchanting, outrageous, and genuinely moving. There is no other way to describe it, but as unique. The mythical or possibly true stories of Edward's eventful life captivate me and include me on a journey in an effort to separate fact from fiction. Each story is fascinating and original. William most accurately describes his father's tales; ""And as strange as his stories got the endings were always the most surprising of all."" Big Fish is unlike other dramatic comedies. It is not hilarious moments leading up to a big dramatic climax like most dramatic comedies, but the movie as a whole is filled with comedy and drama. This movie is unique and interesting. I love this movie and you will too if you like unique stories.",9
15 August 2009,My Favorite Burton Film,"This is my favorite film by Tim Burton. Why, you might ask? I know a lot of people who worship this man because if films like Nightmare Before Christmas (which, funnily enough, was actually directed by Henry Selick, but produced and co-written by Burton), and Edward Scissorhands, etc. Those are good films, make no mistake. But the protagonists are kinda similar and the aesthetic is virtually the same. Tim Burton movie seem to me to be driven by the aesthetics and art design rather than the characters. not so in this film. There's a warmth exuding from everything, helped along greatly by Ewan McGregor's performance. All the flourishes seem to be driven by the tale and the storyteller, rather than driving them. It also looks very different from other Burton films, with some scenes that even look completely ordinary, something I never expected from a Burton film. The writing and the cast elevated the director, rather than the other way around.

29 February 2004,"Mr Burton.,.... What HAVE you done!?","No Spoilers!-

Sorry, but went with very high expectations for this. What did we get?

A great oppotunity for a few hours sleep and a rather numb bottom.

Clever story but spoilt by it's own cleverness.

A sad departure from the usual genius of the otherwise fine director.

Too long, too drab and repetitive.

Go see nightmare before xmas instead.

3 January 2004,My vote for best pic of 2003,"And actually, one of the best films I have seen in a long, long, long, long time. This film will linger with you. I walked out of the theater thinking ""My God, I finally saw a great picture."" I can hardly remember the last time this has happened. Hmmmm -- ""About Schmidt"" I guess. With all the regurgitated trash that's being pumped out these days, this is surely a gem. I won't spoil this with discussions on acting and structure and other such ""jaded reviewer nonsense."" You will discover this magical piece yourself. My word.

17 September 2004,I expected something quite different (and a lot better),"Big Fish appears before viewing to be a fantasy with an unusual and interesting twist. What a treat that would have been.

Unfortunately, it turns out to be another boring character study, this time of an old man who has been fantasizing and telling tall tales his entire life, and how the people around him react to him and his imaginings. Naturally for this type of film, the characters react in a completely unrealistic manner. They all find him to be fascinating in a way that makes one think that the filmmaker has as much touch with how real human beings act as the main character in this film appears to have with reality.

Of course I won't relate the ""touching"" conclusion, but my reaction at the end was ""Bah, I've wasted another two hours.""

19 September 2004,Tim Burton knows how to make a good unique movie,"This movie was propably the best one I have ever seen. It made me laugh and cry at the same time while not expecting the viewer to be a complete idiot. The pressuring happy/sad atmosphere kept on during the whole movie and this showed that Burton can still make perfect movies even after that not-so-perfect Planet of the apes. Not that it was bad, it just wasn't Burton...

Well, back to the movie at hand... The casting was good, and all the actors and actresses lived their characters. The fairytale-like places and colorful world was great, at some points you just knew that something was not possible, but because it was a story, you didn't even care about it.. (the grass-street at Spectre for instance) :)

I'm getting too carried away, so better if I watch the movie again and stop yapping about it.. :)

12 March 2010,Simply The best,"You know when you hear about a movie, and creates great expectative about it? That is what happened with big fish, and I had no disappointment at all. Cmon only the 180 best of IMDb? For me it's top 20 at least, and I say more, it's the best movie of this decade. The superb casting, the cohesive history, and the tears ... I cried in two movies in my life, The Pianist and Big Fish.Tim Burton made a lot of good and bad stuff, and this is his best, his masterpiece Watch it alone, with your parents, friends, with your girlfriend you will love it and I bet you man or woman will cry and get the main role of this movie, staying with the ones you love is the best thing of life. My rate is 10/10 and this is one of the best movies I ever saw, and it's so dramatical (in a good way) as ShawShank Redemption, the IMDb top 1

3 January 2004,good catch,"Fact and fiction are beautifully blurred as a son tries to reconcile the past of his dying father. Growing up with his father, Edward Bloom's elaborate story telling, his son, Will, is tired of the fantasy and yearning for the truth. One by one, the so-called tall tales of Edward's life come to life in a dazzling and often strange portrait created by the amazingly imaginative director, Tim Burton. Will tries to uncover the facts behind the myths, and in the process discovers that perhaps the similarities between the facts and myths are what is important, not necessarily the differences.

While aesthetically pleasing and emotionally touching (as well as surprisingly funny), Burton does not compromise originality or honesty. I applaud Burton for his invigorating insight into the human spirit and for his stimulating, novel depiction of age-old subject matter. From ""Fish's"" specific ideas of the power of legend and immortality to its broader ideas of human relationships and understanding, it is a masterful accomplishment with alluring mystique!

And with awe-striking cinematography, flawless effects, an absolutely spectacular cast (which I'm sorry to say, I have not stressed enough), and one of my favorite composers (Danny Elfman - who has teamed up with Burton before) -- this ""Fish"" was certainly not destined to sink.

There are a few qualms. Although I adored Elfman's score, I thought the music could have backed off a little, and perhaps some of the events (script wise) could have actually been done with a tad bit more originality and congruency.

Though seemingly unusual, even the unaware audience members will find themselves relating to ""Big Fish.""

Do not dwell upon how reality is different than fiction; on the contrary celebrate how fiction is a reflection of reality. I don't think anybody could have said it better than Picasso: ""Everything you can imagine is real.""",
11 January 2004,Enthralled,"Everyone in the audience that saw this film with me was shedding tears at the end...tears of regret and rapture at the same time! Regret because the Big Fish had to swim away...rapture that the legacy was all he deserved.

I love this film. I will see it again and I'll buy the DVD the day it is released. I can't wait to see more of this! Thank you Tim!

19 August 2012,"A big film, a wonderful and inspiring one.","A big film, a wonderful and inspiring one. I love every single frame of it, it's treatment, the story line, the editing, the colors, the actors

Burton shows the rivalry between father and son but not the rancor, which seems to fit with the film's calm lyricism. But the father-son conflict is meant as the dramatic crux, and a forceful actor would have given it some much-needed bite. For the first time since Ed Wood, Burton has transcended his hermetically-sealed world and connected with wider concerns. A continuously surprising journey, highly re-watchable, and one of the best endings I've ever seen Love love love...

31 January 2005,At the crossroad of life's components,"In a time where the movies industry can build a 2-hour show with plenty of precisely timed plot twists and epic audiovisual effects it needs, at least, patience and courage to enjoy a film like 'Big Fish'. Tim Burton wishes to deliver a deeply human myth and begins his effort by the obvious trick: all tricks to the minimum! Even those used, are, more or less, a mere visualization of the spoken tales: how many times have you listened to your grandpa talking about his giant friend who could move heavy rocks (500kg each), or of his second friend who once caught a 10kg fish using his sardine fishing line?

The story behind 'Big Fish' has many readings. I used the word 'myth' because, in my opinion, Burton knows precisely what a myth IS and in the same time IS NOT. He can feel the simultaneous truth and lie behind the act of storytelling, which might be the essence of our civilization, or more accurately the essence of all mankind.

Pause your DVD a quarter before end credits and you will be disappointed. Fragments of stories, interesting but not connected tales, characters that are merely explained etc etc. Be patient until the ending and you will get wiser. Every loose element finds its position and there is not a 'solution', but more important, a FEELING that floods you and bears the key to the whole movie.

I will disagree with the rest of the comments in that the film is not only about a man that made his life. In the end, all the poles of the story find their opposites: father/son, myth/reality, family/individuality, utopia/feasible, destiny/self-control, discrimination and conduct/self-esteem and recognition. I think that the strong point of the movie is this feeling of reconciliation that floods its end. A situation where all the opposites don't claim their victory and prevalence over their counterparts but stand in a equilibrium that, essentially, is the essence of what is an everlasting myth.",10
29 January 2004,Wow It was SO different,"I was left completely unprepared for this movie. The acting was wonderful, the voices were great. But the story was the best part. It was so original, I loved everything about it. McGregor is a special actor to me because of his role in Star Wars but that aside he still did a amazing job.

4 January 2005,The story of a man who tells incredible stories and the relationship with his son,"Well, I'm a fan of Tim Burton, I like almost all of his movies (except The Planet Of The Apes, which I appreciate but I don't like much), and let me tell you, that this one is probably one of his best movies, of course it doesn't reach the perfection of Edward Scissorhands (the best movie I've ever seen), but after seeing Planet Of The Apes, I was scared about the fact that Tim Burton would not be able anymore to make great movies, when I first saw Big Fish, my fear was gone, it is really, really great. It has the usual Gothic atmosphere of burton's movies, the same magic. If you like Tim Burton's movies, then WATCH this one, if you don't, then don't waste your time (and money) watching this movie, you will not like it (believe me, this movie is only for burton's fan).

26 February 2004,Big Fish is an interesting movie,"This movie made me think about how people can see things in many different ways. Facts are always facts...what change is the way we look at them.

Ed Bloom doesn't change the facts. What he does is tell good stories about the facts with his great imagination. Big Fish is not an extraordinary movie but should be seen in the big screen.

Albert Finney and Jessica Lange are great! The movie is similar in way to Forrest Gump (but this one is much better!). Enjoy!..

28 November 2004,Charming..,"Edward Bloom is a man of many great stories and tales about his life as a young man, He can talk for hours on end about his exploits around the world and the people that are in his life.

People are amazed by these tales which include a giant, A witch and also conjoined twins, Most of them are hard to find the truth, Either there fact of fiction. Thats something Edwards son now has the task of finding out.

Coming down with an illness he gives himself the task of finding the truth behind the stories,telling you, The viewer the whole film through his dad's stories and back and forth to present times.

Starting with the story of a ""Big Fish"", We see Edwards Younger self trying the reel in the catch,Described as the most magical and also mystical fish alive no one has ever caught, Until the day that Edward did just that. Within the stories, At first there is truth on how Edward met his wife. But like i said before there's also tales that just cant be true.

His son eventually finds out the truth behind his dad's tales but you'll have to watch the film for that, Also seeing Danny Devito playing a werewolf is also a funny sight, But then again. Seeing him naked in the middle of the woods isn't.

20 February 2006,The Very Best of Burton,"I saw many people talking about this movie and maybe all have been said about it. Tim Burton is one the most beloved directors and yet one of the most despited directors by Academy Awards, and either you like him or not everybody has to agree with me.I'm one of the many fans of Burton and I might be suspicious to talk about this or the others his movies. I guess that whatever he does in the future it can't getter better than this. I firmly believe that this is his best movie, and you can call me fool but I think this movie is underrated.

About the performance of the actors I think they achieved the most difficult thing than an actor can do, touch someone heart. But this doesn't come only from the actors, and shame on me if I say the opposite.

The power of the movie is the powerful harmony between the director, actors, visual effects department, and so on. The true is that most people remembers this movie because Tim Burton directed or Ewan McGregor(don't forget Albert Finney,Helena Bonhan Carter,Alison Lohman,Jessica Lange and Billy Crudup) starred in it but much of the ""heroes"" of this movies are annonymous but praised be their work.

To conclude my own review, this movie for me is one of the best movies ever. Once again I have to say that my opinion is might be overrated since I'm a fan (not a die-hard) of Tim Burton.",10
23 April 2005,Why can't we just live in the fabulous fiction,"The movie is just so lovely that I kept a smile on my face when watching it. The father had build up a fantastic world filled with witch, giant, big fish, circus They are interesting and attractive stories but he told these to everyone including himself all the time, and finally became a legend himself.

It is natural that the father told his son about his ""experiences"" in the first place, and he kept doing this year after year. It would bring him great pride if he brought his son into his world, but it seemed not. His son, soon found out that all the stories had been told thousands of times, were actually non-existence. This happened when the little boy grew up, old enough to identify illusion from reality. At the son's wedding, he found his father stood in front of all the guests, again telling his story (the one with the big fish). Feeling so embarrassed and angry, he ran out and shouted to his father, blamed him for had never let him know the true version of his life, for ignoring him years after years even kept talking about himself at his singleton's wedding... After that, he hadnever talked to his father for three years.

Stop from here, I'd like to digress a little bit for another similar plot I remember from Peter Pan. When Peter told Wendy something about fairies, he said: ""When the first baby laughed for the first time, its laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about, and that was the beginning of fairies. ...children know such a lot now, they soon don't believe in fairies, and every time a child says, 'I don't believe in fairies,' there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead."" There must be many fairies fell and dead in the dad's stories when the son grew up.

It is not that I was unwilling to grow up, and it is not that I pay specific sympathy to the father. Actually, I totally understand the mood that the son wanted to know about his father. I'm just wondering why people always want to dig up the truth, put the more wonderful and interesting way to explain it aside. Even though most of the time they do know the truth is unimportant and plain, or worse, fellness. As well as the doctor said at the end of the movie: ""I like your father's version more."" Maybe that's why people like the father. He kinda has an ability to tell things in a different way, a more acceptable way, eliminate all the banalities.

The most impressive story the father talked about ever is the one with The Beast. At the beginning of the movie, we are told that there some fish that cannot be caught. It's not that they are faster or stronger than other fish; they are just touched by something extra. This just seemed ridiculous when first heard, but alone with the movie moved, it gradually turned out that the big fish was actually stand for the father himself. A man, who was unwilling to tie himself down. But after fell in love at first sight with his wife, he convinced that she was the one he would spend the rest of his life with. Finally he took the wedding wing with no hesitate. And after that, no mater where he reached to, no mater who he met, he never stopped.

Here're some sentences the father concluded after telling each story:

Death is the worst thing that ever happened to me.

Kept in a small pool, the goldfish will remain small. With more space, the fish will grow double, triple, or quadruple its size.

Fish looks difference to different people.

They say when you meet your lover in your life, time stops. While they don't say when it starts to move again, it will add extra speed that you cannot catch it.

That night, I discovered that most things you consider evil or wicket are simply lonely and lacking in social niceties.   Ultimately, the son found something that really happened both in his father's stories and his life, and he began to understand his father's behavior. He found it was not that his father has a habit of lying or hiding himself. It was in fact an attitude of life, a special way to express his understanding through life. This is the spirit of his fiction world. So when the son were sitting beside his dying father, and were told to tell how death would be toward his father, he did so. He told a story successfully, both satisfied his father and himself. Good enough to make death no longer seems terrific. It made death like a beginning to another journey, but warmer, as coming home.

The ending is delightful. It was just a scene of the son's little boy telling stories to his pal. It was stories of his grandpa. Stories finally continue, and the spirit of telling them may passed on from one generation to another.

Have you ever heard a joke so many times you've forgotten why it funny? And then you hear it again and suddenly it's new. You remember why you loved it in the first place.

Let's give everything a chance to show its charm again, and give you a chance to find out that everything around you is actually shinning all the way.",9
5 January 2014,A fairytale that one day will come true.,"It's been a long time since I wanted to do this review. So here it is, actually it'not like review than a comment from my soul to this piece of art. Have you ever be told about the best movie ever ? It's an individual question but when it comes to Big Fish you can count it to you top list. It is not just that sign TIM BURTON'S FILM or Ewan McGregor (fan of them both) It is a title by itself! It's that kind of movie you'll play again not when it's on TV or somebody just said. It comes naturally like some candy you haven't had since you were little. You need to feel it, taste it again. And that's the way I feel it. Because when you love it, there is nothing to worry about ;)

7 September 2005,Fantastic,"What can I say. What a film. Tim Burton's 'Big Fish' is fantastic from beginning to end. The charming tale of Ed Bloom's life and the amazing adventures he has been on make this film a great one to see.

Whether you are a Burton fan or not I highly recommend this film to anybody who enjoys adventure films. The great thing about this is that the movie doesn't just focus on the adventures themselves, it goes deeper to show the basis of the adventures and the ways in which they are told. The adventures of Ed Bloom are paralleled in his son, Will, who is on an adventure of his own, to find out the truth to his fathers life.

Overall, the journey we see all characters go on and the tale of a storyteller makes this film a definite must see.

4 December 2015,A terrific way to tell a life story,"I have no hesitation in giving this movie 10/10, it is one of the best films I have ever seen and one that is engaging from the very first minute.

Burton uses his trademark ""painting"" to create backdrops that draw the viewer to the scene without being distracting from the dialogue and voice-overs that move the story along (I'm thinking of the circus, the show with the Siamese twins and Specter, but there are many more).

The movie has one of the best endings of ANY one that I have seen. As the film begins and progresses, it seems as if it is a ridiculous exaggeration of a man's life, and even though the series of flashbacks are interesting and pithy it seems as if the point of the movie is to put together a chain of fables and embellishments. Then in the last few minutes of the movie you realize that there is a very good reason for all of this.

An example of superb story-telling, I count it among a very limited number of movies that I could watch every day and still appreciate.",10
5 January 2009,Absolute beauty,"I have just watched this movie for the second time. For the first time I was not really sure whether I want to see it-it just sounded weird, but not enough weird for Burton. I am glad that finally I have picked it. This time I was aiming for it-I wanted to see something nice, something touchy. And that is exactly what this film is offering you if you open yourself for two hours.

I don't think it is the Burton's most visual film neither the most bizarre. But for me it has got the right mixture of both. To put it simple: in the end I cried. Both times. And it really doesn't happen to me often.

I don't want to give some spoilers, you can read them basically everywhere so I can give just recommendation: Go for it! If you liked for example Amelie, you will love this one.

27 July 2005,Tim Burton's masterpiece,"Just so all of you know, I am a huge Tim Burton fan because I have always thought that if I were to make a movie about any of the same subjects as his films, I would use the same fascinating visual style. However, I skipped ""Ed Wood"", which is considered for many his best film, because he didn't use his usual visual style. So when I saw the trailer for Burton's ""Big Fish"", I thought Burton was going to use it as an attempt to free himself from his style and try to be more ""normal"". I did not go to the theater and see it, but when it came out on DVD I saw it at a friends house only because I was bored. Then the movie began, and i realized I was very wrong to doubt.

""Big Fish"" is a simple story with great visuals, a touching message, and it shows that Burton, if given the chance, can be a great storyteller. The film stars Billy Crudup as Will Bloom a man who has never really liked his father, Edward Bloom, who is played by Albert Finney. The reason for it is that his father has been telling unbelievable stories about his own life since his son was born. Tales such as meeting a witch that if you look into her eye, you can see how you will die. Also about meeting and befriending a giant, going to war and meeting conjoined twins who help him return home, and catching a humongous fish. But the story that beats them all is the story of when he meets the love of his life and time stops. The young Edward Bloom is played by Ewan McGreggor and his wife, in her old years, is played by Jessica Lange. Finally, when his father is dying, Will returns home to spend time with his father and hopes to finally discover the truth of his life.

""Big Fish"" is Tim Burton's masterpiece. He is not known for directing dramas, but here he shows his gifts as a director. He takes a story that, while simple, could have gone over the top in sappiness and cheesiness, but his visuals and characters are convincing, the plot gets you involved, and when the incredibly sad ending comes, you feel completely moved by the film and admire the fact that Burton has proved himself not only as a brilliant visual creator, but as a serious filmmaker that could make a great drama even without his visuals. 10 stars/ 10.

By the way, this film made me give ""Ed Wood"" a chance, and I thought it was surprisingly good, but not as good as ""Big Fish"".",10
28 March 2019,One of my favorite Burton movie,"Narrator, Story, Music, everything about this movie is pure beauty. If you like this movie and your wife don't you have may married a wrong girl buddy. Story of my life. I'm an adventurer and always been and always will be.

14 June 2005,A true masterpiece! Burton at his brilliant best!,"I had no true expectations of this film apart from the fact that it there looked something strange about it. This film is absolutely enlightening and delightful! It is a story of a mans life and these stories are bizarre and, like many stories told by people we encounter, sometimes exaggerated! Never-the-less you are drawn to the tales of fantasy and twisted truth which Albert Finney tells in his beautiful dulcet tones. Ewan McGregor balances these tales nicely too and makes this film a delight to watch from start to finish! I cannot understand what is not to like about this film (for those who don't rate it, for me it is a beautiful film and already a true classic! It is unusual and stands out amongst your normal ""run of the mill"" action flick! This film highlights the fact that our lives need stories, we survive on stories and these stories bring people together! I recommend anyone to see this wonderful masterpiece! I think Burton will find it hard to top this delightful picture! 10/10 ""Bravo!""

22 April 2006,Loved it,"Big Fish is definitively one of the top ten movies of all times. It's a sort of wonderland film. The movie has a very complex sequence of events, which require more than one viewing for full understanding. In fact, the first time i saw it, i didn't enjoy it much. But then i gave it a second chance, and the pleasure of watching it increased exponentially. The more I watch it, the more I discover hidden aspects and new ways to interpret this masterful creation. The scenario is extraordinary, mixing long pipe lines and a almost omnipresent fairytale atmosphere. If you didn't like the movie the first time you saw it, don't be by any means discouraged. This movie requires patience and an active role from the viewer. Finally, Big Fish deserves special praise for all the dream-like sequences of the main character and the music fits in perfectly well.

7 December 2005,"not story of life, it's something opposite.","Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

24 January 2004,WOW,"I have never in my life seen a movie that made me step back and put my own life into prespective. I loved everything this movie had to offer. Burton has struck Movie gold with this movie. Even if you are questioning whether or not to see this; this movie packs an emotional powerhouse that makes you think about your own life and how your grandfather or father may have ""fabricated"" stories of yesteryear. There are a few very beautifully choreographed shots in this film. One that stands out in my mind is a scene in the Circus when the Ed Bloom comments on meeting the woman that he will marry. As the younger Ed Bloom progresses through the crowd, all action slows down to a complete stop with the line... ""and there I saw the woman that I would marry."" The scene just took me back to when I first met my own wife, and how in a moment in time your whole life can be changed. I have to give kudos to Burton and company for a visually stunning image, one of many that make Big Fish a feel good movie. This movie gets 4.75 out of 5 stars!! Definately a must see and very much a possible Oscar contender against ROTK. Burton=Best Director as Jackson=get some original material.

12 December 2003,Making A Huge Splash,"'Tim Burton is back,' I thought, already when I saw the Big Fish trailer. He's returned from the smelly and louse-ridden Planet Of The Apes. Sell out your talent in such a manner - the shame! Again, I glimpsed hope of soaking up the imagery only his brain could present on a good day and inhaled deeply as I sat down to witness... a minor masterpiece.

William Bloom (Crudup) goes off to visit his terminally ill father, Edward (Finney), hoping to get to know him before it's too late. The father's colorful, unlikely stories about his youth collides with the son's views on 'real life,' and the film weaves these contrasts together and blurs boundaries between the two until the greater picture is revealed: There are more important things in life than truth.

Never before have I seen Tim Burton's imagination this well integrated in a story. Every piece of fairy tale has a ring of true drama and recognizable elements from life, and hits you straight in the heart. Big Fish is a grand film about fathers and sons, about generations and legacies, about growing up as a human being and about good stories. A lovely, heartwarming present to all the storytellers out there and us who love to listen.

9/10",9
17 March 2004,"forced to be a drama, but it's not a problem","Tim Burton's best film, in my humble opinion, would be ""Ed Wood"". In ""Big Fish"", maybe he tried to do something more pop, less alternative. Maybe something bigger, almost epic. Maybe. It is very stupid thing to compare a movie to another, even if they are from the same maker. The comparison will be done to classified one or another, but to compare possible intentions of a movie and the other.

It is impossible, even for a movie expert, to see a piece of work ignoring the curriculum of the maker. It always means something, a maker have techniques, specified labor, and - even it is minimum, or mediocre - intentions. ""Ed Wood"" is deep. TIm Burton makes a excentricly romantic declaration of love to cinema, and its people involved. ""Big Fish"" is also deep, with a wider subject: humanity. You can find humanity in ""Ed"" too, as you can find love to cinema in ""Big""; not because of a scene, either two or three or hundreds. It is what you feel because of all elements that, added, give a new and unique feeling. And in all films of Tim Burton, mainly ""Ed"" - the reason of the citation, gives you his love that he got with cinema. How he does that? Well, he have always done that. He fascinate you graphically, the cast is incredibly credible as human being - at last, he puts you in the context of the story, and then love the cinema.

That's why ""Big Fish"" can be a drama, even if someone might think it is forced to cry, to laugh... what is the problem with that? Emotions are always forced, they move and point. Sometimes is exaggerated, others too subtle, but they have to move. Well, if you scared to be moved... you hate cinema!",8
10 August 2018,The best movie ever.,"This is one of my number favourite movie. It reminds me of myself. When you tell people over and over your story and somehow they think its not real- so you have to prove them what you told them. I love this movie.

Plus it is flipping great and the ending is so sad and the people that the main character heard from his father story thought were fake but no no no they were real and his father was telling the truth. And that my friend is why it is amazing.

11 February 2004,Life is much more exciting through rose tinted glasses,"The biggest worry, in regards to this film, is that the viewers will leave the cinemas confused, without sparing a thought to what they have just witnessed. This is a reason why Tim Burton should be respected. Instead of offering every explanation to the viewers on a plate in a simplified manner, he has instead left it open for the audience to take what ever meaning they perceive- that is- if they would to take the time to do so!

After constant pondering over what direction the story was taking, it was not until right at the end I realised what this film was personally saying to me. - Every person we encounter in life, every experience we experience and every event that stays with us, we look back upon with tinted vision. We remember the good points, which seem even better, and the bad points become distorted, into a darkened fairytale. These are the experiences in life that we tell to others, often altering them to make life seem more exciting, until one day, we may start believing it ourselves and then life suddenly doesn't seem that bad.

22 March 2006,Big Fish,"This is a movie that will truly make you believe in fairy tales. When I think about movies that really truly affected me in some way, Big Fish is definitely one of those movies. I believe it to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie had high morals and a deep story line with dramatic and sometimes unbelievably fantastic turns. The movie tells the tale of a father and son, who is about to become a father himself, the mythology surrounding the father's life, and the reconciliation between fact and fiction. It's not what you would expect from Tim Burton on the surface, but true to form with 'Edward Sissorhands,' Burton's cinematic flair perfectly captures the human condition of life, death, the unimaginable, and the unbelievable in a beautiful piece of art. The scenery in the movie was museum worthy. One sad fact that I believe is that this movie didn't get the publicity it deserved. Not too many people have ever seen this movie, or even heard about it, and that's a shame. I would highly advise if you ever walk by this film in a movie store to turn around and pick it up and watch it.....

You'll love it..",10
29 April 2022,One of my favorite films,"This film always reminds me that the stories your parents and grandparents tell you are worth hearing over and over. Once they are gone, you miss those tales and realize that they tell you so much about who your family members really were. As a Southerner, some of the Southern accents annoy me, but I enjoy the story so much that I overlook that.

27 December 2003,"I laughed, I cried, I loved it!","This is a valentine for Tim Burton fans and there are sure to be many more after this wonderful film. I hadn't expected to be so moved by it, but I was. The Hollywood Foreign Press categorized it as Best Picture Comedy or Musical which if a bit puzzling, probably gives it more of a chance to garner a win. Amazing that the reactions are so polar opposite. Nothing mediocre about it!

5 January 2004,A Brilliant Fantasy,"Many viewers will not understand this film. It brings up questions about what reality is. Is reality the actual historical context of the events? Or is reality the memories that the history lives in? Ultimately, what is real?

This film was incredibly touching, because anyone can relate to Will Bloom's resentment towards his father, involving unfulfilled expectations and disappointment. But the power in the message of this film is that by forgiving, we empower ourselves to heal emotional wounds and get past our own pain and hurt, as well the power of forgiveness bringing a gift of healing to those we have carried the grudge against.

Tim Burton has ""grown up"" with this film. He does not resort to sappy sentiment nor over the top emotion, but instead provides a tangible undercurrent of longing, love and desire to feel closest to the people that have influenced us the most.

Ed Bloom is not a likable character, in fact he comes off as arrogant and aloof. And yet he is likeable, because there are good qualities in him that his wife and his daughter-in-law are able to find by looking past his faults. It made me think about all the times we get so caught up into looking for the faults in others, rather than looking for the good. Through his stories, Edward is revealed to have ambition, loyalty, conviction, and dedication to the people that make up his life.

Helena Bonham Carter is brilliant as Jenny. She's done so much with a character that is barely drawn. And Alison Lohman continues to prove that she is the next big star coming up, and her likeness to a young Jessica Lange is uncanny.

Go see this film, but go with an open mind. Ask yourself when images do not make sense, what are they symbols for? What else could they mean?

By letting go and using your imagination, this movie is powerful and poignant. It clearly has a message about the importance of those we live for, those we leave behind, and how we continue to live through their memories.",10
25 January 2004,The best feel good film for years!,"Excellent movie which everyone should go see. Must win BAFTAs and Academy Awards. Brilliant performances by all the cast especially Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor. I have never seen so many men wiping away tears at the end of a movie!

19 March 2022,"If a person's emotion is real enough, even if he lives in a dream, he is also happy.","The film makes me understand what romance is and why love needs romance. Artistic truth does not represent reality. What art pursues is emotional truth, which can really move people's hearts. ""Big fish"" is connected with bizarre stories, which makes ordinary people unable to believe. But think about it quietly. Trust itself is a choice. Life needs fairy tales, love itself is the fairy tale of life, and fairy tales, it is better to be romantic, which is more in line with our expectations.

7 September 2023,A man's story,"I learned a lot from this film with the relationship between father and son, storytelling about Edward Bloom's journey and the love of his life. Imagine that you went through the problems and people understand how hard your life is, I would be appreciated and die peacefully if I was like Edward BloomI, some don't know how much we struggle with problems and discouragement, but for me no one gives fk because I never show my sadness to anyone and I never showed up when Im at my lowest. People really say that my smile is awkward, but they don't know that I don't usually smile when Im alone and I have a lot of mental illness since I was a young who committed suicide a few times, that's why I wish I would die peacefully if anyone is really grateful to hear my story like Edward Bloom.

Just another imagine how we know we die, is it bad or good? Well, it tells us already like Don and Edward, Edward uses it to make his life better because he already knows his destiny and not afraid to do anything unlike Don. By the way, it's just a story that Edward tells his son and combines with fantasy to make it look more interesting, but it also tells us to believe in ourselves too, every time I want to give up, I always hit myself up and saying it's so easy why don't I try a little harder, my parents doesn't raise me to be weak (I have family issues btw hahaha) but it is just a motto to remind myself not to give up, because we write our own destiny.

Another line I noticed was ""This is why you shouldn't show a work in progress"" It's indeed! We shouldn't show work that has not yet been done because they don't see that we want to do and what in our mind yet, based on my experience (damn im talking about my life now?) I always show them my work in progress such as drawing, editing, video and more... they can't imagine the images in our minds and they just refuse my work and to not continue and that time no matter I explain to them it makes no sense. Not until I finish it myself and show them the results (they want it back, but I rather throw it away because that guy didn't give me a chance and ruined my life since we both were in high school, he was the reason that I have family issues)

Let's talk about Edward's love, is it true that ""when you meet the love of your life, time stops""? I don't really know that, but when I first meet the love of ny life, the world was shaking just like my heart was beating for her and time was running so fast that took away all the pain that i had and give me back the joy that i never felt.

Every time Edward tell a story about his past, we see that the scene is bright and looks like a happy life, unlike his presence, it can also tell about emotions. How can a man who has a good relationship with everyone but can not give his son a good relationship? All in this review felt like I was talking about myself for the rest of my life (don't worry Im gonna end this review soon even if I still have a lot more ideas of this film, i bet nobody read it), I wish I could tell someone about the way I went through and I overcame those issues and they remember my pride. I never got overlooky or forgotten again, I like to helping people even if they don't give me anything, sometimes I cancel my own happiness just for them and they don't care about that, I hope they see my kind, I mean I don't want anything from them, but I want feel the feeling of being encouraged by anyone, just like I encouraging/cheers them and remembering me. This is why I really like this movie.

A man tells stories so many times that he became a stories. They live after him. And in that way, he becomes immortal.",10
1 January 2004,Wonderful,"What this movie teaches us is that if we look hard enough at our lives we will realize that there is some magic there, and with a little bit of imagination we can look back on all of our many experiences and smile.

30 April 2004,Fantasyastic!,"All the subtle bits of sentimentality found in other Burton films such as Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, and Ed Wood are polished and perfected in this colorful, warm, and humorous adaptation of Daniel Wallace's novel. The performances are outstanding by the entire cast, especially Albert Finney's portrayal of the older, dying Edward Bloom. The stories within the story have a fairy tale look and feel about them that can make you feel like you're watching a film for the first time. However, be prepared for a lump in your throat and a wet cheek or two toward the end. Burton's visual expression of the closeness between father and son combined with Danny Elfman's score creates a moment of introspection for the viewer that can really tug at the heart.

28 February 2004,"Moving, funny, captivating","This movie is a good time for all. I was surprised at how captivating it was, and how enjoyable. Great casting - good acting - great storytelling. They don't make many movies like this these days. The interweaving of fact and fiction and the resolution of fact with fiction were skillfully rendered. And the purpose of fiction vs. fact was made clear with brevity and grace. The overall storybook feel of the filming was interesting and unusual and the special effects were effective without being overly grand. The sense of personal peace and acceptance that comes from this film is a welcome change from the plethora of aggressive (and often violent) movies. When we sat down in the theater, we were seated in front of four young men (late teens, early 20's) and I thought to myself that they were not going to be satisfied by this movie. Throughout the film, it was apparent that they were liking it very much and when it was over, they began a lively discussion of their enjoyment of the movie. Gave me hope for our society!

26 January 2004,Tim Burton has done it again,"This is one of those rare films that lets you be a kid again. I found myself drawn to the screen for the entire duration of the movie, and that is something that is rare. BIG FISH is brilliantly adapted from the Christopher Wallace novel. Though it is quite different that its book form, the screen version has added a more intense and relationship between father and son, and Albert Finney played the role as good as anyone could. Finney's accent and soft rounded words added a lot to the entirety of the movie- Comparable to the narration of Morgan Freeman in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.

Burton's tell tale style shows up here once again, similar to that of EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, with perfectly groomed yards and mysteriously enchanting locations. The film seemed to flow effortlessly, and the timing was a spot on match. I think Burton has hit a new level as a filmmaker and a storyteller, and I look forward to his next project.

16 January 2004,No film has ever had such magic,"I must concede to being perplexed by the negativity a minority carries for this film. Sadly, we live in a very cynical age where folks spend their lives seeking darkness in the daylight. This is a movie to remind us all that even in the most pitch black of places, there's a sliver of sunshine begging for a piece of your mind.

Ewan McGreggor and Albert Finney are brilliant as the duel incarnations of Edward Bloom. Ed's tall tales are entirely ensconcing and charming and remind me of own penchant for weaving narratives in my younger days. The love Ed has for his wife is palpable and the relationship between he and his son is as real as it gets. This movie just has a lot to say about life in general, about how in its most basic form, it's little more than an embellished story.

Those who have come down on it for being ""sappy"" are not only gravely mistaken, but so locked in to an obsession with the ""gritty"" that they fail to realize that even in the worst of lives, there are tender moments that make this world worth it. I never thought it would be possible to accurately describe life itself in two hours. They did it here... boy, did they ever.

This is my favorite movie by far and I will cherish it so long as I live. I encourage you to do the same.",10
11 January 2004,A champion,"Out of all of the movies that I've ever seen, Big Fish is by far the best. No way around it. This is one of those movie that you wait all of your life to see. Hollywood should take a look at this movie since it was done right. So few movies these days mean as much as this one.

First, in ""Ed Wood"", in the party scene toward the end, after the debut of a movie that didn't close down the first night. The very first thing you see is a pair of gnarled hands pounding away at an electronic piano keyboard. These hands belonged to the redoubtable Korla Pandit, of 1950s ""Snader"" fame. Being from that era myself, I instinctively knew whose hands they were, and astonished my brother-in-law with this bit of world-class trivia.

Now in Big Fish, who's the ""barely-known"" musician? In the scene where we first see the town of ""Spectre"", we see a man sitting in a porch swing, playing ""Dueling Banjos"" on ... a banjo. In the credits, you'll see ""Banjo Man"", Billy Redden.

In the 1972 movie ""Deliverance"", you may remember another character sitting in a porch swing, playing ""Dueling Banjos"" with Ned Beatty playing the guitar part. In the credits for ""Deliverance"", you'll see ""Banjo Boy"", Billy Redden. Same guy. He's NOT an albino; he's NOT retarded...and he DOESN'T play the banjo in real life.

28 December 2003,One of the better movies this year,"If you're looking for a movie to get your blood pumping or bring a tear to your eye, this movie is not for you. If, however you're looking for an escape from reality this is for you. An interesting story with the usual Burton weirdness, fine performances highlight this film.

A man who delights in B.S.ing.

A son who wants the to knows the truth about his father.

What is the truth ? That is the question that is answered at the end. Or is it?

20 May 2004,"A beautiful film.Tim Burton's best.Academy's worst neglect, yet.","Big fish is one of those films which makes you stand up and applaud. These kind of movies come along very rarely and when they do you just have the most joyous times at the cinema.We always thought Tim Burton could only deliver dark and Gothic adventures and boy has he proved everyone wrong.Everything in the movie that burton creates is simply fantabulous.

The set designs, the visuals, the sound, the mood everything in it just pulls into the beautiful world of fantasy.This is definitely one of those best films of the year and it's so very disappointing that the academy has once gain neglected burton's masterpiece of work. Obviously the year was the ""lord of the rings"" but giving Big

fish its deserved nominations of 'Best picture', 'Best director','Best supporting actor', Best film editing', Best cinematography', best musical score', best original song', and 'best adapted screenplay' would have at least payed some respect to this magnificent piece of work which leaves you all emotional because of its wonderful family related themes. One of the best films of the year, way underrated, recommended

15 January 2004,A Great Movie,"This movie was totally excellent! Not only has this movie inspired me to do many things but it also it just simply a great movie. Everything in the movie that most people thinks is ""weird"" has some symbolism to it and if you can't see it then you are going to hate this movie. Seeing as how I am a avid movie fan it takes a lot to get to me but I am not ashamed to say it but it made me cry. Any movie that can get to me like that it has to be good. Excellent movie and I would recommed this movie to anyone who wants to see an excellent flick! Great job to all the Cast members!

12 January 2004,Absolutely Lovely,"This movie was absolutely lovely and just a great movie. So much fun and imagination was put into this movie. Tim Burton does it again with making a great movie that will be cherished forever in the tradition of Edward Scissorhands and the Nightmare before Christmas (which happens to be my most favorite movie.) This is a great movie for the whole family, with little crazy stories for the kids and the understanding that come with age for adults. The soundtrack is also lovely as well; well done Danny Elfman. A++ for this film.

29 December 2003,A brilliant masterpiece without the need for a fast pace...,"Disclaimer: No spoilers to speak off in this review, rating 10 out of 10, apologies for any grammar or spelling mistakes, english isn't my native language.

Usually when I watch a movie that lacks a fast, or at least reasonable fluent pace, I get bored halfway through. Not while watching this movie though. The movie is narrated in small chunks; showing the main character reliving the many stories of his father. Each subplot is enjoyable on its own, while only very slowly moving the main story arc forward. The different settings and the impressive visuals (no fancy ""special effects"") merge into a wonderful world of fantasy, and the ending is both unexpected and consequent. The list of the directors (Tim Burton) other movies should definitly be taken into consideration, as this movie is in my opinion his best work, reminding you a lot of his previous work, especially Edward Scissorhands.

If you liked or disliked this review, or have any comments, feel free to contact me.",10
15 January 2004,Best Movie Ever,"This was honestly one of the most impacting, heart-wrenching, hilarious movies I've ever seen in my life. The entire movie theatre sobbed in unison at the end, and it was well worth the $7.00. If there was one movie I'd recommend seeing in theatres right now, it's Big Fish, no competition. And both Billy Crudup and Ewan McGregor are fantastic looking.

26 January 2004,fairy tales forever...,"When I was a kid, my dad used to tell me this story about how come his skin was always red. He said that one day when he was cooking in his restaurant, a lobster tried to escape and he chased it all over the kitchen and out to the river where it ran off... Just as it was about to jump in, it gave him a little nip as if to say faretheewell and thanks for letting me go. My dad would say that a little bit of the lobster got in him that day which is what turned his skin red...

I know now that it was just because of the heat and everything in the kitchens but at that time and at that age... that was the best reason in the world. I even remember having a fight at school defending him and his story.

That's probably why Big Fish hit me in my heart so much. I havn't seen my dad in over 5 years and the moment the credits started rolling I wanted to pick up a phone and go find him. Tim Burton has taken a story full of life and imagination and portrayed it in a way only he can do, with humour, affection, surreality and pathos. This film can easily appeal to all sorts of people but for anyone like me who has fallen out with their father or not talked to them for a while.... man, it's going to get you.",
30 December 2003,"A fanciful story explaining a life of fanciful stories, beautifully!","'Big Fish' is an intriguing and beautiful fantasy from the imagination of Tim Burton. The entire cast is brilliant, Ewan McGregor, Billy Crudup, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange and all the rest too. The movie is charming and lovely, spectacular but not overdone. It was surprisingly wholesome.

This type of movie has the same southern charm as 'Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'. It's a fairytale of the same breed as 'The Princess Bride' though it's more whimsical, less sarcastic. They let the magic flow, and don't squelch it by explaining it away. Although, the editing is tight, you don't feel confused at the end. Some of the special effects are so convincing, I thought they were real, even after a minute or two. Parts of it remind me of Alice In Wonderland, other parts are more like a classic hero movie from the 1940's.

There's love, fantastic creatures, slapstick, haunted woods, and paradises. The movie is about overcoming obstacles more than anything. It's mantra could be FDR's famous line ""We have nothing to fear but fear itself."" It's probably the best movie I've seen this year, and that's saying a lot.",10
21 January 2004,Tim Burton's Best Film Yet!,"Tim Burton's Best Film to date! I walked into the theatre expecting a good film, but this one blew me away. Ewan McGregor (young Ed Bloom) and Albert Finney (senior Ed Bloom) we excellent and I think Albert Finney should get an Oscar Nomination for this one. Tim Burton should get a Best Director Nomination as well. If you haven't see this film get out the local theatre and watch it. This film looked great, the acting was excellent. There is nothing I could find wrong with it. It's intelligent,inciteful and funny. Very few films really get to me, but this one made me tear up. Well done Tim! 10 out of 10!

8 November 2020,An incredibly beautiful film,"I was shocked the first time I saw this film. It was not what I expected from a Tim Burton film. It immediately became one of my favorite films of all time and remains so. I watch it every few years, when long enough has passed that I have forgotten some of the details, so that it is an exploration all over again. It's best not to read much about it and let the film unfold for you in the way that it unfolds for the main character. But, in a nutshell, it is a film about a man and his son and the way their relationship changes over time. It is incredibly touching, especially if you are someone who has grown to appreciate a parent as you have aged. Don't read any more - just watch and experience this beautiful gift from Tim Burton.

6 February 2004,Australian Premiere saved me,"Well rather than pen a thousand words,put simply I found Big Fish a complete surprise,again and again.Without being prejudiced by trailers,ads on telly or Friends,I saw this film with my daughter.

Mystical might describe the parts where we were taken on a journey by the Blooms to places none of us had been before.

Originality and very easy viewing gets my vote of approval!

12 March 2004,Simply Fantastic,"First of all...My English is not very good, so, my apologies....

Well, I think that Tim Burton did one of the most amazing movies of all times...man, he´s great!!....

Every scene in the film is full of surprises that you could never expect at all, the visual effects are great too, and the plot is very emotive....

Not every one who see it likes it, but Big Fish is exactly my kind of movie and I wish this year was full of ""Big Fishes""...

Albert Finney and Billy crudup play their parts very well, but Ewan Mc Gregor make this film even better than it was....

I don´t know why this movie didn´t get an Oscar nomination, hey, I´m a great fan of Lord Of Rings, and I think that the people and the movies that won an Oscar really deserve it, but Big Fish was one of the films which had to be there in the ceremony, nominated in one or more categories...

I want to say that I almost cried seeing the film (I´m a 16 boy) and never a movie make me feel that....

Big Fish is original, creative, fantastic and a different but really good film

Sorry Again For My English",10
25 January 2004,No Need to Keep Fishing,"I was rather skeptical about this film at first; I wasn't sure to expect from the movie after having seen some interesting previews. I was also slightly skeptical about Ewan McGregor's ability to pull-off a Southern accent, seeing how he is Scottish. Despite the fantastical, and ambigious trailer, I found the magical realism to be believable and consuming. I was rather drawn to the stories, and found myself willing to believe them. It was a nice departure from the typical darkness of Burton's films. ""Big Fish"" was much more optimistic feeling, and was at times heart-warming. I was impressed at Ewan McGregor's performance, although there were time when his Scotish accent was quite apparent; it did not however detract from the film. I was also impressed with the rest of the great cast. Each actor performed in the most dynamic and compelling manner, acuratly portraying the fantastical characters of McGregor/Finny's imagination. I was very happy to see Billy Crudup in another film. I was amazed by his performance, and at his ability to portray a character so entirely different from his previous roles, especially his role as Russel Hammond in ""Almost Famous."" Overall, I found ""Big Fish"" to be a charming, and entertainingly bizzar film. ""Big Fish"" also made me have a greater appreciation for my grandfather who is known for telling tales himself. I recommend this film to anyone who appreciates vivid imagination, and beautifully woven stories.",
11 January 2004,beautiful,"First of all, let me say that I love Tim Burton and all involved with this film for doing such a fine job. This movie made me feel. It left me with a feeling like when i was 10 years old and listening to crazy made up stories that my mom used to tell. I felt nostalgic. I ADORE Big Fish. Tim Burton deserves some recognition for all the work he did with this film. Very entertaining. I love it.

11 January 2004,Excellent movie...hesistant to give it a 10,"Big Fish is a rare film that surprised me, in all actuality. I was expecting typical Burton moviemaking, and saw what I consider to be an exceptionally moving film. (As an aside, I will never understand why the Hollywood Foreign Press nominated it as a comedy, but I digress).

I admit that I was bored a bit throughout the movie, and slightly annoyed when people laughed at comical events that were more moving that comical. However, as the movie concluded, I looked around and noticed not a single dry eye in the movie theater. I'm a 23 year old male and I've cried while seeing two movies in my life (Life is Beautiful and Big Fish). Take that for what it is.

My main concern with the movie is the southern accents and picturesque story of Alabama. As a northern transplant going to school in GA, I will admit that the southern accents were not spot-on. However, if I had never lived in the South, I never would have noticed this and would have viewed the movie a bit differently. I think that northerners have a ""story"" version of the South that is much different than the lived experienced of the South. I prefer the ""story"" version and that is what you get from start to finish in this excellent movie.

I urge people to see the movie if you have an enormously strong connection with your father or you are slightly emotionally disconnected from your father. This movie will move you in a way that I was not expecting, even after reading numerous reviews of the movie.

12 January 2004,Not in memory...,"Upon leaving the movie theater after seeing Big Fish, I could still feel the lump in my throat. I forced away another wave of tears as I pondered more about the content of the movie. Not in memory do I recall a film that has touched me in such a way. The use of color and shapes were the perfect enhancement for the fantastical story line. Tim Burton's imagination seems to have only improved itself as the years have past. Ewen McGregor's skills blew me away as the intensity of his character left me paralyzed in his blue eyes. The lines almost leaped out of the screen and down into my soul. My compliments to Burton, you have surely done it again! I hope that I may have the pleasure to view many more works from him in the future.

14 January 2004,Big Fish: A,"Back in 2001, Tim Burton made a sci-fi film called Planet of the Apes. Although the film was a commercial success, it was one of Burton's worst.

Now, two years later, Burton reaches an all-time high with ""Big Fish"", the story about a young man piecing together his dying father's life.

The whole film is great. While it is not as dark as, let's say, ""Edward Scissorhands"" or ""Sleepy Hollow"", it is still one of Burton's best. The performances are great, as are the sets. Danny Elfman's music is one of his best.

I fully recommend this for all Burton fans. Let's see if ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" can beat this!

19 January 2004,Everything A Great Movie Should Be!!!,"This Movie is by far the best film I have ever seen. It scared me, I laughed so hard I peed my pants, and it touched me so much that I cried uncontrolably. The acting was amazing, the direction brilliant, but it's the story itself that is so wonderful. A wonderfully unique script!

If your a big Tim Burton fan, you may or may not like this movie. This is definately his most ""normal"" film, though it still has that Burton touch.

See it, See it, See it.

11 April 2004,Unmissable,"this one movie which no one should miss it's quiet educational about life and how can you make life more interesting and how can dreams come true and how important the relation between the family members especially the relation between the father and the son. Watch the movie and you'll know what I mean. the movies talk about the father who trying to tell stories about his past but in more interesting way that it happened and how his son wont understand what his father trying to do to get him to understand those stories but the stories themselves have some values of how can you work to make other people happy and trying to help them which it give you pleasure of seeing other people happy.

Why is everyone making such a big deal out of Master and Commander, it wasnt all that good.

7 February 2004,Really Different...But Great!,"I'm so glad I found this 'site', to read others views, especially about this film, 'Big Fish', as it was very 'different', and thought provoking! I didn't know a thing about the movie or anything about the director before I saw it (hey... not a big movie buff, but learning!) and I can see now, by the listing of his previous works, most of his movies, normally, wouldn't interest me...though, I might get 'adventurous' and check out some of the others! We left the cinema and I said to my daughter that ""it reminded me in many ways of Forest Gump"", and now, I read and see, many others , feel the same...sorry to those who disagree,though, it would be really interesting to understand the 'similarities' for those who thought alike! For me, It was more than just the 'Southern' accents and scenery...I think the fantasy of the story, flowing into seemingly everyday/normal situations, that we all understand, and then,'tricking' the viewer back into the,'fantasy' within the story, with an easy assimilation, was the strong common element to both these films! Reading through other peoples perceptions has given me clarity to my jumbled 'feeling' about the movie..and yes I love the 'fantasy' and even the 'sentimentality'... though, the 'realistic' part of me kept saying,... "" Wil, Ask your mother the truths""!(Like...How the parents met/got together, and about his misunderstandings and questions!) ...that... drove me nuts!... even though I adore Jessica Lange as an actress and all credits to her for a wonderful performance, but the character felt frustratingly 'weak' for my liking. The bath scene and (1st ending!)were beautiful...and the rest of the movie...great cinematography, great(big)cast, warm feeling and humorous story line, touching, though, at times, confusing, drawn out eg Spectre...(forest - spiders/trees etc)..though my understanding of this, was it was his fears and anxiety about 'getting out' in the big wide world!? I'll explore this feeling more when I watch it again! Wil's wife in the movie 'looked beautiful', especially close ups!Great 'facial expressions' for that role and the camera loves her!I'll be watching this movie again... no doubt, quite a few times!",
9 March 2012,Life is an Adventure,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

17 May 2004,I liked it because of its magic,"This film tells us the story of a father who tells his life in an imaginary way to his son. He can't believe those stories, but when his father died, all the characters of the tales appeared in the funeral. The name of the film comes from a story of a big fish which anybody could never fish but the father could and that is the animal in which he turned when he died. This is a typical film of Tim Burton with paranoiac scenes and fantastic plots, and I liked it because of its magic and the ability of the director to introduce us into the stories. I think it makes you reflect on life, what boring could it be and what we could do to make it better and after all, to live happier. The combination of the stories with the sound track makes it a very beautiful film.

23 June 2005,Amazing.,"This is another Tim Burton masterpiece. First came Edward Scissorhands in 1990 that took you on an odd yet emotional adventure. Now comes Big Fish doing the same with added fantasy. It takes you along for a ride with a interesting and respectful metaphor about life. It tells a great story about a story-telling father and unbelieving son who don't know each other at all. Truth is that the stories his father tells are exaggerated but true but the son thinks their all complete blasphemy. He mostly tells of when he was young and in love with a girl he never met. He works as a circus janitor for information about the girl in which he receives from a family friend of hers. He is also the owner of the circus. All the actors and actresses do an amazing job and fit their roles perfectly. Tim Burton has now added this great film to his long list of glorious movies that he's been a part of. I give this movie a 10 out of 10...no question.

19 July 2004,Easily one of Burton's best,"I enjoyed this film very much. Not a classic Burton but who cares? I loved being able to see the most mundane things through Edward Bloom's eyes...the part that got me best was when he first laid eyes on his future lady, and everything stopped, and he romantically stepped through hoops and moved popcorn to get closer...it conveyed how he felt in that moment. It's impossible to take this movie literally, it's full of lessons in love yet quirky and odd. The cast and crew prove to be just as wonderful as Mr. Bloom, the colors and clothing and places are all so surreal and lovely...I just watched it again and have to say it's worth a purchase, rental, or viewing.

8 November 2004,Always Trust Your Imagination,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) always wished for his father Edward Bloom (in younger days Ewan McGregor and in older Albert Finney) to tell the truth. While Will grew up, he was always embarrassed of his father's imaginative stories he would use to entertain Will's friends, even though his father would claim they were true. That was why Will decided not to speak to his father for many years. The movie goes through Edward Bloom's life in flashbacks from the view of his death through a witch's glass eye when he was ten to his last days on Earth. As Will is about to have a child of his own, his father is put on his death bed. Will pleads with his father to tell one tiny truth, but it only makes Will angrier when his father argues with him. On the day of his father's funeral, he looks around and starts to notice all of the characters in his father's story.

Tim Burton's movie Big Fish is the best example of using your imagination. It is actually a book by Daniel Wallace, also entitled with the same name as the movie. As I watched the film, it seemed as though Edward was just trying to make his life more interesting than what it really was. His stories were in fact true, except he had exaggerated the small details to make a bigger and better story. Tim Burton did a great job on casting Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange (as Will's mom and Edward's wife) and everyone else that even appeared in the movie for a short time. I couldn't imagine anyone else to play the character roles as good as they did. They were perfect for each part. Big Fish never had a slow part in it. It just played out connecting every piece of Edward's life together. The storyline is far-fetched with a fifteen foot tall giant who ate sheep and cows, a town no one knew about, and with singing Vietnamese Siamese twins. Just off-the-wall settings and characters like those make the movie. I was infatuated with Big Fish and appalled when it ended.",
10 July 2005,Finally - A 'Must-See' Movie,"Let me start by saying that I'm not a fan of Tim Burton movies. I skipped the chance to view this movie many times before I finally forced myself to watch it. I now agree that this is possibly one of the best movies ever made, combining excellent acting, direction, writing, and production.

The direction of this movie is nothing short of astounding. This is a wonderfully-crafted film that returns to the roots of film-making by using an actual story. Fancy effects are at a minimum, because this film doesn't need to hide the lack of a decent script. 'Big Fish' is a timeless tale that could have been created by old-time Hollywood, back when the story mattered.

Burton does a wonderful job of matching the movie's style to each specific tale, while never losing the feel of the story that binds it all together. No movie has ever captured the feel of 'Love-At-First-Sight' better than Burton stopping Time itself.

There are some parts that seem too corny or unbelievable, until you understand that this entire movie is about the perception of 'belief'. There are very few movies that can appeal to the adventurism of men, the romanticism of women, and the fantasies of children. 'Big Fish' is one of those rare movies.

One of the wonderful things about this movie is that the interaction and passion between the younger version of the Bloom couple is matched perfectly by the older version. The cast seems to leap flawlessly through time and you never fail to recognize the reckless playfulness of big-dreamer Edward or the shy maturity of Sandra.

The movie tells of a son (William) who visits his dying father (Edward). As the son has grown to become a reporter, a job based completely upon the importance of fact, he has lost all respect for any fantasy in life. This has led to a 3-year rift between the two men, as the father embellishes the memorous tales of his life. William has grown to distrust any portion of the tales, because he has become a man who requires absolute proof of everything.

Since Edward is now dying, William feels a sense of duty within himself as a reporter. He feels that he needs to write his father's obituary in his mind, to preserve a family history for his unborn child, yet he refuses to do so unless he can completely fact-check his father's memories.

This leads to a story of William attempting to dissect every tale his father provides, in an effort to uncover the truth. His father is uncooperative and insulted, insisting that the 'truth' has been there all along and William has simply lost the ability to recognize it.

The end-result is satisfying, as both men are proved correct in some manner, with William recognizing that he is more like his father than he would have ever... (Dare I say it?)... imagined.

---------------------------------------

William Bloom (Billy Crudup) - People have commented that Crudup appears boring in this movie. I personally felt that he nailed his role perfectly. The essence is that of a wide-eyed boy who has become a factual writer with a cookie-cutter life, losing his sense of imagination as he grows. After rebelling against the one thing ruining his image of being a 'normal' person (The 'imperfect' father), he stumbles into regaining the ability to be just like the old man, embracing that he truly is a part of his father. Crudup's 'boring' character seems quite intentional and deserves much more credit.

Adult Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) - Finney is everyone's grandfather, the cantankerous coot that is proud of his life and just doesn't care if you believe it. He's going to have fun right to his last breath and nobody is ever going to take that away from him. His best acting is when he jumps from the playful Edward and bares his teeth to William, daring him to move from his world of literalism because the truth is always right before him... A 'reporter' might not see it, but a 'human being' should. Finney's expression screams ""I am NOT a typewriter"".

Young Edward Bloom (Ewan MacGregor) - Somewhere along the line, MacGregor has got to drop his horrible forced acting-school accent and taper his voice into the role. He is as believably Southern as an Eskimo. Other than that, his likability-factor makes him an excellent choice for the personable young Edward. His best part comes when he explains to Jenny how much he loves Sandra. The mood of the younger couple is a perfect match to the elder version, and Burton mimics life by allowing the younger version never to appear as crabby and lethargic as an older couple.

Adult Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) - If it is possible for someone to explode off the screen in a quiet manner, this is it. Lange is a wonderful combination of tortured, romantic, shy, smart, and sly. She seems to know every secret, but is content to force William to find it on his own and regain the same respect for his father that she has.

Young Sandra Bloom (Alison Lohman) - It took half the movie before I realized this wasn't a digital makeover of Jessica Lange, that is how uncanny the resemblance was. It completely adds to the enjoyment of the movie. Lohman did a fine job, but she lacked slightly in comparison to Lange (Which is certainly no insult to her skills).

Helena Carter (Jenny Hill) - Not a major role, but very interesting. Carter provides a solid performance as the biggest secret in the movie, although her make-up job is extremely mediocre. She looks too much like a young woman in a bad gray wig, but it's a minor flaw.",10
26 March 2005,so sweet,"This is really one of my favorite movies ever. Tim Burton did a good job with the fantasy scenes, and Ewan McGregor was absolutely charming. The cast was good and really gave the film character. I usually fast forward the reality scenes. And the end is so touching, I cry almost every time I watch it. I love how the kids saw how they die in the witch's eye, and how Edward gave the thousands of daffodils to Sandra. Not to mention the soundtrack is fantastic. Danny Elfman did a superb job at giving the music old Southern sound. This is a very good movie and give full encouragement to all of you to watch it. I also liked how Edward exaggerated about his life, I think many people get so caught up on ""what reality is"", that they soon try to shut out any stories with strange possibilities.

22 June 2004,Truly a great film,"I'd like to mention that I recently sent a DVD of this film to my somewhat estranged father for his birthday. Maybe I am a sentimental wimp, but this film really hit home for me. My father and I are around Albert Finney and Billy Crudup's character's age range. Not sure about you, but my father spun tall tales about his life. Like I think most fathers do... So it is no surprise that I loved this film. It is like a chick flick for men. Dick flick? Great performances all around. Too bad it was mostly ignored at the Oscars. Some people may find the film syrupy or a bit over the top. It made me want to call my father and ask him to tell me a tall tale....

3 January 2004,A charming film filled with fantasy and an homage to Federico Fellini,"The film moves gracefully from start to finish. The main characters are people you would like to meet and know more about. The characters in the father's tales are a true homage to the characters in Fellini's Amarcord and 81/2. The world of fantasy does not only need hobbits to make it interesting.

10 June 2005,My favorite Burton,"I went off the theater, my eyes filled with glittering stars. Well, I'm exaggerating of course but this movie has magic in it. It's the mix of a good plot, convincing actors, various situations and so forth. But all of these are technical aspects which I acknowledge.

But there is more to it than just that. A kind of 'Burton Touch' that is spread all along the movie. Maybe the circumstances helped but one can feel that Tim Burton put his heart in this movie. One can feel all the tenderness, the love he has for the characters and maybe a kind of nostalgia also.

I really loved it and the ending always makes me cry (well, only almost actually).

19 August 2006,One of the finest pieces of art n fantasy that makes you believe life,"Since i have been fed with all kinds of tales n fantasies since my birth i couldn't help but notice how similar my feelings were while watching this movie. Its one of those few which u can relate yourself to at least 1 character.

It has been a long time since a movie had made me cry, but this made me n also left me thinking each dialogs, trust me some would stick on u for a life time!!

See it then only u will believe it but watch it without thinking about it n even i can guarantee u will love it.

To tell you about the story, its well written and compiled together with each character given enough time to grow on you. Particularly in this movie you will search for the characters and you will find them as expected.

One of the finest pieces of art n fantasy that makes you believe life is worth living.",10
31 January 2004,Can't Talk About It Right Now,"What a flick! I'm no movie critic; I don't know Tim Burton from Richard Burton. All I know is that this one had me blowing snot, dabbing tears, and trying not to attract attention in a theater full of teenagers. Please tell me I'm not the only 55 year old man who lost it during the finale. Even the bathtub scene was almost too much to bear. I came home and wrote a letter to my son, called my Dad, and made love to the bride of my youth. No doubt, got my $8 worth from this picture!

30 May 2006,absolutely brilliant,"I don't think I've ever watched a film that celebrates life that much. The tiny things of everyday life become truly heroic. It's reality within reality. I don't know which should be contained in inverted commas. It's Edward's reality that makes *reality* shine. That film surely made time stop for me!

Cast and filming were unpredictably well matched, like the people who are involved in our lives at certain times, all seem to somehow fit. Ordinary people who bring extraordinary dynamics, changing our life to the better.

The film is packed with metaphors and gives lots of food for thought. It's filled with optimism and subtly though consistently, presents the brighter side of life.

10 January 2004,Everyone IS the Big Fish,"(I saw the movie yesterday, and this is what I'd like to share with you)

If you stick to the surface, this movie is about a man who likes to tell stories of his life, who in the end turns to be THE big fish of the movie.

If you go a little deeper, you start to see this movie is about us. Each and everyone of us IS the Big Fish, the Big Star, the main actor in OUR life. Our life consists of countless events (stories) simple to complicated, where we meet other people in circumstances normal to bizarre. Who is to judge what is what and who is who?

On the surface, this is a good movie. Down deep, this movie describes the true essence of our life, and it can easily be regarded as profound.

(Since this movie is based on Daniel Wallace's novel, she should be the one complemented on the vision she was able to record for others to explore.)",10
31 January 2004,An Aesop's Fable,"Big Fish was such a wonderful experience with its human qualities that touched the heart. Family was so important to Ed Bloom who craved attention of all those who would listen to him. It brought him joy to share his special stories. We all cry for those times when a parent created a story that brought a bit of the real and unreal together into a story that would be a bit like an Aesop's Fable. The large catfish was such a fable that could be included in my old, well-worn copy of Aesop's Fables. I loved the characters and everything about the film. It is a winner even though it was ignored by the Oscars. We all know it won and that is what is important.

24 January 2004,Very touching and fantastic film,"In my opinion director Tim Burton has made his best film yet. Big Fish tells the story of a man, Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), famous about his fantastic tales. When Edward becomes ill his son - to which he is not talking to - travels to see him wanting to get to know his fathers real self. During the movie we see flashbacks of young Edwards (Ewan McGregor) life. The movie is very touching and has all the trademarks of its director well in place. The score is brilliant, the actors even more brilliant and the script moves forward steadily without too much explaining. I absolutely loved this film.

1 August 2009,"I wouldn't usually say this, but...","This movie was outstanding. It's about as far from my usual genre as you could possibly get, and fantasy based movies (especially Burton ones - no offence) are normally like pulling teeth for me; however, this film defied all my expectations.

After having had this movie sit around for the last 18 months, and having wrote it off as boring after reading the synopsis long ago, I don't really know what possessed me to watch it now. I'm glad I did though

This is a simple story about a man coming to the end of an ordinary life, that has been filled with extraordinary tales, and his son trying to filter these tall stories to get to know his ""real"" father, and come to grips with his fathers state. Excellent acting and dialogue, and wonderful both visually and emotionally. I haven't had a film grip me like this in a very long time. An adventure of a film that I didn't want to end.

Don't know what else to say, apart from see this movie! A treat for all ages, and a real treasure. 10/10.",10
18 January 2004,Fathers and Sons,"Quite honestly, the ending of the movie moved me. Is it a cliche that you've seen hundreds of times? Certainly. The cliche was well done though, and at the end of the movie you really care about the characters and what they go through. I don't like how they try to sum up/answer the questions, I would have liked to have seen more questions at the end. I really want/need to read the book.

Last note: This movie is my favorite father/son movie, having knocked Field of Dreams out of that position.

12 December 2006,I need some help!,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

16 December 2006,An effective & moving adaptation of Daniel Wallace's wonderful novel.,"I've been a fan of Tim Burton since ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" in 1985, and although his choice of both narrative (""Ed Wood"" vs. ""Mars Attacks"") and presentation (""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" vs. ""Nightmare Before Xmas"" or ""Corpse Bride"") vary wildly, his courage to tackle unusual and challenging projects is a large part of his appeal. There are consistent elements to a Burton project that stamp it as uniquely his vision.namely: rich and unusual characters, a dark, dry sense of humor, and vivid and imaginative use of color, all of which work beautifully in the film.

Burton's sense of humor is dark, dry and very intelligent. He doesn't pander to the 'lowest denominator' when creating films - he respects his audience enough not to talk down to them. There is often a good deal of subtext to his dialogue and repeated viewings are often rewarded with humorous details that went unnoticed the first time around. He treated ""Big Fish"" with a lighter, loving hand than in certain of his other films  respecting both the importance of the ""tall tale"" and the delicate bond between father and son.

Burton took a few liberties in adapting Wallace's narrative (as is to be expected, due to the limitations of the different genres.) His decision for Edward to convince Carl the Giant to run off to the big city, and take him along, provided him the opportunity to introduce a whole new colorful setting to work with: the circus. This gave him a springboard for several plot points (Edward meeting his future wife, the giant and Edward both finding visually-interesting employment), and condensed many of the novel's stories into one for the sake of time constraints. It also provided Edward with a 'sidekick,' a common convention in a quest fable (or 'roadtrip movie'.) The basic theme of the movie centers around a father & son with very different personalities attempting making peace and find a connection. On one level, Will resented his father for denying him what he felt was his right to know the 'real' man behind the myths. But the reality is, the ""fables"" Edward created to describe his life were as ""real"" as the facts themselves  contained within the 'fish stories' were the truths, the lessons, Edward wanted to impart, and conveyed the overall image of his own life as he wished to be remembered.

One of the messages of the film is that it is impossible to truly know anyone completely. Our perceptions and assumptions (whether accurate or not) inevitably color our impression of who a person is. We can't ever know the truth of a person's life  all we have to work with are the parts they reveal to us, and the fictions we unconsciously generate to fill the gaps.

William always resented his father for what he considered 'avoiding reality' by 'inventing tall tales' about his own life history. But Edward has his own perspective: ""You're not necessarily supposed to believe it. You're just supposed to believe in it."" The process of the father trying to communicate to his son the importance of living ""larger than life"" and not allowing himself to be constrained by the petty restrictions of mundane life makes for a very moving, and wonderfully told, tale.",7
26 December 2006,Love it,"I loved this movie, it was fun, interesting and had a great ending...sad but great....I wish I'd written it, what an imagination and a gift for story telling...just think, no rape, pillage and plunder, war, aliens, apocalyptic themes, etc....and it was still a great movie Hmmmmm? Directors and writers are you listening??

Hopefully we can have all of the above and once in awhile, we can also have a movie like this...just for something to mix it up...that would be so nice....or do I sound like Mary Poppins: not my intention, just wanted to say its nice to have a story that plays and flows well in a movie, without bomb blasts, aliens eating humans, evil politicians, etc.

13 January 2004,Typical Tim Burton,"This movie is typical Tim Burton. It starts slowly, but eventually he has you completely engaged in the fantasy such that you don't realize he has succeeded in getting you to ""buy in"" to the story until the movie ends. The photography and scenery are also extremely well done. The big fish at the beginning of the movie is not believable, but somehow that is all corrected by the end of the story.

A vision of life with such emotional honesty as I've hardly seen.

You can't talk here about pacing or little failed details because BIG FISH is just beyond expert analysis. This is a movie that actually can make you laugh to tears and cry from the heart. A truly, honest story full of metaphors that actually lives and not are there just to be deciphered.

A wonder. True magic.

11 December 2003,Comments on the Movie,"An excellent, artistically whole, picture.

The person I saw it with said it suffered from spats of brilliance, I disagree. I thought the entire movie was consistent in theme, intellectual intensity, and creativity.

Personally the only criticism I have to make, is that I wanted one more fantastic scenario. The last one before the finale, involved his affair with Bonham Carter. That wasn't nearly as entertaining as the circus scenes, or the World War II action. I wanted one more scene of zaniness.

Maybe they'll have another crazy story in the deleted scenes of the DVD. I'll just have to wait and see. Visually, I'd say this was Burton's best work, better than the Set direction in Edward Scissorhands, which is saying a whole lot.

Alison Lohman is a brilliant, young actress. I guess she's not as young as she looks, but white oleandor, Matchstick Men, and Big Fish. What a resume.

anyways, Burton's back, ladies and gents, stand up and take notice.

-Brian",
25 February 2009,A story for everyone,"Big Fish is a movie that will pull in every member of the audience. Albert Finney, an amazing actor in himself, plays the amazing character with an imagination for the absurd, Edward Bloom. Ewan McGregor plays the young hopeful Ed Bloom, with the heart and soul of a friend worth having. The story takes place in several time frames, from Ed Blooms childhood, young adulthood to his late years with an adult son of his own. Billy Crudup plays the dying old mans son, looking for answers he visits his father for the last time. Big Fish is a drama that plays every genre to a T.

The movie begins with a lost man searching for his fathers history. It continues cohesively through Ed Blooms childhood, from a one-eyed witch to jumping spiders. With ""tall-tales"" of wars, Siamese twins and a traveling circus, Will Bloom learns who his father is. Throughout the movie Will and his pregnant wife rehear most of Will's childhood bedtime stories of giants and idolized southern towns.

Tim Burton once again mesmerizes us with a heartfelt love story with incredible imagination and flair. He takes us to a new world of fantasy and hope. Burton, usually dark and playful, takes a turn and directs a movie so full of love and compassion the only thing that tells you it was even him is the amazing score by Danny Elfman. Burton tells the story of a young man looking for a place so well you'd think it was his very own biography.

Set design plays a huge part in making the movie what it is. The movie takes place in several locations all with very different themes. Forgotten forests, traveling circuses, the hidden south, to a white fenced home. The set designers do an amazing job of making each location a character. Each set has its own feeling, its own personality.

Big Fish is an enchanting story of a young man trying to understand his father. Its believable in its total absurdity. Fact and fiction co-exist in a way that, by any other director, would have seemed awkward. Big Fish is movie for the ages. If you have a heart and half a sense, you're guaranteed to love this enjoyable fairytale. An easy 4.5 out of 5.",9
9 May 2004,Christian allegory to the Bible (esp. Revelation),"Big Fish takes you to that hidden place that only a select few only ever get to know or see. Bjork sang about it. Tim Burton recreates it. Take your shoes off and stay for awhile. Mcgregor/Finney is the Big Fish; He is the Christian soul winner who walks by faith and trusts God's word. His stories sound like fairy tales to his son because he has no faith in God or the Bible. Crudup plays the cynical unbeliever. ""There is no way Jesus could have walked on water, it's just a made up story!"" But you will soon learn that it is not. Amazing parables begin to reveal themselves if only you have argus eyes to see. Carter is Jezebel, the adultress. The fallen angel, Satan, is Buscemi. (He put his shoes back on). Jessica Lange is Eve (the naked woman in the water). Josephine (Cotelliard) I'm not so sure of yet..if you figure her out please let me know! This movie is really going to make God smile...and hopefully you too.

10 January 2004,Big Fish - No spoilers here! Read with confidence!,"This is only the second time that I've posted a review on this site. I go to many movies, and some are wonderful, but between the ones that disappoint me and the ones that are not necessary (do you really need another review of Lord of the Rings and how great the series is? I thought so.), I rarely find myself coming here to post. The masses normally do a great job of it (in fact I haven't gone to a movie in years now without first checking here!).

On a rare occasion, however, you can find a gem amongst a sea of garbage; and although other people on here are very talented at finding gems like these and reporting them, sometimes those gems are worth so much its necessary to take the time to tell the whole world about them.

`Big Fish', by Tim Burton is such a gem.

Walking into the theaters I saw all ages there. Obviously word is spreading about this movie fast, and from 10 to 75+ all generations were represented in full force. From the moment the movie starts, to the beautiful ending, `Big Fish' really lived up to its name as a big movie.

Without going into details, I'll tell it to you like it is, plain and simple.

This movie is not without its problems, after all what movie is? The acting is great over-all, but is not perfect.personally I like a `real' movie. Tim has always been good at leaving movies a bit raw, and I respect him for that. Some of the scenes look like they might have needed another cut at it here and there, and both of these problems add up to about 2 minutes of the entire film. People that exploit those on here are full of themselves, and I'm sure they can honestly admit to never having any kind of imagination or happiness in their entire lives. I'd suggest before you try to critique a movie, you have a real life before trying to live in the fantasy that is film.

`Big Fish' certainly has creativity, originality, and in some case a lot of foresight. It did absolutely touch the heart of every person within sighing distance that I could tell, and I'm sure the entire audience as well. This movie was magical wondrous ride that I wouldn't have wanted anyone else to direct, because no one could have done the job like Tim Burton. He's had hit and misses in his career, but this one takes the cake.

There are always flaws in every movie, so I refuse to give a 10/10 to anything, but this is about as close as it gets. 9/10

Grab your wife, Grab your kids, Grab your parents, and if their alive, grab your parents' parents, and go see this movie! It's worth every penny no matter where you live!",
16 January 2004,The moral!,"OK, so I've been reading people's thoughts on the movie, the metaphors and

explanations and all. In fact many people on this site have conflicting perspectives on what the movie is truly about and what in the movie is real in what is fantasy. It occurs to me that Big Fish, which is about a son attempting to uncover who his father truly is and which of his grand stories are true and not true, left the same effect on its viewers. Here we are trying to distinguish between reality and fantasy, just like Edward. In the end Edward realizes that it doesn't matter what is true or false and comes to accept his father for who he is, and himself carries on his fathers legacy by repeating these amazing stories to his own children. Once again here the viewers of Big Fish are reitterating the stories from the movie. But what the point here is, is that it doesnt matter what was reality and make believe in the movie, just accept and enjoy it with all the great ties and metaphorical connections. Don't overanalyze it to the point where it all meaning is lost.

15 May 2009,"Extraordinary, Engaging, Brilliant, Revealing","The basic premise of this film follows a young man who tries to reconcile the truth and lies of his father's life before his death.

Tim Burton's masterpiece draws you into a world that is simultaneously so grounded in reality and fantasy that the viewer will have trouble separating the fact from the fiction. This dichotomy characterizes essentially the whole premise of the movie, and develops many of the themes and sentiment.

Visually, this film is a stunner, with beautiful hues and grandiose landscapes. One scene covers the whole screen with a field of gorgeous gold daises.

Interestingly, the seemingly bizarre and irrelevant stories that Edward Bloom become more and more simple, beautiful, and believable as the movie unfolds. Brilliantly, his story telling comes full circle at the end of the film, and the viewer is somewhat able to reconcile Edward Bloom's imagination with the actuality of his fascinating history.

Not only does this film allow for deep analysis and retrospect, it possesses all of the qualities of great film. An exciting and engaging story, beautiful landscapes, fabulous settings, and most importantly, fascinating character interactions. This film is undoubtedly my favorite.

You will NOT regret watching this film. I can guarantee that.",10
11 February 2009,My Favorite Movie,"Big Fish is one of my absolute favorite movies because of it's beautiful detailed stories and happy atmosphere. Other people that loved it liked it because of it's ""abracadabra of cinematography"" and ""pure sunshine."" I agree with them. This is an extremely well done movie that makes you happy while at the same time making you think about some of the big questions in life like ""what really is true love"" and ""what does a life well lived mean"" and of course the timeless questions about death.

People that didn't enjoy this movie disliked it for it's sentimentality. Many didn't like it for the same reasons that I did like it. It was ""too happy"" and ""too innocent."" Aren't happiness and innocence good qualities? That's what I believe. Others said that it was ""overdone."" They didn't appreciate the metaphor of being ""meant for bigger things"" that was portrayed by the film style and acting, not to mention the incredible sets and gorgeous costumes.

Big Fish will always be one of my favorite films because of the amazing storytelling and the sweet views on love, and death. I always cry at the end of this movie because of Tim Burton's ability in this film to make you love the characters and what they stand for: determination and love.",10
30 April 2004,Inspiration vs Time,"This movie was inspirational. This week a have seen 2 great movies, ""Mystic River"" and ""Big Fish"". With the first one when you go out of the theater you can hear people say ""great movie"" ""powerful performances"" ""great plot"" and everyone would agree. And when somebody watches it again he will say the same thing. When I got out of the ""Big Fish"" I couldn't say a thing. It wasn't the plot or the acting or anything else, it was the way it got under my skin. The way it made me feel about everything around me, even for a short period. Magic. everyo The thing with movies that inspire you is that not everyone would agree with you because it affects you in a personal level. ""Big fish"" was for me a beautyfull experience and all and all the best film I have seen this year. The acting was wonderfull and Tim Burton's direction was haunting as always. But unlike any other great movies, the second time you see it won't be the same. And as time goes by, you will remember that feeling but you won't be able to experience that emotion again, until you find your next inpirational movie. It is a one-way trip into your heart. It was for me, if it's not for you don't worry, maybe next week is your lucky one.",10
4 January 2004,By far one of the best Tim Burton films ever!!!,"This is one of the most imaginative stories every put to film. Burton's imagination is like that of a small child's and watching it I felt as though I was a child right along with him. The charisma that Ewin McGregor exudes in this film is nothing short of spectacular and the stories he tells, are soooo fun and soooo imaginative that it makes you want the stories that he tells to be true. I laughed, I cried, and in the end, I was so glad that I saw the movie.

17 January 2004,Not your typical story or movie structure,"If you are waiting for the storyline to somehow conform to the expected format found in most other popular films, then you are going to have difficulty enjoying this treasure.

This film has an incredible way of demonstrating how fantasy can have a place in reality, and that one's imagination doesn't have to be abandoned with adulthood. With all this fairy tale/real life enchantment, this film also contains very touching elements such as a father/son relationship and reconciliation and the presentation of a beautiful perspective on life.

I am one of those people who remain in the theatre until all the credits have all scrolled by, and am therefore almost always the last to leave. After this film, however, there were several other viewers remaining in the theatre who were visibly touched by the story. Some were crying in a way that seemed as though it was more than empathy for the characters, but that this film somehow touched elements in their own lives. I know it did for me.

Therefore, go watch this movie with in open heart and mind. Don't expect the traditional (and expected) rising action, catharsis and denoument. This film is bigger than that, and will offer you something more.",10
28 January 2010,Breathtaking,"I want to start out by saying that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. In addition, I suspect that as I'll grow older there won't be many more so touching like this one.

The storyline consists in the narration of Ed Bloom's life tales and how he exaggerates the truth only to make them even more fascinating. As the story goes by we get to know the other half of the coin. Despite having lived an amazing life, Ed also neglected his wife and only son who holds a contained resentment against him.

In ""Big Fish"" nothing is what it seems but at the same time it really doesn't matter. The density of the characters is just wonderful and it's that kind of movies that you can watch over and over as it leads you to an incredible and personal soul-searching.

Tim Burton did a fine fine job with this one.

Unquestionable 10/10.",10
10 January 2004,"Interesting, touching","Big Fish is a little different from Tim Burton's usual movies, yet still whimsical, unrealistic, but yet very realistic. It seemed a little long at parts, but well worth a trip to the movies. My father-in-law, who loved to tell stories, died nearly 2 years ago after a stroke and so the movie was very touching to me. The ending is wonderful although it was very sad for my husband and I. I'd encourage you to watch it-teaches that maybe when we think we don't know our parents, maybe we really do and maybe there is some of them in us! Great actors in this movie - perfect roles for each of them.

21 April 2010,"Hunters, fisherman, and other liars","Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

25 December 2003,Loved Film,"The film was beautiful. Good looking, and a heart grabbing story. Great actors guided by Tim Burton in a sensitive, emotional way. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney were exceptional. The Photography was breathtaking. The use of the birds and animals was well done also. Don't miss it. Ron, Orlando

31 July 2010,That's how I remembered it.,"Big Fish shows that everyone remembers the past however they want to remember. When William Bloom (Billy Crudupt) returns home to his father's death bed, he just wants to hear the true story of his father's life. The fairly tale story of young Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor) is retold in flashbacks by the aging Edward Bloom (Albert Finney). Though William Bloom is disappointed by the lack of reality in his father's stories, he learns to accept the fantastical stories and that this is how his father wants to be remembered. The theme of Big Fish is similar to that of Orson Wellles' Citizen Kane. Both movies are told in a series of flashbacks, however, Citizen Kane is told by many people and Big Fish by one. In the film Citizen Kane every person who is interviewed on Kane remembers him a slightly different character, implying that there is some fabrication and personal impression in each version of his life. Much like in Big Fish, Edward remembers his life a whimsical fairy tale. In both films some stories are substantiated by fact. In Citizen Kane the reporter finds some things backed up in records and in Big Fish William finds some truth in his father's stories, looking through old documents in his garage. In the film, scenes in the past are much more colorful and high key lit than scenes in the present. This may have been done to separate the two, and to show how much more exciting Edward's past was, compared to his present state. Also, he remembered his past in such an unrealistic way. The color red is also used a lot in the past. This could represent passion. Another film technique used in Big Fish in relation to the theme is a barefoot motif. One of the first instances of barefooted-ness occurs in the picturesque town of Specter. Everyone in the town was barefoot because they had all tossed their shoes across a telephone pole long ago. Edward's shoes are also tossed up there and he has to continue his journey barefoot. Barefooted-ness occurs again when Edward's wife gets into the bathtub with him, in the present. Some characters are always shoeless as well; such is the woman manifestation of the Big Fish and the smaller giant. The werewolf circus conductor is also seen scratching his head with a barefoot. The movie ends with some one removing the adult Edward's shoes and tossing them over a telephone wire. Barefootedness may represent youthfulness because most young children hate wearing shoes. It is only once people grow up that they always wear shoes when outside. This fits with the theme of remembering a fantastical and youthful past regardless of what really happened. Though Big Fish is an obvious exaggeration, the past is always some what fabricated to fill in the details we forget and subject to each individual's interpretation.",8
17 January 2004,Beautifully Breath Taking,"I had big expectations for this movie...i really did. Admittedly, i am not a strict ""Burton-ian"" but i have long admired Burton's style and figured that this movie was either going to severely disappoint or greatly impress..and fortunately the latter occurred. The movie is a bit choppy, and at times can seem a bit superficial but simply put, it is a truly moving piece of a son who cannot accept his father until it is nearly too late. I recommend this to everyone; even if it's not as dark as Burton's other works, it still has extremely worthwhile performances and messages.

10 January 2004,Beautiful Tale,"In my opinion, ""Big Fish"" is the best movie of the year. ""Big Fish"" is a visually stimulating movie and it is complimented with a wonderful story. This movie is not only beautifully directed by the never disappointing Tim Burton, but was also very well casted. The physical similarities between Jessica Lange and Alison Lohamn were amazing! Everyone on the cast was brilliant. When you leave the movie theater you leave with a wonderful feeling inside. This movie was amazing and I strongly recommend everyone to go see it.

15 December 2003,THE BEST,"This movie is so far the best movie I've seen this year. Excellent drama with excellent acting. I would recommend it to anyone to go and see it. Usually I don't rate movies and I don't praise movies but this is an unbelievable piece. Great acting and great directing. Hopefully we here about this movie around the Oscars.

31 January 2004,The iceberg...,"Just as Billy Crudup tries to explain how his father is like an iceberg, so do I attempt to describe this movie. It's 10% colorful, imaginative fantasy. The other 90% deals with sincere, real issues - personal identity, the psychological divide between childhood and adulthood, true compassion, and....death. It could be that my current situation involving a grandfather who is nearing the end of his life resembles this movie enough to tug painfully at the heartstrings. But, I think it's more than that. Big Fish has a magic that is rarely seen in movies. It sparkles with creativity, genuine performance by all cast members, and a sincerity that reaches right to the depth of the soul.

11 November 2003,Bizarre Hilarity,"I just went to a screening of ""Big FIsh"" last night, the producer was there to talk to the audience about the movie afterwards. He couldn't stop telling us how lucky they were to have Tim Burton directing, and after seeing the movie, that was obvious to everyone. I knew I was in for a ride in one of the first shots of the movie, the cinematography was beautiful. Further into the movie a shot will bring back memories when you witness a ""landscaping company"" a block of small houses and green grass being cut, all framed to the center. The movie had a lot of Tim Burton flavor to say the least.

The cast was spectacular, Ewen McGreggor did a surprisingly great job though he certainly wasn't type-casted for the part. Danny DeVito is touching, Helena Bonham Carter flexed herself between two characters. The movie is a gem, and very inspirational, questioning themes of time and immortality. Very touching and magical, a great movie to see over the holiday season. Enjoy.

29 December 2003,A story to take to the heart,"Big Fish was...one of Tim Burton's best movies. I walked into the theatre, expecting some of the ""normal"" things that you see in a Tim Burton movie...people pale as the moon, with black uncontrollable hair and dark circles under their eyes. People wearing pinstripes (which were seen occasionally), dark camera angles and frames...all of that which you should expect when you walk into a movie with the name ""Tim Burton"" plastered on the poster. Watching the movie, I got none of that. It didn't have the distinct markings of a Tim Burton movie, and I could have plastered any director's name on it. I have to give praise to Tim Burton for this.

Now, back to the movie. ""Big Fish"" is full of metaphors about life and relationships and how people weave together their life stories (some true, some false), and I think it should not be missed. Hurry to your local theatre when it opens!

25 January 2004,Awesome,"Great movie. People who don't like it are retarded. It's awesome and dare i say....touching? Finney, McGregor and Buscemi are outstanding and, of course, Mr. Burton's direction is right on the mark. It's funny, honest and fantastical. Go see it.

2 February 2004,couldn't hook an oscar nod,"Tim Burton, one of hollywood's most unique voices, tried to hook a big one.

""Big Fish"" is distinctly a Burton film, filled with memorable misfit characters and fairy tale imagery. But the overall tone of the film, from the cinematography to the score, displays a different sort of Burton. One that is reaching a little further for the masses,and the oscar voters.

The film is tremendous. It touches us with lessons about relationships, persistance, and optimism. Burton always has a passion about misfits, and they figure largely into the story here. However, the film ever so slightly tips towards the mainstream, unlike many of his other films (Ed Wood, Mars Attacks).

It seems to me he was shooting for an oscar. it's a story voters love, and the Elfman score was more classic movie-esque than before. Oscars loss is our gain. He has crafted yet another fable,this one the most touching, and enjoyably, more family-oriented than his previous efforts. The story keeps you watching and guessing, and the ending tugs at your heartstrings, yet in a totally unhollywood way.This may have kept oscar voters away, and even american audiences,but he has left us with a film that will endure. One for the ages. Don't let missing the big catch of a hollywood award get you down Mr. Burton. You've left us a film that will reel in generations to come.",
2 December 2003,By Far one of the best movies!,"I was able to see a screening of the movie last night courtesy of a marketing firm out in Denver area. Other than the fact that it was the new Tim Burton movie, I didn't know much about this movie going into it. I remember seeing a spread for it in Vanity Fair a while back, but didn't connect the two. The spread I saw focused on a circus cast. This was NOT the entirety of the movie.

The movie is about a man who, as a boy growing up, was told what seemed like tall tales of his father's life. He is haunted by the story of his father catching a fish on the day he was born, and it seems to overshadow every important event of this man's life. When the father becomes sick, William Bloom, played by Billy Crudup of 'Almost Famous' fame, heads home.

It is then when William Bloom tries to pry more into his father's life and find out how to separate fact from fiction. The stories that the Edward Bloom, younger version played by Ewan McGregor, tells are definitely a hard thing to believe, but the vision and artwork of this movie and the production crew make the scenes and ""stories"" absolutely beautiful. As you travel along with the younger Edward Bloom you begin to realize that he is indeed ""A big fish in a small pond."" Throughout the stories, and the uncovering of ""the truth"" William learns more about his father, and yet at the same time learns nothing new.

Overall, I LOVED this movie. I strongly suggest that you go see it. Billy Crudup played William excellently, and Ewan as the young Edward Bloom was captivating. Albert Finney, of Erin Brocovich and Traffic fame, plays the older version of Edward Bloom and you can't help but wish you had a grandpa like him. Some of the smaller roles were actually the biggest names in the movie. Steve Buscemi (known for his wacky character in Armageddon) was a small-town poet who goes missing, Danny Devito is the circus ringmaster, Jessica Lange plays Mrs. Bloom, and Helena Boham Carter plays a young girl who happens to be in the path of young Edward Bloom, and the lovable ""Giant"" is exactly that... you somehow imagine to see a bit of every friend you ever had in this giant, and possibly even a bit of yourself. The saddest note about it? Marion Cotillard, who plays William's wife, gets no credit for her role on imdb.com and yet she is just as important as the elder Mrs. Bloom.

The movie gets two enthusiastic thumbs up from me, and I would definitely love to own this movie. In my humble opinion, it is the BEST work from Tim Burton that I've seen, and definitely ranks with the best of the best from this year.",9
10 December 2003,"See this film, with an open heart!","This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, and I'm tempted to describe it as a drug-induced Forrest Gump, but it really should stand on its own.

The story is beautiful, the characters are extra-ordinary, the scenery and story are full of soul. I will be purchasing the DVD the very day it is released! I LOVE THIS FILM!

1 January 2004,I left the theater emotionally drained.,"Maybe it was because I had just returned from a visit with my own father, or perhaps because of my own life experiences, but at the end of the film I wept, like I never have during a film before. When I arrived at the theater I was tired and under the influence of allergy medication. Consequently, I caught myself dozing off a little at the beginning of the film. Soon, however, I found myself completely wrapped up in the film. It was obvious from the beginning of the film, that somehow the father's tall tales would somehow be related to his real life, but it was such a delight to see fact and fancy dance about each other, to ultimately produce an TRUTH which can not be described by facts or fabrications alone.

At the end of the film, I not only surprised myself with my own tears (I am not one who is often brought to tears), but also became painfully aware that I was unsure as to whether the tears were for my father, my grandfather or myself. I have no idea how others will respond to this film, nor can I predict what my response will be on a second viewing, but I do know that the film was beautifully crafted. The acting was not only perfectly suited to the script, but it was most definitely an ensemble cast, with no actor trying to outshine another, or dragging the production down with inferior skills. By far, this is my favorite Burton film, and my favorite film for 2003.",
16 December 2003,Fantasy and Reality Blend into Surprisingly Beautiful Film,"I just saw ""Big Fish"" at an early screening last night, and I must say I walked away amazed.

To be honest, I am a big fan of Ewan McGregor's work; I think he is an excellent actor, and I mainly went to see his performance. I saw by looking around at all the Edward Scissorhands t-shirts and Jack the Pumpkin King ski caps that I was surrounded by mainly Burton fans. No matter; I knew I was going to enjoy this film from what I had heard about it, even if it wasn't completely up to par.

However, the film turned out to be fantastic in all ways; you'd really have to press me to find a single flaw. The characters were rich, and perfectly cast (I don't even really like Alison Lohman, but she was THE young Jessica Lange). I really liked how consistent each character was, as far as McGregor being dead-on as a young Albert Finney, and Finney hitting the mark as an old McGregor.

The film was crazily well-written; it was comedic, dramatic, far-fetched, light-hearted, and touching all at once. But what is amazing is that this was all accomplished without being too cheesy, too sickly-sweet, and too unbelievable. What's more, the way the story was told was very interesting; there was seemless transitioning from the past to present, with parts being told from different points of view. Also, each principle character had about the same screen time, which I really liked. The script, direction, and acting were so fresh that I never had a dull moment--the film was always interesting, never boring or lackluster. I didn't look at my watch once.

Tim Burton really surprised me with this one. Of course, I have thoroughly enjoyed a few of his films from the past, but I wasn't sure what to expect from this one. It is by far the most mature film of his to date. I appreciated that it wasn't too ""Burton-ny""--but that's not to say that you cannot see him in this work. It is a true Burton film, down to the last detail, but it's not so out-there that only real Burton fans can enjoy it or understand it. His directing is superb and focused, and I cannot imagine another at the helm of ""Big Fish"".

I can guarantee you will not be disappointed in the acting. Finney is more than convincing as the stubborn, old, and colorful story-teller; Crudup IS the skeptical, annoyed son who really doesn't ""get"" his dad, and who has accepted the fate of never really knowing Edward Bloom; Lohman is the fresh-faced, youthful beauty--the only one who will ever really give Bloom the chance he deserves, no strings attached; Lange gracefully plays the aged wife, the one and only who understands Bloom, who lets him get away with his stories--he is not only devoted to her, but she to him, and you can tell how lucky she feels to have such a loyal companion who loves her unconditionally. But it is McGregor who really shines; he carries the movie and is flawless as the lovestruck, ambitious, curious, scheming underdog. His expressions convey every emotion perfectly, and his is a very honest performance, not matter how far-fetched the story. But every performance, from the children to Helena Bonham Carter, is so truthful, and this is what really makes the story work.

I think the ending was one of the best and least contrived ones I've ever seen in a movie. So, if you're curious, I urge you to see the movie. I really think it's for everyone, young and old, men, women, and children. If you're not curious, you SHOULD be. You really WILL laugh and cry, but mostly you'll be laughing. And I promise the tears are from sheer joy, not sadness. It would be a shame to miss out on this one just because you're not sure of it. Just so you know, my dad's a manly man who hates crappy movies, and I sure as hell am going to take him to this.",10
25 December 2003,AMAZING!,"I am a huge fan of Burton, at least most of his work. I was sorely disappointed by his work on ""Planet of the Apes"", but found that his visual stylings in ""Sleepy Hollow"" were amazing and helped a lacking story. Anyway, on to ""Big Fish.""

Now, I'm not one for the dramatic tear-jerker movies, in fact I try to avoid them like the plague. But I was tricked into thinking this movie was heartfelt and a good movie with a great story, which it is, but by the end I noticed the lump in my throat getting bigger, and that inevitable tear rolling down my cheek. Yes, this movie got me, and not many movies do, at least not like this one did. It really is that good, and if you don't see that then there's something wrong with you, you must not like anything or have had the emotion of compassion taken away.

This movies story is simple, at lease simple to tell. What makes it so good is the underlying meaning, the relationships and chemistry between the characters and of course the emotion that is conveyed.

But alas, this is only my 2 cents. Although just about everyone else in the theater I was in, no matter how hard they tried to play it off or hide it, was crying. So don't listen to those people who say it's just Burton being Burton, cause it is, but it's not at the same time. And this time, lets hope the Academy recognizes his incredible work.",10
21 December 2003,perfectly wonderful,"I thought the movie was absolutely wonderful. Tim Burton is an amazing director. The story is beautifully crafted and the just the visual element was perfect. Seeing it made me happy for the rest of the day, if not the rest of the week.

27 December 2003,"Unbelievable, unimaginable, a must see for Tim Burton fans.","Big Fish is a movie about a father whose life is a mystery to his son. From the beginning it feels as though the father's life is a fairy tale. In his dying days his son tries to find out the truth about his father's life. Tim Burton draws you in to yet another one of his worlds. I left the theater speechless. I laughed, I cried, and I felt as though I should do something big with my life. This movie is a pleasure for any fan of Tim Burton and Danny Elfman. Elfman manages to put another perfect soundtrack to another amazing one of Burton's movies. Do yourself a favor and see this movie.

17 December 2021,Adding Flavour to a story,"When i was a little boy seeing this film on the Halmark channel ...hit kind of diferent .... but now as an adult it all makes sence the story revolves around the Life of a character named Edward Bloom who tells the story of his life guideing us throw his memory's and his son who always had doubts about the autenticity of his story's , i wont reveal plot points but i do have to add that while the story's complexity is focused around diferent time periods ...the way the writer tells it is throw the imagination of the character for example have you ever play'd ""Papers Please"" its about 1 guy sitting in a booth all day stamping passports .... not much to tell huh .... but as you slowly progress in the action it goes to a whole new level makeing the player decide his own fate, being face to face with certain decisions ...and so on so the execution for this film was spot on i havent read the novel but i hope to some day.

If you havent watched this movie then i advice you to do so by all means not based around my review but to see it for yourself and draw you're own conclusions.",10
29 December 2003,Landmark in US film making - No spoilers,"Don't be fooled. Big Fish is not the classic want-to-be ""surreal"" tale with random psychodelic elements. Big Fish is not a movie that ""tries to hard"" to be different or surreal. Big Fish is *real*. It embodies much more than what it may seem at first glance.

After a somewhat decline during his last movies (since his masterpieces ""Edward..."" and ""Ed Wood""), Tim Burton finally decided to explore two more realistic subjects: first; a father-son relationship and second; the story of ones life. Big Fish is left to the viewer to be understood, analyzed, and interpreted. Like any other film, the final interpretation lays on the viewer. However many directors are often biased and leave little room for personal interpratation making their own. Burton, on the contrary, leaves a universe for multiple interpretations. One can wonder how he managed with such a solid plot. Nonetheless, he succeeded.

The beauty of the profound subject, the imaging, the style, and the meaning and purpose of Big Fish, makes it a film to be remembered by many generations to follow. Tim Burton has delivered a masterpiece like never before: a landmark in US filmaking.

10/10 - Big ups for Big Fish",10
1 January 2004,"Poignant, thoughtful and humorous","Although the movie was somewhat slow moving at times, it was charming and funny enough to be very entertaining. This film is a fantasy with serious overtones about family and relationships, both a comedy and a fascinating reflection on human nature. Once again, a very worthwhile effort by Tim Burton.

2 January 2004,"if you are a weepy moviegoer, you'll need tissues","Certainly Tim Burton's best work to date, this movie could have been so much MORE but was still enough to make half the audience sniffle and shed a tear (or several) throughout the last half. If you get sucked in, as I was from the beginning of the credits, you will find yourself transported through a journey that is both whimsical and filled with humanity. If nothing else, this story renewed my faith in the concepts of soulmates, love, and surprise endings.

4 January 2004,Can I see this again without the violence?,"Loved the film but not the violence. Is it asking too much for good films that use creativity to get their points across? Is our culture so tied into fighting that we can't accept people making hard decisions without needing to slug another person? I'd really like to recommend this film to all my friends but that won't happen. This film could have been a classic, but as it is I don't think so.

1 February 2004,Brilliance,"Big Fish is more than a movie, but a deeply woven piece of life and symbolism. Every line and every character holds some symbol of life and the journeys we take. Tim Burton has created a masterpiece that will be remembered for a long time. The acting was amazing, Ewan McGregor plays the perfect part. Many people find this film very confusing and weird, but if you look and follow the film slowly in your mind, you can see how every piece of fiction from his father holds some significance, which eventually leads to a stunning climax. Big Fish is my #1 film of the year. Mystic River and Master and Commander hold no ground. Please see this film and see if you can get as much out of it as I did.

2 February 2004,Subtler than normal,"First up, I'll admit to being a huge Tim Burton fan - I even liked Planet of the Apes - so I had high expectations of this film. Some of the reviews I'd read in the UK press worried me a little, but seeing the film made me remember that critics know nothing - or at least they do when it comes to films I'm going to enjoy.

Without going into the plot (there are 250 or so before me who've done that) this is a visually understated but still typical Burton film. It's done with more subtlety than we may expect, but there is still a lot to see and enjoy while the story unfolds. And Ewan MacGregor has a thoroughly great tiem, and brings real energy and fun to his role, which it needs as the centrepiece of some very tall tales indeed.

11 January 2004,unbeleavable film that provokes many emotions,"The title of this movie has a big significance over the whole story. With many of the other movies directed by Tim Burton, they all somewhat have a dark touch to them. The film starts really dark and progresses too many ""happy"" parts in the story but still retaining its darkness. The interaction between every character comes back in the end, even if you don't think it will. There are also many twists that will make you think. A few things still seem unclear, but I am sure there is a logical explanation for all of these occurrences. Big Fish makes use of many of your emotions. From the emotion of happiness in parts when you think a good thing will happen, or near the end when you're really mixed on Sad and Happy at the same time.

This movie is a must see. If you liked Nightmare before Christmas or along the lines of Edward Scissor Hands, you will defiantly like this movie. Its different, but not that weird. I was expecting a lot different that what it really was, but it was a really good thing.

27 February 2004,The most real substance I have seen in a movie. 10/10,"(My glowingness might seem suspicious, so: I swear I don't work for anyone involved with this movie or anything like that.)

Excellent.

Okay, let me start off by pointing out the fact that, from the summary given by IMDB as well as others, this movie might sound like a weepy chick-flick (no offense to ""chicks"") type thing that's all sunshine and kittens and airheadedness. It's not. This movie should appeal to just about everyone who likes movies, and I do not say this lightly. I saw this movie in a theater with people of all ages (as well as a bunch of younger soldiers, normally die-hard action/comedy types), and from the chatter in the lobby after the movie, it was one of the most well-received of any movie I have ever seen in that theater.

Even if you generally dislike Tim Burton (my opinion of him *was* pretty neutral, slightly on the negative side), you'll probably find this an improvement on a lot of his previous stuff, which was all either kinda thin, or way too dense, plot-wise and in almost every other aspect, in my opinion. He should keep doing this sort of thing. He fits here.

It seemed to me that it was near impossible to find a good summary of the plot of Big Fish, and it struck me while I was watching it that this is because it's such a hard movie to summarize. You can't write a ""form-letter"" kind of summary for it because it's got a formula all its own.

Here's a summary of the movie as I see it.

All his life, Ed Bloom has liked to tell tall tales about amazing things he's supposedly seen and done. His son, William Bloom, was edified by this when he was young, but now he's about 30 and after all these years his father's habit of constantly trying to be the center of attention and telling these same stories to anyone who'll listen over and over again wears on his nerves. He feels that he doesn't really know his father because he knows next to nothing about his father's life. All he's ever heard about his father's experiences up until he was born are the tall tales his father is so fond of telling (Most of the movie consists of vignettes of these stories, featuring Ewan McGregor as a younger Ed Bloom). And now his father is dying, and he's afraid he'll never know the truth. He pleads with his father to tell him of what ""really happened"", but his father refuses to water down his life and spoon-feed it to William, as he basically puts it. As his father grows more and more sickly and weak, William goes digging around trying to piece together an account of his father's real life, he begins to realize that maybe, just maybe, the stories he'd been told since childhood weren't simply larger-than-life myths. Perhaps, he realizes, his father truly is a larger-than-life man. (This idea is subtly given to us in of the flashback vignettes wherein 10-year-old Ed begins to grow very tall. I won't spoil the rest of it, see it yourself, you'll enjoy it.).

There's no way that my summary does it justice, but I hope it's enough to get you to want to see this. This movie deserved a lot more praise (and revenue) than it got while in theaters. We want to encourage more movies like this. It's truly incredible, but you really shouldn't take my word for it; it defies description. Go see or get it on DVD as soon as possible. My new favorite movie. I only wish it was longer. It was worth my $1.75, and had any of the creative department been present I imagine I might have tipped them.",10
11 January 2004,This was great,"I loved this movie. I thought my future husband Ewan McGregor did AMAZING and I just loved the whole story. Now, would I have loved it that much if I wasn't COMPLETELY drooling over Ewan? Maybe not AS much but this movie was definitely a winner. Not everyone's going to like this movie. It was definitely...unique. But it had good meaning and I can't wait to buy it when it comes out on video. I highly recommend it.

11 January 2004,Surprising,"I saw this movie as a Saturday afternoon chill-out matinee with no expectations. I ended up blubbing my eyes out at the end and was sincerely affected, not because it's schmaltzy, trite or over-emotional, but rather because it spoke to real emotions and trials in everyday life. How many of us have had to deal with uncooperative people? Scraping along to make a living? Dealing with horrible bosses? Unrequited love? The death of a parent who we inherently love but don't ""get""? It's a beautiful tale and one that should be seen again and again to get the full measure of it's beauty. Kudos to Tim Burton.

11 January 2004,Outstanding,"Most sons grow up believing their fathers are bigger than life, only to find out later in life that their fathers are only too human. William Bloom grows up believing his father, Edward, is all too human, only to find out as his father is dying that he was actually bigger than life. A powerful story of truth, redemption and most importantly renewal.

14 January 2004,Big Fish in Little Pond: Capra did it better,"While always a fan of Tim Burton, I must admit that my admittedly high expectations were not met here. Even the attention to visuals, from set decoration, to special effects were off the mark for what we have come to expect from Burton. When one is fishing in such over fished waters, it is necessary to offer novelty, not for its own sake, but to advance the story. About 15 minutes into the film, I suddenly found myself thinking OF ""It's A Wondeful Life"". And on that most obvious level of being a ""big fish in a small pond"", I really liked the Baileys much more than the Blooms. Capra's people are connected to their environment by passion and living, while Burton's characters are too often about style and inference. But that's why there are matinees...

18 February 2004,Superb - for any age,"I can only say as I see. I took my eight year old little boy to see 'Big Fish' last night. I was completely carried away by this wonderful tale told so brilliantly well by Tim Burton but I think it spoke volumes that my little boy did not fidget or speak all through the two and a half hours' meander through the mind of a dying man and his son's assumptions that everything his father has ever told him is a big fib! Leaving the superb and imaginative special effects aside, the story is an insight into the life of a kind and generous man who only wants to make the lives of those around him more pleasant and Tim Burton has succeeded in putting it across in a most amusing and moving way. This is not a sickly sweet weepie - although I cried for at least the last 15 minutes of the film - and Tim Burton fans will enjoy the off kilter and slightly unnerving undercurrents that make his films a genre on their own! If 'Big Fish' is anything to go by - onwards and upwards with Willy Wonka - another of my eight year old's favourite characters! Well Done Tim Burton!!!

13 May 2004,Fantasy Forest Gump,"I finally got the chance to rent this movie after wanting to see it in the box office. Almost everything is right in the movie. Great acting by both Ewan McGregor and the mastercard guy, great directing as always from Burton, art direction, cinematography, and special effects. Its very cool pointing out the small references to the earlier Tim Burton movies, shown during the film. I see this story as similar to Forest Gump. It's the adventure of an individuals life as he passes through significant events in time. The major difference is that it has a much wider fantasy level. The ending wasn't up to par with the rest of the movie, but it doesn't hurt it that badly. Overall a very good movie. 4.5/5

22 May 2004,A True Masterpiece,"tim burton's 'big fish' is easily one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. everything in it looks astonishingly beautiful.

from burton's directing to john august's screenplay, ending in such remarkable roles as the ones by albert finney or ewan macgregor, for instance, everything, but everything in it, is magically thrown at you with such simplicity yet so ornamented that gives you a sense of joy and happiness for being seeing such masterpiece. A must see, a must in 21st century cinema.

18 January 2004,An Awsome Movie,"I was suprised at how good this film was. Tim Burton took a easy concept and made it his own. Big Fish is a work of art because it takes a fathers stories and a childs imagination and puts them into one man. Ewen McGregor did a wonderful job at playing ED. He took the role to a whole new place that could have only been done by him. When I first thought about going to see the movie I was a little worried because of the movies that Tim Burton is famous for. I thought it was to be dark and scary. But Tim Burton was totally in his element doing a light and cute movie

22 January 2004,"Dude, it was a great movie.","I have just seen Big Fish and I believe this is a movie that will go down as a cinematic masterpiece. I'm not a huge Tim Burton fan, so I was a little weary, but I thought it was an actually beautiful film. What is important about this film is that it an asthetic film, and just plain visually pleasing. I mean how awesome did it look when Ewan McGregor is standing in the middle of a field of daffodils, and how beautiful the town of Spectre was (the first time we see it), the colors were amazing. I also think that the stories that we see are the listeners interpretation of the events. (Of course the giant can't be like 20 feet tall, but when you hear a guy talking about giants that's what most listeners will imagine.) I have to admit the main reason why I did see the movie was because Ewan McGregor was starring in it (I wouldn't mind more scenes with him), but I was not dissapointed with the stellar acting of Albert Finney etc... What is most important to know is that this is not a ""normal"" movie, so don't go to the theatres expecting to see a ""normal"" movie. I can understand if you don't appreciate all the metaphors, and the abstract quality to this movie, but please to just bash it saying that is sucked. This movie totally did not suck at all.",10
21 January 2004,This film will move you,"I go to the movies to be entertained and somehow, moved. I want to leave the theater thinking ""wow"", I got my monies worth.

A friend of mine told me that Big Fish was, ""different"". With that in mind, I went to see it. Well, it is a little different. But its a magical different. Beautifully filmed, the film seems to go in so many different directions. Each direction is interesting. Then toward the end, the whole story comes together with just a wonderfully magical ending.

I wouldn't call this an action film; nor is it a comedy, although it has many fun and interesting twists. I can't recall a movie in a long, long time, that in the end had viewers both crying and applauding.

Its been a couple days since I saw the film, and I am still smiling inside when I think about it. Go see it. I'm going again.

24 January 2004,Tim Burton's Respectable Masterpiece,"Tim Burton had originally garnered my respect as a storytelling director with Edward Scissorhands (the most comparable of his movies so far to this one), and re-established it with Ed Wood, and when I saw the trailer for Big Fish, I had a feeling this would become one of my favorite movies. This unique story of exaggerated features took some time at the beginning to discover where Burton was headed with it, but as the story progressed I became totally involved and stayed so until the stirring ending. The audience with me in the theater responded with claps of applause. The strong cast worked together seamlessly -- Ewan McGregor, never afraid to take on varying and unique roles (Trainspotting, Eye of the Beholder, Moulin Rouge!) excels as he often does (I could see him becoming a recurring favorite actor of Burton's along with Depp). Billy Crudup takes on his role with the emotional honesty he showed in Almost Famous. The chemistry between Albert Finney and Crudup convincingly relates a broken relationship between father and son. The story is tastefully outlandish, and a striking statement on the differences between fact and truth. 10 out of 10.

28 January 2004,Best Movie I have seen in a long time...,"Big Fish is a must see. Tim Burton has really stepped off on a ledge and made a beautiful, unbelieveably heart wrenching movie. I was glad to see the surreal, dreamlike side that he brings to a film added to this amazing story. Many men even cried at this one...including myself.

Character development is spectacular! It was like ""A River Runs Through It"" meets ""Cirque de Soleil"".

4 February 2004,So this is how we are immortalized!,"Saw The Big Fish at a Radio 4GY (Gympie, Qld.) preview showing at Noosa AMC last night. What a movie...instant classic cult status. An allegory, a fairy tale.

The intellectual interpretation - Dali comes to the big screen...the mundane minutae of life transformed, enlarged and intensely coloured to more real than real. The familiar sliding into the surreal. We are the interpretation of our own dreams, creating our own reality and therefor our immortality. Here life imitates art.

The emotional response. WOW. Laugh, cry, be amazed and totally involved.

My friend and I talked about it, and thoughts it had provoked, for the next 2 hours. Indescribable yet indelible - can't wait to see it again.

15 March 2004,THANKS TIM!,"I really love the magic of Tim Burton's creations but Planet of the Apes has been a big disappointment.I was waiting for a new movie when I knew that Big Fish was in the cinemas. It was an unexpected surprise! I went to the cinema with my father (who loves Tim like I do) and a new dream started... Big Fish is one of the most poetical Burton's film. The relationship with the father, the power of the imagination, the ""absurdity"" of the characters...All these things made me feel good for a couple of hours! I have to admit that in some moment the story has a loss of rhythm but I really liked it. Thank you Tim!

3 March 2004,Literary Parallels for An Excellent Film,"An excellent movie. A throwback to Faulkner and Southerners. Yet approachable. This movie explores some of the same ideas as some works by Faulkner. Most specifically The Sound and the Furry. The ideas that overlap are the concept that one can live on through the stories you tell. Also, the propensity for Southerners to uphold this story telling tradition. Another movie that examines some of the same ideas is Second Hand Lions.

Both are good movies, but Big Fish is in a class of its own. A class of greatness. This movie is a legend about the legends of a legend. Good performances and good directing contribute to a good movie.

29 April 2004,A true testament to the necessity of storytelling.,"Well, I've finally seen Big Fish. This is truly Tim Burton's masterpiece. A true testament to the necessity of storytelling.

Did anyone else see Spectre as a metaphor for heaven? Especially as Ed is descending from the forest (hell) into the vibrant, bleached world of Spectre? Strangely, though, this heaven seems to act as a device of temptation for Ed. Am I alone in this observation?

Also, how many Tim Burton films depict imaginary machines that prepare food? Pee Wee's Big Adventure (Breakfast); Edward Scissorhands (Cookies); Big Fish (Breakfast)... Are there any others?

What does everyone else think?

Is this Burton's best?

6 April 2004,One of Burtons finest,"As for all Tim Burton movies, the photography is excellent. This, combined with the always skilled Danny Elfman on music, makes this movie enjoyable from beginning to end. I was also amazed by Burtons storytelling. Some people say the movie is hard to keep track on. They have obviously not seen many Tim Burton movies. I found it quite easy to follow and maybe that was why i enjoyed it so much; Burton being able to make an easy picture while still holding on to his characteristic signature. (simplicity rules!) I know not all Burton-fans share my opinion on this, but I say this for the ones who found Edward Scissorhand a bit hard to watch. Not because of the story, but the progression of it. But back to the movie: Albert Finney does a marvellous screen performance, even better than in Millers Crossing. And it was a relief to see Ewan McGregor in shape. It made me want to forgive him for appearing in that Star Wars-crap.

7 April 2004,Another wierd and wonderful triumph for tim burton,"Tim Burton certainly has a unique vision. The everyday, and potentially suburban meets with the distorted and the bizzarre to create a surreal, and powerful film. The reunion betwween a dying man and his estranged son, as the son seeks to understand the man his father was- feasible, and ordinary, if a little sad, serves as a basis to transport the viewer into a world of fantastic fairy tales. Witches, giants, and siamese twin lounge singers populate the incredible life of Edward Bloom, played with mastery by Albert Finney as the dying storyteller, and Ewan Mcgregor as the younger, adventuring version. What is most captivating to the viewer, however, is so much not the incredible fantasy of the image, which, it cannot be denied is striking in its grotesque beauty, but the humanity at the centre of the tale. For this is where Burton truely shines- love, and interaction with no element of cloying Hollywood sentimentality. A truly wonderful film.

12 November 2004,A Beautiful Movie,"This Movie is by all definitions a work of surrealism. I love the giant fish ,I love the giant man,the Daffodills and the circus.

The culture and accents of the deep south are charming and spirited,I usually love an honest and brave protagonist that takes on an adventure and takes us all with him. There is not one actor's performance in this film that doe'st fit into the overall feel.This is the kind of movie that one would understandably want to watch once a year for the rest of your life. I do consider it to be surrealism however, I don't mean Salvidor Dali's surrealism , it is very beautiful and magical in it's own right . Burton uses quite a few animal symbolisms ,such as when Danny Divito's character turns into a black wolf and then we hear through the commentary;""I figured that evil is put forth by loneliness and all it really needs is social kindness to be remedied""-I can't quote it exactly-however, we are enlightened when the black wolf becomes playful. I love the creation of the little town called Spectre.And the silly dead pianism of the character by Steve Buscemi as the Poet/bank robber .

The key grip in this film was probably very hard to do and it was done very well-such as the fact that Helena Bonham Carter's character is not only the witch but the little girl Jenny from Spectre all grown up,It is comprehensible ,and covers the span of the protagonist's life time.

Anyone who has the taste for this kind of fairy tale meets mythology will be moved by it's ending,I certainly was,it made me think about my relationship with my own father and his mortality and even my own mortality.Ewan McGreggor is absolutely perfect as the young Edward Bloom,a die hard southern romantic. As for Tim Burton,I'm not sure if he actually wrote this,but it is truly a masterpiece.It's nice to see Burton not wasting his talent on remaking Plant of the Apes etc...(he should stick always to bringing us something new.)

I just wanted to mention one more thing,this is the last movie that Spaulding Gray ever saw in his life.He brought his kids to go see it and said goodbye to them before drowning himself in the East river last winter.I mention this because,If you see this film and YOU GET IT,you will understand that Spauding Gray actually gave his children a great gift to remember him by.",
4 May 2004,Film Overview and Review,"The title and posters may give the impression of Dr. Suess, but this film is Tim Burton at his best. It harks back to his classics, combining the 50s-ness of Edward Scissorhands and eerie forests of Sleepy Hollow, to provide an enchanting blend of fantasy and realism. Burton has found his ideal protagonist in Edward Bloom - a man so tangled up in tales of fact and fantastic that his son William feels he's never known his father. The film is both a celebration of Ed's life and the story of his sons discovery that his dying father is not the liar he always thought him to be. Whether young (Mcgregor) or old (Finney), Ed is loveable and inspirational, partly due to his yarn weaving, but mostly because of his carpe diem, rose-tinted spectacle attitude to life. His entertaining and whimsical adventures include encounters with a giant, a werewolf and a witch, not to mention the films namesake, a great Big Fish - to which there are many allusions during the course of the film. However, the balance of this delightful film hangs by a thread as Will, Billy Crudup, in 4-weddings-and-a-funeral-esk style, delivers a singularly terrible line in an emotionally charged bedside scene. But Burton manages to recover most of his dignity in the final phase of the movie, by reminding us of all the characters who have made us chuckle and entertained us so thoroughly throughout the movie. By doing so, the pieces of the puzzle that is Ed's life, fall into place. It is a beautifully crafted cinematic experience and one of Burton's finest. Sophie Tan",
23 June 2004,BIG FISH AS FASCIST TALE,"Funny how most people disagree with what is so obvious to my way of thinking, or feeling. I found THE BIG FISH a huge FASCIST tale, much worse than FORREST GUMP, to which it is fairly compared to. It is the story of a man who would do anything to get what he wants, totally disrespectful of others feelings and lives, it is a saga of a male imperialist chauvinist conqueror in all aspects of life and what is most annoying is that his crudeness and indifference to others feelings, all his passive aggression, his violent innocence, is not at all contested but seen as 'he was a magnificent man after all' and everyone joins him at the funeral scene blah blah blah. Everyone, well not exactly. Find who are missing and that may get you thinking into my p.o.v. I was so disappointed that Tim Burton appears to service a whole different set of values than I had thought judging from his masterpieces (i.e Scissorhands, Nightmare before Xmas etc) that I now believe that to me, THE BIG FISH is the worst film EVER.

18 May 2004,magic in our everyday life,"A story isn't just something which happened and the others, it is, us, tell. We build stories everyday. We decorate them by adding new things and they grow and grow.

The best moment of the film is the end, when the son understands his father and helps him to die in the most magic way no one has ever imagined. Although the film could look quite surrealistic, like in a parallel world, leaves us a message: we construct our own reality, so, why can't it be magic?

Unfortunately, when the film finishes and you go back to the world, you realize that there isn't place for the magic in this world, and that you won't find any magic town as you walk through the forest. It is a little frustrating but you can dream and no one can assure you that you won't find it someday.

Despite the things which take place in the movie don't usually happen, it makes us dream for a while. You feel like if you were leaving in another world that, although is not ours it could be, and each one can build it in every moment of his or her life, step by step.",
23 May 2004,incorrect,"as a chinese, some part of this movie make me sick, some lines in chinese suck, the chinese troop look like corrupt, evil,and ba.ba.ba. by the way, it say guangdong chinese.OK, it must appear 10 lines.but i only know say something that I truly want,so the movie i don't know how to say .fubulous movie ,tim burton is famous director.

The story revolves around a dying father and his son, who is trying to learn more about his dad by piecing together the stories he has gathered over the years. The son winds up re-creating his father's elusive life in a series of legends and myths inspired by the few facts he knows. Through these tales, the son begins to understand his father's great feats and his great failings.

21 July 2012,Tim Burton = Phenomenal,"Tim Burton did an exceptional job on this film. He took a typical story of a father-son relationship and turned it into something completely unique and unexpected. The story line was slightly predictable but it didn't even matter. The slight predictability is masked by the quirky stories his father tells and how they are interpreted in the film.

Ewan McGregor: perfection. He was absolutely fantastic (my opinion is a bit biased because I love everything he is in). He was so believable even when he was doing entirely UNbelievable things. His character's passion was undeniable and definitely something to be admired.

Overall, the film took a serious story and made it light-hearted. Put simply, it was brilliant. It's so different from anything I have seen before. Fantastic!

16 July 2004,Overall I try to be fair when commenting on a movie!,"This movie was quite possibly one of Tim Burton's most moving movie since Edward Scissorhands. Ewan McGregor's portrayal of Edward Bloom was especially captivating. The softness of the color tones set the mood for the whole movie. The brightness in the flashbacks symbolize the happiness of that time. The somber tones of the reality signify the distress of the present time. The movie over all is excellent. The editing was excellent as well. The way that they break up the somber mood of the present with the whimsical flash backs causes the watcher to feel the moods strongly. Jessica Lange does excellent work at portraying emotion on camera. I suggest everyone see it at least once.

24 April 2005,Stunning,"The story is fantastic, but if you're a fan of the book you may be disappointed. The story's about a man who desperately wants to know more about his father, so he sorts through stories and rumors to try and get the best feeling for his father's life. This movie is definitely Burtonesque. Some of the visual effects and art you'll see in this movie will move you to a point you've never been moved to before. Ewan McGregor does a fantastic job in his role as the father in his younger years. If you're a father or a son, you'll get this movie; but really it's a movie for anyone. Heart-warming, intelligent, funny, and it ends in a way that'll leave you feeling so warm it could bring a grown man to tears. 9.5 stars out of 10.

7 October 2004,A Simple Father Son Movie,"This was one of the better movies that I have seen in the last couple of years. It was borderline bizarre but at the same time if you break it down it was just a story about a father and a son. Many of us can relate to troubled relationships with our fathers or whomever. This movie just touched me in a certain way that I can't remember many movies doing. I just love when he was lying in bed and he commented on how he was growing to fast for his body and maybe where he lived was just too small for him. At the end of the movie there is a Pearl Jam song called Man of the Hour. Since watching this movie every time I hear this song it just brings a smile to my face and I think of ""THE BIG FISH"".

18 October 2004,soulfood,"Got the film out without really knowing what to expect, as I hadn't heard of it. All I can say is that it touched us.. all of us.. my kids (18 and 20 years old).. their friends.. me... Very special.. and anyone who possibly has any kind of finished or unfinished business with his or her dad should see it.. not as a lesson but as a simple ""yes"". It gave me a lot to think about, rather to remember, to laugh and cry about and what more could you wish for... What surprised me was the reaction of my kids... and it gave us a chance to share feelings we hadn't shared in a long time.. and that makes it more than worthwhile.

6 November 2004,A nice and awesome movie overall...,"Well. This weekend i really had nothing to do and just decided to rent a movie again. My decision fell on ""Big Fish"". A movie i was ever interested in and missed in cinema. I really had no intention to rent especially that movie. It just came to me, and in the end it didn't went out as a bad choice.

The story starts a little bit boring, but after 10 minutes i just kept on viewing it. The first blue underwater screens seemed a bit mystical but provided a deep doing. The jumps between being a young man, a man having no perspective and a man with a women and a son are really interesting. They try to show the viewer from how many different perspectives a human can look at events and how these perspectives change during the process of getting older.

Atfer some time the viewer feels like the son of Edward, seeing no reason in his acting and his story telling. All the time i thought it's a drama in the end and an adventure movie in the former time. I was completely wrong. When the son of Edward is experiencing the truth in his fathers

story's, i did as well. I just went to a new perspective on them. I saw a reason, a reason for all what he told his son.

The time line with the death of Edward in the hospital was chosen _perfect_. His son just starts telling a story to his father. A story in which actors he didn't believe. A story unbelievable for him, just telling it to his father cause he wants to hear a story bout his end. On the funeral several people his father described met up. We can't see any action in his face. He is just bluffed.

-> A fantastic story -> A fantastic story line

Things came which i didn't expect first. Awesome work of the actors and the director.

A thumb up. Nice movie for every day and its worth a look at!

18 June 2005,Big Fish The Best of Tim Burton,"I was deeply moved by this film. The hatred of the son for his father resultant of not realizing like many sons the heart of his dad. Sad that only at the end of his fathers life are the sons eyes open. Yes the World War II generation came home with great ideals reminiscent of Don Quixote and Aldonza Dulcinea. Ideals were like fish stories that grew from a mustard seed and took on the Sparta of magical mystical fish tales. Great things bigger then life could be had only with a pure heart dedicated to ones damsel.

I didn't read the book but was amazed at the chivalry and romantic spirit of Daniel Wallaces premiere book. To imagine working for free only to paid with a tidbit of detail each 30 days about the women he had only caught a glimpse of. Or to not fight back and be beat to the ground on request from his love.

Yes these great once held ideals still live in my heart and the appeal of the film is the re-awakening of this once great time filled with the dreams of the greatest generation that ever lived.",10
20 March 2005,"""Have I ever told you about the time...?","Before the time of television and movies, the passing of knowledge and wisdom depended on story-telling and the magic of the story-teller. And with the storyteller's twist, fact and fiction becomes a foggy mist.

William Blooms (Billy Crudup) is on a search for the ultimate meaning of his father's many tales. He tries to learn the truths of his father in his father's dieing days. When it came to story-telling, Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) knew it best. ""Big Fish"" begins with Edward Bloom telling tales about his past at dinner parties, around a campfire, and to anyone else that would listen. Everyone seems intrigued by his stories except his son, Will, who wishes his father would just be able to tell him the truth.

Through the film's constant stream of flashbacks, young Edward Bloom (played by Ewan McGregor), goes through countless adventures, unafraid because as a boy he confronted a witch who foretold the exact moment of his death. In one, he befriends a giant and together they hit the road, but Bloom gets sidetracked in an isolated town called Spectre where the streets are paved with grass and all of the residents walk around barefoot. He leaves only to wind up in the circus, shoveling dung and performing dangerous tricks in the attempt to learn the name of the girl he loves.

This film, with its storytelling premise, has a small resemblance to the 1994 film ""Forrest Gump"" about a mentally challenged man who is put into a variety of situations and real-life events. And while waiting for a bus, he tells his unbelievable tales to on goers. But Big Fish has a different tone that allows for the relationship development and the deeper emotions felt between the two main characters.

Tim Burton engages us with his colorful backdrops and wonderful motif. And since most of the movie is in flashback, we are in a ""dreamy"" state for quite a while. The overall theme of this film is further enhanced by the usage of camera angles, lighting, and color. This greatly contributes to the sense of magic and creativity of Ed's tales and therefore, helps with the exaggerating of the stories that he tells.

""Big Fish"" tells the tale of a son who longs to truly know his father and not just the exaggerated stories that his father tells. And as the foggy mist of fact and fiction clears to reveal nothing, should we, in the end, accept that fog to be truth?",7
4 April 2005,My Facourite movie Ever,"Well, this would have to be one of my favorite's movies of all time and I've seen a lot of movies sos thats a big call. I love it how everything is so subtle yet so emotional, the more u watch it the more u love it. Tim Burton is a genius, it is so dark yet so damn colorful all at the same time. There are some movies which when u walk out of them they really change your perspective on things and make the whole world feel like nothing else matter, this is one of those movies. Not many movies have done that to me.... only a few I cant think of, but this is also the type of movie which makes you want to be a better person and to live life to the fullest and take every day for granted. Not one and thing to say! 10/10 all the way.

27 April 2014,Fairy tale,"First and foremost, I should admit that most of the reason I love Big Fish is that I've seen it 15 times and cried every single time. Its light and airy, creative with a great sense of humor, and yet the true story of a lost connection between a father and son is important enough to get those waterworks going every time.

The main reason this movie is so great is the story itself. It's a return to a storytelling that we'd forgotten about. The recreation of fairy tales that are brand new but seem familiar. Every segment of Edward Bloom's life is mostly believable and just partially fantastical. Instead of delving deep into a false world, Tim Burton adds a bit of a shine and spark to our reality so that it remains recognizable while still amazing us. It is a story told about the life of a man, the end of that life, and the eternal nature of it as it's carried on by his son.

There's something ancient and deeply human about that concept – one that goes back to the earliest cultures on the planet. It's also an idea that's gone out of fashion in a way, but the idea that we can achieve immortality through our children is brought into bright forefront along with the psychological weight of finding elements of your father in yourself, working through distance with a family member, and finding closure. Yes, it's the kind of movie that legitimizes Freud and makes you want to call your father afterward.",10

27 June 2014,The perfect movie,"There are only two other movies I know of that are as charming and sweet as Big Fish, and those are Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption.

The story is riveting and it's just overflowing with a magical atmosphere. I can't imagine anyone portraying the role of young Edward Bloom better than Ewan McGregor.

There isn't really anything else to say. If you like Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption, then grab your girlfriend and go watch it - you will not be disappointed. It's not like the movie cannot stand on its own other than to be likened to Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption, it's just that all three of them will leave you speechless and filled with wonder and joy. I recommend it with all my might.

4 February 2015,Great Movie!,"This is a great movie for people who love stories and especially for children. It may begin like a movie that just contains a bunch of tall tales, but as you begin to get into the movie you realize that there is so much more to the stories then what you first began to think. As you continue to watch you feel like the son does and think the stories may be just a bunch of lies. Then before you know it you're so into the movie that you forget about real life for a moment. Big Fish keeps you in wonderment as you watch it, but the ending is just incredible. I would recommend this movie as one to watch, and especially for kids because it contains so much imagination and exciting characters that will keep children entertained throughout the whole movie. So if you're looking for a fun movie to watch with the kids I would definitely recommend Big Fish as one to watch. The director did such a great job with this movie.

5 November 2005,So they DO still make good movies!,"I don't know why this movie didn't make a bigger ""splash"" in Hollywood. It was terrific. But then again, Hollywood wouldn't notice a movie unless it had at least 50 f-words & nudity...all by the 15 minute mark. So I guess it isn't a surprise after all. The storyline was well planned and left you with just enough mystery to wonder whether or not the stories really WERE true. I hope that I leave my family and friends as happy as this man did with nothing but good memories of me to share. I highly recommend watching this movie, but make sure you have enough tissue on hand. Watch this movie with your kids. They'll get a lot out of it. It truly was heartwarming. I'll be buying this one next.

5 May 2021,Big score for Big Fish,"Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end.

I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.

30 March 2006,Silver Screen Poetry,"(This review may contain spoilers, i do not intend to ruin anything, but for your own sake watch the film first before reading this comment)

Big Fish is just one of those films which can be a dilemma to a critic, as there is so much to talk about and so little to criticize.

Tim Burton's film is an adaptation of a novel of the same name, and the same basic story. As a fan of the book i was a little worried about the concept of a silver screen version...i was very wrong.

The book was labeled as something which would never make its way into cinema simply because it wasn't written to suit a director. Whoever said this must have forgotten Tim Burton. He turned all of those mini-stories and mini-characters into something which watches like poetry (if you take my meaning).

Because that's what the Big Fish tale essentially is: poetry. I mean the story itself is about stories; a father's stories to his son. Tim Burton captured the deep love shared and closer-to-surface tension between father and son brilliantly, never falling once in his streamlined interpretation of the delicate relationship between grown father and growing son.

Not to mention, Danny Elfman's orchestrating is brilliant. He got himself an academy award nomination for his brilliance in Big Fish, and he well deserved it. The pieces that he has created for this film are just beautiful. They fully capture the emotion and sheer...poetry portrayed in the film. Danny Elfman is never always one for subtlety, however in this piece of work he has mastered the art with splendor. The soundtrack is just beautifully poetic, matching perfectly with the delight Tim Burton has created.

Also, Tim Burton has managed to create such a...fantastical world, and yet we take it seriously. Moving trees, werewolves, witches, giants, mermaids, larger-than-life characters...all of these are present in the film, and yet none of them seem ridiculous once shown through Burton's magical style.

Big Fish is a film of magic and splendor; of love and temporary loss; of the past and the present; of father and son.

Big Fish is poetry. However it is seen and heard, not read.

18 October 2005,The last movie to make me cry!,"This and.. ""Its a Wonderful Life"". the last 2 movies in the last 10 years to get me to cry. All in all... a terrific movie, with a terrific story, cast, and ending! From the terrific imagery brought to you by none other than Tim Burton and is truly remarkable mind! He really immersed you into this diegesis of a world where things are always non-proportional and are told with such great heart by our protagonist whom is telling his story as an older (and eventually) dying man. This was most definietely the best movie for me, of 2003, aside from of course ""Return of the King"". If you are looking for a fantastic movie to view, rent, or buy... Big Fish is it! :D

11 February 2006,A lie to live in...,"You can talk about this movie for a lifetime after watching it, yet you have no words to describe it right after you've watched it...

The story is simple, as in much of Burton's projects. A father and son have not been talking for 3 years, after an argument. After those 3 years, a phone call from his mother, Will Bloom (the son) learns that his father has cancer, and with his wife Josephine, flies over to his parents' house.

There can be people who found it complicated and senseless, but for me, it was the second movie i've ever cried in. (The first was Forrest Gump btw)

All i can say is, it was the most beautiful lie i've ever heard, and knowing it was a lie, i just wanted to believe it even after...
