18 August 2015,Beautifully photographed yet sometimes hard to watch,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",8
26 November 2020,The Aviator,"A wildly entertaining look at a larger than life character. The Aviator is another success from Scorsese. Although it doesn't follow the usual gangster theme, it still feels like a Scorsese film and manages to have nearly as great of an impact as some of his others.

Going into this film, I had no idea what it was about. Based on the title and some posters that I had seen, I assumed that it would probably have something to do with aeroplanes (as it turns out, I wasn't wrong). But apart from that, I had no idea what the story would be. I was quite positively surprised, once I realized that it was a biopic, about Howard Hughes. Hughes is the type of character whose name I had heard, but that's where my knowledge ended. As such, I can't say how accurate this film's portrayal of him is. But what I can say is that it didn't feel like he was portrayed only in a good light. Indeed, the film portrays him as a very complex character driven by his obsessions and fears. Doing both good and bad.

The life that Hughes lived, at least as far as it's portrayed in the movie, was full of emotion, pleasure and difficulty. The movie captures all these feelings well. Watching someone live life to the fullest doing whatever he wants to do is, in many ways, very freeing. This is one of the reasons why this movie is so entertaining at times. But the pleasure and the enjoyment weren't without difficulty. Some of the most harrowing and difficult scenes are the most intimate ones. The scenes, where we get to understand that Hughes was in pain, and struggled internally.

Something that I must have always know, but somehow never realized, is the reason why Scorsese's films feel so different. It's because there is no clear beginning or ending or highpoint. These films, be it Irishman or this one, are always snippets of time and life. They follow a character from one point in time to another, never giving context on either side. That's why these films always feel so epic in proportion. In a way, they never end or begin. We, as the viewers, are left to wonder what happened before and what will happen after. Of course, if the film is about someone who actually lived, like The Aviator, we can always open up Wikipedia and read those things. But I like to live it open. I like to create the full story in my head while watching the movie and after it has ended.

It's not exactly a typical Scorsese film, but it feels very much like one. Like his other films, The Aviator is just as much of a spectacle. It's entertaining enough to keep it from ever feeling boring, even though it runs for close to three hours. But, like other Scorsese films, it's also afflictive enough to leave you with more than just entertainment.",8
11 March 2013,A very different and sad look at the life of Howard Hughes.,"Years ago, Tommy Lee Jones made himself famous for playing Howard Hughes in a made for TV movie called ""The Amazing Howard Hughes"". The film clocked in at over three and a half hours and was a wonderful look at the man. Now, about 25 years later, Martin Scorsese has created a new biography of the man--though the film is under three hours long--so naturally things had to be omitted. Considering how complex Hughes was, they easily could have made a mini-series out of his life--but the film STILL is very good and worth seeing despite its brevity (and 170 minutes IS brief given the subject matter). It differs from the Jones film because instead of trying to encompass all of Hughes life, it focuses much more specifically on the psychological decline of the man and really builds a wonderful sense of profound sadness in seeing this decline.

While Leonardo DiCaprio didn't look or sound as much like Hughes as Tommy Lee Jones did, he was quite good in this breakout role--and was nominated for Best Actor. However, the one who managed to earn an Academy Award was Cate Blanchette--who was just wonderful as Katharine Hepburn. Her voice and mannerisms were dead on--and she played the role, at times, in a hilarious fashion. Apart from these two, the other stars of the film are the cinematographers, set designers, director and CGI techs (who managed to create an AMAZING plane crash sequence that blew my mind). Overall, a film that is best seen not as a replacement for the earlier film but an enhancement--and I think seeing BOTH would be a great idea. Well made and well worth seeing.

By the way, isn't it kind of ironic that Alec Baldwin plays the part of a HUGE airline exec--considering Baldwin's recent relationship with some airlines!",9
21 December 2004,Falling Short of Greatness...Again,"Scorsese has such an encyclopedic knowledge and understanding of cinema that every shot, however inventive and daring, is effortlessly composed. The direction, editing and cinematography are all the first-rate work by individuals who are clearly masters of their profession and the production design, costumes and makeup are the best you'll see all year. Their efforts combine to create a world of rich and lavish color, of excitement and glamour. Who wouldn't want to visit THIS Cotton Club in 1935? It's hard to imagine who could trump the technical team for Oscars this year.

With such a perfectly realized world in which to perform, the actors universally do an outstanding job. Despite the criticism of the hardcore DiCaprio-haters, the unprejudiced will observe an excellent performance that takes genuine risks and convincingly conveys the passing of more than twenty years. Importantly, DiCaprio more than holds his own when paired with Cate Blanchett and especially Alan Alda, who both give equally note worthy performances. Blanchett's interpretation of Katherine Hepburn seems spot on, and anyone familiar with the late actresses mannerisms will appreciate the hard work that clearly went into the recreation. Alda, one of the most consistently underrated actors around, delivers another masterclass in restrained character building as he oozes ambition and political dishonesty from every pore.

And yet, despite the obvious talent of all those involved and Scorsese's ability to effortlessly fill three hours, something about The Aviator fails to completely satisfy. Without wanting to sound like a film student, movies should, ultimately, be ABOUT something; love, honor, courage, redemption, the BIG ideas and themes that are the fuel of the plot. What was the drive of The Aviator? A rich guy recklessly spends lots of money to indulge his personal obsessions and gets away with it. We're never told how his experiences change him, and without change there's no journey. Considering the screenplay was written by John Logan, who usually displays a keen interest in showing the emotional evolution of his characters, the oversight is inexplicable. Ultimately then, much like Gangs of New York, The Aviator is simply the sum of it's parts, and however brilliantly those parts are realized, there doesn't seem to be a bigger theme to underpin and drive them.

The Aviator is a perfectly realized recreation of the era and one well worth experiencing. But the lack of a real emotional journey suggests 'all gloss and no substance', and ultimately prevents the movie from being truly great.",8
18 July 2012,Hobbies,"Switching from gangsters to one of the most colorful tycoons of industry Martin Scorsese took the first step in making The Aviator a success when he cast Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes. As he did as J. Edgar Hoover, DiCaprio has the spirit of the man invade his body as he portrays the Texas based industrialist, aviator, and movie producer. He had all those careers at the same time and dealt with a lot demons besides.

The Hughes fortune comes from Howard Hughes, Sr. who patented a drill bit that is the foundation of all oil drilling on planet Earth. If you don't use that drill bit, you can dig for oil with a pick and shovel for however long it takes. It is one of the most profitable patents in the world and it was the foundation of the Hughes wealth.

Which allowed Howard Hughes to indulge himself in two passions which were to all intents and purposes, hobbies. Aviation and movie producing were what drove him. And when we meet him he's shooting and reshooting and reshooting Hell's Angels. A lot of his own money went into the film which eventually was a success and gave Hughes the first of many perks as a Hollywood tycoon, Jean Harlow as played here by Gwen Stefani.

Faith Domergue, Ava Gardner, and most importantly Katharine Hepburn and there were many others follow in the Hughes story. Cate Blanchett won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for becoming Katharine Hepburn. With some of the liberties taken I don't think it's an accident that The Aviator came out a year after Hepburn died at 96. The movie also missed Jean Peters whom Hughes actually married and Terry Moore who is still alive and who claims she did marry him. Jane Russell and The Outlaw and the famous brassiere personally designed by Hughes also get a passing mention.

As for aviation which was his real love, Hughes had a decades rivalry with Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe of Pan American Airlines. Trippe had more friends in Congress, particularly a rightwing Republican Senator named Ralph Owen Brewster played by Alan Alda. Alda got an Oscar nomination himself playing the smarmy Brewster who threatens to destroy Hughes by Congressional investigation. Hughes who was hardly a liberal in his politics totally turned the tables on the Brewster committee and the Senator himself. Not shown in the film but in 1952 Hughes made it his business to defeat Brewster going for a third term and did.

Besides Blanchett's Oscar The Aviator won several others and was nominated for several more including Best Picture and Best Actor for Leonardo DiCaprio.

In my memory Howard Hughes was the eccentric billionaire who stayed in seclusion and ran his enterprises through a network of underlings. DiCaprio does a wonderful job in showing how Hughes became what he was, his mania against germs instilled by his mother. To have all that money and be living in the largest plastic bubble one could create. Hughes made himself a prisoner in his own mind before he became a prisoner of the jail he personally designed.

The Aviator is a marvelous insight into one of the most eccentric and colorful people of the last century.",9
13 February 2005,Open the Door...,"Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator"" is grand spectacle with a reverence for the nostalgic, set in simpler times. As a snapshot of Howard Hughes's life from 1927 to 1947, ""The Aviator"" is a portrait of a man of genius and unmatched innovation, and also a man debilitated by severe obsessive compulsive disorder and extreme depression. ""The Aviator"" has an amazing performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, and a mesmerizing performance by Cate Blanchett, who seems to inhabit the role of Katherine Hepburn-- the love of Hughes's life. However, the one indelible image I have of the film is the scene in which Hughes is frozen in the men's restroom, because he can't make himself touch the door knob for fear of germs and contamination. Granted this was a time before obsessive compulsive disorder existed as a diagnosis. The scene is intended as a dramatic arc, distinguishing a tragic flaw in Hughes. However, for me it seemed overly indulgent, and was curious regarding the scene length. Much like most of the nearly 3 hour movie, this is an exercise in indulgence, and attention to detail that is only that. Scorsese's balance between Hughes's genius and his great suffering is good melodrama, but not very inspiring. I have a particular affinity for Howard Hughes the man. Had John Lone's (and Michael Mann's) story followed Hughes through the 1950's and beyond, the story would be even sadder. ""The Aviator"" illustrates the highs of genius, and the abyss of near insanity. This is an accurate depiction of an amazing man's life, but it is skewed toward the broken aspect. So just personally for me, it was frustrating to watch. To Scorsese's credit, one gets that he has immense compassion for Howard Hughes.

Hughes' life sentence is established in the opening scene. Hughes's mother while bathing the young Hughes, tells him something that perhaps leads to his obsessive compulsive nature. Apparently he is incomplete in his relationship with his mother, and the story surrounding what she said.

Fast forward to 1927, when Hughes left his father's wealthy drill bit tool company in Texas, to be a maverick film maker in California. Hughes is an ambitious and novice film director, but he is smart and has unmatched drive. However, his real genius is as a pilot and an innovative designer of airplanes. His gifts for fame and fortune are established. Hughes (DiCaprio) then pursues a touching romance with Katherine Hepburn (Blanchett). This is the highlight of ""The Aviator"", even amidst the spectacular aerial cinematography, because it is just about relationships that move people. There is a wonderful moment when Hughes lets Hepburn take control of his plane as they fly above Los Angeles at night. As great as the chemistry is between Dicaprio and Blanchett, this romance part of the story goes on a little too long in the context of the movie.

From this point on, the movie becomes increasingly darker. Sure, Hughes has his share of triumphs, but everything is tempered by his spiraling decline into depression and his debilitating obsessive compulsive disorder. The acting is outstanding throughout the picture. This is Leonardo DiCaprio's most mature performance. He truly captures Hughes's intensity, genius, and charm. His suffering also elicits great compassion. Cate Blanchett is outstanding as Kate Hepburn. At first one wonders whether she is doing a caricature of Hepburn. She is not. She is being Hepburn. Blanchett's performance is simply stunning. An unrecognizable Kate Beckinsale is awesome as Ava Gardner. Beckinsale gives surprising layers to Gardner, who is really not all that she appears to be on the surface. John C. Reilly is fabulous as Hughes's CFO. In an understated fashion Reilly's performance anchors the movie. Alec Baldwin as Pan Am CEO, Juan Trippe, and Matt Ross as Hughes's engineer Glenn Odekirk give strong performances.

Scorsese's ""The Aviator"" is spectacular to view, and has a sense of history and tragedy. He offers an interesting portrait of the dichotomy between genius and madness, with an emphasis on the dark. This choice really lost me. ""The Aviator"" is amazing work, that is not very inspiring, though it was probably not intended to do so. That is a bit of a disappointment.",8

22 January 2005,An Interesting Muddle,"""The Aviator""--a biopic of Howard Hughes-- is clearly one of Scorsese's lesser works. Still, a lesser work from Scorsese is far superior to the greatest work of your average director. Here's the rundown:

The first quarter of the film is a total triumph, showing the young Hughes' bold endeavors in film when he produced what was at the time the most expensive and lavish film ever made. Scorsese tipping his hat to old Hollywood is the most fun he has had since ""Goodfellas."" The costumes, set designs, and pacing of this portion of the film are stunning and suck the viewer in.

The rest of the film, despite Scorsese's amazing and vivid attention to detail, is a muddled mess, giving us glimpses into Hughes' obsessive (and compulsive) ways, his womanizing, his ambitious foray into aviation and the early days of commercial flight, his fight against Congress at the end of WWII, and the notorious plight and ultimately single flight of his infamous ""Spruce Goose."" It's all semi-educational and semi-entertaining, but in the end I think the complicated life of Hughes remains a mystery.

As for the performances, they are amazing (thanks in most part to Scorsese, the ultimate actor's director). Leonardo Dicaprio in the title role gives yet another performance that goes against my natural loathing of him, and although he seems a bit too boyish playing Hughes in the latter years (and the film really suffers for it), he's impeccable for the better part of the film. Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn is simply stunning and steals every moment she is on screen. Her look, her mannerisms, and her speech perfectly match the screen legend to a haunting degree. Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin in supporting quasi-villain roles are methodically perfect. And the nicest surprise was Kate Beckinsale, a normally flaccid actress, playing Ava Gardner. She came across as gorgeous, intelligent, and maximized her minimal screen time without ever overtly stealing her scenes. Like Sharon Stone in ""Casino"" and Cameron Diaz in ""Gangs of New York"" Scorsese once again coaxes a great performance out of an otherwise unremarkable pretty face.

In the end, ""The Aviator"" flies high thanks to Scorsese and the acting, even if the real person it depicts remains lost in a muddle of half truths and speculation.",8
19 January 2005,Leo's Masterpiece,"There is no doubt that THE AVIATOR is the masterpiece of both director Martin Scorsese and actor, Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio becomes Howard Hughes. The actor is so profoundly absorbed in the role that the DiCaprio we know from other films cannot be found in this film. It is a bravura performance of great depth and magnitude. DiCaprio richly deserves his first Academy Award.

I have never know much about Howard Hughes. This film opened my eyes to him as a personality, a businessman, aviator and his lavish lifestyle. DiCaprio no longer is the ""pretty boy"" from other films. The expressions he takes on are not handsome, the deeply furrowed brow, one could actually watch him, as Hughes' character, think his way through challenging situations, the mark of a highly gifted actor. Watching DiCaprio evolve into the paranoid schizophrenic Hughes in the latter part of the film is a stunning example of pure acting. Leo deserves recognition for recreating a most difficult personality.

Though the film is long, it never slows down nor gets boring and it commanded my attention from start to finish. It is masterpiece cinema for these two men and for other actors too. Cate Blanchette must be commended for her role as Katherine Hepburn. Every role was played by first rate actors.

If you want to understand a piece of American history from the 30s through the 1940s, this film will illumine you. It may not be the greatest film ever made but it sure is cinema to the max and worth seeing, without a second thought.",10

16 February 2022,Chaotic But Compelling,"The Aviator is typical Scorsese: chaotic, self-indulgent, grandiose and a film clearly different from the indistinguishable blend of movies. As you can surmise, the film is a mixed bag. The scale and artistry are worth noting as is DiCaprio's performance(although it feels like he only kicks into gear for the latter half), but some other parts are too wild. And many of the supporting roles feel artificial and obnoxious i.e Cate Blanchett.

Howard Hughes' life is certainly one worth retelling; a pioneer of aviation and film who struggled with severe mental issues and The Aviator does a fair job accomplishing it.

18 November 2019,Beautiful,"Not too long ago I considered Scorsese to be highly overrated. I'd liked a lot of his films but didn't think any aside from Taxi Driver were amazing. When I heard about The Irishman and how it's a culmination of Scorsese's career, I decided to watch/rewatch all his films.

Now I consider him one of the greatest living filmmakers as many others do. I look forward to checking out the other films of his I fear I underrated.

As for this film, it's a beautiful epic capturing Hughes life with style and grace.

18 November 2021,Golly,"From piloting the fastest plane to cruising a carriage, this movie has some serious pacing issue. First half goes by so fast and it was genuinely the most fun I've had in awhile. Then it all got mixed up like crazy, sometimes it's fast and sometime the scene played out way longer than it should. By the time it reaches the third act the pacing slowed down exponentially, it's like riding a carriage. One other thing that bothers me is the editing and CGI, especially in the flight scenes. Everything feel disconnected in the editing, one time it's showing something and in the next scene it shows a shot of the same thing in a completely different manner and the CGI is poorly animated and unconvincing. Besides all that it was great, Cate Blanchett delivers a great performance. She's enthralling and she's one of the source for the movie's great energy. DiCaprio's performance is downright amazing. He succeeds in portraying a man that is rich, reckless, full of ambition and eccentric. Even when Hughes starts to battle his own demons DiCaprio still nailed it. While at times the CGI and sloppy editing distracted me from the movie it was still a great deal of fun.",7
23 July 2020,Great.,"There are few historical characters who live as intense and interesting as the eccentric and controversial Howard Hughes. He started by inheriting a tool company but his passion for aviation took him to other flights, much higher and more notable, making him one of the pioneers of aeronautics and, also, of spoken cinema. This film is truly luxurious in all aspects and is probably one of the films that will mark Di Caprio's career.

The plot starts with Hughes' efforts to shoot ""Hell's Angels"", first as a silent film and then as a sound film, a super-production that cost him a lot of money. The film also shows Hughes' loving connections to renowned actresses like Katharine Hepburn or Ava Gardner, the US Senate's investigations into public money that he received in order to manufacture military planes that he never delivered, the creation and expansion of TWA Airline and, finally, the psychological disorder that Hughes suffered, and that were related to a serious form of phobia to germs and diseases.

The film was expertly directed by Martin Scorsese and features a luxurious cast led by Leonardo Di Caprio, in one of the most interesting and rich roles of his career, which is already enviable at all levels. The actor worked hard and committed himself deeply to the psychological portrait of the millionaire who, little by little, sees his energy and entrepreneurship undermined by his growing phobia. Beside him is Cate Blanchett, in the role of the willful actress Katharine Hepburn. And here, honestly, I'm not sure what to think. I don't know Hepburn very well, I don't know if what Blanchett did was really true to the portrait of that actress, but I thought that sometimes it seemed a bit like a caricature. Anyway, she won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, which should indicate something. Kate Beckinsale also makes an interesting appearance in the role of young Ava Gardner while Alec Baldwin and Ian Holm were good additions and did well with what was asked of them.

Technically, the film has high production values and a lot of quality. Cinematography is excellent and there is a lot of CGI involved, always of good quality and very realistic. The film is essentially set in the 30s and 60s of the last century, so the sets and costumes rightly make an effort to respond to these changes and put on the right props. The soundtrack also deserves special mention because it not only has an epic and adventurous feel to it, but it is easily heard.",10

This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",9
13 July 2020,The Aviator,"An amazing performance by DiCaprio and spectacularly shot throughout. The VFX was dated, but it didn't detract too much from the overall quality of the film.

18 December 2019,Hughes should be a technological legend,"As a technocrat, I have followed the professional lives of the people that have made the modern computer industry. Individuals such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison and Elon Musk. They are hard-driving people that had great vision, but personalities and egos that were abrasive, to say the least. Much earlier, there was another person in this mold, and his name was Howard Hughes. This movie is an expression of his life, successes and failures. DiCaprio puts forward a superb performance as the mercurial, yet brilliant Hughes. In watching the movie, it was easy to project some of what has been written about Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and simply replace Hughes with either of those two men. Of course, there are two significant differences. The first is that Hughes was at his base a test pilot and a very good one. No one ever questioned his courage and willingness to take great personal risk. The second was that Hughes was also an integral part of the Hollywood movie making scene, which made him top notch fodder for the tabloids. This is a great movie about one of the most underappreciated visionaries of the twentieth century. It is unfortunate that his great flaws were self-destructive, in the sense that they made it impossible for him to function in society in his last years. Had he remained socially and professionally functional, he may have been the greatest of all time.",10
26 December 2004,The Katharine Hepburn Show.,"Before Howard Hughes was a recluse so reclusive as to out-Salinger J.D. Salinger, he was a big time stud, who made big movies, flew fast planes, and courted gorgeous ladies; so say Martin Scorsese and John Logan, architects of this latest Hollywood biopic.' Leonardo DiCaprio continues his trend of turning in great performances with great directors, playing Howard Hughes between 1927 and 1947, the years where Hughes conquered the worlds of film and aviation, making room for romance with Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). In later years, Hughes's mental problems would become legendary; at this stage in the game, he suffers only from pronounced germ phobia and mild obsessive-compulsive disorder. This is all expertly depicted by Scorsese, Logan, and DiCaprio. Stealing all her scenes is Cate Blanchett, who should start making room on her mantle for her Best Supporting Actress Oscar. It couldn't have been easy to play an iconic movie star like Katharine Hepburn, but Blanchett aces it. Kate Beckinsale, Kelli Garner (Faith Demorgue), and Gwen Stefani (Jean Harlow) are the other women in Howard's life, although none are as clearly defined as Blanchett/Hepburn. The villains of the piece are Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda, playing, respectively, Pan-American Airways CEO Juan Trippe and Trippe's bought-and-paid-for politician, Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. Both excel, with Alda coming off as both slimy and goofy at the same time. Alec Baldwin, like Cate Blanchett, steals every scene he has, playing Trippe as a delightfully suave villain. In his final scene he delivers a wonderful monologue on the future of Hughes's Trans-World Airline, and caps it off with the most hysterical use of the F word in many years. Also appearing: the dependable John C. Reilly as Hughes's business manager Noah Dietrich; Jude Law, who apparently can't go two weeks without seeing himself in a different movie, as movie legend Errol Flynn; Brent Spiner (yay!) as airplane executive Robert Gross; and Willem Dafoe as a photographer. ""The Aviator"" is overlong, and drags in places, but it is a great movie. I rate it a 9/10.",9
22 January 2005,For once the hype is accurate! A must see!,"Leonardo Dicaprio, once again, shows his depth as an artist and his ability to carry a film. He deserves the Golden Globe, and his due as an outstanding actor. Howard Hughes, the man, remains a mystery and the portrayal of his obsessive compulsive disorder was a powerful view into his inner hell. The beginning scene set the pace for a journey into his privileged and dark world. The Aviator showed the torments and gifts of genius. Amazing job by all involved!

25 December 2004,"Dark and dour; a saga, not an epic...","Martin Scorsese's Howard Hughes biography flies high and mighty when it does indeed fly--down on the ground, it's aloof, cold and a little slow...and yet, one gets the impression Scorsese doesn't notice. He's an extremely self-satisfied filmmaker who doesn't bother to pick up the pace. When Hughes begins to deteriorate, the movie gets bogged down in the same red-tinged psychological muddle that doomed the entire midsection of ""New York, New York"". The period flavor--as with ""New York""--is careful but unsatisfying, and Leonardo DiCaprio is serviceable in the lead but nothing grander, nothing more than workman-like (his little boy voice strains throughout, cussing like a kid playing grown-up; his height doesn't detract, however, and his weight and demeanor seem correct). Cate Blanchett playing Katharine Hepburn is too fast at the beginning, but finds a more appropriate style; unfortunately, there's too much of her. Thelma Schoonmaker's lightning-fast editing fails her and Scorsese in this instance. We don't need to see Hepburn arriving at the movie studio, turning the lights on and meeting a handsome admirer. Whose story is this? The sequence around the Hepburn family dinner table is, however, a smash, and Blanchett is lovely in her period wardrobe. I didn't believe for a second the impersonations of Jean Harlow (very minor) or Ava Gardner (a big problem) ...and what happened to the ""Outlaw"" controversy? It seems to take place off-screen. The editing also slips up in the final third, allowing scenes to run on too long and letting shots get ahead of themselves (as with DiCaprio behind the wheel of the Hercules, seeming to turn the plane too early). Howard Shore's score is great, Robert Richardson's cinematography is terrific, but ""The Aviator"" is overall a disappointment; an expensive and good-looking lump of coal. ** from ****",5
26 October 2006,Leo's best,"Leonardo D. was absolutely amazing. He was so accurate in the actions of someone with OCD. I have that disorder and he is so relatable. I know that the movie is about Howard Hughes (who was an absolute genius, even though he was a mad man), but Leo's performance was amazing. This is the movie that made people forget his role in Titanic and respect him as the amazing actor he is. I also really liked the costumes and music. The lipstick, the hair... again, they were right on for the period. Cate Blanchett made a perfect Katherine Hepburn. She was able to become the loud, powerful, intelligent woman that was Katherine Hepburn.

If you haven't seen the movie yet you are truly missing out.

14 December 2004,Perhaps the best movie of 2004!,"Leave it to Martin Scorsese, he is one of the few reliable directors who graces in age, still manages to make outstanding movies. I thought his previous film; GANGS OF NEW YORK was the best film of 2002 (and still stand by that comment). Scorsese who was once known for showing us the gritty realistic world of New York City's ""Mean Streets"" with the Little Italy thugs (MEAN STREETS), anti-hero loners (TAXI DRIVER), fallen hero (RAGING BULL), bizarre world of Soho (AFTER HOURS), realistic thugs (GOODFELLAS), gangsters controlling Las Vegas (CASINO; it wasn't in NYC, but it still had the similar theme), guilt ridden paramedic (BRINGING OUT THE DEAD), and the war between immigrants (GANGS OF NEW YORK). This is the Scorsese that all of us know about and remember. Yet Scorsese was also responsible for telling us about a single mother in the southwest struggling to survive (ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE), the final farewell concert of a fantastic rock/folk group The Band (THE LAST WALTZ), and the story of Jesus Christ (LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ). Now Scorsese has become the storyteller of one of the most enthusiastic and eccentric billionaires of recent years, Howard Hughes.

In THE AVIATOR, Scorsese portrays Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) as several different roles: filmmaker, womanizer, entrepreneur, engineer, germ-phobic, and aviator. The film tells about the achievements that Hughes accomplished such as the movies HELL'S ANGELS & THE OUTLAW, the building of an airplane that can fly above 20,000 feet, acquiring TWA and making it a international airline, and the design and building of the largest airplane ever the Hercules (now known as the Spruce Goose). Yet Hughes went through so many conflicts with his business: Pan Am Airline chief Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin), Maine Senator Ralph Owen Brewster (Alan Alda), Louis B. Mayer (Stanley DeSantis); his romance: Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsdale); and himself: paranoia, and obsession compulsion disorder.

THE AVIATOR discusses all of those elements in rich detail, that after watching the movie, you begin to realize the amazing accomplishments that Hughes did. Wonder why the only thing we most remember about Hughes was being a recluse who was afraid of germs. And would like to know more about Howard Hughes and see the films that were discussed in the film.

This isn't a Scorsese film that people want another TAXI DRIVER, GOODFELLAS, CASINO, or RAGING BULL would expect. This is a different kind of Scorsese, one who is telling a story about a man, who is no different that him. A dreamer who dreams big and ignores what his advisors, and partners tell him, then come up with projects with amazing results.

DiCaprio proves that he his under-appreciated actor in this film. While most of the public see him as that goofy kid who shouts, ""I'm king of the world!"" in TITANIC. Yet most don't realize his talent with such roles as in WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE and CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. THE AVIATOR shows that DiCaprio is a great actor, giving a realistic portrayal of the eccentric Hughes in some scenes, and a man who cleanses the germs that represent people he dislikes or negative incidents. Blanchett does a amazing job with her performance of Katherine Hepburn with the way her head is tilted back to the pronunciation of words to the snobbish like personality she has when she is around her parents. While Beckinsdale also does a great job playing the very sexy Ava Gardner who has a love/hate relationship with Hughes, a woman who hates him at times, but will help him when he needs help.

The supporting performances by John C. Reily, Ian Holm, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Danny Huston, and Matt Ross are all top rate and also deserve recognition as well.

And Scorsese proves that he one of the best directors of all time with several elements. First the pacing of the story, the film never drags and at running time of 169 mins. it kept my attention on what was going to be happening next. Second, some of the scenes of the film were of complete beauty and wonder. One scene that blew my mind was during the filming of the aerial scenes from HELLS ANGELS which showed how dangerous it was filming the dogfight scenes from that film, seventy years before computer generated images would replace that technique. Third, the acting by the actors was top notch and very convincing. Finally, the story of Howard Hughes himself was unique and original and I think there will never be another person like Howard Hughes.

This has been quite a year of movies: COLLATERAL, SIDEWAYS, KILL BILL VOL. 2, THE INCREDIBLES, RAY, A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT, THE TERMINAL, FAHRENHEIT 9/11, BOURNE SUPREMENCY, OCEANS TWELVE, CRIMINAL, SPIDER-MAN 2, MEAN GIRLS, HARRY POTTER & PRISONER OF AZKABAN, and SPANGLISH were all films that were amazing and all were among my favorite films of this year (yet I still need to see LIFE AQUATIC and FINDING NEVERLAND). But I think it will be hard to beat THE AVIATOR, for it's story, characters, and epic feel.

The Academy has snubbed Scorsese for 30 years; they did the same thing for Roman Polanski until THE PIANIST. Now I think its time for the Academy to acknowledge Scorsese for his craft and technique. While some people will believe that Scorsese should have won his Oscar back in 1980 with RAGING BULL, or in 1990 with GOODFELLAS, I feel that it's time to recognize Scorsese for something! And THE AVIATOR is one film that I think that most Scorsese devotees (like myself) feel is worthy of recognition. Plus, if this movie wins both Best Director and Best Picture, then two of my favorite directors will win Oscars (Scorsese and Michael Mann, who produced AVIATOR).

So that is why I am rooting and hoping that THE AVIATOR will collect Oscar gold. The best movie of the year, and don't miss it!!!!! ***** (Out of five)",10
4 January 2005,Three Characters,"We all live in our own movies, and particularly like movies of people who do so more literally. Here are three in one film:

Martin Scorsese: My regular readers know that I have been very critical of his films. Sure, they are crafted well enough, but the world he created was not one worth visiting. His films until recently were of the Italian storytelling school which focuses on characters. Those characters do not inhabit their worlds as much as create them. Scorsese's camera, therefore, was affixed to people, almost by a visible thread.

But those of us who watch film seriously know that there is nothing but empty darkness just outside the camera's eye. There's no world, so there can be no God, or fate, or luck or whatever material you imagine fills the river of life. He knows it is a cheat as well and has said so. Just like many other fabulously successful filmmakers who know their work is hollow, in his later years he's tried to mature... to master a greater notion of creation.

""Gangs"" was a success in this regard though an unfinished film because the Weinsteins pulled the plug. It marked a completely different approach to space and context, and I applauded it. Now he actually finishes a movie in the new style. Though this is a story of a man, it is no longer anchored to the man. The camera is now Orson Welles' camera with shots of the space with people in it. So obvious is some of this that when Hughes first retreats, he stays out a room that inexplicably (and unhistorically) has strings tied from hither and yon from objects. Take another look at that room and see all of Scorsese's old camera angles. I think we can welcome Scorsese now as the best new filmmaker of the year. This is as much his story as Hughes'.

Cate Blanchett: Cate is one of three actresses alive who can fold her acting, meaning that she can simultaneously deliver two characters in the same motions. She's at the top of her game here (while Julianne is devolving with an apparently thick husband). Hepburn was an amazing actress, deeply untalented in the conventional measures but capable of engineering her surroundings to suit. Her engineering of the ""Philadelphia Story"" persona is Hollywood legend. She engineered a character that worked, then stepped into it. The old Scorsese would have hired someone like Streep to play Hepburn and lumbered around after her.

The new Scorsese allows Cate to flower and willingly supports the folding: an actress (Cate) playing a character (Kate) who is playing a character. You can see all the conduits of control, all the taught strings at two levels. God, what a great time to be alive!

Howard Hughes: The movie gave the impression that Howard simply inherited his money. No so. He was a brilliant engineer who famously codesigned systems and the engineering organizations to support them. While most of us were barfing at frat parties, he designed a drill bit (often credited to his father) that is still the standard in the industry, together with a set of screw connections that has since become the international standard. That's where the money came from. And though he went loopy toward the end, he ensured that 100% of his wealth (yes, all assets were sold) went to endow the world's largest private research institute.

This was a passionate engineer in a world of monopolistic thugs (Gates take notice), truly what we like to think the ""free market"" is all about. The movie also ignores a key movie connection: He always intended the ""Spruce Goose"" to be made of wood, and because all US manufacturing assets were committed, he designed a production system that allowed small businesses, even backyard groups, to make pieces that would be floated down rivers and successively be glued into larger parts. This (what he called the ""packet production system"") was the first serious research into what we today call ""virtual enterprises.""

When the war ended, he sent his virtual enterprise experts into his film business where they used the system (freely giving away details) to destroy the vertically integrated studio system. Nearly all movies today use his virtual enterprise approach and the Weinsteins (producers of this very film) are the current masters of the system.

Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",
9 November 2020,The way of the future.,"The cinematography (composed primarly of red, green and blue to emulate the look of classic three-strip Technicolor) is beautiful, even if the blue grass is a bit distracting. The performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett are great.

The film can drag a lot during its way too long runtime of nearly three hours as most of Hughes' public life and scandals just isn't as interesting as his career and his condition, but it still remains a really good and very well made biopic.

3 May 2010,Visually stirring and ambitious biopic on legendary rebel billionaire Howard Hughes,"From the talented Martin Scorsesse comes an admittedly ambitious but compelling and visually stirring biopic on legendary rebel billionaire Howard Hughes. Although it is nearly three hours, I don't think the film dragged that much and I was gripped for the whole duration. My problem is to do with the secondary characters though. The Aviator is one of those films where a lot of detail goes into making the protagonist and a few more key characters convincing and relateable, but the secondary characters aren't given as much attention as well. This is not the first film to have this problem though, Kinsey which was still very good had it too, as did Chaplin. Back on target, actors like Willem Dafoe and Ian Holm are not given that much to do, they do fine with what they have, but their characters have the sense of appearing there one minute and disappearing the next. Another problem was that occasionally the drama was lacking, the story was well constructed and paced, and the themes here are very ambitious, but other than well staged plane scenes parts of the more dramatic parts felt somewhat lukewarm.

Complaints aside, this is still a very good film. First of all, it is amazing to look at, the scenery is gorgeous and the costumes are sumptuous. The music is also a delight, beautiful and poignant, dramatic and haunting in others. I loved the small clips of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, orchestrated here and it works(it was originally written for organ you see), and Tchaikovsky's 5th and 6th Symphonies, the latter of which has a final movement that is so heart-rending as it always reminds me of death, don't ask why though. The Aviator is brilliantly directed by Scorcesse, and the script does have moments of meaningful power. And the acting is pretty exceptional. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his better post-Titanic performances here, he proves he is more than a person that is all looks no talent, for he really is brilliant as Howard Hughes. Cate Blanchett is wonderful as well as Katherine Hepburn, and Kate Beckinsale surprised me. Like DiCaprio, she too proves that she is more than a pretty face by giving a really good account of herself as Ava Gardner while looking absolutely amazing in the process. In a smaller role, Alec Baldwin was also enjoyable.

Overall, not absolutely outstanding, but The Aviator is a very striking, ambitious and compelling biopic. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8
9 January 2005,never quite delivered,"Twice in a row I have been disappointed by Scorcese. He has managed to get some good work from most of his performer, but he fails to produce enough emotional punch to make this a classic. There are some segments that are quite impressive because of their production values. Unfortunately there is very little soul in the package. De Caprio does some of his best work here, and both Beckinsdale and Hepburn are quite impressive. Still, near the end I wasn't sure what I had seen. It felt long and tedious in some parts. I was hoping it would get better. I never felt the passion and the fire in the man, never got to the point where I could relate to his victory or the joy he took in his work. There are 5 minutes in ""Azkaban"" where I could feel the joy and glory of flying. I felt like I was watching the sketches or the rehearsals here.

Maybe next time.

17 December 2004,A GREAT American TRAGEDY,"This is an astonishingly beautiful and moving film. Martin Scorcese has created a seminal work -- one that brings the harrowing, big-studio, adult movie making of the 1970's and totally reinvents and reinvigorates it for today's audience.

The story traces the rise and demise of billionaire Howard Hughes as he struggles to find meaning and purpose in a life unfettered by concerns of money, talent or opportunity. Whether trying to get a plane off the ground or a young starlet into bed, Hughes attacks life with a fierce gusto -- plagued and prodded by obsessive compulsive germphobia that constantly threatens to consume and defeat him.

DiCaprio is amazing! It's the performance no one thought he was capable of. It is a dynamic, smart, funny, articulate, intense, mature and ultimately harrowing performance that relaunches his career as one of American's finest actors. At the end of the film, you just want to take him in your arms and sob. It's really that good.

Cate Blanchett is incredible as Katherine Hepburn. At first, I was a little thrown by how bravely she attacked the Hepburn trademark voice, but I was completely won over by the second line. It is a tender, funny, incredibly convincing star turn that supplies the heart for the first half of the film. The scene where she takes Howard home ""for dinner"" with the family is a classic! Kate Beckinsale does a surprisingly fine job with Eva Gardner -- conveying the slow burning passion of this Hollywood icon without ever lapsing into mere mimicry.

But, in the end, this isn't a love story -- it's a war story -- a war between Howard's unstoppable will and his fierce inner demons battling for Howard's soul. It is the major relationship in the movie and the true heart of the film -- one that fuels his eccentric genius and yet constantly threatens to rip his life apart. He tries to ignore it by sleeping with every beauty in town. He tries to outrun it, building faster and faster airplanes. Yet, it is his one constant companion from early childhood to his ultimate, inescapable end. And it is this relationship that leaves you devastated at the end of the film.

Brilliant!",10
30 December 2004,not best picture material,"Since this got a lot of award nominations, I thought it would be better. It was OK, but too long. There is so much to tell about Howard Hughes; you can't do it in one film. And this movie stops when he was still fairly young. We don't see him in his later years when he was really nuts.

The lesson to this movie, if you let unstable people have a bunch of money, then they are going to do some crazy things. Hughes throws money around to build his dream planes and to make movies that aren't very good. According to this movie, his biggest enemy was Pan-Am, who was trying to keep TWA from flying overseas.

Also, the movie shows a lot of his girlfriends, many of whom were famous actresses. It never dwells to deep into his personal relationships though. I'm sure there were many more interesting things about them.

FINAL VEDICT: It was OK, not great. And we learn Hughes sure loved his bar of soap. If you're into biographies then you'd probably like it; otherwise, I would skip it. Also Leo is sort of hot in this, but they have to make him look crazy in some parts. So, it isn't the best film to Leo watch.",7
27 February 2012,Soaring yet falling,"The Aviator is, yet another, Scorsese masterpiece that deals with the life and glory of a character I would've never seen myself liking so much. The story is focused on Howard Hughes, a character who, undoubtedly, is foreign to many people in the present. Hughes inherited his parents' fortune at twenty-two, directed the most expensive movie at the time, spent money worse than a drunken sailor, and was building planes that were set to be used by the Army Air Forces. Enigmatic, yes. But far from a feasible hero.

Hughes is played effortlessly by Leonardo DiCaprio. He has already established that he'll take any role, from J. Edgar to a man on a doomed ship, and he has been on a continuing streak of fantastic films. We can pretend Romeo and Juliet never existed. Here, he accepts the challenge to focus on the glory years of Hughes (1927 to around the early forties), where he was living the dream, then quickly becoming his own worst enemy. DiCaprio's challenge is also presented when he must transition Hughes delicately from a fully functioning, money-hungry womanizer to a slowly, defeatist madmen without overacting or hammering home on the clichés. The result is beyond commendable.

Hughes, himself, was a man that possessed energy, efficiency, courage, and determination in limitless amounts. He had the ability to pick up any woman he wanted, say anything he wanted, and casually ask a woman to marry him like one would say ""pass the salt."" Not only was he a professional ladies man, he was a surreal filmmaker, directing a film called Hell's Angles at twenty-two. After two years of unprecedented hell trying to get the film shot efficiently, right down to cloud formations, he casually tells his business executive, Noah Dietrich (Reily) that he'd like to reshoot it, this time, occupying sound to please a demanding audience. Was he completely unaware of the time and money he put into the silent version, or just a reckless spender of money? Going back to his womanizing ways, one woman Hughes put through hell and high-water was Katharine Hepburn (Blanchett). She had to put up with his increasing OCD habits, not to mention once his name became big because of Hell's Angles, all the starlets that would inevitably follow. She left him soon after, much to his dismay.

What did Hughes do maybe achieve closure or ease the pain? Become involved with more women. One of them was fifteen year old Faith Domergue (Garner) and another being the amazingly beautiful Ava Gardner (Beckinsale).

After his work behind the camera, Hughes put films in the foreground, as he wanted to focus on something bigger; aircrafts. He loved them more than life itself. He had a monstrous idea; to build a blame that could float on water and soar higher than plausible. He would name it ""Hercules,"" a name of piercing accuracy.

The art direction is extraordinary. One of the most thrilling scenes involves something Scorsese rarely uses, but when it is applied, he always uses effectively; special effects. The scene involves Hughes crash-landing in Beverly Hills with the wing of the plane slicing the rooftops of houses like a table saw cutting through a tin can. This scene is fantastic because it doesn't focus on the awesomeness of it all, but it the peril and the exhilaration Hughes must have felt while in the plane. His struggle to get out is absolutely haunting and impossible to ignore.

Apparently, Scorsese mimicked the bipack color scheme used in films back in the day. This adds sort of a lighter, ""easy on the eyes"" kind of tonality that I have not experienced in films in a long time. Green objects appear to be blue, and some of the later scenes are shots using three strip Technicolor. Not only does Scorsese utilize old technology to tell a timeless story, he presents it the way it would've been told back then. Colorized stock footage mainly makes up the aerial battles, which are wonderfully coherent and intense as can possibly be.

Another thing to pay close attention to are the planes. They are scale models, rather than computer creations. This, again, adds to the ""easy on the eyes"" tonality. Everything is natural and looks ravishing, better than anything that could've been created from a software program. It only provides to the already extremely genuine picture we are watching.

Howard Hughes was determined, enigmatic, energetic, courageous, yet a sad figure overall. A man consumed by his fear and his uncontrollable OCD. The later scenes of his life, which I dare not spoil, are so devastating and upsetting they are sometimes hard to watch. Here's a man that had it all, then plummeted into a dark, endless hole of murkiness never to be mentioned again until his tragic death in 1976. Rather than plod along through the most likely noneventful teen years leading up to the production of Hell's Angles, The Aviator chooses to reestablish the glory days of Hughes. The film omits the darker days of Hughes life, such as the sixties and the seventies. What we're supposed to feel at the end is unclear, but one thing is for sure, if we walked out sad, it would be extremely out of place.

Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Kate Beckinsale, John C. Reilly, Gwen Stefani, and Jude Law. Directed by: Martin Scorsese.",10
10 June 2021,"Without name Scorsese and Dicaprio, would 'The Aviator' be praised the same?","The real-life figures and events are way more exciting. One of the disadvantages of biographical film: can you make film more interesting than already prominent figure or already dramatic affair. However, when the film is well-made with solid storyline, the sense of realism and relatability upgrades the quality exponentially. Howard Hughes is a subject that is worth delving into, such an interesting person. However, Scorsese makes him very boring with elongated and very one-dimensional story and slow pace. Hughes' mental illness can be emphasized in many other ways, and Scorsese does not have to make the movie peculiar as this one to achieve that. In addition, portrayal of Katharine Hepburn.... Cate Blanchett is so peculiar, awkward, and theatrical. Blanchett should act Katharine Hepburn as a person not her characters on the screen.

Weird mixture of poor screenwriting, strange performances, vague ambiance, uncoordinated and unfocused development... just PECULIAR movie.",1
25 February 2008,Grand Theft Oscar: Scorsese gets robbed again,"The Academy must have had it in for Martin Scorsese. How could someone amass a resume that includes Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas (among others) and still not wrangle a Best Director or Best Picture Oscar? Here he delivered his best film since Goodfellas only to get stiffed yet again. (Luckily, he finally broke through a couple of years later with The Departed.)

I knew very little about Howard Hughes before watching this film. I think that one of the things that makes this a good biopic is that it made me want to learn more about the man. It was quite interesting to see how Hughes's obsessive nature was a double-edged sword, spurring him on while crippling him mentally.

As far as I'm concerned, this is Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance to date. The entire supporting cast is talented but DiCaprio is in another league altogether. Cate Blanchett also gives a stand-out performance, garnering a well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Katherine Hepburn.

Scorsese's direction is impeccable, as expected, but the art department deserves special mention. The film landed Oscars for art direction, costume design and cinematography, all of which were well-deserved. The film really takes you back to a time and place, namely '20's to '40's Hollywood.

I can't understand why this film isn't appreciated more. Perhaps the downbeat subject matter has something to do with it. Personally, I love the ending with its mixture of triumph and tragedy. Hopefully, with the passage of time this film will not be unduly overshadowed by Scorsese's other fine films.",8
25 May 2005,To know him is to understand him.,"Martin Scorsese directs this biopic that peaks at the life/career of eccentric billionaire industrialist Howard Hughes(Leonardo DiCaprio). Beginning in the late 1920's to the mid 1940's Hughes directed movies, would test fly innovative aircraft of his own design and battle his physical disabilities. His life long phobias and his obsessive-compulsive disorder would cause him to exile himself from friends, lovers and business stalwarts. The world he once believed to own would become a secret world unto himself. Most interesting is his relationships with Katharine Hepburn(Cate Blanchett), Jean Harlow(Gwen Stefani)and Ava Gardner(Kate Beckinsale). Alan Alda plays Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. Jude Law is cast as Errol Flynn. Close business associate Noah Dietrich is played by John C. Reilly. Also in the cast are: Alec Baldwin, Willem DeFoe and Ian Holm. THE AVIATOR runs almost three hours and is well worth the time. Photographed and scored masterfully.

7 April 2019,Possibly one of the worst Scorsese ever,"The fact that Hughes was an intriguing character who lived a mysterious and glamorous life in the golden age of Hollywood does not translate into an exciting movie.

Among the many problems:

the total lack of structure. Seems like there is no screenplay and the passage from one scene to the other is totally random.
the flat dialogue. See Hughes and Brewster's dinner scene as a good example of tedious exchange of words.
the absurd idea that Beckinsale could in any way be a good choice for Ava Gardner. Beckinsale not only does not posses any glamour and style, but also has no physically resemblance whatsoever.


Way too many threads, all undercooked and meshed up in this messy recipe.",3
25 December 2004,Has Martin Scorsese lost it?,"The master of the small movie apparently wants to be the master of the epic film. Unfortunately this is a tall order for anyone, especially for someone who hasn't made a particularly good film (small or epic) since 1990. But at least this time he is trying for a masterpiece and not just pissing away his time with garbage. There will be inevitable comparisons with ""Citizen Kane"" (in fact at one point in the film a reference is even made to W.R. Hearst) but anyone who does so should get a reality check. A more appropriate side-by-side comparison would be Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood"", and this is a comparison that ""Aviator"" loses.

Which is not to say that ""Aviator"" is a bad movie, although certainly it is bad history and is in need of major trimming, it is at least entertaining to watch. One wonders, however, if it will fare well enough at the box office to justify its epic expense. It has a relatively small initial target audience and nothing about the final cut makes one think it will generate word-of-mouth appeal from the wider population.

There are a number of flying scenes and two are very good, the night landing on a golf course and the take-off of the Spruce Goose. There are also two that are very weak. The worst is the setting of a new speed record which has a serious continuity error, the plane on the runway was clearly not the plane in the error (bad pun intended). This was so obvious (one had a partial canopy and one had a full canopy) and they cut back and forth so much that I wondered if I was hallucinating the disparity-hard to believe that it was not handled better. The other was the crash of the spy plane in a Hollywood neighborhood. The cartoonish shots of various homeowners watching their houses being destroyed from the inside would fit a Cohn Brothers comedy but are totally out of place in this film.

The film has one great performance, Cate Blanchette channels the vocal patterns and mannerisms of Katherine Hepburn, her scenes are the highlights of the film and fortunately she has a lot of scenes. It took a lot of courage for Scorsese to not just structure the film around someone as familiar as Hepburn but to have her character played in a manner where she was recognizable to her fans.

Alan Alda does great as a slimy senator, Adam Baldwin is slick as thestrangely likable Pan Am President, Kelli Garner and the other Kate (Beckinsale) are dazzling decoration, and Ian Holm provides comic relief. Apparently Scorsese felt he needed this high caliber ensemble to compensate for miscasting the lead.

And miscast he is; from DiCaprio's first line you know that this will be a painful experience; although perhaps not quite as horrible as you would expect from his prior work. Since Scorsese's break with De Niro after Cape Fear, both director and actor have suffered. You have to believe that the replacement DiCaprio takes direction well and that Scorsese is gambling that he can hit a home run with a weak actor and not have to share the credit for his triumph. But his strategy does not work as their screen version of Hughes utterly fails to capture any of the personal magnetism of their subject. I left the theatre thinking how well Titanic Leo executed the role, for his attempt was clearly earnest; but that almost any real actor could have brought nuances to the part well beyond the scope of DiCaprio's abilities-even under Scorsese's direction. The weakness of his portrayal is not as obvious when he is the only one in a scene but it takes on varying degrees of glaring when he is paired with one of the better members of the supporting cast.

I kept coming back to Johnny Depp's portrayal of Ed Wood and wishing it was he who was playing Hughes. In real life Wood was a strange guy but almost one-dimensional when compared to Hughes. But if your only exposure to them was these movie biographies you would think that Wood was far more intriguing.",6
26 December 2004,Flawed Narrative; Flawed Take on Mental Illness; Great Cate as Kate,"Martin Scorcese's ""The Aviator"" is a long movie -- 169 minutes.

A movie that long has got to have a narrative that drives the film from first frame to last, if for no other reason, than to keep viewers from becoming bored.

Will Scarlett get together with Ashley or Rhett, for example? ""The Aviator"" lacks that narrative drive. There's no one story that propels the film from first frame to last. What there is is a series of episodes, some interesting, some less so. About two thirds of the way through, the film does get boring. You just want it to finish up.

Before that point, there's a lot happening on screen to keep your interest.

There's a lot of money on view here. Hughes' film ""Hell's Angels"" is recreated. You get to watch World-War-I era biplanes swoop and fight in the sky. You watch Hughes crash land a plane. This scene will no doubt bring to mind 9-11, as it depicts a plane crashing into inhabited buildings.

Best of all, you have Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn. This is one of the most extraordinary performances ever seen on film. Stars are stars because they are unique and fabulous; actors playing dead stars usually waste their time -- you can't imitate their charisma and fabulousness; uniqueness is, by definition, inimitable.

Blanchett incinerates any doubt you may have had about her ability to pull off Kate Hepburn. Looking nothing like Hepburn, she conjures everything anyone ever loved or hated about her -- the attitude, the voice, the accent.

Brava, Cate. She all but renders Kate gratuitous.

Kate Beckinsale and Gwen Stefani, as Ava Gardner and Jean Harlow, respectively, can't touch Cate's performance. Luckily, they are on screen for less time.

There's a great scene, too, where Howard is dissed at a dinner party by Kate's obnoxious, limousine liberal, Connecticut family. The best such scene I've ever seen, as good as Susan Sarandon's ""I am working class"" from ""White Palace."" But Cate's performance, and that dinner party, take place in a void. There's no long-line narrative into which they fit, working to bring the movie to a powerful climax.

To the extent that the movie does have a long line narrative, it is a narrative so grim and unappealing that most viewers, if they knew that that's what they were buying a ticket to see, might pass.

The real Howard Hughes was famous for dying an ignominious death, made ugly by his untreated mental illness.

Throughout ""The Aviator,"" there are scenes hinting at Hughes' eventual complete mental breakdown.

For example, Hughes and Hepburn dine out. Erroll Flynn, wonderfully played by Jude Law, visits their table and upsets Hughes' carefully arranged dinner plate. Once Hughes' peas are rearranged, he can't eat. He leaves the restaurant in a panic.

The background of this scene is very lush. Law is as good as Erroll Flynn as Flynn himself. What you are left with, though, is that very creepy, disturbing image of a grown man who is so deviled by undiagnosed, untreated mental illness that he can't finish a meal if one of his peas is moved.

Creepy. Sad. No Exit.

The most the movie comments on this tragedy is to suggest that Hughes' mother made him crazy. This is shameful. For years mothers were blamed for making their children schizophrenic or autistic. These outdated, misogynist ideas wounded innocent people and did not help the mentally ill at all. What was Scorcese thinking? Was he thinking? Scorcese's inability to deal, intelligently, with the theme of mental illness reflects his inability to bring the viewer close to Howard Hughes. I never felt, while watching this big budget, splashy, technically impressive movie, that I was learning a single thing about Howard Hughes. I never felt that I was being brought into his mind, heart, drive, life.

I don't know if this was the fault of the script, or DiCaprio's performance, or Scorcese's direction.

I left this lengthy movie, though, without new insight into Howard Hughes.",5
6 May 2005,"Not a flawless epic, and not Martin Scorsese's best movie, but a very good one.","Howard Hughes was the notorious playboy of the 1930s and '40s who wooed every Hollywood starlet in sight and was responsible for delivering aircraft to the United States government at the cost of $56 million. He ran well over-budget and never delivered any planes, although his monstrosity ""The Hercules"" -- at the time, the largest aircraft in the world -- was eventually built and did, in fact, fly.

""The Aviator"" chronicles Hughes' life -- from his childhood to the point at which he first became obsessive about germs, his hands and so on and so forth. Hughes became increasingly eccentric and insane as time went on and by the end of the film I think Scorsese does something rather brilliant in terms of narrative effect -- I won't give it away but suffice to say it's a nice little conclusion to the movie.

The movie itself is quite good but tries a bit too hard. The acting is top-notch and DiCaprio holds his own as Howard Hughes, proving once again he's more than just a pretty face. Cate Blanchett perfectly imitates Kate Hepburn and Kate Beckinsale is a great Ava Gardner.

However I feel some material could have been cut. Some scenes really held my interest and I momentarily was lost in the film -- then there were sequences throughout which I felt bored and wished it would move on.

Also, I found the subtitles (posted on the screen to introduce new characters, e.g. JOHN SMITH - FRIEND OF HOWARD HUGHES) a rather dubious element -- I expected better from Scorsese... introducing new characters with subtitles seems sloppy and far too easy for such a master filmmaker.

I also felt ""The Aviator"" lacked Scorsese's overall typically energetic visuals, opting more for a bloated epic style -- one gets the feeling Scorsese was in it for the Oscar this year and was out to prove to the Academy that he could make a typical epic. There are a few tracking shots but other than that, it really didn't feel like ""A Martin Scorsese Picture."" On the plus side I found the cinematography quite nice, the musical score entirely fitting, the cameos amusing (Alec Baldwin, Willem Dafoe and Jude Law amongst others), and most of the dialogue believable.

""The Aviator"" is not Martin Scorsese's best film, nor would I call it the best film of 2004. It is not flawless, but it does manage to entertain for the most part and is a solid insight into the life of Hughes. If I had one complaint, I'd say about thirty minutes altogether could have been edited out and replaced with more interesting material (or none at all), but as it stands, ""The Aviator"" is a very good movie.",7
23 December 2004,"Leo, Marty and Cate/Kate honor the best of cinema","I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",10
3 January 2005,An unfortunate disappointment.,"There is several related but distinctive ways to present a life history. Here are just five of them:

1. Fiction: As in Jack London's autobiographical, ""Martin Eden."" This calls for the engagement of story elements where a protagonist is introduced, conflict results from his or her personality and life choices and the conflict is resolved with the effect of having the character changed.

2. Panorama: As in David Lean's unforgettable ""Lawrence of Arabia"" where the subject becomes the pivotal instrument of a historical event and epic magnitude is attained.

3. Pageant: As in Richard Attenborough's memorable Gandhi where the subject actually creates history within the presentation of a story and that story once again reaches epic importance.

4. Chronicle: As in Sunrise at Campobello, the story Franklin Delano Roosevelt, or The Spirit of St. Louis, on the Charles Lindbergh flight.

5. Tabloid: Where a laundry list of yellow press reportage is woven into continuity.

Aviator is the last of these. Here is a by-the-numbers presentation of tabloid headline stories fleshed into sometimes interesting dialogue but never revealing the depths of the man except for one odd, unexplored scene from his childhood with his mother. Nor does the film adequately present Hughes' remarkable influence on the history of aviation. Instead it's tossed off in a casual style except for the depiction of some of his dramatic adventures in aviation while his early career in Hollywood is presented as an exaggerated, frenzied comic strip.

Another curiosity, not a single one of the selected actors in the film bears the slightest resemblance to the celebrity being played. For example, Jean Harlow is played by an ethnic, Mediterranean type of woman in what looks like a tight, cheap blonde wig instead of the airy, blousy colorless hair which was Lombard's trademark. Cate Blanchett does a fine job at emulating the Kate Hepburn voice but has none of her fine, angular facial features. The worst choice was Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, nowhere close.

The physical miscastings are topped by Leonardo DiCaprio who, God bless him, works his little heart out playing Hughes but selling us his Oogie Pringle, Walter Denton teen, nasal soprano voice for Hughes' baritone is challenging. This mismatch is compounded especially for those of us who can still recall the mature, handsome face of Howard Hughes and can contrast it with DiCaprio's still unlined Kewpie appearance.

Perhaps the most irritating part of this picture is in its distortion of Howard Hughes' years where we see, for example, his extreme and radical mental deterioration begin before his famous senate hearings of 1947 which was not the case. My own original and primary research with a long time friend who lived in Vegas and knew Hughes in his final years said to me emphatically that he was not the bizarre psycho with long fingernails and matted hair described in the media back then.

In summary, the film is devoid of meaning and strangely hollow. It is conversely not without some entertainment value. It has some marvelous performances in it, especially that of Alan Alda as Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. However, as a biopic of Howard Hughes I can't recommend it",3

17 February 2005,Romantic capitalism produces fine entertainment,"Marty Scorsese is a Hollywood director with a sense of history who knows how to make very watchable middlebrow commercial pictures. Here he tells the story of one of American capitalism's more romantic heroes in an entertaining and spectacular fashion while not overlooking the demons which drove him. Although this is a big budget production with some stunning aerial scenes it is essentially a character study of a true American eccentric.

I'm not sure many mothers would like their sons to grow up like Howard Hughes but his Mom as depicted here certainly left him with a deep fear of germs. It is a curious feature of the story that despite being obsessed by germs Howard was happy to risk infection by sleeping with countless women and to risk his life flying experimental planes with great daring and gusto. Having lost both parents by the time he was 20, Hughes inherited a prosperous medium sized business which manufactured drilling bits for the oil industry and proceeded to build a huge ramshackle empire, including a film studio, an aircraft manufacturer and TWA, once America's largest domestic and second-largest international airline. He started out by nearly going broke making the World War I aviation epic ""Hell's Angels"", got interested in aircraft design, and constructed some pretty way-out craft, including the Hercules flying boat or ""Spruce Goose"" (framed from timber, aluminium being unavailable), then the largest plane ever to fly. It seems, incidentally that all this was funded by the US taxpayer and the lil' old Hughes Tool Company of Houston, Texas, which was the only part of Hughes's empire to consistently make money.

And then there were the women. Wow. If ever there was a man who lived out his teenage fantasies it was Howard. He is shown here as an adroit seducer who meets his match in Katharine Hepburn, though they break up after she meets the love of her life, Spencer Tracy. One of the best scenes in the film is a lunch at the Hepburn family estate where Howard is confronted with the whole nutty Hepburn family, all of whom seem to have mastered the art of making outsiders uncomfortable. Then there is the beautiful Ava Gardner, who never seems to let Howard get too close, Jane Russell, the lady whose bra Howard famously designed for ""The Outlaw"" (who, still living, is mentioned only), and many others, some dangerously young, though it has to be said that Howard seems to have retained a mental age of 15 or so for most of his life.

There are many fine performances in the film. Leonardo Di Caprico is a plausible, if very edgy Howard, and actually starts to look like him in the later Senate inquiry scenes (for a moment I thought they had slotted Sam Neil into the part). Cate Blanchett, burlier than the real Kate, powers her way through the part of Katherine Hepburn, tomboy. I really enjoyed Alan Alda, almost unrecognisable from his ""Mash"" days, as one of the villains, Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, President of Pan American Airlines, and the other major villain, puts in an avuncular performance which relies a lot on his infectious grin, but it does not seem out of place. On the other hand Kate Beckinsale is a bit too perfectly dressed and too much in control as Ava Gardner  perhaps Marty is suggesting her as a mother figure in contrast to Cate's tomboy sister. Ian Holm was wasted in his minor role as the Prof and Jude Law was superfluous as Errol Flynn.

It's a good story, though at 170 minutes the film is a bit on the long side, and I'm not going to take Scorsese to task for his historical inaccuracies. I wonder however whether the early signs of madness were so evident. Noah Dietrich, the very able executive portrayed by John C Reilly in the film was first employed by Hughes in 1925 and remained no. 2 in Hughes's empire until the late 1950s. In his 1977 memoirs, as I recall, Dietrich says Hughes really only started to fall apart in that decade, particularly after the failure of his marriage to Jean Peters, which falls outside the time frame of this picture. Scorsese for dramatic purposes has to give us a foretaste of what is to come, but it does have the effect of making Hughes seem nuttier than he actually was at the time. Still, this is all-round good entertainment which I'm sure is all Marty intended.

Finally, a special mention for the set designers who, it seems, managed to turn the lobby of the Southwestern University Law School into a fair representation of the fashionable 30s' nightspot, the ""Coconut Grove"".",7
4 February 2006,Leonardo Portrays DiCaprio,"He looks like a little boy trying to play the role of a grownup. Has there ever been a worse casting mistake? With his baby face looks, his high pitch voice, his phony Texas twang, and his forced mannerisms, DiCaprio not only is the wrong actor for the role, he is so distracting as to ruin the entire film.

That's the main problem. Another problem is the part of the plot that deals with the tedious technicalities of early aviation. I found it to be totally not interesting. Maybe it would be of interest to an aviation historian.

In addition, the film gushes with busy hubbub and lots of non-substantive chatter. The screenplay must have weighed a ton. Despite all the dialogue, the film's script lacks an emotional spine, making the film seem shallow, superficial, and insincere.

At a cost of over $100 million and a runtime of nearly three hours, the film conveys an air of superiority. It is very, very impressed with itself. It spews implied bravado. I cringe when I consider that the filmmakers could have made five very good films, costing $20 million each. Those are five films we will never see.

However, if you like DiCaprio, the Hollywood ""star"", you will no doubt like this film. After all, ""The Aviator"" is mostly just a flashy cinematic vehicle to enhance his star status. Viewers looking for an honest and in-depth study of the life of Howard Hughes will need to look elsewhere.",1
6 December 2004,"Ambitious, Impeccably-Acted, DELIVERS","Martin Scorsese's most recent ambitious project does not disappoint.

I just saw this film in a special preview for NYU film students, with Martin Scorsese there to discuss and answer questions after, and I must say, it was pretty phenomenal. It is Martin Scorsese's best work since Goodfellas (this is obvious) and most probably his best work since Raging Bull. DiCaprio's character study of Howard Hughes, and his devotion to this role, is exquisite and reminiscent even of Robert De Niro's in Raging Bull. The film is lengthy, but this compliments it, for the story is riveting and the production is practically flawless (even the combination of computerized processes and more traditional photography was smooth and effective).

The presentation of the film, in an evolving color (from two-tone Technicolor, as Martin explained it to us, to three-tone, to modern by the later sequences) is absolutely stunning, and the cinematography by renowned Robert Richardson, ASC, is some of the best I've seen (and, in my opinion, deserving of an Oscar).

Cate Blanchett was impeccable as Katharine Hepburn, though, at times, I felt that the complexity of her character was never really deeper than a surface analysis.

She did her role flawlessly, but this is not to say that it really Alec Baldwin portrayed one of the flattest villains I've seen in a major motion picture, but, again, this is about Howard Hughes, and DiCaprio's performance is worthy of an Oscar nod at least, and perhaps an Oscar Win (certainly the best performance I've seen all year).

One of my few complaints, though, is the lengthy sequences featuring Howard Hughes as a solo aviator. Though interesting, entertaining even, the film was long enough already, and did not require such an exhaustive analysis of individual flight procedures.

Also, it seems that some of the themes were almost too redundant, such as the ways in which Hughes' psychological problems were performed. Much of the Hollywood history is good, even interesting, but it also sometimes seemed a bit self-indulgent, to the point where you questioned the necessity of ALL of those nightclub sequences in the film.

But, besides those relatively few complaints, it is a spectacular film.

In all: do not miss it.

11 February 2006,The actresses,"For someone who has been watching and watching again Katherine Hepburn's and Ava Gardner's movies for years ,this movie does not make it.It's impossible to believe that the two actresses are ""Sylvia Scarlet"" or ""Pandora"" .Howard Hughes's face is much less familiar so Di Caprio ,whose performance is quite good ,is not such a problem.I have nothing against Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale ,but the fact that they do not look their parts gets in the way.Maybe the younger generations does not have the same problem .

All that remains is quite satisfying and the male cast ,including Ian Holm ,a suave mischievous Alec Baldwin and William Dafoe whose appearance does not exceed 5 minutes ,is uniformly good.Excellent use of ""the outlaw"" excerpts.

4 January 2023,Another Scorsese and DiCaprio masterpiece that is an absolutely must see,"The Aviator (2004) is a movie that I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on HBOMAX. The storyline follows Texas oil drill bit man Howard Hughes who wants to make it big as a movie director as well as design and grow his commercial airline business. He goes head-to-head with some of the biggest commercial airline companies both for commercial flights and government contracts. He lives an exotic lifestyle filled with movie stars, models and issues with germs...he isn't sure which of his interests will lead to his demise, but one of them surely will.

This movie is directed by icon Martin Scorsese (Raging Bull) and stars Leonardo Dicaprio (The Departed), Cate Blanchett (Lord of the Rings), Alan Alda (MASH), Kate Beckinsale (Underworld), John C. Reilly (Stepbrothers), Alec Baldwin (The Departed), Ian Holm (Lord of the Rings), Gwen Stefani (Zoolander) and Jude Law (Sherlock Holmes).

The depiction of this era is absolutely magnificent. The look, feel and temperature are very well captured. The storyline is captivating, unique and unlike any story ever told. Hughes really was larger than life in his foresight and accomplishments. The cast is magnificent, and everyone delivers a tremendous performance. Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn blew me away, very impressive. DiCaprio delivers a brilliant performance as Hughes, his strange behavior, and how his genius and determination got his success before he went mad. The ending is sad, curious and amazing all at the same time.

Overall, this is another Scorsese and DiCaprio masterpiece that is an absolutely must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10
21 December 2016,Sorsese and DiCaprio deliver great work here,"The Aviator is another dynamic film from Martin Scorsese. He has employed his energetic style to the story of the Hollywood mogul / aviation pioneer Howard Hughes, the result is a fast-paced and entertaining biopic. It's a more restrained effort than Scorsese usually delivers and it's pretty obvious that it was going very much for a PG-13 rating given the very blatant method of including one f-bomb to affect this. So the material, while still showing the darker aspects of the title character, nevertheless whitewashes him considerably too – in real life he seemed to be anti-Semitic and racist, while he also killed someone due to dangerous driving (neither of these two aspects made it into this film). What we do see is still a man with many flaws though with his recklessness, excessive perfectionism, womanising and germ phobia. Leonardo DiCaprio really is excellent in the part it has to be said and shows again just what a skilled actor he really is.

Unusually for a biopic the story begins with Hughes already a millionaire and in the middle of making the World War I fighter-plane epic Hell's Angels. We see the money he threw at this picture and his perfectionist attitude leading to it being a very elongated shoot. Despite the film's huge success, he was never fully accepted by the Hollywood old boy's network and was considered an outsider. It's this aspect that has been used to make a hero of Hughes in this film, a man against the system if you will; even though I am sure the truth was less clear-cut given his massive wealth and more unsavoury character traits. Whatever the case, we see him push the boundaries of acceptability in movies with his violent crime film Scarface (1932) and his racy feature film The Outlaw (1943), we see him design ever more ambitious planes, we hear of him circumnavigating the world, and testing aircraft himself (this includes an expertly filmed sequence where Hughes crashes one of his planes into the middle of a populated area), we witness him founding his own airline TWA and in the process gain powerful business and political enemies which leads to a congressional investigation and finally we see a man suffering from paranoia who becomes a mentally ill recluse.

The story of Hughes life certainly was a dramatic one and Scorsese presents it as such. He even had romances with Katharine Hepburn (played brilliantly by Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), which adds a glamorous social life to his high profile public achievements. The lush period detail adds a great deal to proceedings with a beautiful look maintained throughout. Scorsese even went so far as to use an old two-strip Technicolor process for the cinematography which leads to the strange moments where we see fields and golf courses replete with blue grass. So, all-in-all, this amounts to another typically well executed, handsome-looking and energetic effort from Scorsese and his first genuinely great collaboration with DiCaprio.",8
12 December 2021,A beautifully yet accurately crafted biography of a once tycoon,"A beautifully yet accurately crafted biography of a once tycoon It is hard to believe that only after 17 years from its debut that I got the chance to watch this famous movie. The IMDb high rating is not wasted after I watched this show. Be it plot, scenes, costume or cast this film is a sensation.

The plot catches my eye although I was born after Howard Hughes died. Thanks to this revealing biographical movie I finally get to know an epoch making legend like this. It is hard to imagine that a business tycoon with oil drilling background had such diverse interests in other areas like film making and aviation. He was indeed a talent who not only lived his life by ration but probably more by passion. Live your life to the fullest. Isn't that what we say every day and hadn't this been vividly realized by Hughes?

This movie also has captured many other important life details of Hughes. The fanfare he received, the romance he encountered and the planes he designed concertedly give a fuller picture of his personal as well as professional life, many of which have been artistically portrayed by the talented crew. Many scenes are liked by me. The mirthful party scenes, the fine dining scenes and the high flying scenes are all something I enjoy watching as a finer person. Needless to say the costume is an absolute hit, which isn't hard to explain why it achieved the Best Achievement in Costume Design in the Academy Awards.

And just to be consistent with my other reviews I must remark on the cast. It would be hard and almost inconceivable for this movie to win multiple Oscar rewards together with many other accolades without the double shot - Hollywood A listers like Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett. The simple truth is - great movies accomplish great actors and great actors achieve great movies. In particular this movie has convinced me of my DiCaprio's superb acting skills. Yes he has made many other great movies such as Titanic (1997), Catch Me If You Can (2002), Gangs of New York (2002) and perhaps equally important Inception (2010) just to name a few. But I am particularly impressed with his acting in this film which is something I can't explain. Maybe I love this story too much. Cate Blanchett, as we all know, has achieved many awards too.

Altogether from start to finish, plot to scene, and cast to crew The Aviator (2004) is a must see which you will regret not seeing once you see it.",10
1 January 2006,"The Life, Loves And Lunacy Of Howard Hughes","In what is surely his finest performance since ""Titanic,"" Leonardo DiCaprio manages to pull off a brilliant portrayal of the early years of the eccentric (and insane) multi-millionaire Howard Hughes. The first part of the movie deals with the filming and production of ""Hell's Angels"" - Hughes' motion picture about World War I aviators, and it served as an appropriate introduction to a movie that revolved around (as the title suggests) Hughes' fascination with aviation.

DiCaprio is brilliant as he portrays Hughes' gradual descent into insanity. At first, as the movie opens, Hughes displays mild eccentricities (we would probably say today that he suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder.) DiCaprio manages to subtly show us Hughes becoming worse and worse until eventually he loses all touch with reality, managing to return to normalcy for a monumental battle with a Senate Committee over his airline's desire to begin transcontinental flights. Alan Alda was quite good in his role as Senator Brewster, the chair of the Committee, and someone in the pocket of the head of Pan Am Airlines (played by Alec Baldwin.) The depiction of the Senate hearing was brilliant, and left no doubt that Brewster - knowing of Hughes' fragile mental state - was an utterly beaten man, obviously taken completely off guard by a totally in control Hughes.

The film depicts Hughes' various romances, focusing especially on those with Katherine Hepburn (Kate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), which served as an opportunity to show Hughes' growing paranoia. The last scene of the movie is particularly haunting to anyone who knows how Hughes' life turned out. The relationship with Gardner (and the role she played in getting him on his feet before the Senate Committee hearings) was especially interesting.

I enjoyed the movie very much, although it seemed that it dragged a bit in places. Perhaps at times it became a bit too concerned with details (not unlike Hughes himself, actually) and, if we were going to get an almost 3 hour movie about Hughes, it might have been more satisfying to have less detail about these particular years and extend the movie into Hughes' later years. Perhaps fodder for a sequel. Having said that, this is a very good and very interesting movie, which I rate as a 7/10.",7
24 August 2005,flawed but compelling look at a visionary,"It ain't always easy being a visionary and an innovative genius - just ask Howard Hughes, the renowned millionaire, who had three main ambitions in life: to build the fastest airplanes, to make the biggest movies, and to become the richest man in the world. That he achieved those lofty goals at a very great personal cost to himself is what makes his story the stuff of legend. For Hughes also suffered from the demon of mental illness, which manifested itself in chronic obsessive/compulsive behavior, a neurotic fear of germs, and acute paranoia. Martin Scorsese captures all facets of this larger-than-life figure in ""The Aviator,"" a high-flying epic that does justice to a man who became a national icon and the embodiment of the American dream despite his internal weaknesses - and whose legend lives on today.

John Logan's script spends virtually no time on Hughes' youth except for a brief prologue which shows Howard's hypochondriac mother planting those seeds of fear in his tender psyche that would haunt him the rest of his life. The story proper begins with Hughes' efforts to produce what would turn out to be the most expensive film ever made up to that time, the war epic ""Hell's Angels,"" a non-studio work that allowed Hughes to combine his twin loves of movie-making and aviation. If nothing else, Hughes thought BIG, and his capriciousness and profligacy, as reflected in the mounting budget of the film he was making, also spilled over into the realm of aviation, as he began looking for ways to create ever more aerodynamic airplanes at greater and greater cost. His obsession with size culminated in the creation of the ill-fated Spruce Goose, the largest airplane ever made - and one whose airborne career lasted exactly one flight.

Logan and Scorcese also focus on the personal side of Hughes' life, concentrating specifically on his tumultuous affairs with Katharine Hepburn (brilliantly played by Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). His relationship with Hepburn is a particularly telling one because they seem to understand one another so well - so well, in fact, that they are unable to make a permanent go of things and wind up going their separate ways.

As director, Scorcese brings his usual flair and visual inventiveness to the film, soaring highest - as is appropriate, perhaps - in the aviation sequences. The first hour, in particular, moves at a breathless clip, as he weaves the various strands of his epic - yet, at the same time, intimate - story into a cohesive whole. If the truth be told, at 170 minutes, the movies does run a little too long and it sags a bit in its middle section. However, as Hughes begins to unravel psychologically - at one point locking himself in a screening room barely clinging to what little remains of his sanity - the movie becomes a sad but fascinating study of a man in the throes of a nervous breakdown. The scene in which Hepburn converses with Hughes through a locked door, pleading with him to let her come in and help him, is heartbreaking in its poignancy.

As Hughes, Leonardo Di Caprio carries the weight of the film on his frail shoulders, and he does a superb job, hitting new dramatic heights in the scenes in which he both falls to pieces psychologically and rises confidently to the challenge of clearing his good name in a senate hearing. Alan Alda is also terrific as the senator from Maine determined to get Hughes to sell TWA to Pan Am in order to achieve a monopoly on international flight carriers in the future.

The first half of the 20th Century provided fertile soil for individuals like Hughes to grow and flourish, men with the brains to see what the future offered and the guts to reach out and go for it. The film captures the era beautifully through the art deco architecture, the dazzling sets and costumes, and a nostalgia-evoking soundtrack overflowing with familiar period standards.

What Scorcese undoubtedly understands is that Hughes continues to cast a spell over the general public not because of what he accomplished as a moviemaker, an inventor, an entrepreneur, but because he did all those things battling demons that made him both inexplicably strange and, at the same time, more recognizable as a human being with weaknesses very much like ourselves. It is this paradox that creates the kind of mystery a figure needs if he is to remain a source of fascination long after his death. In honor of that spirit, ""The Aviator"" doesn't unravel the enigma of Howard Hughes; it deepens it. And that is as it should be.",8
1 January 2005,A Vivid Portrayal of a Crippled Colossus,"While ""The Aviator"" is Martin Scorsese as a for-hire director, he barrels into it with the same visual zeal for exposing the surface excesses and tragic consequences of unbridled capitalism of 1930's/'40's Hollywood and the aviation industry that he did for the Gilded Age of ""Age of Innocence"" and the Las Vegas of ""Casino.""

There is more than a passing resemblance to ""Citizen Kane"" in story arc and style as the outsider millionaire Howard Hughes seizes the popular imagination to take on The Establishment of the media moguls, business competition and the Congress while bedding stars and battling personal demons amidst a loyal coterie. The metaphors come together in a foreboding scene within the klieg lights of a Hollywood premiere as Hughes, with Jean Harlow on his arm in a cameo by Gwen Stefani, is blinded by light bulbs that crash onto a red carpet strewn with broken glass and is too deafened to partake in PR banter.

From the opening shots of the making of ""Hell's Angels"" Scorsese ties together the two improbable if it weren't true twin obsessions of Hughes, movies and airplanes, so we also see the source of the director's interest in the project. Scorsese's love of old movies comes through as he really gets into Hughes's upstart movie-making techniques outside the studio system and the ratings board. There's almost too many movie clips (though I've seen interviews where Scorsese's descriptions of the airplane footage in the original ""Hell's Angels"" are more thrilling than what's actually re-created here), but they serve as a haunting backdrop for Hughes's deterioration as he silhouettes against replays of his films like Gloria Swanson in ""Sunset Boulevard.""

Leonardo DiCaprio is surprisingly and astoundingly effective as he wouldn't naturally seem to resemble the imposing Hughes. Perhaps that's why Scorsese uses an unusual, for him, number of close-ups which emotionally work as an entrée to Hughes's perceptions, enthusiasms and psychological problems. While DiCaprio is aided by excellent make-up and hair styling as he ages and the character matures and changes, the accent, body language, tortured expressions and seductive intensity are all his. The movie powerfully shows how involved the self-taught Hughes was in the design of his innovative planes and his gutsy piloting. I hope DiCaprio's youth appeal will bring in younger audiences, as the few in the audience I saw it with were clueless about the historical figures and references in the film.

I was leery of anyone taking on Katharine Hepburn so I was surprised not only how good Cate Blanchett was but even more surprised by her chemistry with DiCaprio, which I thought originally was as odd a casting pairing, as well, Hughes was with Hepburn. They really make it work, both together and in a fast-talking dinner with her intellectual, politically active Yankee family.

Alan Alda is terrific as the corrupt senator, but I was surprised that he had his New York accent rather than adopt a Down East one as he was supposed to be a Maine senator. Even in comparison to the climactic Senate hearings in ""The Godfather,"" this ping pong conflict is exciting, helped by the exaggerated production design and theatrical lighting that reflects how Hughes sees the match up in his shaky mental state. (There's no hearing room in Congress that large or would have photographers that close.)

Also in the ensemble Alec Baldwin and John C. Reilly are almost too restrained as, respectively, the Pan Am CEO and Hughes's COO. Ian Holm is delightful in a very small part that helps to show how Hughes kept around him a small group of loyalists who enabled his eccentricities. Jude Law as Erroll Flynn is a cameo and seems to be there only to represent the conventionally dissolute Hollywood as opposed to Hepburn and Hughes being in a parallel trajectory.

Kate Beckinsale is just pretty and has none of Ava Gardner's earthy presence nor brazenness. Even though she talks frankly, she is not a tough dame and she just seems to be playing dress-up in the extravagant period costumes.

Sandy Powell's period costumes are wonderful, even the men's clothes are eye-catching in how they set off the actors' bodies, yet are stylistically appropriate.

The production design is a bit over the top, but it emphasized how outsized Hughes's environment was, as a billionaire controlling a huge airplane factory and airline and as a Hollywood arriviste in the glamorous nightlife. The flying special effects, particularly of the breathtaking Beverly Hills crash, fit the overall tone.

The cinematography is ravishing, over a wide variety of settings and environments.

As usual for a Scorsese film the period song selections are superb. Stay through the credits to hear a Leadbelly song about Hughes. It's fun to see both Rufus and Loudon Wainwright as nightclub entertainers. Howard Shore's score is a bit overpowering, but does work with the exhilarating aerial shots.",9
11 August 2006,A Long Flight,"Overlong but generally engaging biography of the legendary Howard Hughes. DiCaprio is quite believable as the high-flying millionaire. Blanchett is also convincing as Katherine Hepburn. An all-star cast fills out the rest of the cast. This one could have used a good editor as Scorcese decides to give us a complete portrait of Hughes, warts and all, as in nearly three hours of ALL. The scenes of Hughes' withdrawal into a darkened room drag on way too long. The film is at its best in the early parts as Hughes starts his Hollywood career. There is a hilarious scene where Hughes has Prof. Fritz (Holm) explain to the censor's board why Jane Russell's breasts are not obscene.

22 January 2005,Never Gets Off The Ground,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",4
24 January 2006,Verbally Offensive; Visually Fascinating,"Except for one major problem (for me), this was a very entertaining and enjoyable three-hour film, and I am usually unable to sit through long movies.

BAD NEWS - If hearing the Lord's name in vain offends you, be prepared to be offended big-time. This movie may break the record for most GDs said in one major studio film with at least 50. Almost all were said by Leonardo DiCaprio, in the lead role as Howard Hughes. A minor disappointment was that the story ended about 1948. I wanted the see the old man Hughes walking around in Kleenex boxes, in his Las Vegas penthouse and perhaps learn more about the big controversy surrounding his will, a topic that was in the news for months yet I can't recall what the final verdict was.

GOOD NEWS - This was very interesting story, start-to-finish. The acting is superb, especially Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn. Blanchett is just riveting in every scene she's in, and DiCaprio, for that matter, isn't far behind. My favorite scene in the film might be when Hughes tells off Hepburn's snotty, elitist parents. Great stuff there. No phase of Hughes' life is overemphasized from his flying, his womanizing, his illness, his business dealings and the politics against him. All are given an appropriate percentage of film time.

This is a very stylish film, a treat for the eyes courtesy a sharp DVD picture and wonderful camera-work. The fascinating visuals include stunning shots of the airplanes, nightclubs, cars, women, you name it. If the language had been toned down, I would have rated this a ""10.""",8

8 January 2005,Ambitous but flawed,"Any movie directed by Martin Scorsese has to be worth watching and this ambitious, if flawed, biopic of Howard Hughes is certainly well worth the price of a cinema ticket. As he did in ""Gangs Of New York"", Scorsese works with Leonard DiCaprio who here has the most challenging role of his career so far as the eponymous businessman, womaniser, flyboy, movie mogul, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder-sufferer. Thirty-year old DiCaprio works hard at the role and captures the manic energy, tortured expression and obsessive mannerisms of Hughes, but ultimately his boyish looks make this less than ideal casting. Except for a brief and unsatisfactory childhood scene, the film covers only the twenty years 1927-1947 of Hughes' 70 years, a period which enables Scorsese to present a remarkably sympathetic portrait of this complex character which underlines his great vision and commitment to competition - twin virtues of modern-day capitalism. The man's tyrannical behaviour is excused as the product of genius, while his anti-semitism and near fascist politics are overlooked entirely.

Cinema is first and foremost a visual medium and this movie is wonderful to look at. The grand sets and contemporary clothing - enhanced by music of the period - provide a rich evocation of the era, while the appearance in the narrative of so many movie stars of the time enhances the feeling that we have stepped back to a time when Americans were assuming leadership of the world. The realisations of these famous personages is uneven: while Cate Blanchett is brilliant as Katherine Hepburn and a paunchy Alec Baldwin convincing as Juan Trip, Kate Beckinsale is weak as Ava Gardner and Jude Law is disappointing as Errol Flynn.

The real stars of the movie, in many ways, are the aircraft, most of which are necessarily CGI creations. We feel with Hughes as he films from the sky swirling dog fights for his film ""Hell's Angels"", takes Hepburn night flying over Los Angeles, sets a new speed record, twice crashes experimental aircraft, and finally lifts the mammoth 'Moose Goose' a few feet off the water. This film of almost three hours is longer than it should have been, but it is at its most entertaining and exhilarating when it conveys the adrenalin excitement and social transformation of modern aviation.",8
26 December 2004,Gorgeous but emotionally empty,"A curious film in so many ways; it is a truly gorgeous film, great cinematography and editing to keep it as tight as possible but there is something missing at his very heart! It will obviously win Oscars, this is just the niche that the Academy voters are looking for, and I'll bet that it makes a pretty penny....but it sort of reminds me of ""The Last Emperor"" which I have never felt deserved a ""Best Picture"" Oscar in that there is minimal involvement asked of the viewer and a feeling of Who cares??? I disagree that it is a ""must-see"" depending on how much time and energy is available to you, the viewer. I found the other major's of 2004 to be much more involving, particularly ""Finding Neverland"", Spanglish, Sideways and Closer. As James Berardinelli reports, Scorcese would seem to have lost something since ""Goodfellows"".

8 August 2005,"""Howard Hughes, The Aviator""","""The Aviator"" focuses on the brilliant and tragic life of the fascinating madman and genius, Howard Hughes, 1905-1976, (to be precise, 20 years of it, from 1927 when 22 years old Hughes was producing the film ""Hell's Angels"" until 1947 when his most famous aircraft, the Hercules was completed). The film is as amazing and dark as the man who called himself with pride, ""Howard Hughes, the Aviator"". Cinematography, Art Direction, and Editing were perfect in the almost 3 hours long film that never for a moment seemed too long or boring. Martin Scorsese made a spectacular and dynamic picture and Leonardo DiCaprio earns my respect and admiration for his acting - he is one of the most talented young actors now and I will be waiting for his following films impatiently. I trusted him in every scene and he made me feel strongly for and sympathize with Howard Hughes's affliction.

Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin both gave great performances as the corrupted and disgusting Senator Brewster (Alda) and truly memorable Pan-American Airways CEO Juan Trippe, Hughes' enemy and competitor (Baldwin played a delightful villain). Surprisingly for myself, I didn't like very much Cate Blanchett's impersonation of Katherine Hepburn (I usually love Blanchette in every movie I've seen her)  it seemed more like caricature but it is a matter of personal liking or not.

I feel that ""The Aviator"" took off the ground like a huge steel bird and took me with it to the marvelous journey. I also believe that ""The Aviator"" is much better and more interesting film than the last year's Oscar winner - but again, this is my opinion. You, of course are entitled to have yours which may be completely different from mine.",9
1 January 2005,Shockingly poor biopic,"Overly long, boring, badly acted and directed. Shocking how badly Martin Scorcese has fallen off, after triumphs such as Goodfellas not that many years ago. Leonardo DiCaprio is incapable of playing grown-up roles, as he continues to look like an overgrown infant even as he pushes thirty-something. I'm amazed at the gushing over Cate Blanchett's grotesque imitation of Katharine Hepburn- Frank Gorshin does a better one. And don't even get me started on Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, who was apparently a sexless, anorexic coat-hanger instead of a bombshell (much to my surprise). However, the greatest disappointment by far was Scorcese, who completely lost any semblance of a storyteller in favor of cheesy CGI effects and bogus dialog. Too bad, because Howard Hughes was a truly fascinating subject- a deeply neurotic multimillionaire, plagued by obsessive-compulsive disorder, but also a true visionary and aviation pioneer. This movie doesn't do him justice.

1 March 2006,"Great movie, but no masterpiece","This comment on THE AVIATOR deals with the motion picture itself, not with its biographical aspects, since I know too little of the facts concerning Howard Hughes' life.

I can say right away that this movie kept my interest, even with its 170 minutes running time. In fact, I wouldn't have mind to see it even a bit longer by adding a few scenes concerning the controversy and release of Hughes' movie ""The Outlaw"". I eagerly wanted to know more about it. When looking at the story, Scorsese choose to ignore the common rules of scriptwriting. Understandingly, since this is a biography. The film has a spectacular opening, then is toned down a bit and uses a slower pace when it comes to the development of events.

Leonardo DiCaprio took some time to convince me as Howard Hughes. Don't get me wrong, 'cause in this movie he really proves what a great actor he is, no doubt (pun intended, get it?) about that. But it's just that I found him a bit too young to portray Howard Hughes, especially since he doesn't seem to age much throughout the movie. But he did a very good job on portraying Hughes' mental decay. I wasn't quite too fond on the way Cate Blanchett played Katharine Hepburn. She came on a bit too strong and slightly unlikeable. Maybe this was an accurate portrayal of Ms. Hepburn, but since I'm not very familiar with that actress, I rest my case. The rest of the acting was, as to be expected, very good.

I also liked the way the cinematography showed a lot of different tones in color, hereby indicating the different episodes in the time-line of the story. The CGI of the airplane could have used a little more detail, if you ask me. There was even a big error, easily spotted. When Hughes has his attempt to set a new speed-record, the close-up shots of the airplane (with DiCaprio in it) show an open cockpit. The more distant CGI-shots show a closed cockpit. Also DiCaprio's hair doesn't move while flying with an open cockpit (but when he crashes in the field, it does). A few other unrealistic shots are to be found when it comes to special effects, but I won't bother going into them.

I ended up liking this movie more than I expected, but it didn't have the same impact as, for example, A BEAUTIFUL MIND (which I consider to be a much better movie). So THE AVIATOR is just a great movie, but certainly no masterpiece.",8

31 December 2004,A film totally without soul,"Watching this film was torture.

First there was the soundtrack -- tinny sounding music from the big band era which seemed to be coming from schoolroom intercom speakers. Then there was Scorcese's constantly moving camera. What's up with that? He actually made me feel seasick. I had to close my eyes quite a lot during the film.

But worst of all was the treatment -- a story totally without soul. It's fair to compare it with Franco Zeffirelli's recent ""Callas Forever"" which was a touching tribute full of love for the subject matter. There was none of that in Aviator. Scorcese seems not to have liked Hughes very much, which is too bad as it made us uncaring as well.

I gave it a 2. Hubby (who was the one who wanted to see it) gave it a 3. You might want to give it a miss!",2
9 January 2008,Marvelous.,"When it comes to film, my love is primarily focused on two things. I can be swayed and amazed by brilliant metaphors and symbolisms and fantastic technical aspects, but a film is nothing to me without two key ingredients. First, I need power in the performances. Be it subtle inner pain or explosive intensity, it's practically impossible for me to love a film if it doesn't feature some great performances or at least a brilliant one in the lead. Secondly, and most importantly, is the story. The thing I love most about film is the ability it has to immerse me into a story and take me on a journey outside of my own world. Be it through wild comedic adventure, an action-filled extravaganza, a deep, emotional story about characters or a powerful epic drama, I have to love a story to love a film. Luckily for me, The Aviator features a magnificent story of a very complex individual and is anchored by one of the finest performances I've ever seen in the form of Leonardo DiCaprio. While it does have flawless technical aspects (including a score that never ceases to amaze), the film is founded on these two elements. As you well know, Scorsese's film tells the story of the infamous Howard Hughes who led a life full of beautiful women and a huge amount of money to do whatever he pleased with. Hughes decided to put this money towards his huge ambition and his love for film and, more importantly, aviation.

As the film begins we see him working on his debut feature, Hell's Angels, which proudly portrayed his love for the sky and the planes that glide through it. Throughout the production he's met with an enormous amount of obstacles from money troubles to plane troubles to having to reshoot the entire picture because by the time it was finished, the era of silent films was over. We progress through the prominent stages of Howard's life and along the way, Scorsese shows us everything about his life from his relationships with beauties like Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) to his battles with severe mental issues ranging from OCD to bipolar disorder and potentially paranoid-schizophrenia; and all of this is portrayed exceptionally while in the background his aviation empire rises, falls and rises back again and his film career is met with constant turmoil. Scorsese manages everything perfectly so that the viewer is always aware of what's currently on screen, what's happening that we aren't seeing and what has driven the story up to the point we are currently at. It flows at a perfect pace, never going to quickly for the viewer to catch up and never dragging throughout it's almost three hour running time.

Scorsese's direction is perfect as he creates, in my opinion, what is easily his best film since Taxi Driver and one of the finest films of the decade. The film shares a lot of similarities to Scorsese's other widely acclaimed biopic, Raging Bull, and one of the key similarities is that the film is anchored by a wildly intense, unstoppable performance; in this case coming from Leonardo DiCaprio. Taking on someone as complex as Howard Hughes would be an immensely difficult task for any actor, especially one as young as DiCaprio, but Scorsese firmly believed in his abilities (the two previously worked together on Gangs of New York) and his decision pays off in a way that I couldn't have imagined in my wildest dreams. DiCaprio's power is stunning, his absorption into the character goes beyond anything one could have expected and he ultimately creates one of the finest performances I've ever seen. A raw, brutally intense portrayal that perfectly encompasses the legend that is Howard Hughes in a film that tells his story admirably and never cuts corners. Scorsese and DiCaprio both create what is bound to be one of the highlights of their careers and certainly is one of the highlights of this incredible decade of film.",9
17 February 2005,"Certainly a BIG movie, but NOT necessarily a GREAT movie","I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",
22 January 2005,Wonderful film and a must see!,"Truly a spectacular in the sense of capturing the essence of an age and of Hughes himself. While not factual in its day-to-day of Hughes' life, the film reveals the man in his genius, obsessions and eventual decline. Scorsese and DiCaprio are to be congratulated.

The gorgeous and extraordinarily well-acted (by DiCaprio) movie moves through the highlights of Hughes' accomplishments in film and especially aviation. Without Hughes, American aviation would not be what it is today. His bold vision, deep pockets and ability to follow his grand dreams allowed him to create on an incredible scale.

Howard Hughes was a American original as well as an American tragic hero. DiCaprio might play Hughes as more personable than he ever was, that is impossible to know. But I came away no longer just thinking of Hughes as a tragic freak, but instead truly admiring him while having tremendous compassion for his mental illness. What a life!

27 May 2005,Take a pillow,"You'd better take a pillow. This film is so dull it's unreal. It goes from bore to bore. Yes, we knew Howard Hughes was a recluse. So they blame it all on his mother, very Freudian. The descent into madness is very quick, the whole ""hygiene"" plot isn't very well explained at all. I was just bored almost all the time. Even the plane sequences weren't particularly inspiring. basically it's the story of a rich kid left money by his parents and he decides to use it to make films and build planes. More power to him I say. I'd have liked to have seen more of Howard's life explored instead of just concentrating on the Hollywood bit. Jane Russell and Jean Harlow (played by the stunning Gwen Stefani who really looked amazing on screen) could have been used a lot more. Leonardo Di Caprio isn't very watchable at all as Howard Hughes, i think they hired him so the woman would flock in for his nude scenes. A very very very very very very very BORING film. Go see something else.

15 January 2008,The Concurrent Rise and Fall of a Legend,"Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the best actors of his generation. Martin Scorsese is the greatest director of all time. They have made a formidable pair over the years and sometimes I think DiCaprio is miscast for certain roles (""Gangs of New York,"" ""The Departed""), but ""The Aviator"" has DiCaprio's name all over it. This is one of the best, if not thee best, acting performances I have seen since Robert De Niro in ""Raging Bull."" Both characters have their similarities as well. Jake La Motta had his own inner demons which lead to his paranoia about his wife which ultimately lead to the destruction of the people around him and Howard Hughes' demons are brought front and center as we see where it all starts when he's given a bath at an age where the young Howard should be more than capable to cleaning himself. His mother tells him about all the diseases and makes him spell the word ""quarantine."" In this unsettling opening scene we see where his delusions start.

DiCaprio can be hilarious at times and heartbreaking at others. Scorsese and DiCaprio do an incredible job of taking us from the marvel of his genius and innovation in aviation to the destruction of his OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). It starts off slow with a few hints here and there that something isn't quite right with Howard Hughes, but gradually we see more and more and more and more and more until we finally see some horrifying acts from Hughes as he locks himself in his projection room playing reels of his films ""The Outlaw"" and ""Hell's Angels"" over and over and over and over again. These films have been completed and released, but Hughes is still watching. Still looking for these imperfections. He's stuck. He's stuck in his mind and he's stuck in his life and he's stuck in his projection room.

There are some very good scenes with Cate Blanchett, who plays Katharine Hepburn, and quite wonderfully I might add, and by wonderfully I mean terribly annoying, loud, and excessive. The damn woman does not shut up. Howard says, ""I could always hear you."" She replies, ""That's 'cause I'm so Goddamn loud."" Yes you are miss Hepburn, yes you are. They have some great scenes together, but the best one comes when Howard meets her entire family and it's quite possibly the greatest dinner sequence I have ever seen. It's beautifully shot as we watch Howard Hughes struggle to keep up with all the conversations going on at the same time due to his deafness. They are extremely rude people and they bully him and then he finally snaps and we feel so good for him. Katherine Hepburn is a completely different person with her family than alone with Howard. Howard accuses her of acting in her real life and wonders if she even knows anymore. This leads to the destruction of their relationship and leads to more paranoia from Howard Hughes as he burns all the cloths that she had infected. He calls Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly) to tell him to buy him some cloths and then quickly changes the conversation and starts asking him about recorders and asks if he's recording his conversation. This is where Howard Hughes and his paranoia starts to take off.

The best part of the film comes in the third act, during a simple and what some may think as a rather uneventful Congressional Hearing. It's two people cross examining each other, what could be so great about that? You would have to see to understand it. Alan Alda is the villain as Senator, Ralph Brewster, who is trying to pass a CAB Bill through the Senate that will put a monopoly on the air ways giving Pan Am sole possession of the sky. Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) had his people create the bill on their behalf to shut out the competition from Hughes' growing airway company- Trans World America- which is expanding across the Atlantic Ocean into Europe. Brewster and Trippe team up to investigate Hughes as they try to embarrass him in public by revealing all his secrets. They order the FBI to raid Hughes' house over and over again causing Howard Hughes to shut himself off from outsiders like nothing you have ever seen before. They threaten to take Hughes down by investigating what he did with the 50 million he received from the government to build plans that ultimately didn't fly during the war. Howard Hughes can simply sell over Trans World America to Juan Trippe and everything will be forgotten to hide him of the public embarrassment. Alda is spectacular and so crafty, always looking for a way to the top, or always getting his way with a smile on his face, just rubbing his arrogance in the face of everybody. During the Congressional Hearings the film reaches it's climax. This is where Hughes tries to overcome his extremely paranoid state and go to these Congressional Hearings and fight for his reputation. The battle that ensues between Alda and DiCaprio is incredible to watch. The final sequences brings us triumph. Only then are we brought right back down as we see Howard Hughes has not progressed in the final scene. It's a brutal ending it the subtlest of ways. The fact that we seen him at the Congressional Hearings gave us hope that he can somehow recover from his paranoid state; that he conquered his fear. Then, we are shot right back down with the final moments of the film capping off an incredible roller-coaster ride of emotions. The final act of the film is what I thought would undoubtedly give Leonardo DiCaprio his first Oscar, but to my surprise that didn't happen and that's a shame because he is absolutely incredible here. A fan of his or not, you can't deny his greatness in ""The Aviator.""

One of Scorsese' best.

27 December 2004,Aviator Flys-Doesn't Soar,"Leanardo DeCaprio was entirely the wrong person to play Howard Hughes DeCaprio is a pipsqueak while HH was 6'3 . Also HH had dark eyes not brilliant blue . Gwen Stefani should stick to warbling trash and stay away from acting entirely, her brief turn as Jean Harlow is grating like fingernails on a chalkboard . There is precious little of where HH got his money.He inherited a million on his 21st birthday .Nor is there ample explanation of how or what caused HH to disassociate from the world .His mother bathing him well past the age that it is necessary and her going on about germs and such hardly seems to be enough . It was said during HH's father's day ""Sure you can still drill for oil without a Hughes bit, as long as you don't mind using a pick and shovel "". HH's father was the real genius of the family having invented the rotary drill bit for oil exploration . By the way HH's Inheritance in todays dollars is the equivalent of ten million .Plenty for a young man to reinvent the world in his image . Much is made of HH's flying exploits but not much time is given to the 'Spruce Goose' that only managed to reach 70,feet of altitude and only flew for a mile ,hardly impressive stats .Yet Hughes was convinced this aircraft was the salvation the armed forces were looking for . Not much is said about HH's contacts with the CIA and his involvement in many shady deals perpetrated by that agency . Jude Laws cameo as Errol Flynn is alright I suppose as they are both effete in nature . As HH has very little connection to todays generation(movie buying public) this film will flounder and die in a relatively short time . Michael Mann was right to walk away from this project as there just isn't anything new or revealing to say about HH . The script is no revelation nor is the direction . 2 of 5 stars for the 'Aviator' And bye the way all these people debating'Aviator's' opening grosses are missing the fact that only half of the actual gross accrues to the studio the other 50/60% is eaten up by the theaters . So on that scale'Aviator' is without a doubt a bomb . It will be extremely lucky to gross thirty million domestically and will probably do the same over seas . The only thing that can save it is an unprecedented run on DVD .",1
7 December 2020,One of the best films....,"This really is a great film, shows what Howard Hughes did and he did it very well. It's a shame that Alan Alda was cast in it, he's from the 70's and he should stay there.

17 February 2005,My brief review of the film,"A technically very well made film, helped by some fine acting by Leonardo DiCaprio and Alan Alda, it is nevertheless is not at all perfect viewing. Whilst the film is quite a satisfactory biopic, depicting Hughes' experiences well, it never feels deep at all, even though it tackles deep issues. The film just simply does little else other than show Hughes' life, and although that was the point of the film, it feels just a bit too lacking for it to be worthy of a second viewing. At almost three hours in length it feels much too long, and with almost all the supporting characters underdeveloped, it has little other than just its flashiness to hold one's interest. For the technical credits, which are very impressive, and for Leonard DiCaprio's solid performance, the film is worth watching. However I find little to recommend it as a film for which more can be taken out of it with a second viewing.

1 January 2005,The Aviator: 7/10,"I can't really talk about Martin Scorsese's directorial credentials, as I've only seen three of his movies: Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and The Aviator. All of them have the same rating-why is that? Maybe it's Scorsese's inability to keep those movies under two hours (The Aviator clocks in at about three with previews), or since those three movies dealt on real people, did Scorsese and his screenwriters get their life stories wrong? Whatever the case is, they're all good, but maybe I'm just not able to appreciate everything Scorsese does. It's been two years since Leonardo DiCaprio's last role in Catch Me If You Can. He's not what everyone made him out to be after Titanic; he's no longer just an idol of teenage girls. Instead, he's proved himself to be a fine actor, one that's perfect to play Howard Hughes.

In the beginning of the movie, Howard Hughes (DiCaprio) is working on directing a huge epic movie. We have no backstory to him, which may have caused trouble later on. There's no telling of how he got his massive fortune, but I digress. He works for three or four years on his picture Hell's Angels, making it the most expensive movie at that time. The movie follows Hughes through his his tumultuous movie career, pioneering aviation career (such as buying TWA), his relationships with Katharing Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), and his insanity (spoofed brilliantly on The Simpsons, I might add). You'll also see Jude Law as Errol Flynn (in his sixth, and final, role of late 2004).

For its almost-three-hour runtime, The Aviator seemed to go by rather quickly. We have the great Howard Shore score, which is sometime mixed with music from the era, to create an odd-but interesting-effect. Scorsese's direction is great in some parts, but not in others. In the crash sequence, Scorsese finds ways to build up the tension (although the interior of the houses we see look quite late-1990s...), even though we know there's still at least an hour to go in the movie, yet when it comes to the tail end of the movie, when we see Hughes in all of his insane glory, we don't really see how he progressed from a mid-case OCDer to this completely delusional psycho. It's a complete transition. Although we do get a sense that Hughes is becoming more mentally unstable, it's just completely from left-field, and maybe instead of 15 minutes of showing how different he is from the Hepburn family, Scorsese could have showed what pushed him over the edge or something like that.

The movie looked pretty good. The cinematography was pretty good; it's probably the one Oscar that this movie is a shoo-in for. There's DiCaprio's acting, which'll be nominated, but won't win (obviously, Jamie Foxx for Ray). DiCaprio obviously studied Hughes and his mannerisms, and does a good job pulling him off, but can anyone compare him to what Hughes was really like? Acting out someone who no one remembers (personally) is kind of a cop-out for not having to do a top-notch acting job (see, Foxx didn't have it that easy for Ray Charles). Yet he still did a good job, and threw off any lingering ""King of the World"" thoughts that people had about him. Blanchett is quickly rising on my favorite actress list-this and The Life Aquatic back to back, great in both. There's John C. Reilly, who's a good actor, but whose voice is so damn recognizable it's hard to consider him a powerhouse actor. And Alec Baldwin. Remember when, in South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, the Baldwins' house, and everyone was happy? They were happy because Alec Baldwin couldn't play a character named JUAN! That's like Johnny Depp playing Fat Albert. It just doesn't work.

The Aviator is an entertaining movie. Sure, it drags for a bit, and is unnecessarily long, but it's never boring. It's by no means the year's best biopic (that goes to Ray), but it's an entertaining one.

My rating: 7/10 Rated PG-13 for thematic elements, sexual content, nudity, language and a crash sequence.",7

9 December 2004,"Sorry, but, Marty strikes out again!","Okay, I was lucky enough to see The Aviator in Hollywood, along with half of the world celebrities. With all of the hype of this movie, you would think that Christmas is coming early.

This three hour film starts off well enough but seriously loses steam after it's first hour with Hughe's funding of his big project, Hell's Angels, by the end of the film, with the Spuce Goose, barely anyone in the audience was noticing. Blame it on the slow moving script by John Logan which just skims over Hughes life.

Sorry to disappoint you, but, Marty Scorsese strikes out again, with a lackluster script and terrible performances by Leo and Gwen Stafani.

This movie putters along like a tortoise, with an occasional brief appearance from some of Hollywood's greatest early actresses.

However, one of the main problems, is that Leo DiCaprio just is not believable at all as Howard Hughes in the least. He looks, acts, talks, and dresses like Leo DiCaprio. Every time he spoke I thought he was the drifter from Titanic trying unsuccessfully to imitate Howard Hughes, as well as Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind.

There are great performances from Jude Law as Errol Flynn, and Cate Blanchett as Kathrin Heppern.

However, my advice to No Doubt lead singer Gwen Stafani is to keep your day job, because you seriously need acting lessons. You make look like Jean Harlow, but you sure don't act like her in the least. Also, Kate Beckinsale looks strikingly close to Ava Gardner, but, she basically sleepwalks through her role.

Also, I don't think that Marty Scorsese was up to the task of directing the biography of Howard Hughes, I think that Michael Mann should have kept the project, as he is more suited to successfully direct compelling biographies.

I think that Michael Mann and Marty Scorsese should have traded projects this year, with Mann directing The Aviator and Scorsese directing Collateral. I think the results would have been much better.

All in all, not a total disaster, but far from the best film of the year.

Two stars out of four, not worthy of a best picture award in the least.

Far from Scorsese's best work.",1
17 February 2005,"It may not be his best, but it's damn good","Despite its many Oscar nominations, I hadn't heard a lot of great things about the film prior to seeing it. That is why I was very pleasantly surprised when, while watching ""The Aviator"" I was met with what I feel is a truly great film. There are so many things involving the film that could be construed as personal negatives for me: (and more about most of these later in the review) I am not a DiCaprio fan, though I do recognize his talent, I can't stand Kate Beckinsale, and frankly, a 3 hour biopic on someone like Howard Hughes is not a very compelling subject for me. What got me into the theater was that it was a Best Picture contender and ultimately, it is a Martin Scorcese film. I was recently criticized as someone who would only dislike a film by a director I appreciate and follow if it was sheer crap, basically suggesting that I am such a fan girl that I can't discern whether something is good or not, simply because I may idolize a particular director. This is categorically untrue, but a good test of this would have been ""The Aviator"". I am a Martin Scorcese fanatic, and though I have not seen his entire filmography, there are certainly some films I like better than others. ""The Aviator"" was a film that I was afraid was going to be in the ""others"" category, but more importantly, I was afraid that it was going to be nothing more than mediocre, and that Scorcese who is LONG overdue for an Oscar (one of the only things that keeps this in check is that neither Kubrick nor Hitchcock won one either) was going to finally win recognition from the Academy based on his work for this film. About an hour into the picture, however, my fears were assuaged because ""The Aviator"" is truly a great film.

Scorcese's direction is brilliant; he captures the spirit of the time, from the vibrant colors to the lush costumes, to the garish and (almost scary) club performers. ""The Aviator"" is as close to an epic as one can get without donning a gladiator helmet or parting the Red Sea. Scorcese messed with some special effects in ""The Aviator"", something that he hasn't played with too often. One scene in particular, where he is in a plane filming scenes for his film ""Hells Angels"" is absolutely breathtaking. The sets in ""The Aviator"" were huge, the party and premiere scenes were electrifying, and the cast (literally a cast of hundreds, if not thousands) was headlined by some good actors. DiCaprio really was fantastic as Hughes; physically, he didn't seem to embody Hughes until his later years, but I personally don't consider that to be a necessity  look at Hopkins in ""Nixon""; he looked nothing like the man, but his mannerisms spoke volumes. Particularly when DiCaprio was able to chew some scenery during scenes involving Hughes' mental breakdowns, I felt that he not only didn't overact, but he solicited a distinct air of sympathy for the character. (Except for the few people around me who found his episodes humorous, apparently.) ""The Aviator"" is headed by a great actor, and features many excellent performances by supporting actors, but the real standout for me was Cate Blanchett in the role of Katherine Hepburn. Having been a lifelong fan of Hepburn's (particularly of her early work) it took about a minute of Blanchett's performance for me exclaim, ""She's fantastic!"" Contrary to an opinion of one of my fellow theater attendees, Blanchett doesn't just mimic Hepburn, she literally becomes her. If she doesn't win the Oscar for this role (after having been so deserving for her role in ""Elizabeth"" as well) I will be shocked and dismayed.

Of course, there are no perfect films, and ""The Aviator"" is far from perfect. I have never been a fan of the vintage-sounding nasal voiced narrator who appears to be reading items for a news brief on the radio, and Scorcese uses this a lot in the film. By about the third use (out of about 30 uses) I was getting pretty irritated. Though I realize that this is a pretty standard technique in period pieces, it still is annoying and derivative. I also was particularly dismayed by Beckinsale's depiction of Ava Gardner. Beckinsale, who is a homogenous and mediocre (at best) actress in the first place, managed to mess up her really small role by giving Gardner a weird Hungarian sounding accent. Perhaps I am not fully schooled in Ava Gardner's history, but I don't recall her sounding like one of the brides of Dracula. If I'm wrong about Gardner, I'll be happy to retract that criticism, but the performance was still lackluster.

Sure, Scorcese should have won the Oscar for ""Raging Bull"". Probably for ""Goodfellas"" as well. But as easy as it is to want to give someone an Oscar based on their past offerings, it isn't fair to that person or their peers if this occurs. (It would be like if Kubrick got an Oscar for ""Eyes Wide Shut"".) Thankfully, ""The Aviator"" is deserving on its own, and if Scorcese gets the statue (finally) he will have earned it fair and square. ""The Aviator"" is a long film, but with its great pacing, it didn't seem like it. I give the film a very solid 7/10, possibly subject to change if the film holds up in the ensuing years.

15 February 2005,A movie about a man's OCD. Period,"Suppose Martin Scorsese made a biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt which consisted of three hours of discussion of his affair with Lucy Mercer and his Polio induced disability with only slight attention paid to the Great Depression or WWII. Better yet, suppose the movie ended just after FDR's third inauguration with a Republican foe, played by Alec Baldwin, rising and in two or three sentences, acknowledging defeat and predicting that FDR would end the depression and rid Europe of Nazism and Fascism, making it safe for Socialism.

Substitute Howard Hughes for FDR and change paralysis to OCD and you have, ""The Aviator."" Scorsese's thesis is that everything Hughes did was the result of an obsession or compulsion. Hughes compulsively chases (and catches) every beautiful Hollywood actress in the 1930's and 40's. Meanwhile, his obsession with airplanes and perfection drives him to design innovative aircraft that enable him to be the first man to circumnavigate the globe in four days and set new air speed records. We are shown a seemingly endless scene (one of many) in which he is trapped in a men's room because he is so obsessed with germs that he is afraid to touch the doorknob. Strangely, this fear of germs doesn't seem to prevent him from touching the private parts of female movie stars. (It should be noted that Hughes's biographers rarely if ever mention his disorder as occurring prior to the late 1950's.) As if in answer to my most fervent prayers, the movie finally concludes in a 1947 scene (after Hughes has defeated the U. S. Senate and several couples have left the theater, but before he has established his business empire) by having Alec Baldwin, as the head of Pan Am, predict Hughes's accomplishments in the 50's and 60's (which should have been shown in scenes replacing those of catch me, catch me with starlets and Hughes suffering from the OCD he had not yet acquired).

Cate Blanchett, currently the best actress in Hollywood, is outstanding as Kate Hepburne. Leo DeCaprio is not credible as a giant like Howard Hughes. He isn't helped by having to spend the duration of the movie displaying a facial expression which seems to say, ""I have to find a men's room, fast."" For this atrocity, Scorsese should be exiled to movie hell in Northern Minnesota making movies about female iron workers filing sexual harassment law suits.",1
21 January 2007,Reflexive,"Those of us familiar with Scorsese's long career know what we're seeing - the ideal vehicle (Hughes' story) for him to reflect on and direct commentary right back at himself.

Scorsese spent much of his early years pushing against similar 'Code' restrictions on sex and violence in film. He put manic energy into everything he did, and survived addiction (paralleled in this movie as the womanizing and obsessive-compulsions). He later battled skeptics and naysayers who questioned his budgets.

But what makes this worth watching as a movie is the completion of his paradigm shift from character excess and character fixation to the ability to capture a world and move about it as he wills. ""Gangs..."" hinted at this, but tripped over its detail-consciousness. Here the camera is free to explore; we get narrative -flow-. There are virtually no face close-ups; the emphasis is always on the surrounding space.

And DiCaprio acquits himself mightily here. Compare this to a container built by a mechanistic hack (Cameron's ""Titanic"") and it's a joking matter. The key is he plays a man who drives the world he occupies, and never overpowers it.

Worth the near three-hour investment...",9
12 June 2005,Over Inflated Bio Pic with Under Inflated Performances,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",5
15 November 2021,Howard Hughes bio pic,"Howard Hughes bio pic, I get it. Hughes is very much the hero of the film, not its villain. He is, admittedly, a flawed hero, but then none of us are flawless- certainly not the heroes among us. He can be stubborn- for example, he insists on completing the Spruce Goose even after the military have cancelled their order and it should have become clear to him that there is no commercial future for the plane- and also ruthless, as when he blackmails a muckraking journalist who is threatening to publish a story about Hepburn. Throughout the film we are conscious of his struggles with the mental health problems- especially his paranoid fear of germs- that were to worsen in the latter part of his life. Nevertheless, we are always aware of the powerfully creative side of his personality, his flair for business and his combative spirit. This comes out most strongly at the end of the film when TWA's business is threatened by a Senate bill that would have given Pan-Am a monopoly on international air travel and Hughes is summoned to be interrogated before a Congressional committee about his business record. Hughes's enemies expect that he will be humiliated, but he is able to answer all the charges against him to such good effect that the bill is defeated. Leonardo di Caprio was excellent as Hughes. I must admit that I have not always been his greatest admirer; he struck me as an untalented pretty-boy when I first saw him in ""Titanic"", and there was little in ""Romeo and Juliet"", ""The Beach"" or ""Gangs of New York"" to persuade me to change my mind. He was, admittedly, better in ""Catch Me If You Can"", but this was a light-hearted film very different in style to ""The Aviator"". He seems, however, to be maturing into a very good actor and succeeded in bringing out the various sides of Hughes's complex personality. Of the other performances, the two that stood out were Cate Blanchett's impersonation of Hepburn and Alan Alda as Hughes's enemy, the corrupt senator Owen Brewster who is more interested in serving the interests of Pan-Am than those of his constituents.

10 December 2022,The Aviator Soars,"I have been germophobic all of last week since re-watching this gem. Scorsese tells of the 'Life and Madness' of Howard Hughes with such disturbing clarity that I am compelled to read the biography. Hughes fits the bill for an ideal Scorsese protagonist -- manic, obsessive, and brilliant. DiCaprio brings his insanity to life on screen with vivacity, although the Southern accent is lost every time he shouts. Howard Shore's score is also riveting. Despite Hughes' life being wrought with tragedy at nearly every turn, his dedication to his own vision brings about a future hardly anyone else could have dreamed of imagining.

24 May 2015,gorgeous technically superior,"Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) uses his Texas oil money to satisfy his obsession of making a realistic air war movie ""Hell's Angels"". He becomes romantically involved with actress Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett). He has obsessive-compulsive disorder and is severely afraid of disease stemming from his mother. He brings his obsession to aviation and build an airline battling Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin). His romance with Hepburn comes to end and he starts a new one with Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale).

Martin Scorsese has given a technically superior movie. It is gorgeous like our imagination of what old Hollywood must have been. Hepburn is doing an impression. DiCaprio is a star. While the movie do a great recreation, it keeps its distance. It needs a gritty, non-pretty sense to dig into Hughes' dark obsessive side. This man is disturbed and the movie should be visually disturbing at certain times to bring that out.

28 December 2004,"Amateurish, fictional account of part of Howard Hughes life","This film was apparently made to appeal to the lowest common denominator. The most noticeable fault is that much of it is untrue. The movie takes place mostly in the 1940's when Hughes was at the peak of his career. There is very little about his life after that period.

Although much of his private life was personal and not known to the public, this did not stop the film makers from inventing things they didn't know about him. Although there is no reason to think there was anything psychologically wrong with him at that time, the movie makers made him appear as some kind of nut who mumbled to himself and behaved in crazy ways, something that is unsubstantiated and offensive since he was the head of large corporations and did (his company still does) a lot of business with the government, unlikely for a crazy person as he is depicted in this film.

The producers (which include Leonard DiCaprio) apparently took what few bits and pieces of his personal life are known to the public, rearranged them to suit this mostly fictional film, and came up with another trashy Hollywood film.

The acting left much to be desired as well.",1
12 June 2005,"hype was exaggerated, not wining the Oscar justified","This was supposed to be one of the greatest film of the year, and a plethora of Oscar nominations gave hope that Scorsese will make it this time. He did not, and he did not deserve it.

Not that this is a bad movie. Scorsese knows to tell a story, and as a docu-drama 'Aviator' is one of the best. The problem is that the film tries to be a lot more including to meet the challenge of 'Citizen Kane' - much inspired of the same character. It fails exactly where a film like 'Beatiful Mind' succeeded - in explaining the mix of genius and paranoia, of vision and eccentricity, of the business leader and frivolous entertainer of movie stars. The scene in the character childhood trying to explain the obsession of a whole life is simplistic and lacks not logic, but artistic truth.

Worst is the mis-casting of Leonardo di Caprio. I confess that I am no fan of his, and I believe that after sinking 'Titanic' he now crashes 'Aviator'. He cannot track the aging of the character, and he is far of the complexity of Crowe in 'Beautfiul Mind'. As a compensation we have Cate Blanchett, shining as ever in Hepburn's role.

Not that it's a bad film. It tells a lot about the period, about aviation and cinema, about the conflict between the South and the North in the American mentality. But is is far from any psychological depth, and does not raise to the level of expectations and of the hype.",8

9 January 2005,Seemed like a TV movie re-hash,"For all the 'Oscar buzz' one hears about this film, I came away rather disappointed. Why? 1. DiCaprio is a fine actor, granted. He does NOT possess the physical intensity that Hughes had, not to mention almost being the physical opposite. It'd be like Steve Martin playing James Dean. It's just WRONG. 2. For all the accolades Blanchett gets as Hepburn, she's somewhat of a caricature. Her accent was too over the top. What, did Scorcese think we wouldn't know who she was supposed to be? 3.I think an unknown as Hughes would have been a better idea, but then it might not have gotten the big box office receipts we're hearing about. And that's what's really at the bottom of this. I'll take the Tommy Lee Jones TV version any day!

19 February 2005,a mad genius,"You really can't miss when doing a biography of Howard Hughes, certainly one of the most brilliant, glamorous, eccentric, and fascinating men who ever lived. And for me, Leonardo DiCaprio and Scorcese don't miss. DiCaprio's portrayal of Hughes is a revelation. (I'll digress here to say, for those who have accused him of being short, I've seen him in person - he's not short.) He does a fantastic job as Hughes. You can almost hear his inner dialogue. As for Scorcese, the movie is truly spectacular in its breadth.

I was disappointed in a couple of elements. One was, with the care Cate Blanchett gave to her portrayal of Hepburn, one would have hoped that a little attention had been paid to the casting of the other women in Hughes' life: Faith Domergue, Ava Gardner, Jean Harlow. Of the three, I liked Kate Beckinsale's Ava the best - but for me, Ava Gardner's beauty is unparalleled. Beckinsale really didn't approach it. And Stefani was wrong, wrong, wrong. How hard can it be to find a young actress (and Harlow was 19, not 35, when she appeared in Hell's Angel's), and slap a platinum wig and a white clinging gown on her? Harlow's look was very distinctive, and when it's off, it's distracting.

The other thing I was disappointed in - and I suppose this couldn't be helped in a way - was the telescoping of the years and some unnecessary inaccuracies. I don't pretend to be an expert on Hughes. I've seen one documentary on him which was fantastic, and now I want to read about him. But Katharine Hepburn talks about the press showing up at her brother's funeral - I don't know why that would have been, since she wasn't famous yet. I realize her family was prominent, but she made it sound as if it had to do with her fame. She also labels herself as Box Office Poison way too soon, and the movie skips the entire Philadelphia Story, including Hughes giving her the money to buy the rights. No mention of most of the controversy over ""The Outlaw"" which took several years to see a release.

But these are minor, nitpicky points. This is a big, gorgeous film, with exciting, lush scenes and some fantastic performances.",9

16 January 2006,Great Ride in 'Aviator' ***12,"Leonardo Di Caprio might very well suffer from the Dorian Gray complex. He just looks too young for his parts whether it be this engrossing film or 1997's ""Titanic."" Nevertheless, he was quite good as Howard Hughes.

The film shows Hughes' life, complex as it was, totally absorbed in aviation and film making.

Kate Blanchett, as Katharine Hepburn, was perfect. She really established a well authentic New England accent in playing Kate the Great. Her Oscar win was like a 5th trophy for the late Miss Hepburn herself.

The film is very fast paced just like the life of Hughes himself. Tragically, the man was victimized by OCD, which invariably ruined his life.

As the senator, Alan Alda received a well-deserved best supporting actor nomination. Tied to Hughes' competitor in aviation, he tried to ruin him only to have the tables turned on him. While the part was brief, Alda showed a crustiness that I never thought he was capable of. I thought I was viewing Melvyn Douglas when I saw him in his scenes-especially the luncheon scene with Hughes.

An interesting biography, well-crafted by Martin Scorsese, who just can't seem to find Oscar gold.",9
17 April 2005,Scorsese's worst,"For some reason Scorsese is considered a great director. I think he's just a working man, not an artist. His interest for perverse brutal violence is however in a sick way shared by many of us. But does those films tell us anything about ""life""? Hardly.

""The Aviator"" is about Howard Hughes, as everybody know, and especially his passion for making airplanes. It's mostly like average TV, with bad make-up, bad reconstruction of the 20s, 40s and so on and, it has to be told, rather bad acting. DiCaprio is overplaying and so is Blanchett, Alda and the rest. Theatrical to say the least.

And the movie is much to long. The second half is better and you find some tension in the story about the senate hearings but still, Scorsese ought to be taken down from the pedestal.

25 December 2004,Very Long and Drags much of the time,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie after all the press and favourable ratings. We saw it on opening day in the Detroit area and found the movie to be just OK. I give it a 4 on the scale of 10. Acting was OK, script was so so. I was expecting much more action I guess. The movie was at least 45 minutes too long IMO, most of the people walking out of the large theatre which was about 3/4 empty felt about the same way based on comments that we overheard. The story seemed to ramble on with no progression, little dramatic tension and then ended at what seemed to be an arbitrary point. It seemed that there wasn't a lot of continuity from scene to scene. In short, given the positive press, it was a disappointment.

18 January 2005,Insightful and well done,"Scorsese does it again with this period piece detailing the life of the eccentric millionaire Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio). The film opens with Howard directing his 1930 war epic, ""Hell's Angels."" Which took 3 years and 4 million dollars to make (not a small chunk of change back then, not even that small now). The movie moves to his meeting and subsequent courting of Katharine Hepburn, played exceptionally well by Cate Blanchett. It also depicts him moving on to the likes of Ava Gardner and Faith Domergue. ""The Aviator"" shows us the many aspects of Hughes' being, both good and bad. He is a dreamer, sparing no expense to make his movies or build his aviation empire, despite the financial trouble it causes the company which he inherited from his family that is based in Houston (the name of the company escapes me. We also see his obsessive compulsive nature, afraid of contracting germs and constantly trying to stay as clean as possible. When Errol Flynn grabs a pea off of Hughes' plat with a nice cut of meat on it, Hughes pushes it aside with only one bite gone. Also, Hughes is contracted by the government to make fighter planes and an ""air-boat,"" a giant airplane that can transport the troops, their equipment, and transportation across the Atlantic so that German u-boats will stop taking down U.S. submarines and ships. He call's it ""The Hercules."" The project takes too long, and it isn't completed in time to help in the war. Well, Hughes' new airline TWA doesn't amuse the big wigs at Pan Am Airlines, so their owner uses his personnel senator (Leon Brewster of Maine) to get a bill before Congress to put a monopoly on international aviation travel. Hughes takes on Brewster and his hearing and wins, then he takes the maiden voyage of his ""Spruce Goose,"" as Brewster called it, and retires the vessel forever. If you didn't know who Hughes was before this movie, then it will give you a great foundation on which to build knowledge of this quite intelligent, quite intriguing man. DeCaprio turns in a superb performance, further distancing himself from his teeny-bopper early years. He has definitely changed my opinion of him with his last three movies (Gangs of New York, Catch Me If You Can, and The Aviator). I realize he might have been good in earlier movies (though don't you dare say ""Basketball Diaries,"" which sucked), but I haven't seen them all.",10
30 January 2005,Exceptionally acted... but not Scorsese's best.,"'The Aviator' is an unusual film in the sense that it features the life of an unusual man. Howard Hughes, a pioneer in the history of aviation and cinema, two completely different fields. It is good that the movie showed enough of his contribution in the history of the former, as the name suggested. A movie meant as a biopic becomes an eye-candy the credit for which should not only go to the filmmakers but also the character Howard Hughes himself. Smart-looking planes, beautiful actresses of that time and also that plane crash in Beverly Hills sequence... all because of him. And it becomes perfect for a moviegoer when such a good plot comes with good acting.

It is indeed quite a treat to see all the good actors performing so well altogether. Leonardo DiCaprio is simply awesome. At first it appeared to me he is somehow miscast as Howard Hughes, perhaps because he doesn't just look like him. But his acting was so wonderful that I can't think of anyone right now that could replace him. He definitely deserves his Oscar this time. The changes of Hughes' character with time is brilliantly portrayed, with some scenes where Leonardo proves his mastery like the days inside the hotel room or the last shot of Senate hearing or ""Show me all the blueprints"". Apart from him, 'The Aviator' is also Cate Blanchett's best work. Her appearance was perfect for Katharine Hepburn and she got the accent big time. She just defeated her works in 'Veronica Guerine' or 'Elizabeth'. John Reilly is good as always, so was Kate Beckinsale. I actually would love to see Scarlett Johansson as Ava Gardner but Kate is okay. Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda, however, are not upto that level. And oh yes, as long as we're speaking about acting, let's not forget the brilliant cameo by Jude Law as Eroll Flynn.

The point is, all these decent performances by the actors could not make it the best film of the year. 'Aviator' has got a number of problems. The movie is nearly three hours long and it loses track in the middle. The first hour of the movie is very good and interconnected. But after that it just became a collection of separate events glued together. 'Aviator' was never meant to be a documentary film with actors. But that's what it became in the end. Personally I think the film aspect of Hughes' life should have been shown more, along with the aviation aspect of course. Sometimes it appeared filled with too much detailing and unnecessary shots like the opening scene or that scene of urinating in the bottles etc. As a director, Scorsese could not surpass his earlier works like 'Raging Bull' or 'Taxi Driver' or even 'Gangs of New York' with this one. Interesting and unexpected plot twists or showing violence in a simple careless manner, what were his trademark, are absent here. As he didn't get his Oscar from the said three films, I highly doubt he will make it this time. On the other hand, Eastwood has done a hell of a work with 'Million Dollar Baby'.

My rating: 8/10",8
19 January 2005,Enough for an Oscar?,"There is always a little extra excitement involved when seeing a movie that has had a lot of buzz about it before reaching Sweden. And ""The Aviator"" is such a movie. Not least because most people are wondering if this is the movie that will finally give Martin Scorsese his Oscar for best director.

This is the story of millionaire Howard Hughes. The man who started out with a tool company, began his film-making career with the worlds most expensive film and then went on to become a pioneer in aviation. A story about a manic and intense individual, a man of great success but also one who lived constantly on the edge. And not only is this movie about his life's work but also about his turbulent personal life and the many women he loved.

Martin Scorsese has long been a man with a distinct feel when it comes to style. And that is very noticeable here. ""The Aviator"" is a beautiful film with a lovingly created world, intense pictures and astonishing sound and music. A delight for the senses. But the movie is also well played with a huge cast of well known and talented actors in both big and small parts. Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as Howard Hughes, but the strongest star of the movie is still Cate Blanchett. She steals every scene she graces with her appearance.

The story of Howard Hughes is fascinating. Not the least because he himself was a fascinating man, but also because of all the famous people that he crossed paths with. Katharine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, Erroll Flynn Scorsese treats Howard Hughes with a certain respect, but he doesn't shy away from his less flattering sides. This also means that Scorsese steers away from making an idolized portrait and the movie feels more real, Hughes never feels like a saint.

So, about the Oscar. Will this be enough for the ""Best director""-Oscar? My guess is no, unfortunately I believe that Scorsese will once again fall short. That however doesn't mean that this is a bad movie. Far from it. ""The Aviator"" is well directed, well played, interesting and entertaining. A recommended viewing, I rate it 7/10.",7
7 March 2011,A Long but Classical Film!,"I could see why Leonardo DiCaprio would want to play Howard Hughes. He was an incredible genius but also deeply troubled man. This film shows how Howard Hughes operated with the women in his life like Katherine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, Faith, and others. He was paranoid and obsessive compulsive disorder. He was terrified of germs. There are more scenes in the film about his spiraling out of control with his mental illness than anything else. Despite his obvious inflictions, he was truly a brilliant businessman, aviator, and film producer. Nothing was too small or impossible for Howard Hughes. I thought Cate Blanchet deserved her Academy Award for playing iconic actress, Katharine Hepburn. Let's face it, Kate Hepburn was an extraordinarily gifted actress and an American treasure. Blanchett pulled off the performance perfectly to make even Hepburn proud of it. The relationship between Howard Hughes and Kate Hepburn was mutual admiration and love even when she left him. Hughes' love for Kate went further than that. The rest of the cast includes Kate Beckinsale (Ava Gardner), Sir Ian Holm, John C. Reilly, Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, etc. Everybody in the film business wants to work with Scorsese and who can blame them. I want to work with him. This film is nearly perfect if not too long at times but truly captures some of Howard Hughes' troubled and successful life.",9
4 September 2005,Entertaining and well done biopic,"I'm not usually a fan of biopics, or even Martin Scorsese films in general, but surprisingly enough; this one, in spite of it's lukewarm critical reaction, is actually really good, and definitely well worth seeing. Much of the criticism landed on The Aviator has come about because of the fact that it's not very deep and while this is a problem for the film, it didn't upset me too much because what we do have is a stylish and always interesting film, which evenly covers up it's shortfall in substance with it's positive aspects. The film follows the story of Howard Hughes; an aeroplane and filmmaker in Hollywood's golden era. The film starts during the troubled shoot of Hughes' debut film; Hell's Angels, and ends somewhat prematurely as Hughes is still a young man. We are never really allowed to get into the subject's head, but this doesn't seem to be an accident, as it was obvious to me that Scorsese was more interested in portraying the history behind the man than his psychological profile. Scorsese gives us enough of the man to keep us interested in him, but stays true to the facts of his life to an extent in which the film is always kept interesting.

Leonardo DiCaprio seems to have replaced Robert DeNiro as Scorsese's muse, and despite a disappointing turn in the sub-standard 'Gangs of New York', DiCaprio shines here and really does well as the rich, yet troubled, Hollywood icon at the centre of this story. Scorsese seems to have a bit overboard with the cast, as several big names of the present appear as big names of the past. Cate Blanchett irritated me just as much as the real Katherine Hepburn did, which shows the greatness of her performance. Kate Beckinsale and, surprisingly, Gwen Stefani give life to two of Hollywood's golden girls; Ava Gardner and Jean Harlow as well, while smaller roles such as that of the charismatic Errol Flyn fall to the likes of Jude Law. This was the film's major selling point for me - there's something great about the big stars of today portraying the big stars of the golden age, and the way that Scorsese populates almost every scene with the big names of the time ensures that this is as much a film fan's movie as it is a multi-million dollar blockbuster. Critics can complain about a lack of substance as much as they like, but what I saw here was an excellently stylish take on one of Hollywood's most intriguing figures, and I don't hesitate to call this Scorsese's finest hour since Goodfellas back in 1990.",8
6 June 2005,Visually stunning; but Martin's best work and best picture? No.,"See, at the Oscars, despite the fact that I had not seen ""The Aviator"", I was cheering for it. Because I am a huge Martin Scorsesse fan and I only saw two other movies that were nominated. Leonardo without a doubt has become a very fine actor, and the clip they showed for his nomination of ""Best Actor"" looked extremely interesting. So, when it came to best picture I was all for ""The Aviator"" or ""Finding Neverland"", but then ""Million Dollar Baby"" took it and I was upset. Still, I had to see ""The Aviator"".

While the movie has a very stunning atmosphere and fine actors that can steal the scene, it's not a very interesting story. Howard Hughs, no, I do not know that much about him. In fact, I didn't realize what he really did until I saw this movie. But he just seemed like any ordinary a-hole in life. The movie could have been something spectacular, but the person and story just didn't interest me. So, I'm so sorry Martin, you were not handed anything that could have been gold. This was the problem, because it was too long and the main character wasn't that interesting, you loose track of the film.

Otherwise, this is a good all around film to watch for a Saturday. Is it a watch? Oh, yes. 2 hours and 45 minutes of Leo is a little much to handle. But I would recommend it to see good flick, but that's all it is. Just a good flick.

7/10-To Martin: We know you can do better!",7
4 November 2006,Brilliant depiction of Howard Hughes's early years,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",10
19 September 2005,"""The Aviator"" will fly forever.","Okay, so ""Million Dollar Baby"" was great, but I still say that ""The Aviator"" should have won Best Picture (especially since Martin Scorsese has never won an Oscar). The story of Howard Hughes' (Leonardo DiCaprio) Hollywood years, the movie shows his determination to make ""Hell's Angels"" at any cost, his love affair with Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), his persecution by PanAm CEO Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) and Sen. Ralph Owen Brewster (Alan Alda), and finally his experience with the Spruce Goose. And we can clearly see how Hughes was getting germ-phobic during these years.

Among other things, it's good to see DiCaprio breaking away from the ""Titanic"" mold. Further kudos to him for taking on a role as great as this one. ""The Aviator"" isn't one of those epics that prides itself only on visuals while lacking any real plot; it's all about the story (but then again, Martin Scorsese's movies always have real plots). Like ""Gangs of New York"", it looks at something that so many people probably wouldn't usually think of.

All in all, kudos to everyone who participated in this movie. Like I said, it deserved Best Picture. Oh well, at least it took home more Oscars than ""Million Dollar Baby"".",10
28 August 2020,A Mesmerizing Biopic,"At nearly three hours long, this film might be suspected of needing editing, but it is interesting throughout. This is primarily due to the enthralling story of its subject, Howard Hughes. In fact, the film ends in 1947, nearly thirty years before Hughes' death---an amazing fact to comprehend when you consider the nature and quality of Hughes' life as portrayed at the end of ""The Aviator.""

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hughes as the larger-than-life persona he was, but manages to capture the smallest eccentricities and obsessions---traits that would later take command of his tragic life. The film portrays Hughes as a human dynamo, constantly curious and constantly determined to achieve great things. Yet sometimes he would undermine his own ambitions with an exhaustive focus on details. Likewise, he was not risk averse, but he eventually came to find threats, mostly imagined, in innocent situations and inconsequential choices. DiCaprio embodies these seeming contradictions, and it feels like director Scorsese deserves a portion of the praise.

The other performances are strong as well. Cate Blanchett, as Katharine Hepburn---Hughes' companion for eighteen months---is captivating as the iconic actress who matched Hughes' independence and free spirit. Alan Alda deserves special mention as Senator Brewster, the unscrupulous politician who grabs the spotlight in Senate hearings that are meant to destroy TWA, one of Hughes' companies.

Much has been written about Scorsese's use of post-production effects to achieve various film effects that mimic the film stocks of the times. When combined with tremendous sets and costumes, they allow the viewer to immerse completely in the ambience of the era.

There are, I fear, no great lessons to be learned from the life of Hughes, which was uniquely singular, but the details of his life---even when edited and condensed into this dramatic version---are mesmerizing.",8

14 January 2020,A Larger-Than-Life Story Of A Larger-Than-Life Icon,"The second collaboration between Martin Scorsese & Leonardo DiCaprio finds the duo bringing on screen the larger-than-life story of a larger-than-life figure. A richly detailed, vividly photographed & brilliantly performed epic biographical drama, The Aviator is another fine addition to the esteemed filmmaker's extensive body of work.

With its meticulously detailed set pieces, inventive cinematography & apt costumes, Scorsese takes us back in time to a glamorous era, and paints a fascinating portrait of Howard Hughes from his industry pioneering highs to crushing personal lows. But there are sloppy scenes in between, and its 170 minutes runtime is quite excessive.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays the iconic real-life persona with gusto, articulating Hughes' mannerism, interactions & worsening mental health with gripping intensity. And he's well supported by the rest of the cast, especially Cate Blanchett who leaves her own mark as Katherine Hepburn, plus her chemistry with DiCaprio is delightful to watch.

Overall, The Aviator does soar under Martin Scorsese's assured direction but there are times when he takes the foot off the pedal, thus resulting in loss of momentum. The commitment from the cast & crew is thorough, the colour grading is a highlight in itself, and the story as a whole makes for an interesting sit for the most part. But unlike his best works, The Aviator isn't memorable.",
20 December 2004,Crazy about flight,"What's the point of a biopic, anyway? Is it meant to be a sort of crude cloning, like a waxworks effigy at Madame Tussaud's but with moving images? Or is it meant to delve into the secrets, show us the real man or woman behind the public mask? In the case of Howard Hughes, we already know all about the weirdness. What Martin Scorsese means to do is to show that Hughes was also a heroic figure in the history of aviation, and a playboy who had a great deal of fun. That may be a bit of a stretch: Hughes's story is full of epic foul-ups, spectacular wastes of money and time and lives to satisfy his mistaken whims, not to mention morally dubious actions; but nonetheless Scorsese's new movie, which focuses on Hughes's early, triumphant decades, is fun to watch. It soars and sparkles This is where Leonardo DiCaprio comes in. Did Scorsese just choose DiCaprio to get a big budget for his aviation epic? I don't think so. There's more logic in it than that. Yes, Leo is too young-looking and reedy-voiced, but the movie in many if not all respects works anyway, and so does DiCaprio's performance. It's fun seeing the fine clothes and high life. DiCaprio looks great all duded up: his face and body fit quite well with 20-'s-30's-40's styles, and he's equally believable as party boy and ladies' man.

Scorsese's version of Katherine Hepburn -- who turns out to be one of the linchpins of the movie -- isn't too far off. At least her story gibes with the way the actress herself tells it in her memoir, About Me, which explains how her ex-husband's presence and her family's snobbish, clubby ways put Hughes off, how she discovered he was hard of hearing but tried to hide it, how they were too much alike to stay paired off for more than a couple of years. Cate Blanchett as Hepburn however not only doesn't look at all like her (she isn't as sharp and stylish), any more than Leo looks like Hughes; despite her obvious mimicry of the voice, she also doesn't really deliver her lines with the clarity, the rhythm, and the panache that Hepburn unfailingly had. But hers is essential as the liveliest female presence and so very much needed in this macho story about a boy and his toys.

The Aviator isn't too long if you accept that it's an epic. But can you do that? It's a colorful and unique story, but beyond that it doesn't quite know what it is, a clinical case history, a piece of hero-worship, an epic, a tragedy, or a comedy, and so it self-destructs, almost, toward the end, when the fun ends and the craziness increasingly begins to take over. We can certainly be glad it wasn't cast in the form of a solemn tragedy. It could have been made a comedy throughout. Hughes's obsessive-compulsive/paranoid meltdowns are tragi-comic.

The aviation sequences are so amazing you wonder how they did them. One simple answer is, by spending lots of money. They must have cost as much as Hughes's extravagant projects. Again, this aspect of the movie is a bit of a whitewash, because DiCaprio makes crashing planes look heroic rather than foolhardy.

People have commented on the ""clever"" (actually too obvious) way breasts and clouds are connected, and how Hughes's fondling of a woman segues into his feeling of a new plane's shell for perfectly flush rivets. What's clever is how DiCaprio's face as he ""flies"" is both rapt and manic. Aviation comes to life as a higher calling, perhaps one of the great ones of the twentieth century, but technological progress as a kind of madness, a Luddite's ""I told you so."" Leonardo is not so good as a crazy man. Growing a beard only makes his face look younger. We can believe him as a wild spender. It's harder to believe him as a recluse. (He's more often seen walking around buck naked than cowering in a corner.) But whatever you say, this movie's fun. At least it is till the craziness takes over. And even then it's fun, because Hughes is seen rallying from his longest crazy spell to triumph before the Congressional committee, stomping out to general applause. And DiCaprio works because he has the power to dominate the scene. What is best about DiCaprio is his exuberance -- always -- and his boldness, and those are the aspects of Howard Hughes Scorsese is playing with.

All the way through Leo does that wrinkled-brow charming-eyes look Orson Welles used to do, and you think of Citizen Kane. The Aviator may not be Scorsese's Citizen Kane but it's a fascinating movie and much more successful than the ill starred and lugubrious Gangs of New York. There are numerous splendid spectacles in The Aviator and they all have a glitzy glamour about them and are perfect for the wide screen in a big Cineplex. But is this what made the Scorsese of Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas great? No. He's been seduced, not by money, but by movie grandeur, and he's moved far away from his boorish New York roots. In that he somewhat resembles Zhang Yimou, who's also moved toward pure spectacle, and with even better results -- not, of course, doing the biography of a modern figure.

The question remains: why do directors do biopics? Is Scorsese really looking for himself in the mad failed movie director, the obsessive compulsive recluse, as Oliver Stone is said to see himself in the megalomaniac Alexander obsessed by his mother? That may be a better answer than it seems.",
27 July 2005,Over Produced Junk,"What in the world happened to Martin Scorsese? Here is the creator of Dog Day Afternoon and Wise Guys, a man considered one of the best of the 1970's Golden Age of Film, but film by film his stuff gets more over produced, less insightful, and more expensive. I saw it coming with Gangs of New York, but somebody keep Leonardo DiCaprio away from this guy. They are awful together and The Aviator is one big expensive, good-looking bore without a soul.

In a documentary on Neo-Realism, Italian Post War Cinema, Scorsese claims he started with storyboards as a child, a comic book look that is produced giving the director a visualization of what the film will look like. The trouble with The Aviator, it looks like a storyboard. The replicas and animation of Hugh's weird airplanes almost steal the show, because they are the only interesting thing to look at on screen. Howard Hughes is never fleshed out. At least Kinsey, a recent bio flick tried to show why Kinsey was what he was, but DiCaprio's Hugh's is some kind of freak because his mother talked about diseases while he bathed. There's not enough there Martin. The bulk of the film shows a very young actor with no physical resemblance to Howard Hughes talking big time business and avionics without any back-story on how he became so brilliant out of the crib? The women in Hugh's life are trotted out one by one. He's a cocky guy putting his hand under a cigarette flappers skirt, a rich boy lover for Kathryn Hepburn (She doesn't come off too swell in this version), and Ava Gardner (No wonder Sinatra and Artie Shaw had it easy with this chick after the money-bags geekdom of Hughes). None of these gals are fleshed out other than Hollywood publicity shrek.

Don't bother with this one.",3
9 January 2011,Mostly successful,"The Aviator is a grand epic piece of filmmaking. It has vivid costumes, elegant art direction, and great cinematography as its to be expected. The script is very good and the film is mostly entertaining,a nd the performances are great. Leonardo Dicaprio gives the best performance here, and whenever I see him in a film I have to remind myself that he has not yet won an Oscar, and what shame that is. Cate Blanchett as well adds another impressive performance, although as far as a performance goes I liked her as the film went along more. At first she just seemed like a cartoon character, but if the real Hepburn acted that way then who am I to judge. Although this is an impressive picture it is not as great as The Departed or even the recent Shutter Island but it does build impressively in Scorsese's filmography.

11 April 2009,Decent Scorsese Film!,"The Aviator is a decent film that tells the pre and post World War 2 life of Howard Hughes. I must admit that I was not thrilled when I decided to give this movie a shot. It just did not appeal to me. But with all the hype, I decided to check this film out.

As I mentioned before, this is about Howard Hughes, a successful billionaire who is great at having corporate trouble. This film talks about the new kind of films he made back in the 30's. Then, Hughes decided to build the world's largest airplane that may or may not backfire.

The acting is probably the high point of the film. Leonardo DiCaprio is a really good job as he usually does. Cate Blanchett is really the must-see of the film. Her portrayal as Katherine Hepburn is a powerful one that even Hepburn herself would be knocked off her feet. I also like Alan Alda.

For a subject matter such as this, the film is way too long. This is no Lord of the Rings so I could not be engrossed in the film in several parts.

Scorsese does deserve some Oscar consideration(which it did). But, this film is not Oscar-worthy as LOTR is. I rate this film 8/10.",8
9 December 2017,Appalling celebrity impressions,"The Aviator is a biopic of the famous Hollywood director and producer Howard Hughes. Martin Scorsese directed the film, so naturally, his beloved Leonardo DiCaprio starred as the title role. The film was advertised ad nauseum, so much so that even movie goers who didn't want to see it felt compelled to at least rent it at some point. Everyone loves to watch movies about old Hollywood, chalk-full of celebrity impressions of legendary stars, right? From a technical standpoint, the movie was very well done. The shots are well-framed, the colors are beautifully saturated, and the sound is well-created and mixed. However, if you're at all familiar with the actors and actresses portrayed on the screen, you will be beyond disappointed. To summarize, Cate Blanchett plays Katharine Hepburn, Kate Beckinsale plays Ava Gardner, Jude Law plays Errol Flynn, and Gwen Stefani plays Jean Harlow.

Katharine Hepburn had such a distinctive way of talking that it's almost a game to imitate her, like Michael Caine's or Cary Grant's accents. Cate didn't sound anything like her, and I don't know why no one told her. In addition, she didn't look like her and she didn't even mimic the way she moved her body. Basically, she wore trousers and dyed her hair and thought the audiences would be fooled.

Jude Law, while a very handsome man, doesn't happen to look like Errol Flynn. His eyes are further apart on his face and neither down-tilting nor deep set, his nostrils take a different angle, the tip of his nose is shorter, his bottom lip has a bow-shape, and his eyebrows have a different arch. So why was he cast? Why didn't the casting director pick Kevin Kline, who does look like Errol Flynn and actually portrayed him in a movie nine years later? Ava Gardner's defining characteristics are the large features of her face. She has a huge mouth, large eyebrows, eyes so far apart they seem to be falling off her face, and a big skull. I've been waiting in vain for someone in Hollywood to cast Eva Mendes as Ava Gardner, because I'm sure audiences would think Ava had been reincarnated. Kate Beckinsale has a small, delicate-looking frame, and a thin face. Her eyes and eyebrows are not falling off the sides of her face, and her smile doesn't scare people with its size. I can't imagine any reason why she was cast.

Last, but certainly not least, we have Gwen Stefani, who was extremely excited about her film debut. She played the original bombshell, Marilyn Monroe's idol: Jean Harlow. Jean Harlow is one of my all-time favorite actresses, so I took this insult to her memory personally. We'll start with her face. Jean Harlow had close-set, deep-set eyes, a substantial nose, a cleft in her chin, an extremely small mouth, a very high forehead, and eyebrows that were stylish at the time but nowadays look clownish. Gwen Stefani, during her five minutes in the film, was not given any putty for her nose, her chin was cleft-less, her mouth was its normally large size, and her eyebrows had not been altered one millimeter in shape or position. This in itself is absurd. Next, we have body structure. Jean Harlow was very petite at 5'2"" and had a beautifully curvaceous figure. She was diminutive. Gwen Stefani, at 5'7"", is intimidating. Her shoulders are very prominent, and her athletic build is nothing like the woman she's supposed to be portraying. Finally, we have the feature that was Jean Harlow's trademark: her voice. Jean Harlow had an incredibly thick and distinctive accent, but when Gwen Stefani opened her mouth, she spoke like a breathy Valley Girl. It's appalling that she either refused to do her homework, take direction, or submit her resignation.

With all my criticisms, I haven't yet mentioned one word about the lead actor. Throughout the film, Leonardo DiCaprio portrays a larger-than-life figure who ends up succumbing to a debilitating case of OCD. He was nominated for an Oscar for The Aviator, and when you watch it, you will concede that it's the type of role that usually gets a nomination. In general, I'm not a big fan of his because I always feel that he's acting. Actors are supposed to convince audiences that they're not acting and that there isn't a camera, crew members, sets, lights, and modern contraptions all around them. I never feel that way when watching Leo's performances. I always feel he's trying to pull from something that isn't there, and that if you went to see him in a community theater production, you'd think he was very good but probably stretching the limits of his talent. Unless you already love Leo and everything he does, you probably won't like this movie.

While it didn't end up being a huge success at the box office, Hollywood couldn't get enough of it. The Aviator was nominated for eleven Oscars in 2005, taking home the gold for Costume Design, Art Direction, Cinematography, Editing, and Supporting Actress. Cate Blanchett has given some very good performances for which she should have won an Oscar; portraying an unrecognizable Katharine Hepburn isn't one of them.",1
19 April 2022,"""Don't tell me I can't do it; don't tell me it can't be done!""","""The Aviator"" is a biographical drama, which follows the life of filmmaker and aviator Howard Hughes, from the 1920s to the 1940s. Although today he's better known for films (""Hell's Angels"", ""Scarface"", ""The Outlaw""), ""The Aviator"" deals more with Hughes' shifting boundaries in aviation and his private life, which marked love (Katharine Hepburn, Ava Gardner) and political affairs, as well as a serious form of OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) and germophobia.

Even if you don't know what the film is about, or even what genre it belongs to, sound names like director Martin Scorsese, a phenomenal cast consisting of Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, Jude Law, music by Howard Shore, and even five Oscars (out of a total of 11 nominations), are reason enough to watch it.

Scorsese made an effort that each part of the film looked as close as possible to the films of the period in which it takes place, which is especially impressive at the beginning, for example in the scene in which Jude Law appears as Errol Flynn. This is probably the main reason for the Best Cinematography Oscar, which went to Robert Richardson, with whom Scorsese has already collaborated on the films ""Casino"" and ""Bringing Out the Dead"".

DiCaprio, as usual, deserved an Oscar and remained only on the nomination. Cate Blanchett gave her best to mimic the mannerism and accent of Katharine Hepburn, but, although she deserved an Oscar for acting, her appearance is not even close to the beauty of the legendary Katharine. Admittedly, Kate irritates me, so my objectivity is questionable. It is interesting that with this role, she became the first person to win an Oscar by playing another Oscar winner. Kate Beckinsale is as enchanting as ever, and John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda (also nominated), and Ian Holm give the film an impressive charm.

Technically, the film is top-notch in every aspect, but it lacks essence. It consists of parts perfectly made and put together, and it doesn't lack even emotional strength, but it has no point, leads nowhere, ends abruptly, and even with some sort of cliffhanger. I enjoyed every minute of its three hours, but it lacks something essential that would complement technical perfection and make it a timeless masterpiece.

8/10.",8
25 October 2020,Riveting,"This film had a lot of competition that year at the Oscars! Does it live up to the performances of Million Dollar Baby and Ray? Well, almost. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a very flawed man who starts off like any other risk-addicted control freak but becomes an intensely troubled recluse. We are taken along with his bravado but also sceptical of how much control he really has. This becomes apparent to the other characters who react with anything from bemusement, frustration and exploitation. In the end, his ego becomes overshadowed by his mental condition and he succumbs to his fate.

3 January 2006,Too long and not enough excitement,"There were some fine performances in this movie, and it reminded me of Citizen Kane in its approach to the life of a ruthless businessman, but I wasn't gripped by it and Hughes' character was so unsympathetic that I couldn't engage with him. Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Hepburn was excellent and I loved her (being a true Hepburn fan, I wasn't offended). I understood the technical excellence of the cinematography, but I need to feel involved in a story and Hughes behaviour was repellent enough to distance me completely. DiCaprio was good, but I couldn't see him as an older man later on in the story - possibly he lacked the weight required to show middle age convincingly. I lost interest well before the end, I'm afraid.

20 April 2020,"I'm Howard Hughes, the Aviator","I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",8
15 January 2005,"Good, not great, Scorsese","The first 10 minutes of ""The Aviator"" are more exciting and emotionally gratifying than the entirety of Martin Scorsese's previous epic, ""Gangs of New York"" (2002).

You gotta hand it to Scorsese. The man learns from his mistakes.

After casting the pretty, but talentless, Cameron Diaz in ""Gangs of New York"" and watching that turn into a wretched film - sorry, Daniel Day-Lewis' commanding performance aside, that film's positively dull - he thought better when it came to casting ""The Aviator."" Yes, he cast beautiful women in this, too. But he found beautiful women who are also incredibly talented. Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale.

Not that ""The Aviator"" doesn't have its attractive actress with unproven talent. Scorsese cast singer Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow, but then wisely gave her just two lines of dialogue in the entire film.

""The Aviator"" actually seems like two films. The first part deals with Howard Hughes' (Leonardo DiCaprio) obsession to make movies and with gorgeous women. The second part delves into Hughes' fight with Pan Am and Congress, and his better-known obsessive behavior - collecting and storing his urine in jars, for instance - that turned him into the world's most famous recluse.

The first part is interesting. The second is not.

After a brief, rather Oedipal prologue that foreshadows Hughes' odd behavior later, writer John Logan gets right into the Hughes' adult life. Scorsese cuts to the chase, showing us the first year of the filming of ""Hell's Angels"" (1930).

The entire sequence about ""Hell's Angels"" is not only fascinating but also breathtaking when Scorsese takes to the skies to show the filming of the WWI dogfights in the film. The spectacular aerial fight alone proves what a master filmmaker he is.

About 30 minutes into the film, we meet Katharine Hepburn, played marvelously by Australian actress Blanchett, and the film takes off. Blanchett completely dominates the screen. She captures every nuance of a young Hepburn. Her Hepburn's got spunk, attitude, charisma and you forget you're watching Blanchett. Hers is one of 2004's best performances.

Later, we get another pleasant surprise - young Beckinsale as screen siren Ava Gardner. After the wretched ""Van Helsing,"" it's good to see Beckinsale putting her talent to better use. She may not be physically built like Gardner, but she carries off the role with poise and panache. She's thoroughly believable as the legendary actress.

""The Aviator"" would've benefited greatly had it concentrated more on the Hughes-Gardner relationship and less on Hughes' eccentricities.

In fact, it's those two women who keep the film interesting. When they leave the story, the film falls flat. The other characters are not nearly as interesting as these two women and it's to these actresses' credit that they so completely take over a film that's not about their characters.

There are some fine supporting performances. Alec Baldwin's turned into a good character actor and the always-brilliant Ian Holm makes it all look so easy as Professor Fitz. There's a sensationally funny bit when Hughes forces Fitz to pose as a mathematician to prove to movie censors that Jane Russell's cleavage in ""The Outlaw"" (1943) isn't all that revealing.

Chances are, Scorsese will win the Oscar. He deserves a nomination, but I don't know whether he deserves to win for this movie. If he does, I'm certain it would be because Oscar voters were too dumb not to reward him for directing ""Raging Bull"" (1980) and ""GoodFellas"" (1990).

My enjoyment of ""The Aviator"" boiled down to one person - Cate Blanchett. Oh, what a tremendous difference real talent makes.",7
20 October 2009,A biography as ambitious as the man himself,"Martin Scorsese's second collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio is ""The Aviator,"" a nearly three-hour biopic examining about a thirty-year window in the life of airline and movie mogul Howard Hughes, whose successes in aviation and Hollywood romances made him shine in the public eye despite the bankrupting methods and slowly growing obsessive compulsions that tore at his private life.

Despite the length, Scorsese uses his brilliant talents to show how compulsion began to eat away at Hughes. To be honest, Hughes' story is nothing unbelievable or inspirational. When one decides to do a biopic, it's normally because the figure is compelling in a way audiences have never seen -- but that's not Hughes. His story is not so much what he did but the manner in which he did it, so Scorsese deserves a lot of the credit for keeping ""Aviator"" a compelling biography.

Scorsese brings what could constitute as horror movie technique to illustrate Hughes' OCD. For one thing, OCD is not a vocal part of this film. It's never mentioned aloud except when a few characters describe Hughes as ""eccentric."" Scorsese is solely responsible for our understanding of Hughes' condition. The way hands are shown moving slowly and elegantly in the film, the way Scorsese holds on a close-up of red meat -- we get what's going on in Hughes' head.

The blast of light from old-time flashbulbs and the crunching of glass, the way different characters' start to speak over each other -- we easily identify with Hughes' discomfort. Some help from Robert Richardson's stunning color palettes and unusual but striking lighting effects certainly helped.

On the other side of the coin, the ""continue to spend money to be ahead of the curve"" slogan motivating Hughes' inventing beginning with making ""Hell's Angels"" the most expensive movie ever made (at the time) highlights the difference between him and ourselves. Nobody logically would have dared to do the things Hughes did, but he had the money and the drive to do it, constantly forcing his business manager (John C. Reilly, in the movie's first scene) to take care of the technicalities and to make it work regardless of what it took. The fact that Hughes kept going despite OCD and making debilitating choices is what makes him a great biographical figure.

Parts of ""Aviator,"" while a big part of his life, don't seem to add to this core vision Scorsese and writer John Logan (""Gladiator,"" ""The Last Samurai"") paints of who Hughes was. His playboy persona adds another mysterious dimension to his character, but as great as Cate Blanchett (Katherine Hepburn) and Kate Beckinsale (Ava Gardner) are in this film, their subplots don't fit as well considering how much else is going on. In summary, Hughes needed them as maternal figures in a way, but couldn't offer them anything substantial as far as love and affection. As interesting as that is to note, notice that it doesn't exactly influence Hughes' ceaseless drive to make the best planes in the world.

As Alan Alda's character Sen. Brewster enters the picture and attacks the image of Hughes that we grew accustomed to in the first chunk of the film, calling him a criminal for using military tax dollars and never having anything to show for it, we start to see Hughes' legacy. One could call Hughes a number of things, but not a liar or a crook. His flaws were in his ambition, not his core self. In 170 minutes he never once smokes a cigarette or drinks liquor -- you won't find that from a protagonist in a 1920-1947 period biopic in any other film. Coincidentally, the ambition of this film to fire off that message for its entire duration is its only real fault. ~Steven C

13 October 2010,"I didn't run into ""great"", ""convincing"", or ""Scorsese"" in here !","Maybe the worst thing about any movie is asking after its end; what did it want to say? Here, after this bio-pic, it was; who Howard Hughes was?!! OK, according to what we've seen, he's a millionaire with a compulsive disorder, who loves big movies, big planes, and big breasts!

As a follower of Martin Scorsese, and a fan of some movies by him, I asked myself why he handled such a project? The best I could reach, from the very movie, was how that capitalist tycoon wasn't another pedant brat (great scene with him setting among Katharine Hepburn's family as his complete opposite). He was a man with many dreams, obsessed with them, workaholic to fulfill them, and - most importantly - a fighter for them against the American administration which, in here, represents the oppressiveness (government) and conservatism (censorship). Simply, this dreamer's ambition is greater than these employees' ambition; he wants the sky, while they want offices with walls have painting stars on them.

However, I didn't buy it. Hughes was another capitalistic symbol. Making a movie about him, as a man with a dream, anti-narrow mindedness,.. etc. is a try to read him from very keen angles, making a victorious hero of him, which did give me the feel of ""forced"".

Then, it's in the exterior angles as well. While giving it many long scenes, the movie, so provocatively, didn't enlighten us about the man's sickness at all. It was so vague and unrelated to the subject; unless the movie is showing it as just the artist's demons that every time he fights them he wins the best of himself, becoming the hero!

There are many whys too; why Hughes loved Hepburn in specific?, why he had that sickness in specific?, why the movie dealt with the man's cinematic career as just the story's relief?, why we knew nothing about his past but that his mom was washing him as a kid, wishing him well?!!

The CGI didn't work in some shots. To tell you the truth, I was confused why to use them in the first place. For instance, the garden where Hughes lands his plane on it, after the flight with Katharine Hepburn, was CGI. So was that for cutting down the budget or something?!

Scorsese was working out of passion, unlike the usual him. It was more than obvious that he got the things done effortlessly. I have never seen him uninterested on-screen like that before. Most probably it was a deal, a Studio deal, of a movie about the eccentric once-celebrity man; where he gives them what they want, as they want, to give him later the permission to make what he wants as he wants. The smell of this ""deal"" is so overwhelming. Otherwise, this is the most tasteless Scorsese, or let's say the most un-Scorsese, movie!

Further, a major killer punch; Leonardo DiCaprio. I couldn't stand him utterly. I watched this movie 3 times, and for 3 times he failed to drew my attention, so how about any persuasion?! He seems too boyish and no man. His voice is a child voice. At some points, he looks like a teenager with terrible make-up as a grown up. His face doesn't look like the original Hughes, however that's not the problem. The real problem is that Leo's charisma and talent are so weak to be Hughes or else. Teases me pretty much whenever I watch him working continuously in movies for the best directors of his time, to be one of the worst factors in them, while much better actors, who surely could do higher, aren't in his shoes, having his top chances. In a word, disappointment is the basic thing I receive from him all the times yet. And it gets just bigger every time.

What did I love from it? Let me see. The moment of seeing, and hearing, the faucet's water as a torrent of knifes. It's not about expressing the lead's hallucination accurately inasmuch as the expressive power of cinema itself; to speak the unspeakable, and transmit what used to be considered as exclusively doable in other mediums literature is on their top.

The second, and the last, thing I loved was naturally the aforementioned scene of the lunch with the idiots ""who don't need to work since they have too much money!"". It was excellently written, perfectly delivered, and effectively impacted, despite my feeling towards how that was part of a truth which Scorsese wants to see, or wants us to see, nothing but it. It wasn't the best scene of this movie; it was the best of it at all.

(The Aviator) didn't dazzle me as a biography movie, based on Howard Hughes's life movie, or a Scorsese movie. I'm still asking after it: who that guy was? Not a success by any mean.",5
29 January 2005,Maybe the third time Kate Beckinsale and Josie Maran appear in the same movie will be the charm.,"""The Aviator"" may be directed by Martin Scorsese, written by John Logan (although I've never been a fan of ""Gladiator"" and I fell asleep watching ""Star Trek: Nemesis""... fortunately he also wrote ""Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas""), produced by Michael Mann (among others) and performed by an acclaimed cast, but its real stars are all behind the camera. It's beautifully shot (by Robert Richardson) and designed (by Dante Ferreti), and edited almost too precisely by Thelma Schoonmaker, and the Sony Pictures Imageworks visual effects manage to make the flight scenes convincing (something that doesn't often happen when the subject is real planes). Howard Shore's sparingly spotted score is another plus.

All this effort, sadly, only results in a movie that's wonderful to watch but never really particularly... well... good. The movie shows us a Howard Hughes who's a hypochondriac, an obsessive and a lover of flight, but if you knew that going in it's not likely to expand your knowledge of him or make him seem like any more of a human being, and while Leonardo DiCaprio tries hard it's not until well into the movie before he comes across like Hughes and less like someone impersonating Hughes. But he's not as much of a drawback as Cate Blanchett (who's indescribably annoying as Katharine Hepburn), although Alan Alda does a much better job as his senatorial nemesis, and indeed it's decently acted overall.

This hollow core of the movie makes it a lot better as an exercise in appreciating technical expertise and impressive visuals than as something that makes you feel and enthrals you; it's got an epic length, but it's only compelling in fits and starts. You come out of it feeling you might be better off reading a good book about him instead, rather than WANTING to read more about him (there is a difference). ""The Aviator"" reminds you that Martin Scorsese, for all his impressive credentials, was a willing participant in ""Shark Tale."" But it's a vast improvement over ""Van Helsing,"" the last time Kate Beckinsale (fine as Ava Gardner) and Josie Maran were in the same movie. Of course, most things would be.",5
23 September 2011,Overly Cautious Approach Sours a Fascinating Subject,"This on-the-surface look at the life and times of one of America's most notorious recluses delivers plenty of dirt, if not much real introspection. The mysterious Howard Hughes is certainly a tricky subject to nail down, with much of his daring decision-making and eventual descent into madness left officially undocumented, but I still haven't managed to shake the sense that there's a lot of meat to this story that's just been left outside to rot. Cate Blanchett is positively enveloping in her role as Katharine Hepburn, for which she deservedly won an Oscar, but the rest of the cast feels too careful and uncertain, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio's turn as Hughes himself. Leo's eyes don't seem bright enough to concoct the miracles he's performing, while his smirk lacks the cocksure authenticity that would make the most powerful men in the country shudder. Director Martin Scorsese seems similarly lost amidst such complicated material, which comes as a real surprise. Scorsese hammers his audience over the head with the outward symptoms that made Hughes such a curious individual in his later years, but falls short in examining the reasonable, humanizing concerns that led to such paralyzing compulsions. As an adventurous history lesson one could do far worse, but for such a long run time and such a colorful subject to deliver so few answers is a major disappointment.",5
17 December 2005,A stunning combination of madness and genius,"That Howard Hughes certainly was a particular individual: billionaire, filmmaker, engineer, aviator (as the title reminds us), ladies'man, but also an eccentric sociopath who wouldn't even open a door if someone else had touched it first. Not a bad subject for a movie, and Martin Scorsese decided to accept that challenge. And frankly, why not? This film was an excuse to bring Hollywood's glory years back, those years the director is so fond of, the period in which most of The Aviator is set. And let's not forget one of the movie's key themes, obsession, something Scorsese knows quite well (it took him almost 20 years to make The Last Temptation of Christ and 30 to do Gangs of New York).

The first half of the film is the best one, as we witness Hughes'(Leonardo Di Caprio) first important battle: the one he fought to complete Hell's Angels, which was the most expensive picture of its time. When he's not shooting said war flick, he spends his time as any other wealthy guy: dating movie stars. The focus is on his relationship with Katharine Hepburn (a picture-perfect Cate Blanchett), although we're also granted glimpses of his affairs with Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) and Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani). Through these acquaintances, we even get to see a different side of show business, namely what famous actors do off camera (Jude Law is tremendously fun as a drunk, all but heroic Errol Flynn).

After that, serious trouble begins: Hughes' various manias start to increase and get worse, making him more and more alone, with nothing but his money and his extreme ambitions to keep him company (that's probably why The Aviator is called ""Scorsese's Citizen Kane""). And he's gonna need that money, since his airline might get thrown out of business, courtesy of a group of people led by Pan Am boss Juan Trippe (an impressive Alec Baldwin) and a corrupt US senator (the justly Oscar-nominated Alan Alda).

Ultimately, it's a film about power and the war fought to keep that power, as well as the struggles we have to face in order to make our dreams come true. And in Leo Di Caprio, Scorsese has found a man capable of successfully portray the incarnation of innocence, enthusiasm, genius and pure madness, all in the same person. While in Gangs of New York he was second to Daniel Day-Lewis, this time the former Titanic star has the chance to shine on his own, and impress us he does, particularly when his eccentric billionaire starts losing it completely. Shame the two didn't venture more into what drew the crazy man, but The Aviator nonetheless remains a compelling, epic story.

Love classic American movies? You'll love this one, too.",9
2 June 2006,Hughes at His Peak But Epic Biopic Not Quite a Masterpiece,"This is an audacious, surprisingly amusing piece of Hollywood film-making by a veteran craftsman of the first magnitude, yet for a number of reasons, not necessarily of Martin Scorsese's sole doing, the movie does not resonate as much as you wish it would. In staying true to the spirit of multimillionaire magnate Howard Hughes between the late 1920's and the late 40's, Scorsese and screenwriter John Logan are stuck with the facts as they happened, and consequently, the film feels episodic with a great, sometimes dazzling story in the first 2/3 of its epic 166-minute running time and a pedantic, only occasionally involving last hour.

You need to have some familiarity with Hughes' life to understand his halcyon years proving himself as a Hollywood tycoon worthy of respect, and his legendary excess during the three-year production of the now-forgotten ""Hell's Angels"" is captured perfectly here with truly thrilling aviation sequences. Scorsese then focuses on Hughes' romance with Katharine Hepburn and captures the oddball chemistry of burgeoning eccentrics amid the frenzied environment of studio-owned Hollywood, in particular, the Cocoanut Grove nightclub. These sequences remind me a lot of Scorsese's failed musical, ""New York, New York"", but this time he seems far more assured. Ava Gardner enters the picture in the forties, as Hughes builds luxury airplanes that can't fly and his obsessions and paranoia start to take over. There's a magnificently filmed sequence of Hughes crashing his XF-11 plane in the middle of Beverly Hills.

Once he recovers from this incident, the film starts to drag, as the story shifts focus to the power struggles in positioning Hughes' airline TWA against the European-route monopoly of Pan Am and the machinations of Pan Am CEO Juan Trippe and the corrupt Maine senator Owen Brewster who investigates Hughes' WWII government contracts. Even the legendary mini-flight of the Spruce Goose fails to excite this late in the story. Only Scorsese's famous ""Taxi Driver""-like, mind-bending touch brings off the surrealism of the sequences where Hughes locks himself up in his room. The film ends rather anticlimactically with Hughes' successful 1947 appearance before Brewster's committee before he drowns in his obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).

Leonardo DiCaprio's chief asset as an actor is his intensity of purpose, and as Hughes, he has plenty of opportunities to display this attribute with his character's obsessions with aviation, movie-making, glamorous movie stars and ultimately germs. What he is missing is a level of gravitas that would have made his character's increasing eccentricities more bearable to watch. Even though the reed-thin Texas-tinged voice is accurate, there is something perpetually juvenile about DiCaprio's appearance regardless of the twenty-year span of the story. This unfortunately compromises the chemistry between him and the obviously more mature Cate Blanchett, who initially seems to be crossing the border into parody as Hepburn. She displays the familiar brusque manner without caution and even affects the recognizable voice but with an inaccurate throatiness that belies the legendary actress' high, fluttery pitch at the time. Nevertheless, she eventually finds her grounding, especially as she recognizes their too-similar personalities and softens during the Hepburn family gathering scene.

With less to do, the too-patrician Kate Beckinsale is in over her head as Ava Gardner, unable to convey the real actress' palpable sultriness or predatory voraciousness without posturing. On the other hand, Alec Baldwin is becoming a stronger character actor with every new film, and he plays Trippe with disquieting authority. John C. Reilly plays assistant Noah Dietrich in his typically hangdog fashion as he subsists more in the shadows. Alan Alda plays Brewster with Hawkeye's familiar mannerisms unafraid to show the underlying sliminess of his character. All the externals are impressive - Thelma Schoonmaker's sharp editing (the pacing never drags...just the story), Robert Richardson's cinematography, Dante Ferretti's production design, Sandy Powell's costumes. Yet for all of this, the movie falls short as a masterwork in Scorsese's filmography. This is a film to respect and not to love.

The first disc has an excellent commentary track by Scorsese, Schoonover and producer Michael Mann - all full of insights without being pedantic. The number of extras on the second disc of the two-DVD set is staggering, really too much for anyone except for those deeply interested in Hughes. There is one deleted scene and twelve separate featurettes and documentaries covering everything from the production to Hughes' role in aviation to OCD to the music. Beyond the sheer number, my complaint about the set is that it's hard to maneuver around the decidedly viewer-unfriendly menus.",8
31 January 2005,Martin Scorsese's take on a 20 year period in Howard Hughes' life can only be called spectacular.,"Martin Scorsese's take on a 20 year period in Howard Hughes' life can only be called spectacular. This film has had me raving since the first time I saw it several weeks back. It is an epic that has everything that makes an epic film extraordinary with its story of a person who are bigger than life itself, combined with great visual effects, wonderfully colorful performances, and exposing the utter genius of Hughes, ""The Aviator"" proves not only be entertaining, but enlightening. Opening with the shot of Hughes as a boy being bathed by his mother and her spelling the word 'quarantine' to him, she instills a fear of disease on what was a fragile mind. We watch how Hughes subtly becomes obsessed with his business ventures into TWA airlines, his scandalous movies, and his building of the world's largest airplane, the Hercules. Furthermore, we see an intimate look at the man from escapades with teenage girls to Hollywood actresses Eva Gardener and Katharine Hepburn, played by Kate Beckinsale and Cate Blanchette, respectively. Blanchette's performance as Hepburn is so colorful and amusing that she proves to be the film's most intriguing performance. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hughes in an excellent performance. The only thing that works against DiCaprio is that he physically looks young, a look he's had trouble shedding considering he is in his early 30s. But it is easy to disregard considering his dialogue delivery and movements are superb. The film flows at a furious rate for a three hour picture and it manages to hold the audience's attention the whole period without succumbing to a single dull moment. Simply put, ""The Aviator"" is the best film of 2004!",10
7 April 2017,Wonderfully made film based on Howard Hughes,"The Aviator really is a fantastic film. The acting is so wonderfully done! I adored Cate Blanchett gives an impeccable portrayal of Katherine Hepburn. I mean everything from the voice and the behavior to her emotions. Very well deserved academy award victory! And of course Leonardo DiCaprio does a great job with his representation of the famed Aviator Howard Hughes. He is charming when the film calls for it, acts like a real old timey gentlemen, but then he can turn into a totally unhinged crazy person. And DiCaprio handles both kinds of demeanors very well. The script is very intelligently written and it gives such lengthy character development for both Hughes and Hepburn. I just adored the scenes that involved monologues by either Hughes or Hepburn, or scenes where it's them conversing back and forth. The acting is so involved and as I've mentioned, the script provides such deep character detail that when you combine those two things, it makes for an absolutely magical moment. And there are plenty of those kind of moments. The film handles the final stage in Hughes's life well, him going crazy, locking himself naked in a theater room. Long nails, long hair, completely naked, it would be an understatement to say he went ""mad"" towards the end of his life, and Leonardo plays this so well! Very realistic and it all flows naturally, doesn't seem forced in the slightest. Overall a fantastic film based on real people. 10/10!",10
9 January 2005,A Disinterested Scorsese,"Martin Scorsese's biography of Howard Hughes' most productive years is distressingly impersonal and while any Scorsese is better than no Scorsese, ""The Aviator"" has the feel of a debt being repaid to Miramax for making ""Gangs Of New York"". His commitment seems so low-level that what used to be a deliciously rigorous style here seems reduced to a series of trick shots that have less to do with burnishing an impression than with going through the motions of creating something merely impressive. The only time Scorsese appears engaged is in the first third in which Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) directs the aviation picture ""Hell's Angels"" and then tussles with censors with a frenzy reminiscent of the director himself. The rest of the film evolves into a ""movie"" movie with real characters portrayed by actors who act as if they're in a movie (particularly Oscar-baiting Cate Blanchett, as Katherine Hepburn, who appears to have watched ""The Philadelphia Story"" one too many times). It takes DiCaprio almost two-thirds of the picture to discover Hughes but he finally does as he ages into a deeply troubled hermit who still can muster the courage to vanquish the foes, Senator Ralph Owen Brewster (a very good Alan Alda) and Pan Am head Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin), who have conspired to break him. In Hughes' later years, DiCaprio bears a definite resemblance to him, but it's also at this point that he bears a striking resemblance to the young Orson Welles, which further connects to the film's thematic links—-and, it would appear, Scorsese's way of passing the time for most of the film—-to ""Citizen Kane"": John Logan's workman, easy-solution script (he blames Hughes' mother) attempts to portray him as a rich kid whose upbringing has traumatized him into an obsessive who lives to control the lives around him; and I swear Howard Shore's score seems at times to purloin Bernard Herrmann's. All that seems to be missing is Rosebud. Entertaining and over-sized but not particularly memorable—-you get the sense it started receding from Scorsese's memory after the premiere.",5
27 April 2008,Disappointingly hollow,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",
21 December 2004,Grade: B+,"Leonardo DiCaprio IS Howard Hughes in the piece that should finally win Martin Scorsese that elusive Best Director Oscar.

Hughes biopics have been floating around Hollywood for decades. And no wonder - the story of Howard Hughes is an excellent example of the American dream being followed through to its conclusion. Tremendous, unprecedented power, fame, success, and wealth, followed by a massive, nearly unprecedented crash-and-burn. What could be more quintessentially American? Of course directors and producers have been scrambling all over each other to be the first to put a summation of Hughes' life on screen. A competing project starring Jim Carrey and directed by Christopher Nolan has been rumored for some time, in fact. But Scorsese got his out first, and I can't imagine that Nolan's film could possibly be any better.

For the uninitiated, Howard Hughes was one of the great eccentric geniuses of this century. He was a film producer and director, an engineer, a pilot, a hotelier, and a crazy, crazy man. He ended his life in the suite of his Las Vegas hotel, which he hadn't left in twenty years. By that time, he was receiving daily blood transfusions from Mormons, who he believed were the only clean people in the world. He was no longer trimming his fingernails or cutting his hair or beard. He wore tissue boxes on his feet, and a surgical mask at almost all times. Terrified of germs, Hughes barricaded himself in his hotel and died there alone, sad, and insane. This would seem to me to be the most interesting part of Hughes' life to film - watching his madness devour him alive.

But no - Scorsese made the choice of allowing us to see Hughes in his younger, more vibrant days, and allowing us to watch the madness creep up on him instead.

The film opens as Hughes is filming ""Hell's Angels"", now nearly universally lauded as a masterpiece. He's throwing money at it hand over fist, but it's a passion, so he doesn't care. Genius or insanity?That's what Scorsese and DiCaprio bring across more than anything else here - the line between the two is so thin, it can be invisible in some cases. It certainly was with Hughes.

Eventually, Hughes gets into the airline business, founding TWA. He gets into a streetfight with PanAm, in the person of PanAm president Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin, enjoying being the bad guy) over who has the right to global flights. In between all the corporate and political intrigue, Hughes finds the time to fall madly in love with fellow outsider Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), and to dally with Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). All along, Hughes struggles with his obsessive-compulsive tendencies, his most heroic moment coming when he overcomes his agoraphobia in order to testify before Congress (represented in the person of Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, a snarky Alan Alda) and save his company.

Leonardo DiCaprio is the true savior of this movie, and Scorsese deserves credit just for getting out of his way. This is DiCaprio's chance to grow up as an actor, and he takes it and runs with it. It's difficult for a star of his caliber to be anything but Leo on screen, but he succeeds more than admirably in making you see Hughes instead of the movie star. He even comes to actually physically resemble the fortyish Hughes, a remarkable feat for a babyfaced thirty year old. It's a terrific performance, and one that should garnish Leo an Oscar nomination.

Also notable is Cate Blanchett's Katharine Hepburn - her performance is jarring at first, seemingly over-the-top, but once you settle in and realize that that's really how Hepburn WAS, it becomes fascinating. Her relationship with Hughes is heartbreaking. It's a case of two Hollywood outsiders who can't get past each other's eccentricities - a great romance cut short by neurosis. To me, the segment of the movie that examines their relationship is the best part of the film.

Overall, it's a slick and good-looking film, which is almost enough to get you past its shallowness. But DiCaprio and Blanchett are both wonderful.",
23 February 2005,"Hear no bad movie, see no bad movie","I went and saw The Aviator with 45 other people, all who like different films and were in need of a good movie, any movie, to relax with after a stressful day. All were drawn in by the glow of Oscar nominations, wondering whether any film could compete with Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King sweeping the boards last year. During the film, nearly twenty of the people in my group went out half-way through and never came back to watch the rest of the film. Seven people admitted to falling asleep. After the film had finished, only two people said they liked it and even they would give it only 6/10. I personally lost the will to live. Leonardo DiCaprio, who shined in Romeo + Juliet, was irritating and uninteresting. I even found myself growing annoyed with Cate Blanchette, who is a wonderful actress, because of the fact she was in this film. The story advanced slowly and tediously. I didn't really care about the characters as they had little depth to them. Huges obsessive compulsive disorder was never really explained and there was no humour to balance out his repetitive breakdowns. Had the film been created with some black comedy and some in-depth character explorations then this may have been able to do what all films should - entertain. Don't see this movie and don't let it get a single Oscar, please!",1

30 September 2017,Industrial crash (dad),"I got prejudices against this movie, even before I watched it!

First of all, it's a Biopic and so far the Hollywood ones proved to be inept: 1) they reorganize the fact to be like they want them to be and not like they are in reality 2) An artist exists by his artistic creation and the process to get them is irrelevant.

Due to the title (aviator) I expected the movie to be just a rich hobby about flying that could only appeal to rich: I don't see why as a simple citizen, I could be interested in such child-play So I put the DVD and start the movie with Scorcese comments: as soon as I understand it's also a movie about (old) Hollywood, my tiny little interest for it just got totally extinguished as for me, movies about movies are the ground-zero of filmmaking: I just don't understand how such movies can be produced except to please the navel-gazing ego-centrism of this little world! It would be like reading books about writing or listening to album about making music!

It's silly, a huge loss of time so I just skip chapters to only watch scenes between DiCaprio and Beckinsale: Sure the production is lavish, every one has fantastic wardrobe but nothing comes of it: later, DiCaprio lives like a hobo in his house and Beckinsale helps him to get ready for a Senate hearing: honestly, why should I care? What's the point to such story? I just don't give it a Sh!t.

This quickest 3 hours movie i watched just adds tons to my opinion that Scorcese is a poor director, totally overrated and he finds such support from the establishment because they just need to find a name!",1
26 January 2005,The Aviator....Lives up to the hype,"The day after this film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards I decided to go see it in the theater to see what all the fuss was about. I was disappointed by Scorsese's previous film and was expecting this one to be the same ploddingly well shot film. Thank god it wasn't. This film hits all cylinders and never misses a beat. ALL of the actors do a fantastic job especially Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn. The film however revolves around Howard Hughes and we see his highs and his lows. The Aviator has throwback feel and look to it complemented by special effects that weave their way into the film seamlessly. At just under three hours long its is paced well and the time goes by without dragging. It really is a good film that deserves all of the attention that it is getting and I recommend it to everyone.

16 August 2019,The Aviator (2004),"Directed by Martin Scorsese. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, John C. Reilly, Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Matt Ross, Adam Scott, Kate Beckinsale, Danny Huston, Ian Holm, Kelli Garner, Jude Law. (PG-13)

Extravagant biopic on the life of Howard Hughes (about twenty years worth, anyway): aviation trailblazer, Hollywood director, womanizer of Tinseltown starlets, and eventual obsessive-compulsive recluse. Scorsese proves again his mastery of filmmaking technique and storytelling, crafting a sensationally vast and detailed world (with the help of superb talents like editor Thelma Schoonmacher, director of photography Robert Richardson, art designer Dante Ferretti, and many more) and using plenty of the ol' ""movie magic"" to make the presentation stylized yet remarkably authentic (even employing recreations of two-strip and three-strip Technicolor to represent different periods). However, unlike most of Scorcese's other rich central-figure character studies (from Jake LaMotta to Jesus Christ), there doesn't seem to be a prevailing thesis or attitude to the subject; should Hughes be admired, pitied, scorned, championed, etc.? The cast, populated by many famous faces in roles both small and large, rarely disappoints; it was DiCaprio's best work since ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" and aside from coming off a bit cartoonish during her early golf game scene, Blanchett is just about perfect as Katharine Hepburn (and won her first Oscar for it).

13 January 2005,"Beautifully told and with a great story  pardon the pun, but three hours flew by","Having inherited his fortune from a tooling business, Howard Hughes seems intent in ploughing into his first film, constantly reshooting and reediting it, leaving the money worries to his business manager Noah Dietrich. His passion for flying leads him to invest heavily in his own domestic airline, TWA, while also making motion pictures and having relationships with some of the most beautiful women (and girls) in Hollywood at the time. Despite suffering from an obsessive compulsion regarding cleanliness, Howard seems to be on top of the world, but attempts to steal a section of the trans-Atlantic business away from Pan-Am proves to be a risky venture, following several failed wartime projects, leading to a high stakes battle.

I must be honest and say that, although I watch a lot of movies I don't really care about the real life gossip behind the scenes and hence some elements of this film were news to me; details mainly, but even then I must admit that I knew very little about Howard Hughes outside of the fact that I had seen his name of many films down the years. Certainly I knew comparatively little about his airlines and his personal traits. For this reason I watched the film with some interest but also a pinch of salt as I was aware that these film rarely tell the whole truth. Ignoring this latter concern, I found myself swept along by a great story and a great film and, when it ended some three hours after I sat down, I looked at my watch wondering where the time had gone! The fact that Hughes himself is a very interesting character only helps a script that crams the film full of so much of interest that it is hard not to be caught up in it. At times it labours some points and at other times it will not focus on areas you would like it to, but it still works. I felt the obsessive compulsive thing was lingered on too much once or twice and some scenes featuring it could have been cut down a little bit, but they didn't slow the film much if at all, so it is more opinion that flaw picking. Also, as a fan of the cinema, I expected more of his films to be mentioned but I guess in fairness these are less interesting that his real work. On top of the story, the script is actually exciting and funny as well as being human and involving  a great combination and one reason the hours just went so fast.

I have not seen Gangs of NY yet, so cannot say if this is Scorsese returning to form, but it is certainly a very strong piece of direction that screams class and is very much his work. Complicated shots, one take tracking shots across crowded rooms and so on, all make the film look great without seeming overly flashy. I'm not sure if he has used special effects (as in computer graphics) before, but Scorsese seemed very at home with the cgi shots of planes etc used  some may not have been 100% convincing but it's as close as dammit. Unusually for him, the one place he did fall down was with the use of music as I found the choices to be pretty obvious and a bit repetitive; happily it took little away from the film but it is surprising for a man who wallpapers his films with music well when he wants to. The sense of time and place is spot on, mainly due to great costumes, sets and a real attention to detail running through the whole film.

The cast add to the feeling that this is a quality production, although at times they are a distraction. First off, DiCaprio is great  and I never thought I'd be allowed to say that again. The guy who showed so much talent early on before appearing to give it up to soulless projects is convincing here in many ways; whether suffering with a drive he can't overcome, being on top of his game or just being funny, DiCaprio does it well. Of course he struggles with the fact that he never ages (making it hard to see the passage of time in the film) and that he looks 16 anyway, but he tries his hardest to make us forget this and, for the most part, he does it. Aside from him, the rest of the cast are best seen as support or cameos and generally they are very good. With real, famous characters it is always a risk that actors will give impressions rather than performances but the likes of Blanchett and Beckinsdale are better than that and do both equally well. Reilly is good as always, Baldwin is enjoyable and it is always a pleasure to see Alan Alda, who happens to be great here. The only problem with the cast having so many stars in it is that they are occasionally distracting  for example Willem Dafoe, Ian Holm and Brent Spiner all have little to do other than providing a ""hey look it's "" factor.

Overall though it is a very impressive film and one that is enjoyable to watch even if you start the film with very little knowledge of Howard Hughes (something that modern multiplex audiences will do). The script is interesting, exciting and funny by turns and the direction is stylish without being overly flashy. The cast are all good despite a few of them being more distracting than value-adding.",
18 September 2006,A puzzling and enigmatic personality,"Legends about Howard Hughes are numerous about his final days, when he cocooned himself in a hotel in Las Vegas, but this film offers some astonishing insights about the reclusive billionaire even for those familiar with his legacies.

Hughes was a colorful and interesting man, a tireless workaholic successful in almost everything he did. Even when a project failed, he'd bounce right back, never giving up at any time. As the Aviator, he actually held a speed record for a flight at one time. He was a film producer. He was popular with women. He founded an airline. He owned casinos in Vegas. And on and on. Although Leonardo DiCaprio' performance captured this unique and enigmatic man's puzzling personality well, he doesn't resemble him enough. This may detract from the movie for some viewers, others may overlook it since DiCaprio's work was so strong.

It's a powerful story which is depicted well. Special effects of a plane crash he miraculously survives are executed with uncompromising intensity. The rise of the entrepreneur is depicted well; the ferocious and unwavering spirit of Hughes is clearly defined, as is his ultimate descent into a paranoid reclusiveness. The scene with the milk bottles will leave you shuddering as you consider the tragic degeneration of a man of his stature. The film is not exploitive in this, but sympathetically offers insights into this man's psychological state.

The movie achieves all that it sets out to do, and will leave you thinking afterwards.",7
22 October 2005,An Very Interesting Movie,"I Found the Aviator very compelling to watch and enjoy, despite its length i felt it was perfectly paced and captured my interest very early on in the film. Some of the visuals in the movie are a brilliant demonstration of how to utilise modern effects and keep them realistic, and although used throughout the movie, at no time do they look out of place.

Great credit has to go to the cast, who all produced fine performances. In particular Dicaprio who captured Hughes's excentricity with imagination and conviction and Blanchett, who successfully brings Hepburn to life.

BUT

Scorcese has to take most of the credit for the film's success, he really does capture the audience with his stylish direction. This is not his greatest achievement, but its damn good.

30 July 2005,"Perfect example of style over substance, a rare detour for Martin Scorsese.","Nobody can deny that Howard Hughes had a tremendous impact, not just on America but over the whole world and to film a biopic of him could never be boring. Another matter is to watch it and I must say that even though the movie does have stunning sequences and you can tell that everything in the flying sequences was well researched, it does leave you rather unfulfilled at the end. The trouble begins, as it usually does with the performances of the actors. Leonardo DiCaprio does well in the opening sequences and in one particular scene (the premiere of Hell's Angels) he captures just about every aspect of his character which unfortunately will be overemphasized through the rest of the movie. Like another of Scorsese's favorites, De Niro, he is pretty much let loose to bring out every emotion that he has in order to make the character a human being, rather than a stereotype.

The supporting cast are not so lucky and I must say that even though Cate Blanchett is very good indeed as Katherine Hepburn, she hardly deserved the Oscar for her performance here. Her one great moment is when she and Dicaprio visits her family and they play a game of one-up-man-ship but that is more a collaborative effort.

Another supporting actor nominee, Alan Alda, is serviceable as the slimy senator on the take from Alec Baldwin. His scene with Dicaprio at the hotel lunch meeting is some of the best acting he has ever done, despite the fact that it is rather superfluous because it is merely a set up for the big Senate hearing. The third actor worth mentioning is John C. Reilly who is in nearly every major American film today. Here he gets to play a normal character for once but he is terribly wasted. We don't feel that he is all that important neither to Hughes or the film.

So to repeat what I said earlier: The story of Hughes is fascinating but like so many biopics it is not completely up to par with the real story. I think the opening caption on this film says it all: ""Based on a true story"" and not ""The full story"".",5

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",8
21 June 2005,"DiCaprio gives performance of a lifetime,but film should have gone further.","My only disappointment with this film is that it did not go deeper into the life of Howard Hughes.He led an indeed bizarre life from the beginning to the end.Every minute could make a compelling film.Leo DiCaprio gives the performance of a lifetime here which far surpasses anything he has done in the past.We get to know him through Leo not only as the passionate aviator that he was,but as the mentally troubled soul that he was.DiCaprio covers both areas very well.I only wish the film would have gone further into his life as I said before.Perhaps a sequel would be in order.Particularly compelling to me were the scenes between DiCaprio and Alan Alda as Senator Bruster.Thoroughly electric!Cate Blanchett is also worthy of note,in her excellent portrayal of Kathryn Hepburn.Worthwhile viewing.

3 January 2005,Like the Platte River ...Too long...Too Shallow,"The Aviator is about aviation innovator Howard Hughes. It is about womanizer Howard Hughes. It is about psychopath Howard Hughes. Any one of these would have made an interesting film. Altogether they resulted in a shallow portrayal over too long a period of time to retain my interest. In short, I was bored.

Let's look at the love affairs. The bit about Jean Harlow was so minuscule it could easily have been cut with no harm to the biography. The same could be said about the scenes with Faith Domergue. The Ava Gardner story could have been interesting, but it was too fragmented to be of interest. Only the Kate Hepburn story was truly compelling, mostly because of the exceptional performance of Cate Blanchett. Still, even this episode  which could have been developed into a two-hour story  left me wanting.

Then, there's the psycho-pathological element. Who was his mother and why did she treat him like she did? We don't know. Was this a sexually abusive relationship? The opening bath scene leaned in that direction, but we don't know. If Hughes was so horrendously phobic, why did the phobia take so long to emerge and wreck his life? We don't know. It's a shame the writer and director did not reveal the answers to these questions. Perhaps no one knows the answers; we just know he was psychopathic.

Finally, let's talk about aviation. I love airplanes. I could relate to Hughes' passion. I could thrill with his gallivanting around the skies  racing, filming, testing, wooing Hepburn. I didn't even mind the fact that nothing in the air was real  just computer generated images. I wanted to stand by his side when he faced off with greedy Juan Trippe and sleazy Senator Owen Brewster. I wanted to fight with him and fight for him. But even this was shallowly presented. The evidence is readily apparent: major characters, identified by labels as if this were a documentary, enter the story without the viewer being prepared for who they are, why they are there, and why we should care about them. I just couldn't get hooked. I didn't care.

Interesting note: when I was first out of college, I worked as a technical writer with a man who was nearly at the end of his career. He had been with Hughes Aircraft and had the dubious honor, along with three or four others, of pulling Hughes from one of his many plane crashes. My fellow employee told tales of Hughes and of the rescue for which Howard ensured him of employment for as long as he wanted to stay on.

Sadly, The Aviator added nothing to my knowledge of Howard Hughes and, although it had great potential to tell a fabulous story about one of aviation's most celebrated innovators, it failed.",4
7 January 2005,"Dude, where's my Scorcese?","I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob.

3 February 2005,Fly high with this historical gem,"Some people say you can't be born a legend, you can only become one. Well, I think in the case of Martin Scorsese, it's a little bit of both. You see, when you're watching a Scorsese film, you're watching movie-making at its best. No detail is left behind in his films which is just one of the many reasons why Scorsese is one of my favorite directors in Hollywood. Over the years Scorsese has put out some masterpieces and although he has won numerous awards for his work, he has yet to hold the coveted Oscar statuette in his hand. A couple years ago when GANGS OF NEW YORK was being promoted, everyone thought it would be the one to give Scorsese his first Oscar, but as most of us saw, that didn't happen. Instead we saw the much acclaimed musical CHICAGO take home the gold. Two years later, we find Martin Scorsese to be in the same exact position, only it's with THE AVIATOR now. Will the same fate hit Scorsese again with Adrew Lloyd Webber's THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, yet another musical? Or will the academy finally award him for not just his magnificent work on THE AVIATOR, but for everything he has brought to movies over the past 30 years?

This film is loosely based on the life of Howard Hughes, one of the first true millionaires of America. Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio), who was only a teenager when he inherited his family's tool business, had dreams that most of us couldn't even begin to think of. One of his dreams was to make a motion picture, which he did with HELL'S ANGELS, a film that not only introduced Hughes to Hollywood, but introduced him to such movie starlets as Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). Having always had a love of aviation, Hughes decided to build the world's fastest plane during the making of HELL's ANGELS, a project that proved to be successful one clear day in 1935. After being dubbed the ""world's fastest man,"" Hughes decided to broaden his spectrum of wealth by purchasing the airline company TWA (TransWorld Airlines). He even began to build a special spy plane for the government, but all was not well in Hughes mind as time passed by. After being dumped by Hepburn, a new enemy arrived for Hughes, Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin), president and CEO of America's leading airline PanAm. And Trippe, with politicians on his side, set out to destroy not only TWA, but Hughes himself leading the great aviator to fight mental demons he never thought he would have; demons that would eventually leave the pioneer at rock bottom. But, just when you think Hughes has no fight left in him, he picks himself back up and somehow manages to rise to the top again in a fashion that could only be expected from Howard Hughes.

Ever since GANGS OF NEW YORK, I had the feeling that we would see Scorsese and DiCaprio team up again, but who would have guessed it would be DiCaprio coming to Scorsese instead of the other way around? As it turns out, DiCaprio is a huge Howard Hughes fan, so when he gave the idea to Scorsese, how could the great director refuse? Well, I'm confident that Scorsese sees something in young Leo, which is probably why he agreed to direct the film. Scorsese allows his young actor to pretty much open up his talents, which couldn't have been a better decision. Going back to WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, I could see the endless potential DiCaprio, but I would never expected such a performance like the one he turned in for THE AVIATOR. He truly became Howard Hughes inside and out balancing the true nature of what made Hughes a legendary industrialist and pioneer. But, DiCaprio was not the only star in this film; he had some great talent around him led by Cate Blanchett, who just seems to get better with time. Blanchett, who played Katherine Hepburn, captured the true essence of why Hepburn was a marvel in Hollywood. And then there was Kate Beckinsale, who did a tremendous job in playing Ava Gardner, the new and upcoming star of the times. Beckinsale, who most people will remember from PEARL HARBOR, in my mind, is starting to come into her own as an actress. Only time will tell us how great she actually becomes. But, the one guy that many will forget from this film will be Alec Baldwin, who played the evil PanAm CEO Trippe. Even though Baldwin doesn't occupy much of the films 168 minute running time, his presence is known in every scene in which he appears, reaffirming his talent as being the best among his brothers.

Many critics will downplay this film because it drags and it's too long. And, although I do agree that the film felt longer than it was, that's one of the aspects that I come to appreciate with a Martin Scorsese film. I mean, going in I know it will feel like a 6-hour film, but I don't care. In fact, I look forward to it because there's no other director in Hollywood that can do the things that Scorsese does behind the camera, and no other director that can bring in the type of emotion that Marty can bring. He may spend more time on scenes, but every detail is played out which ultimately makes his films complete. And in THE AVIATOR, Scorsese has clearly done just that bringing in all the emotion and features that made Howard Hughes who he was.

I don't know what the future holds for THE AVIATOR, but if my predictions are right, it will be covered in gold. Not only did Martin Scorsese capture the true essence of Howard Hughes and what he meant to this country, he allowed Leonardo DiCaprio to run with the character which ultimately left no stone unturned.",8
26 February 2005,The Great American,"Needless to say, with Martin Scorsese scribbling his name on this picture it's granted automatically a statute of epic proportions. However I have this feeling Scorsese has taken a wrong turn, a few years ago. I didn't really like ""Gangs of New York"", but ""The Aviator"" exceeded my worst expectations. Yeah, it's that bad.

There are a few undebatable points of critique. The first is the movie's length. There doesn't exist any cohesion between the material and the time it takes to present it, so, at some point, it all falls apart. And the reason for this implosion is that there is practically next to not tension in the movie. It's got no grip.

The second is Howard Hughes' persona in the film. Now, I don't know why, but I'd call it the Kane syndrome, people keep falling for demented creeps who appear to have a vision. It is not groundbreaking that people aren't perfect and it's not that exhilarating, nor dramatic to see a stuttering man getting stuck at this one phrase, repeating it over and over again. It does not penetrate, it blinds in. And the absolute down point of the film is, paradoxically, the only real scene where it shows some guts, at Hughes's hearing. Why? Because the things he says are so stupid. Don't interpret stupid as dumb. Consider it out of context and false, trying to dramatically impose a figure upon the viewer.

The third reason, and let's say last because three is a magic number, is Scorsese's total lack of inspiration. He is uninspired by insisting to keep Di Caprio as his lead, when Di Caprio can simply not captivate due to the Titanic syndrome. He is uninspired in his choice of ""lirysm"", because at some points the visuals don't match the music. Shortly put, he's bland.

It wouldn't be fair to omit the few intelligent moments of screen writing - rare, but nonetheless delightful given the monotony of this whole thing. Maybe Blanchett who actually seems to be an actor can gain some appraisal from me, but not much. I don't really enjoy her. That's it.

""The Aviator"" is like the Hercule of Hughes' in some regards. It's just too damn big and ripped off to fly.",5
20 December 2004,Fun to watch... but nothing to get frantic about either.,"I felt that the performances were good. Not amazing. Not excellent. Good.

To me that means these actors delivered the lines well, nothing the director recommended or framed them in got in the way and I enjoyed watching the film.

Audiences and Critics (even armchair) are a bit too quick to throw recent movies into the ""Great!"" category. Leo's portrayal of Hughes was admirable. He did a good job... but was he fabulous? Cate Blanchett... OK, I can buy the Hepburn act for 3 hours. Still, is it really great acting or a great impression? I'll give her a break and say she was good at both.

Great is Denzel Washington in Glory, John Turturro in Barton Fink or even Clark Gable in The Misfits. Somehow, this one seems a little too close to made for TV if it wasn't for the incredible cinematography and amazing pace that only Scorsese can master.

I can't pick any actor out of this and say they were bad. That's the best thing about this one. I was caught in the story.

Leo DID seem too young and skimpy throughout the film.

Anyway, hats off to all of 'em. It's a movie worth watching, and that's better than most of the junk coming out of Hollywoodland these days.",7
30 December 2004,"Not Scorsese's Best, not even close.","Though certainly not a bad film by any means, it still is only Scorsese's fourth best film (his best is Gangs of NY, then Goodfellas, then Casino). I do think Leo deserves a nomination because he displayed the character excellently, especially the OCD (which i would know what it is like, because i have it), but I still think Colin Farrel deserves the win. Also Cate deserves a nomination because i thought she was Hepburn, but i also think Angelina deserves the win. I don't how ever think that Scorsese deserves a nomination because the film had many flaws, all having to do with direction and the story that he chose to use, if you were to say he deserved the nomination for Gangs of NY i would agree, i thought he should have won for that, maybe even Goodfellas, but definitely not this one, i'll be fair and give my reasons. First of all why did he put so many long dialog sequences with no score in the movie that had nothing to do with character, it was all about money and politics, and really i couldn't give a crap and a half less, also the drama suffers because of this wasted time and we learn nothing about the people other then they like money, also where was the score? i don't even think there was one, the drama suffers because of that too. Another flaw is the film is too long, I don't mind long movies, in fact i enjoy and prefer long movies, if it needs to be that long, because i feel a movie should be long to tell a whole story and be entertaining, but this one was easily 40 minutes too long, not that it couldn't be as long as it was, it just needs more to do with the characters, and less about money and who he was dating. There were only about 5 very interesting scenes all having do to with the actual aviation like the speed test, the crash (the best scene of the movie), the filming of hell angels, and the mental breakdown towards the end, which was even a little under acted and under played. It had very little, if not, no drama because we didn't learn anything about the characters, other then he had OCD, and they all wanted money. The story didn't feel like it was used, it felt incomplete, they was so much more they could have done, and it could have been very dramatic if there was a score, more character just in general at least, and if his mental breakdown had been more devastating then it was, i would think it deserved a best picture nomination, and even a director nomination, but since it was how it was, i don't think it deserves any other nominations then actor, actress, cinematography, and visuals. 7 out of a 10, barely.",7
16 February 2005,Sort of like watching a turtle on its back,"Knowing quite a bit about Howard Hughes, I expected to see a movie chronicling his minimal exploits in movie-making and his greater exploits as an aviator and a capitalist who built an airline and an aircraft corporation, took on a senate investigating committee and won, and, oh yes, bedded the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood. (NOTE: I was amazed to see that in casting this movie they could find no actresses who could do justice to the beauty of Jean Harlow, Ava Gardner, or even Faith Domergue. That may sound shallow, but beauty is what it was all about. I'll give a grudging pass to Cate Blanchett because of her superb acting. Besides, who ever had the regal beauty of Katherine Hepburne). Back to Hughes: the other interesting fact about Hughes is that at the end of his life he was destroyed by a mental illness we now refer to as obsessive/compulsive disorder. However, few of Hughes' biographers mention the OCD as a significant factor in Hughes' life prior to the late 1950's which is well beyond the time frame of this movie.

To my surprise, the movie was about little other than his OCD which, according to Scorsese, was the driving force behind almost everything Hughes did. I could have lived with that, except for the way it was presented. Poor Leo DeCaprio was forced to spend most of the movie looking as if he had just eaten something nasty. I guess that's what OCD does to you according to Scorsese. In painfully long scenes, DeCaprio would stand unable to function while the camera allowed us to stare at him. It was like watching a turtle on its back trying desperately to right itself.

People all over the theater were holding up their arms, apparently trying to check their watches as we passed the two-hour mark, and a few gave up and left early. Unfortunately, my curiosity overcame my discomfort and I stayed to the bitter end.

Howard Hughes was a much more interesting and complex man than this movie reveals, and his accomplishments were much greater than one would realize from the manner in which they are presented in ""The Aviator"".

Leo is not the right man for this role  he just isn't able to radiate the power, self-confidence, and even arrogance of Howard Hughes. Scorsese's Hughes comes off as a victim taking apparently stupid risks because of a mental affliction which in real life he had not yet acquired.",1
9 August 2006,Magnificent.,"Howard Hughes was an iron and steel industry tycoon, a reckless pilot, he owned an airlines, he was a cinema producer, a playboy A man who live a hundred lives in just one, who defeated death itself after a brutal plane crash... A man that ended up devoured by his own personal demons, his neurosis and his phobias. They turned him into a hermit, locked up in a motel room. A great story to be adapted to the big screen... And who would adapt it better than Martin Scorsese (maybe the best director alive)? I think the first difficulty to avoid was the election of the main actor. I mean, if you choose the wrong guy then the whole project will crumble. Di Caprio, he's a hell of an actor, he's so good, but he still looks like a teenager. Anyway, that's something that all the actors of his generation have in common, so let's just say it is a lesser evil. He carries with the whole weight of the movie and that's a big pressure he just overcame. The rest of the cast is so good as well, specially Cate Blanchett who beautifully plays Katharine Hepburn. The only one who looks out of place is Kate Beckinsale (that poor little thing playing goddess Gardner?? Come On!!).

A magnificent movie, so ambitious, that honour the legend of Howard Hughes and his megalomania. A good script that perfectly set out the ""hows"" and the ""whys"" of Hughes' descent into hell. Maybe it would've been interesting to stress the years that Hughes stayed confined... but it's OK as it is, 'cause Hughes was much more than a neurotic.

13 July 2019,A brief fulfilling epic,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",9
24 January 2021,Flawed,"I read 10 reviews before writing this. I think it was watchable, as I did not know too much of the subject matter, but it was too long and dragged. I saw it on DVD so I could take breaks. It would have been difficult in the theater.

It has an all-star cast of actors and most did really well. I agree with the observation that it was hard to see Leo as the man. He looked way too young to be so rich and successful.

As far as the love interests, Hughes is portrayed as a ladies man but there are really no love scenes. This falls very flat.

16 February 2005,Good but not great Bio-pic,"So what are we to make of the highly touted bio of Howard Hughes.

Certainly this is one of the most lavish and spectacular films of the last few years. It looks great is fantastically put together and acted, but somehow something seems missing.

As the film unspooled I was never bored but I didn't really care. I didn't really connect with the film. Yes, the film is dramatic but its never involving. I never felt that there was a reason to be watching other than it was a well made film that was somewhat interesting.

I'm sure that had it not been a big award winning film that I would have liked it more, but for a film thats up for and won tons of awards I'm left puzzled, a feeling I have about every other Oscar Best Picture nominated film.

See the film, its not bad, and do so on the big screen if possible. Just expect to like the film and not love it.",7
13 February 2005,The Nauseator,"What they did with this film was organise every little last detail FIRST. Then, when they had all the little DETAILS perfect, they tried to film them with actors in COSTUMES that were SO accurate....

Why not focus on something thats worth filming, develop the screenplay RESPONSIBLY, and then hire any ass-head actor to play the part. THEN the film would be coming from the right end to begin with.

This film from this particular director makes me think of those novels where an elderly and distinguished author teams up with young hot-shot but does not actually input anything substantial or significant.

I got the feeling Scorcese was almost the Exec. Producer more than a director.

The best compliment I can give this was that it was beautifully COMPETENT, and that is all.",4
13 November 2005,"Excellent, the best of 2004","The Aviator is my personal favourite film of 2004. I was amazed at the story-telling and the wide mix that made this film. It's a documentary, and it is blended with action, romance, psychology, history, and a great music track. The attention to detail and the picture is excellent. Scorsese does a fine job portraying the mood for every scene in a combination of images and audio. The characterisation is done as brilliantly as some of Scorsese's other films. If you are looking for an excellent storyline, characters, and cinematography, then you must see this film. It stands on its own very well - as a story and as a biography. (For those of you who think that this movie 'has got to be boring' because it is a historical biography, I am telling you that I did not find it boring at all.) You have got to see this film. It's great.

This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",8
1 January 2005,Interesting movie that just suddenly ends...,"Interesting biographical film portraying the early, highly successful years of Howard Hughes before his problems with obsessive compulsive disorder destroyed his mind. The film does a great job of portraying Hughes passion for aviation. You get a very strong impression of his energy and ambition and how it made him so successful. One great scene is where Hughes has dinner with Katherine Hepburn's family. All parties at the table are rich with no need to work again but the contrast could not be greater between Hughes' unrelenting ambition to work and and further aviation in general and the Hepburn family's lifestyle of perpetual relaxation.

The problem is that the film doesn't seem to go anywhere and the ending is very unsatisfying. The film shows Hughes' rise to power, how he flouted all popular conventions of common sense and won, how he built up his business and how he positioned TWA airlines to become a world class airline. But then, just when he appears to have won in his quest to build an international airline, his personal OCD problems take hold, leaving his future in doubt. The film all of a sudden ends at this point and there's no explanation for what followed.

From the way the movie ends, it seems to imply that if OCD hadn't taken hold of him, Hughes would have become one of the most powerful men in the airline industry worldwide as the owner of an international class airline and as a builder and supplier of military aircraft. It almost seems to imply that his OCD is the reason the ""Spruce Goose"" never became a success. Unfortunately, it's only an implication and no real explanation is provided.

The acting was pretty good throughout. I thought Leonardo DiCaprio was excellent as Hughes and Cate Blanchett does a great Katherine Hepburn. Overall, pretty good but not quite best picture quality. 7/10",7
3 May 2021,Aviator Aviator Aviator!,"Finally got round to watching this movie and I gotta tell you I went into it with a whole different mindset. I was gobsmacked at how intrigued this movie kept me, the time flew by it was so good, DiCaprio is pure gold talent if that's a thing even if its not it is now, what an amazing watch, anytime I watch a movie Leonardo DiCaprio is in im never disappointed at all. The best thing with movies like this is that the story is just as good as the acting and especially when the story is based on truth. I think this movie was incredible and I definately recommend it to you!

A movie about a pilot movie director, I wasn't sure at first but im glad I checked it out, it was definitely a movie worth checking off the list.

28 December 2006,An utterly fascinating biography,"The Aviator is the second film based on the life of Howard Hughes, after 1977's The Amazing Howard Hughes, starring Tommy Lee Jones, which I haven't seen. However, whereas the first film was based on a book, The Aviator is an original work from screenwriter John Logan, whose previous work, The Last Samurai, I had tremendously enjoyed.

Upon watching this film I had no special love or hate for either director Martin Scorsese (I found his Casino to be extremely overrated) or star Leonardo DiCaprio (he was good in Catch Me If You Can, but I hadn't gotten over the over-hype of Titanic).

The Aviator is a work of genius. Obviously considered a long film, at nearly 3 hours, it simply zips past, so engrossed you are. Scorsese's direction is brilliant, as is his idea to film each period with that era's ""film color palette"".

The performances here are also top-notch, and are delivered from a true all-star cast. Seriously the number of faces you'll recognize (even in tiny roles) is astounding, the Ocean's movies don't come close. But key here is DiCaprio's portrayal of Hughes.

Indeed, Leonardo, present in nearly every scene, is the movie's core. And the young actor truly fascinates as he inhabits completely the billionaire genius/madman. It is through him that you see The Aviator, and it is only his actions which interest you. As it should be in biographical film.

What else is there to say? Nothing much. There are but a few words to describe The Aviator: fascinating, engrossing, enthralling.. The film has since become a favorite of mine, as has Leonardo DiCaprio.",9
12 May 2007,Too long,"It just is too long. And although I think Martin Scorsese should've gotten his Oscar for another movie than this (so the decision was right not to give him one here imho), I also think he made better movies than Departed. Then again Departed delivered and satisfied more than this!

The acting from Di Caprio is good (much better than in Gangs), although some of the scenes (or better the script) seems to let him down. Even a scene in a cinema hall, really happened (the movie is based on real characters, fyi if you didn't know already), it just didn't translate that well on screen, imho! And the real characters? I do think (and I'm not the only one, as friends of mine have told me), that some actors/actresses have been miscast. The fact that I'm not fully aware of all the H. Hughes stories shouldn't make a difference in my viewing pleasure, but then again they might have made this experience a bit lighter (and heavier at the same time, because of the length) for me ... Not a bad movie/biopic by any mean, but nothing I was excited about afterwards either!",6
31 July 2006,Matin Scorsese Prove Good Director Doesn't Mean Good Movie,"After seeing the movie I now realize why this movie didn't win an Oscar, I feel the movie lack something and it not quite working as it should. The movie is also a one time movie; it means you can't watch it again and again.

The movie is not very well executed and the script, I feel the script is not very strong and well thought. Still the movie works out pretty fine but noting to hold on to, not even with the entire stars that are in the movie. Something is missing in this movie and it left the movie --- blank !!!. Leo didn't perform the best he can, nor is other actors.

Watching this movie is pretty tiring since there noting much except clothing, makeup and how grand the set look but overall not very of the substance. The movie have loads of hole and the casting of Leo is kinda misfit for me.

Recommendation: Should and Could Be Much Better. Not Satisfying At All.

Rating: 5/10 (Grade: C-)",5
6 November 2021,A different look at Howard Hughes,"Leonardo Dicaprio loses himself entirely in another role, this one the real life portrayal of Howard Hughes. I didn't know a lot about the real man, but this paints a darker picture of his struggles and paranoia. It's a little slow at times but the cinematography and lush colors are gorgeous and Leo is great.

18 September 2008,Overrated,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound.

14 July 2005,I hope these blueprints are not the way of the future,"I don't think I'll ever quite understand mainstream tastes. This won five Oscars (including for Cate Blanchett's performance??) and was nominated for six others, including directing, best motion picture of the year, screenplay written directly for the screen and Alan Alda's performance?? That strikes me as bizarre to say the least, although perhaps not as bizarre as the fact that the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films nominated this for ""Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film"", or the fact that so many other awards organizations followed suit.

It's not that I hated The Aviator--I do think it's worth at least one view, especially if Howard Hughes fascinates you. But although I agree that there is some decent (but not Oscar-worthy) cinematography and production design in the film, and Leonardo DiCaprio did a good job despite other factors, I had serious problems with the directing, the screenplay and most of the performances (which I partially blamed on the directing). Yes, I gave the film a seven, but a low seven, and from me, that means this was almost a ""D"". Or in other words, I'd almost not give director Martin Scorsese credit for this if he turned it in for a university course.

The Aviator is a biopic about ""eccentric"" millionaire businessman and filmmaker Howard Hughes (played here by DiCaprio). He also had something of a fetish for aviation, as you could guess from the title of the film. Scorsese and screenwriter John Logan focus on 20 or 30 years of Hughes' life, beginning in the late 1920s, when he was making Hell's Angels (1930), and ending just after the infamous U.S. Senate hearings and the public demonstration of behemoth wooden plane known as the ""Spruce Goose"". It focuses on his dueling obsessions in the film and aviation industries, a couple of his relationshipsprimarily Katherine Hepburn and Ava Gardner, and his increasingly odd ""quirks"".

Since a lot of praise is routinely heaped on The Aviator, I want to mainly focus on the flaws that I believe are present. First off, for the material presented in the film, it is far too long, clocking in at just under three hours. Much of it drags, so the first hour and a half feels more like three. Scorsese has actually had a length problem for some time now--it also seriously marred Casino (1995). He needs to hire an editor who will not kowtow to him. The majority of The Aviator consists of people standing around and talking, and they're usually talking about business. That gives it all the excitement of a 9:00 a.m. employee meeting at a company you don't really enjoy working for. Of course, there's more to the film than that--mainly the romances and the quirk exhibition--but the business meeting mode takes up an unusual amount of screen time. The only time the film becomes really engaging is during a disastrous flight that ends in Beverly Hills. Yes, that's an ""action"" scene, but no, I do not only like action films. Just take a look at my other reviews and ratings.

However, a more serious problem than the length is the combination of direction and performances. The dialogue, in particular, began to grate on my nerves. I'm not sure that the dialogue as written is bad in itself, but Scorsese directs his cast to deliver their lines with bizarre affectations (and I don't just mean characters like Hepburn who did really talk unusually), and frequently talk on top of one another (and I don't just mean the dinner scene at the Hepburn home). Bizarre affectations can work for me in many circumstances. But here, I do not get the impression that Scorsese was trying to make The Aviator surreal (despite the beautiful blue grass on the golf course), Lynchian or experimental overall. The dialogue-delivery and the performances in general tend to play with an aura of ""Hey, we're making a big Hollywood film now"", or, the whole affair seems affected, pretentious, and ""fake"". Perhaps Scorsese was shooting for awards here. Maybe he gets mainstream tastes. To my sensibilities, it seems that Scorsese and Logan were writing and directing to pander to what a particular type of person wants to hear, rather than writing and directing towards what they think is right/believe in artistically.

So I found most of the performances more bothersome than pleasurable, including Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin, both of whom I normally enjoy. Cate Blanchett was particularly grating to me. I've liked her in a couple films, but she's batting closer to .133 for me so far. DiCaprio gave the sole performance--though not Oscar-worthy--that sometimes worked for me. Of course, that's important, since he's the focus; otherwise, The Aviator could have received nowhere near a 7.

There are also serious problems with the ""argument"" Scorsese and Logan seem to be making about Hughes. They seem to place some of the blame for his quirks on his mother, but this is very poorly developed. More seriously, there is a very odd absence of showing why Hughes was as successful as he was--and he was successful, and not just due to an inheritance. According to this film, Hughes was primarily a man who made a number of insane and increasingly financially disastrous decisions while others tried to tolerate him. Even odder, there's a sense of Hughes just ""going along for the ride"". We're not really shown any successful business dealings, relationships, or positive actions. Even considering the film purely as fiction, the character doesn't work for what's supposedly happening ""around"" the character.

Sure, Hughes' quirks are fun to explore, and this and other aspects do occasionally make the film engrossing--occasionally, you forget to glance at the clock. But there are far more serious problems than assets here, and The Aviator is definitely not worth the inflated accolades it has received.",7
12 July 2005,Expertly Made Biopic,"The Aviator is a flawless and powerful picture that leaves an impact on the viewer. The life of the late Howard Hughes is realized by director Martin Scorsese and his star, Leonardo DiCaprio, in this biopic that shows the millionaire's eccentric ventures into Hollywood film-making and breakthrough feats of aviation by breaking speed records. Before I saw this film, I had never really heard much about Howard Hughes so I wasn't really excited to see this film. However, he turned out to be quite an interesting man and this biopic did a good job of telling his life. He had many dreams and actually worked to try to complete them. He did some bad things and he also nearly died from a plane crash. I had never really had an interest for really old Hollywood but this film made me look up some things. Leonard DiCaprio did a great job portraying Howard Hughes. He would sometimes go over the top but rarely. Cate Blanchett plays Katharine Hepburn and does a pretty good job. I usually don't really like her but this movie is an exception. Kate Beckinsale also did a good job as Ava Gardner. John C. Reilly did a really good job though he wasn't a main character. He is also kind of underrated. Alec Baldwin isn't that great of an actor. I never really liked him but apparently Scorsese has a way to get the best out of everyone. Jude Law and Gwen Stefani aren't in the film very much, in fact I didn't really notice Gwen and Jude has like on scene. So very good acting from everyone. Martin Scorsese directs and I can't believe he didn't win an Oscar for this film. He made a beautiful picture and it was sometimes really moving as well. The running time is a long 168 minutes but it goes by so fast as I was defiantly hooked on the film. I find this film superior to Ray as it was better made. The characters were more interesting, direction was better and it didn't suffer from too many clichés. Jamie Foxx did a better job then Leo but not by much. This film also makes you wonder why Hollywood doesn't make films more like this one. In the end, this is an expertly made film and defiantly worth checking out. Rating 10/10",6
25 February 2008,The way of the future is here!,"I don't know what drives Martin Scorsese to make biography pictures. Is it that he wanted to win an Academy Award before earning his first statute from The Departed? Is he really fascinated by these characters he's making about? To be honest, I don't know. But whenever I think of Martin Scorsese , I think about the techniques he uses in his movies from quick editing to fast-forward motion where I am just stunned to see how wild and brilliant Scorsese is.

""The Aviator"" deals with the ups and downs of Howard Hughes (played wonderfully by Leonardo DiCaprio) where not only does he want to make airplanes using the money from his oil tycoon business, but manages to change history as well. He gets involved with movie stars such as Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett as a marvel), Ava Gardner (the delicious Kate Beckensale), Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani, making her film debut) and many other babes including a sixteen year old. While Howard is not only being a mesmerizing playboy and showing off his airplanes, he wants to make movies as well. He makes two of the most harrowing pictures of the early 1930's from ""Hell's Angels"" and the original ""Scarface"" where not only do people consider him a wacko because of the violence, but a genius at the same time.

Just like every popular celebrity in town, there are a couple of enemies that want to slander and rid Hughes of any business. There's Pan-Am flight manager Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) who wants to know the secrets to Howard's new airline plan TWA. Trippe has a sneak on board by Maine republican senator Owen Brewster (Alan Alda) who know the tricks in making Howard suffer.

Throughout the film we get to see Howard's personal problems, and I'm not talking about girl issues, I'm talking about the obsessive compulsive disorder where it's one of the main sides of his downfall leaving everybody to wonder and how he'll succeed if this little disease keeps up with him. He's afraid of germs; he washes his hands more than once; he shuts his mouth tight if he can't get his words right. What a horrible feeling that must be.

Other characters in the film include Noah Dietrich (the gifted John C. Reilly), who is an incompetent bag of hammers that is the fool to Hughes ' King Lear. Glenn Odekirk (Matt Ross) is Hughes' flight engineer who finds Howard's behavior a little strange. Professor Fitz (Ian Holm) is hired by the eccentric engineer to find out if the wind resistance is good or not.

""The Aviator"" may not suit everybody's expectations, but Scorsese never fails on bringing energy just like his other films. I think what made Scorsese make this movie was the fact that he was a fan of the atmosphere of the glamor of the 1930's where most of the movies he watched became his inspiration for making films.

And somehow he gets to go back and make his dream come true in one of the most moving biopics I've ever seen.",10
19 December 2004,Scorsese and DiCaprio back on track,"'And the winner of this year's Academy Award for Best Director is.Martin Scorsese'

Why not? After all, he has been nominated five times before. Adored by critics and hailed as one of this generations finest film helmers, Marty has yet to walk to the podium to accept his due.

Ben Affleck has one. Eminem has one. So why not in the same year that saw Phil Mickelson finally whip his own demons and walk away with a Master's Championship, and the Boston Red Sox overcome the Curse of the Bambino, should Martin Scorsese not be able to put a lifetime of film-making into an honor that has him take home the coveted golden statuette.

Martin's 2004 crack at the can comes courtesy of The Aviator, a film that chronicles the life of movie director and multi-millionaire aviator, Howard Hughes. For any of us that have seen an E! True Hollywood Story or A&E Biography on the eccentric Mr. Hughes, they would most remember his final years. He became a paranoid recluse that bordered on the insane.

But Scorsese only dabbles in Hughes final years and the slow deterioration of this playboy's exile. Instead, he shows what a shrewd businessman and compulsive obsessive aviator Hughes was in his younger years and how he single handedly, due to either his genius or incredible stubbornness, didn't allow Pan Am to buy his Trans World Airlines to create a one-airline option for the American public.

Playing the role as the anomalous Howard Hughes is Leonardo DiCarpio in his second collaboration with Scorsese in as many years (Gangs of New York). I have written for almost five years now how I have not understood the DiCarpio fascination. He was just OK in good films  Titanic, Catch Me If You Can  but gawd-awful in movies that he could have elevated  The Beach, The Man in The Iron Mask. Before The Aviator was even viewed for critics, DiCaprio was garnishing nominations as Best Actor and his salary intake based on one monster making film and countless teen magazines was just mind-blowing to me. Until now.

As Howard, Leo does his best work to date and any non-nomination by the Academy would be robbery. This will be the role that defines DiCaprio. A role where he plays both a man with a vision and a child that locks himself in a room in self quarantine. As a naked Hughes in his red screening room, he drinks copious amounts of milk, lines up his bottles of urine and fends off an aggressive takeover bid by Pan Am's Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin). It is a scene upon which the succeeding chapters strongly rely and in the hands of a less talented actor, could have turned the movie into parody. But DiCaprio turns it into gold and although we are not talking about Tom Hanks type consistency yet, we definitely have seen a maturity that leads to as much more promise than say Gangs of New York did just one year ago.

Clocking in at an unnecessary 169 minutes, the movie's first quarter focuses on the making of Hughes' film Hell's Angels from 1927 to 1930. The film was a visually stunning epic, which before production wrapped, buried three stunt men, was shot twice to incorporate the new innovation of sound in motion pictures and came in at a cost of almost $4 million. Sure that type of money might not even pay for Bruce Willis' baggage handler in today's economics, but back in 1930, it was almost 4 times the cost of the average big screen production. This lavish spending on a film that that would be almost impossible to recuperate, brings Noah Dietrich (always reliable John C. Reilly) into Hughes life as his financial voice of reason and head of Hughes' inherited tools manufacturing business. Together, these two would meet on screen throughout the years as Hughes would always be looking for money to fulfill his dreams while looking to Dietrich to find the money.

After the opening of Hell's Angels, the movie begins to take a turn and follow the two loves of Hughes' life  aviation and women. In his aviation career, Hughes was a perfectionist that garnished grants from the government during wartime to build an airplane to better provide troops and equipment overseas. The plane, nicknamed the 'Spruce Goose' was completed after the war ended and was never used for its wartime intention. And as his empire grew, Hughes also started Trans World Airlines and began the quest of traveling to Europe and beyond. This would consume Hughes in his later years as conspirators in both rival airlines and the government tried desperately to dissipate his dreams.

When it came to women, Hughes was labeled 'The World's Greatest Womanizer' back in the 1950's, but it was his love for Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) that the film reveals most prominently. They had a tumultuous relationship where fame and pressure would ultimately be their demise. But that didn't stop Hughes from putting a lovely woman on his arm each time he went out on the town. Hughes was attached to Ava Gardner and Jean Harlow and various times during his adult life and was the Scott Baio of their times.

The last few chapters of the film deal with Hughes battle with government and his own internal demons as he edges into a world of insanity. This was an important footnote in the life of this public celebrity, but Scorsese probably draws it out 20 minutes more than is necessary.

When the film is over, it is hard not to be overwhelmed with the contributions Hughes made to the future in both film-making and aviation. Without his battles with the government airlines like Southwest and Continental might never have ran a tarmac and he pushed the envelope with such violent or sexual in nature films as Scarface (1932) and The Outlaw (1941) that caused the MPAA to review its processes.

The Aviator will lead the nominations parade throughout 2005. Scorsese, DiCaprio and Best Picture are all strong possibilities and rightfully so. The Aviator was a step back in the right direction for both director and lead actor and was one of the top 10 of 2005.

7 August 2005,Grounded,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",5
30 May 2005,This leaves a lot to be desired; Hepburn notwithstanding,"I presume this movie was released more or less in conjunction with the centennial of the birth of Howard Hughes; he was born on Christmas Eve 1905. This film covers, or at least tries to cover, the ""public"" period of Howard Hughes life, which is shown here as being from 1927 to 1947. That is not too far off. He did not go into seclusion the day he flew the ""Spruce Goose"" though he was well on his way by that time. Hughes was seen frequently for a few more years after wards, then by 1954 or so it became very difficult to find him. He flew a Lockhead Electra on a few occasions in 1958 in Los Angeles; making touch and go landings at the airfield on some Sunday mornings. It seemed that most people working at the airport then knew who was flying that plane, but that didn't generated enough interest to call up the press. By the early 1960s he would venture out rarely, but it was not until 1966-when he started buying up Las Vegas- that his state of seclusion became newsworthy. This movie does not attempt to show those years as the director evidently felt the viewers would already be quite familiar with that phase of Hughes' life.

The main problem is that what is shown has already been shown in other films; even more accurately. About a year after Hughes died the made for TV movie ""Howard the Amazing Mr. Hughes"" depicted the 1927-1947 phase of Hughes life even more realistically than this movie does EXCEPT for one area, and that area is the strength of this movie and probably the reason, other than the centennial issue, why it was made. As I mentioned before other films have already shown this part of Hughes' life in realistic detail as this part of his life was very well documented. In one area though it was NOT well documented and that was about the intimate relations between Hughes and Katherine Hepburn. It was not until her death very recently that letters and notes and other writings between them were discovered in her personal effects. This represented the last known treasure trove of Hughes writings (until his infamous missing will is found) to be discovered. That gives a look at Hughes that had not been seen before. It also shows a lot of Hepburn that is not seen very often as it is part of her life that predates Spencer Tracey. That is, I believe, one of the main reasons why this film was made; not only as a tribute to Hughes but also to Hepburn- who was adored by the movie industry in her later years. The movie also implies that the breakup between the two started Howard Hughes over the edge, but I doubt that was the case in real life. Still, the scenes with the young Hepburn and Hughes are a refreshing part of the movie and I have no doubt that Cate Blanchett shows the young Hepburn as she really was in private with Hughes.

Speaking of romance- One of the problems with this film is the omission of even mentioning Hughes' first marriage- to the daughter of the founder of Rice University. They were married for five years and did not divorce until the filming of Hell's Angels (shown in this movie) was well underway. Why Katherine Hepburn's first marriage is mentioned in the movie and Hughes' is not is probably something of an oversight as it causes him to appear as a playboy who simply cannot commit whereas in reality he was married three times.",4
24 May 2022,Fly Me to the Moon,"Once upon a time, Howard Hughes was one of the richest men in the world. He owned a major Hollywood studio, an international airline and half of Las Vegas. But when Hughes died in 1976, the FBI had to rely on fingerprints to identify his emaciated body.

Now Martin Scorsese has made a fascinating film about Howard Hughes' rise and fall from fame. With Leonardo DiCaprio in the role of the tragic billionaire, we get an insight into what is often called ""The Golden Age of Hollywood"". The glittering parties, the beautiful women (and handsome men) and the shady deals that made it all go around.

Personally, though, I think Scorsese's greatest achievement is to re-establish Howard Hughes as the pioneer in the aviation industry that he truly was.

27 December 2004,Great work by Scorsese and his cast,"Well directed biopic of Howard Hughes that's probably too ambitious and original to be called a biopic. This is simply the story of Hughes' early, gigantic life where he imagined giant movies, glamorous women, and futuristic airplanes, but was crippled by an obsessive-compulsive disorder. Sure, this isn't Scorsese's most personal film, but I never quite thought of him as a straight auteur. A lot of his films do share common themes, but there's always Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, The Age of Innocence, and After Hours. I think of Scorsese first and foremost as a master of the medium, an especially skilled director, and I think The Aviator is one of his greatest directorial triumphs. He is a master of developing the mood of the picture and controlling its pace. It flows beautifully. The film boasts some of the very best acting of the year, too. Leonardo DiCaprio is just coming into his mature period as an actor, and this is his best performance to date. It's definitely Oscar worthy. Cate Blanchett is a marvel playing Katharine Hepburn. At first I wasn't sure if she was just doing a crass imitation, but her character really develops nicely. Cate disappears and we then have Kate. Just try to keep her from carrying home the statuette! Another Kate, Kate Beckinsale, is also very good as Ava Gardener. She's not a great actress, but she holds her own here. Add to them fine supporting performances from John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, and Ian Holm. Also Jude Law, in his fiftieth film appearance of 2004, plays Errol Flynn and is so good that I wanted a lot more. I love films about Golden Age Hollywood, and I like trying to spot the references. One of the best and most entertaining movies of 2004 thus far. 9/10.",9
21 August 2005,"Beautiful, Expensive and Without Heart","I do not know the biography of Howard Hughes, and the magnificent ""Scarface""is the unique movie of his filmography that I have watched. By the number of nominations of ""The Aviator"", the minimum that I could expect would be to know a little about the biography of this American businessman. Unfortunately, the great director Martin Scorcese made a beautiful expensive movie, typically aiming to win the Oscar, but emotionally very shallow and with a very weak screenplay, with many parts very similar to a big soap-opera. After 170 minutes running time, I am not sure whether Howard Hughes was a genius, or a psychotic irresponsible prodigal millionaire born in silver spoon. Leonardo DiCaprio, in my opinion, was miscast with his baby-face in the role of Howard Hughes. The cast is excellent, and the production is outstanding, but in the end I was not fully satisfied with this film. My vote is eight.

28 April 2015,"Objectively there's nothing wrong, but please don't make me watch it again","The Aviator looks like a wonderful film. Its beautifully shot, the costumes and production design are fantastic. Martin Scorsese is a wonderful director, DiCaprio and Blanchett are wonderful actors, Thelma Schoonmaker is a wonderful editor. The screenplay is eventful and has great dialogue. So why did I hate watching this movie so much?

Perhaps it suffers from biopic fatigue. Too much happened in Howard Hughes' life to make the movie a single narrative. Is the movie about his OCD? About his love of planes? About his mad vision for films? About his love life? About his fight with the US Congress and rivalry with PanAm? Scorsese and co. try to tell all of these stories at once, and the result is an overlong experience that is nice to look back on but tedious to sit through.

DiCaprio is good as Howard Hughes - he doesn't nail the OCD with Jack Nicholson subtlety, but the voice is there and the mannerisms are there. He's a solid anchor for the film. Cate Blanchett is delightful as Katharine Hepburn - its a remarkable embodiment and she imbues the part with wit and warmth, but probably not as much as there was meant to be. If she was meant to be Hughes' vice from OCD, the film really should have explored that more. Perhaps if the film career stuff was omitted, there might have been more room for this. In supporting roles, I enjoyed John C. Reilly's always unappreciated dramatic work, but Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda are underused (how did Alda cop an Oscar nomination for this?)

There's nothing wrong with The Aviator, all the pieces are there. But I think if they'd picked a few events from his life (the way that films like Selma and Lincoln are doing these days) it would have been less long, less tedious, and more enjoyable to watch.",5
20 December 2004,Shots and Issues Too Long,"My father worked for Hughes Aircraft for over 30 years, so our family was especially interested in seeing this film about Howard Hughes. I enjoyed seeing the cinematography in this film. It was very nicely shot, especially the night scenes. However, I felt that the film's shots were overall too long. Confrontation scenes between Howard Hughes and Katherine Hepburn went on too long as did scenes showing Howard Hughes' neurosis (hand washing, being distracted by camera flashes and lens changes). I felt that to see a little bit of this was enough, but each scene seemed to be played out much longer than was needed to bring home the point. I also felt that too much time was spent with Howard Hughes' relationships with women (especially Katherine Hepburn) and not enough time showing each of the successes that Howard Hughes had in his career, especially aviation. I think that the prologue should have started out with his father inventing the oil drill bit that was patented. This would have been a better visual explanation of how the family got it's money. It's only alluded to in the film, but it would have been better to have shown this to create a foundation for the family money. I found myself squirming at times because I wanted the film to move more rapidly out of scenes.",6
20 August 2018,A Flight To The Finish.,"I first got this movie, excited that it was directed by Martin Scorsese, who is probably my favorite director. I tried to watch this numerous times and could only pass a half hour. I felt it was slow and that Leo's imitation of Howard Hughes's accent was annoying. I got rid of it-very disappointed with the movie.

Then, a couple years later, I went to a used DVD store and found it for $1.88 and decided to give it another chance. About 2 bucks isn't a bad risk, right?

There was no risk. I have no idea what changed, but I relished every moment of this movie, which runs just under 3 hours. The accent I adjusted to, and I was thrilled with the story.

The movie follows Howard Hughes, a real life filmmaker with OCD. (One movie that he is known for is the 1932 version of Scarface. ) He made many movies with planes, and decided to try flying planes, and that became his new passion.

This movie also goes deep into his OCD, which becomes a part of the PG-13 rating. In one scene, he cleans his hands in a restaurant bathroom so vigorously that he cuts his hands. He also has to wait for someone to enter to leave without touching the germy door. In a more intense part, he locks himself in his movie viewing room nude, talking into a tissue covered microphone. When he has to urinate, he uses empty milk bottles. Aspects like this could deepen conversation on OCD or cause a young viewer to want to learn more about the disorder.

As a film buff, it was also neat to see how Hughes made movies, and all the stars he met. There is a scene where Cate Blanchett plays Katherine Hepburn.

Howard Hughes had a fascinating life and, despite my first assumptions, it made for a great movie. This is one of Martin Scorsese's finest movies.",10
1 December 2004,best movie of the year,"This is simply the best movie I have seen all year. And I have seen them all, I think... I see like 3 movies a week. I saw it at a special screening with a bunch of crusty old movie critics, and they gave it a standing ovation... While not as motivated as the rest of them, I am of the opinion that this is Scorsese's best picture since Raging Bull.... At 166 minutes it does drag at times, and the 3D rendered scenes stood out more than I would have hoped, but the over the top performances (In a good way) of Leonardo and Blanchett were nothing short of riveting. Didn't know Leonardo had it in him... I've had an avid interest in the work of Howard Hughes since I was very young... I've been inside the Spruce Goose, (It's presently in a museum in Northwest Oregon) so I went in expecting a lot... Wasn't disappointed, although I had a few issues the historical accuracy of the story. In the end it didn't really matter, it's just simply a fantastic story...

11 August 2006,"""Underrated Scorsese. A great achievement with a memorable Oscar worthy performance from Di Caprio""","The Aviator (2004)

Number 1 - 2004

The Aviator is a cinematic feat, and the best picture of 2004. Underrated and undervalued Scorsese masterpiece of grand proportions. This is American cinema at its very best and Scorsese is the pilot in this sensational film.

The life of eccentric and obsessive multi-millionaire Howard Hughes from the 1920s to the late 1940s is beautifully captured in the film, with great acting, fabulous cinematography and editing and another superb directorial achievement from Scorsese.

""A genuine cinematic feat. Wonderful Oscar winning entertainment""

""Scorsese is truly one of the leading directors in the world. The Aviator is another display of his talents""

""A spectacular and often glamorous film""

""An Academy Award Winning masterwork from Scorsese""

""Exceptional cinematography, editing, directing and acting make The Aviator one of the finest films of the past years""

""Leonardo Di Caprio is not only worthy of an Oscar, but he's performance in the Aviator is a career milestone""",9
15 March 2014,""" Genius? What are the limits of Insanity ? ""","John Logan wrote the script for this film study of the late Howard Hughes. Under the skillful direction of Martin Scorsese, this movie is thereafter called "" The Aviator. "" It is the bio-Pic of one of the wealthiest, controversial, influential and certainly most flamboyant magnate of the 30's, 40's and 50s'. The son of an oil industrialist who left him an oil and drill bit company which he further expanded into a huge fortune, he further managed to increase its' holdings many times. Later, Howard Hughes became synonymous with early movies which challenged the Hays Code and brought America such stars as Jane Russel. During the same span of years, Hughes became afflicted with a debilitating ailment called O.C.D. or Osbessive Compulsive Disorder. However, his superior efforts also brought him world recognition as well as disastrous influence over many who saw him as a man out of control and a disturbing paranoid mania for cleanliness and perfection. In this film, the cast which features, Leonardo DiCaprio, is superior as he plays the eccentric Howard Hughes, with Cate Blanchett doing a superb job as Katharine Hepburn. Other cast members include Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Ian Holm and Jude Law. The movie is a fast paced ride from Boyhood to reclusive tycoon and each triumph is matched only by the equally strange behaviors which find him isolated in small hotel room afflicted by Allodynia. Still, the director has placed this film in the Annals of the Classics and I have to agree. ****",8
10 November 2011,An outline without insight,"Viewers here seem to tend to extremes of praise or condemnation, neither of which is right. The Aviator is worth watching, but it could have been a lot better.

Hollywood has such a bad record of historical accuracy in non-fiction films that I don't trust them farther than I can spit. In this case, that's about 1945. It seems most of the basic facts are probably presented accurately up to that point, but the problem is there's not much else. However, I couldn't help feeling I was watching a film version of the Clifford Irving fake biography.

The Aviator seems more like a pictorial outline of the life of Howard Hughes, without providing more than a smidgen of insight. I wish the script had done a better job of providing fictionalized but plausible background to help us understand this unusual man. About all we get is the word ""quarantine"" repeated over and over. And the scene at the Hepburn home is way over the top, and not the sort of family described in Hepburn's memoirs.

As to acting, I am not a big DiCaprio fan, but I think he did a good job here. I don't know if it matched the true Hughes, who seemed more solemn, but who knows? I am a big Cate Blanchett fan, but this time it didn't quite work. The energy and presence of the luminescent Hepburn wasn't there, though the voice was, and some of the mannerisms. Actually, Kate Beckinsale delivered the most natural, convincing performance; I have to wonder how she would have done playing Hepburn.

One viewer compared Hughes' story to Tucker, the car maker. But that is to miss the point; Tucker got eaten alive, but Hughes ate the senator - Alda - for lunch. There was much that was heroic about Hughes' life. The old Hollywood knew how to portray heroics, but this film doesn't seem to try very hard. The film is unusually long; more of that time should have been used to provide more depth to the character, rather than drawing out the insanity shtick, which only emerged near the end of Hughes' life.

Looking through the glowing reviews of Martin Scorsese's towering genius, I am struck by how little these reviews have to say about the film, beyond generalities and a list of who is in the movie, etc. Did they actually watch the film?

The more I reflect on this film, the more it leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Frankly, it's a simplistic cheap shot at a complex man. I wonder how many viewers who praise it are old enough to remember when Hughes was alive? Or Hepburn?

But, hey, if you enjoy the movie, what the heck.",4
6 July 2005,"Bad Leo, strong supporting cast","Martin Scorcese's lengthy homage to Howard Hughes is alternately gripping and aloof and unfortunately is forced to rely far too much on the dubious acting talents of its lead, Leonardo DiCaprio. As Hughes, the perpetually cherubic DiCaprio simply doesn't have enough panache for the role, and the sometimes-garish makeup that's intended to show Hughes' aging merely accentuates DiCaprio's anachronistic performance.

The movie spans a few decades in Hughes' heyday, from the 1920s to the 1940s, from his beginnings as producer/director of Hell's Angels to his appearance before a Senate investigatorial committee. Hughes fights with everyone - Hollywood censors, the starlets he dated, his employees, the U.S. government, and rival airline tycoons, sometimes to the benefit of Hughes' myriad business interests, and more often to their debit. The film largely deals with Hughes' involvement in films and in the airline business, choosing to gloss over or ignore entirely his casinos in Las Vegas and the years leading up to his death in 1976.

At the crux of things, though, are Hughes the Film Producer and Hughes the Aviation Pioneer. From his long-delayed Hell's Angels - which made him a national star - to his mammary-obsessed The Outlaw, The Aviator shows how single-minded Hughes was in his relentless pursuit of the Perfect Movie. Because he was independently wealthy and could lean on his own funds to keep production moving, Hughes worked outside the traditional Hollywood studio system, shaping Hollywood to fit his own ideas and methods. Not everything worked - and not every idea was well received - but Hughes remained a man unwilling to compromise his principles; some might call this ""stubbornness."" Juxtaposed with Hughes' film travails is his constant drive to improve aviation, from the purchase of what would become TWA to the innovative behemoth Spruce Goose, which unfortunately flew a distance of one mile exactly one time. Hughes is shown as a notorious perfectionist, personally inspecting each new aircraft to see that it met his (unspecified) standards.

At 170 minutes long, The Aviator manages to cram in many useful and interesting tidbits about Hughes' life and times, and even though certain aspects of his personality were omitted (such as his alleged aversion to African Americans), one doesn't get the sense that something's missing. This is a credit to the screenwriter, John Logan, although the runtime didn't hurt.

As is usually the case with DiCaprio movies, the biggest liability in the movie was Leonard DiCaprio himself. As Hughes gets older in the movie, poor Leo looks exactly the same - and worse, acts exactly the same. Even when he's not laden with makeup, DiCaprio looks like he's about 12 years old and facing the real world for the first time. In The Aviator, he has the gravitas of an empty suit, never appearing to be more than, perhaps, the son of Howard Hughes. DiCaprio isn't terrible in the movie, he's just not terribly believable.

His supporting cast is pretty good, though, especially John C. Reilly as his number-two guy and all-around abuse receiver, Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, and Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, the head of Hughes' rival in air, Pan Am. When you have strong professional performances like the work these people turned in, the movie can suffer an underwhelming lead. Unfortunately, one of the key supporting roles wasn't quite as fulfilling as it should have been - that of Katharine Hepburn, played quirkily by Cate Blanchett. Blanchett adopted Hepburn's idiosyncrasies and personality tics as well as her odd, off-putting stuttering vocal delivery. Now, I'm not saying the real Katharine Hepburn wasn't exactly as Blanchett portrayed her, but her mannerisms were so over the top that they were distracting and annoying. Blanchett won an Oscar for her performance; I believe a Razzie would have been more suitable.

The movie's not much more than an interesting glimpse at a long-dead icon until it reaches the Senate hearings chaired by Senator Brewster (Alan Alda, who also garnered an Oscar nomination). Here especially, Hughes' strength really shows through, although a present-day viewer might wonder how much of the hearings proceeded exactly as depicted in this movie. Alda, by the way, is fine - although I kept seeing those usual Alda mannerisms, which made me think of Hawkeye Pierce instead of a bad-guy politico.

Overall, The Aviator isn't quite the epic it wanted to be, and although it's well paced and benefits from fine supporting performances, it does suffer from an unworthy lead performance.",6
29 December 2004,Unbearably tedious,"I went to see this with a friend, and to be quite honest, I would rather watch grass grow. I walked out of the movie before it was over because I was so bored that I just didn't care to find out how it ended. There is something horribly wrong when one wishes that the hero of the movie would die in a plane crash halfway through the movie just to end the torture.

Like others have said, the cinematography was brilliant and Cate Blanchett did a great job, but other than that, there isn't much to see in this. Go read a book about Howard Hughes instead. Or beat your skull against a brick wall, even. It will be far more entertaining.

6 March 2011,Tucker; the man and his car / Part 2,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",2
31 December 2004,Aviator Glides with near Greatness,"Can legendary Director Martin Scorsese ""score"" his long-awaited Best Director Oscar with his Howard Hughes bio ""The Aviator""? Most oddsmakers feel Marty will be sipping a few ""martynis"" after he receives his first golden boy at this year's Academy Awards. However, Scorsese has been the favorite before and left home empty-handed. For example: 1) The ""Taxi Driver"" oversight many felt was not ""fare"" 2) Many also felt that Academy voters were ""Bad Fellas"" for not awarding Marty the statuette for ""Good Fellas"" 3) Even others felt that the 2003 Academy Awards should have been renamed ""The Gong Show"" for not recognizing Scorsese for his ""Gang Show"" that is ""Gangs of New York"". However, I do think Scorsese will reach new Oscar heights for his spectacular & mesmerizing direction of ""The Aviator"". The bio film focuses on the legendary billionaire, aviator mogul, and Hollywood big wig that was Howard Hughes. ""The Aviator"" takes off with Hughes' relentless direction of ""Hell's Angels"" and ends with the Pan Am/TWA Senate Hearings. During its airtime, ""The Aviator"" exhibits: Hughes romances with Hollywood starlets, his aircraft obsessions, and speaking of obsessions: his obsessive compulsive disorders. Leonardo Dicaprio's performance as Howard Hughes was definitely worth a billion bucks. He portrayed Hughes as capricious, obsessive (of course), enterprising, focused, rigid, suave, and strenuous. Leo's work is one of the best of the year! Pero que ""Leo"" se va forma si no lo nominan para un Oscar. Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Katherine Hepburn, one of Hughes' Hollywood conquests, was hypnotic. Blanchett's ""vowelistic"" vocal interpretation of Hepburn's infamous gab was definitely something to ""vowel, I mean, bow down to"". Hughes romanced Hepburn before she hooked up with Spencer Tracy. I guess the billionairo proved that he can ""have his Kate and eat it too"". Speaking of Hollywood starlets, Kate Beckinsale was a sight of comeliness as Ava Gardner. Ava Maria! She looked hot! Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Danny Huston, and the great John C. Reilly were competent ""aviator"" attendants as the supporting acting co-pilots of ""The Aviator"". The film's cinematography, art direction, and costume design were stellar and not in the ""just plane"" category. The only downfall of ""The Aviator"" was its overlong running time. This nearly three-hour film flight should have landed at the 2-hour runway. Still, it should be your priority not to miss the next theatre flight of ""The Aviator"". **** Good",8
16 December 2022,"Scorsese goes into the spotlight with a deep psychological work around the legendary Howard Hughes, in a meticulous work in technical aspects, script and great performances","The film is a retelling of the life of the eccentric aviator and self-taught engineer, who became a millionaire very early after losing his father, a tycoon who worked in the oil industry. At the age of 18 he was already included in the list of the richest in the United States. Over time, he also gained space in film productions - this amid the transition from silent films to talking films. So much so that one of the events portrayed is his engagement with the production Hell's Angels (1930), his homage to the US army which, in addition to being very expensive at the time, took three years to be released, due to the need to transform it into a talkie.

The fact is that Hughes became something of a ""myth"" in his time. Any projects that gained his attention were done with audacity, as he was not afraid to take risks, especially when it came to money. In addition to cinema, he gained much prominence with his various records flying aircraft - at a time when flying above the atmosphere was considered a brave act, if not insanity. With planes that were designed by his own team of engineers, he broke the round-the-world record in 1938, and was one of the first to have the balls to build larger, larger-capacity planes similar to those that fly through the sky today.

John Logan's script cuts across this man's life from the 1920s to the 1940s, the most productive time of his life. After a brief prologue that shows the origin of his hypochondria, we are thrown into the middle of recording Anjos do Inferno. The overproduction took two years to be made and cost 4 million dollars, an absurdity for the time. Mainly because it was completely independent. There were excesses, of course, like using 26 cameras to film an aerial sequence, or waiting months to re-record it, because I needed clouds in the sky. But, seeking perfection was also part of the madness of the character, developed by Leonardo DiCaprio. Not by chance, many point out as being the role that deserved to have given him his first Oscar. DiCaprio gives Howard Hughes a perfect tone, extremely careful in the small details, mainly in his hypochondriacally crises. The scene in a bathroom, for example, where he washes his hands with his own soap, uses a clean towel and waits for someone to open the door so he can leave without touching the doorknob is amazing.

Howard Hughes is troubled, contradictory. It is strange to see someone who dares to pilot a machine with uncertain functioning, at 400 km/h, and, at the same time, be afraid/afraid to open a door by touching the handle because of bacteria (germ phobia). Paranoid. That little word sums up Hughes. Or rather, paranoid genius. At the same time that he imagines models of planes super advanced in time, his paranoia about cleanliness consumes him. Scorsese makes an interesting shot during the film: while Hughes is making out with a woman, and caressing her body, the scene changes completely to the construction area of the new silver plane in which he runs his hand over the body, with the same pleasure that seems to feel when being with the woman. Passion. When you do something with passion, everything seems easy. Howard Hughes was a guy passionate about aviation, and he made sure to achieve success in his work. For this he was considered a man ahead of his time.

The only place Hughes seemed to feel safe was in the air. It was not by chance that he called himself ""The Aviator"". It was his biggest passion, even when he was at the height of his romance with Katharine Hepburn, that was their code, their refuge, the way she calmed him down after some crisis or problem. A kind of pact too, which at the same time brought them closer, ended up pushing them apart. An interesting contrast is when she takes him to lunch at the Hepburn family home. The characterization of her own eccentricity, the way he is out of place, the modification of her posture, the truncated conversations, all create an instigating caricature that shows a little of what she had warned him about when he started to be famous. ""We are strange people; we can't let them reveal our intimacy or we scare the public."" And that was one of the missions of the agents closest to Howard Hughes, to keep his eccentricities and troubles behind four walls to preserve his image and his business.

Known for being extremely perfectionist, director Martin Scorsese takes care that the film shows the details of ""The Aviator's life. Even though it is quite long, with almost three hours, the film is engaging and does not become tiring, after all there is a lot of history to be told. Throughout his life, Howard Hughes directed and produced feature films, created and piloted planes, fought with one of the largest aviation companies at the time (which monopolized international flights), among other accomplishments, all of this in the midst of his personal crises. Despite not showing more emphasis on his crazy side, the parts that appear already do the trick. John Logan's script is skillful in dealing with different periods of Hughes' life without sounding episodic and in humanizing him, the ambitious spirit and all the character's vitality are essential to the work. For before being an obsessive, Hughes was a visionary.

The technical aspects of ""The Aviator"" are also dazzling: a perfect recreation of the period, which revives the golden period of Hollywood, with a careful art direction, an impressive costume design and a studied photography. The special effects are a case in point, providing scenes that leave anyone with their jaws dropping (the plane crash sequence remains vivid in the viewer's memory even after the end of the session).

The film is not only centered on DiCaprio and Scorsese, there are many supporting actors in it (even if most of them are wasted), such as the beautiful Kate Beckinsale, who plays Ava Gardner and the talented Cate Blanchett, as Katharine Hepburn. Both are Hughes' romantic partners. Some have very small stakes such as Jude Law (Errol Flynn), Gwen Stefani (vocalist of No Doubt, as Jean Harlow) and Alec Baldwin (Juan Trippe, owner of Pan Am airline). There's also Hughes' right-hand man, the devoted Noah Dietrich, played by John C. Reilly. DiCaprio carries the film based on his talent (not that this is a negative point, but stars like these could have been better used).

Many say """"The Aviator"""" is Martin Scorsese's masterpiece. In the biopic of tycoon Howard Hughes, the American director - and the adjective is fundamental - portrays in a poignant and violent way the atrocious loneliness that befalls dreamers, men on the margins, different, who dare and who take risks in the utopian quest for unattainable greatness. Through film, women and aviation, Hughes sets out on the hunt for both perfection and acceptance and security (but on his own terms) within a society that, while it needs him to move forward, fears him. For the aggressive and innovative posture, he presents: a tragic character, as he is aware of the impossibility of adapting to the world around him, Scorsese's anti-hero is condemned to live in the isolation of his obsessive and paranoid mind.

However, instead of dwelling on the protagonist's psychological density, as in Taxi Driver or Raging Bull, the filmmaker privileges the surface, radicalizing the narrative fresco already seen in Gangs of New York, in which the accumulation of events involving the young tycoon serves to express an amalgamation of ideas about a romantic, visionary and enterprising America, which ends up being digested, on the way to the future, by monopolistic commercial practices, by the corrupt state leadership and by the supremacy of large corporations. Scorsese bets, in ""The Aviator"", on the omnipresence of Howard Hughes, so that there is no shot in which Leonardo Di Caprio (extraordinary) does not appear. In the non-linear narrative of the film (albeit temporally ordered), the filmmaker abandons the much-celebrated psychological deepening of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, which contains the rancidity of the simplistic relationship between cause and effect, to adopt the free juxtaposition, on the surface, of the multiplicity of themes - which do not stem from one another, but which intertwine and interpenetrate one another -, which provide the dramatic construction of the anti-hero.

As a consequence of the mounted fresco, in which independent parts join together to form the complete panel, Martin Scorsese annuls the distinction between figure and background, between character and context: Hughes is America, or at least the USA of free enterprise, free competition, speed, immoderate outbursts, youth, conquest adventures, innovation and pioneering spirit. With the birth, in the post-Second World War, of the corporate nation, the moment arrives for the independent producer who challenges the Hollywood studio system, for the passionate person who designs his own aircraft, to withdraw from the battlefield, without first facing the circus set up by Brewster, on the congressional committee, to impeach him (anticipating the witch hunt of McCarthyism), or to get the Hercules, the biggest plane on the planet, to take off, shutting the mouths of critics, despite all the illnesses that already afflict.

The film does not end in the great decline of its protagonist's career, but thirty years before the death of this unique character. The spectator, however, knows nothing of this, but what matters is not knowing, but feeling. Martin Scorsese doesn't need to end his work by narrating destiny. The audience senses where the years will go.

""The Aviator"" lifts Scorsese back into the spotlight with a deep psychological work around the legendary Howard Hughes and everything that bypassed his life. Join the beautiful composition of the story with good effects, an inspired Scorsese, a luxury never seen before in his work and a rhythm so unusual for Hollywood that the lack of climax becomes a defect to be overcome with time.",8
8 January 2005,"Bloated, devoid of human interest.","As demonstrated by the tedious ""The Gangs of New York"", Scorcese seems to be a spent force. Overwhelmed by large set pieces, we are left indifferent to Hughes' struggles. Scenes are left to play indulgently long, and, as well as endless captions telling us how much time has gone by, and where the scenes are taking place, characters are endlessly coming on and introducing themselves, and their relationships: ""Yes, Howard, I am Ava Gardner, and if you want to know if I slept with Arty Shaw, and whether I am interested in Frank Sinatra - the answer is Yes"" is a paraphrase of one of the more clunking bits of dialogue. Cate Blanchett merely mimics Katherine Hepburn's speech patterns and shouts a lot, while Jude Law wears a moustache, and keeps his eyes wide open, in an attempt to impersonate Clark Gable.

Hughes crashing an aircraft is an excuse for Scorcese to indulge his taste for making sure that any damage to a human body is as explicit and unpleasant to look at as ever.

Otherwise much effort has gone into recreating lavish evocations of period, and, interestingly, the overall effect is as unengaging as ""The Cotton Club"" was for Coppola. In the end if you don't have human interest in a script then you have nothing. Aviator is an expensive lesson for Scorcese, for Miramax, and, ultimately, for the audience that this remains a universal truth.",3
22 October 2019,Very interesting and historical character!,"DiCaprio and Blanchett are suburb in this biopic by Director Martin Scorsese. From the airplane crashes that he survives to his Senate testimony that led to the political demise of the senator who called for special hearings against Howard Hughes, this film delivers.

20 January 2005,The Aviator Soars,"The Aviator is a great film that does two things. Gives Leonardo DeCaprio his best performance since What's Eating Gilbert Grape and becomes Martin Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas.

DeCaprio puts on a fine performance as Howard Hughes and is well deserved of any awards he may get for this film. He molds himself into this role to the point where you forget that your watching Luke from Growing Pains on the big screen. He plays Hughes with a sentimental touch that we feel bad for any unfortunate events that happens to him. Hughes was an over achiever sometimes cocky in the way he had done things. But it was his cockiness that got him where he was. And his money. The film shows the mental problems that Hughes had to deal with including his OCD and his longing for someone to love and take care of him.

Scorsese does a great job putting this film together. He tells a great story filled with emotion and suspense while adding some comedic tones that fit right in. The film is almost 3 hours but you never notice the time go by.

I give this film **** out of ****",10
13 July 2016,Overstuffed Biopic Has Moments,"Can the outsized ambition of one of Hollywood's biggest legends smash Hollywood convention and make a picture for the ages? How about two legends, then? Star Leonardo DiCaprio and director Martin Scorsese give it a ride, anyway.

Howard Hughes inherited a lot of money and a fear of germs. Enjoying the first before the second tears him apart, he sets about making a movie that runs up seven-figure bills in 1927, then scraps it and remakes it for sound. ""Hell's Angels"" turns out quite a hit, but Hughes has already moved on to other passions, building experimental planes and bedding Hollywood starlets. Sure it sounds like fun, but can he survive the crash landings?

One of his lovers, Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), puts it this way: ""There's too much Howard Hughes in Howard Hughes. That's the trouble.""

That's the trouble with ""The Aviator,"" too. Taking a 20-year wedge of Hughes' life that incorporated everything from round-the-world flights to building a transcontinental airline, the movie struggles for a focus. In a five-minute span, we see Hughes design a monoplane, take Jean Harlow to a film premiere, and found a future mega-business, Hughes Aircraft. Scorsese is in a hurry to dazzle you with overlit sequences and fuzzy CGI.

DiCaprio's ascension to the ranks of Hollywood's elite seems to have been the true focus of this film. He's fine, too, shedding his youthful image with an eerie approximation of Hughes' Texas drawl that is equal parts authority and anxiety. I just felt there were times when too much of the director's attention was on having Leo do an acting clinic and show the Oscar people something. He's best here working off other people, namely Alan Alda as a nasty senator named Brewster set on bringing Hughes down.

Alda was nominated for an Oscar; Blanchett won one, either her first or Hepburn's fifth. It's a clenched, tinny performance, i. e. true to life and hard to take for more than a few minutes at a time. Fortunately, Kate/Cate makes an early exit, albeit not soon enough for me. What was the point of her character, anyway? If she's supposed to represent Hughes' truest object of desire, she doesn't have the air-speed velocity.

The film does improve as it goes on, reversing the Hughes experience in life. The climax is a hearing held by Brewster in which both Alda and DiCaprio show how good this film might have been had it cut out the starlets and the flying montages and just gotten to the part where Hughes takes on the country and Pan-American Airways while his growing mental issues gnaw away at him. Watching Brewster switch from wolf to sheep as Hughes finds his footing is a joy.

Even in this section, though, Scorsese spends long minutes on DiCaprio raging and writhing alone in the nude in order to let us know he's really suffering, not trusting his actor to show us the same thing in numerous small moments where the story is being advanced as well.

The film is never boring, just muddled and straining at a significance it doesn't reach. Like one of Hughes' most famous creations, the giant airplane nicknamed the ""Spruce Goose"" which ""The Aviator"" climaxes with, what you have here is an overloaded creation that struggles to get in the air, and doesn't stay up long.",5
9 January 2005,A very long movie with disappointingly shallow depth.,"After seeing The Aviator, I disagree with the majority of people, who seem to adore the film. Its director, Martin Scorsese, is no doubt one of the greatest filmmakers of our time, but he has stumbled again with this film (following Gangs of New York).

The film's begins by showing one puzzling scene of Howard Hughes' as a child being bathed by his mother and then it jumps to a scene showing Hughes as a young man directing a movie, Hell's Angels. This 'jumping' from scene to scene with little or no explanation happens quite often in The Aviator and I think it may have been necessary to keep the running time below 10-hours. Aside from Leo and Cate Blanchet, many other characters in the movie are introduced with subtitles or never introduced to the audience at all. It seems Scorsese thought anyone besides Hughes and Hepburn are not worth the director's efforts. The movie SEEMS to contain many interesting subplots: Hughes' interest in Hollywood movie-making, relationships with Katherine Hepburn, Eva Gardner, etc., his quest to build the fastest planes, battling PAN AM and corrupted politicians, building a corporate empire (dream), and fighting the inner demons, which eventually destroy's his life. However, none of the plots are explained with any interest and the story skims only the plots' surface with no effort to grab the attention of the audience (at least not mine).

If an audience is not familiar with the life and times of Howard Hughes, Katherine Hepburn, Eva Gardner, and the evolution of commercial airlines in the U.S., then it is almost impossible to see any depth in this movie.

Sure, the set designs and acting of Leo and Blanchet are above-par in the film, but most others aspects of this film are in such a mess! It seems as if Martin Scorsese (and the writer) assumed every audience coming to theaters to watch The Aviator would already be fascinated by Howard Hughes' eccentric life. The story in the movie has no beginning or and no ending! It starts abruptly and ends abruptly.

Although the film spends nearly three hours concentrated solely on Howard Hughes' success and his inner demons of life, I walked out of the theater with a feeling that I've just watched an expensively designed movie with no real content. It really is a shame to spend that much money to make a movie that long only to miss the mark completely. Howard Hughes' life story must be very interesting to have drawn so much money and top talents, but then why is The Aviator so flat and boring? Well, it's simply a not well-made movie.

I miss the RAGING BULL, GOOD FELLAS, CASINO, CAPE FEAR... and I wish Mr. Scorsese would go back to making highly entertaining movies with DeNiro. THE AVIATOR (and GANGS OF NEW YORK) is a sub-par quality by the director's great standard.",3
22 August 2006,A Fun Movie,"Martin Scorsese keeps it relatively light with ""The Aviator."" There's none of the foul language or gratuitous violence that characterized his most famous work, ""Goodfellas."" He has crafted a very interesting character study of famous entrepreneur Howard Hughes, mogul of aerospace and maker of B-movies. You see plenty his involvement in both enterprises in this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio seems a little too boyish to play Hughes when he is in his forties, but he clearly is so passionate about his role that you forget the little minutiae such as age difference. He plays Hughes with so much energy that he makes the role all his own. It's pretty clear DiCaprio is having fun with this role. Those who dislike hammy acting may think of DiCaprio as over-the-top, but I liked it. His portrayal of Hughes' various neuroses and compulsions make this a very fun movie to watch, akin to Johnny Depp's portrayal of the equally odd and neurotic Ed Wood.

The other actors do a fine performance. Cate Blanchett is fun to watch as the upper-crust actress Katherine Hepburn. She seems to be having as much with her role as DiCaprio, and she's not afraid to ham it up as well. Kate Beckinsdale is fine as Ava Gardner, and John C. Reilly does a serviceable job as Hughes' long-suffering accountant.

Scorsese does a competent job trying to portray his version of Howard Hughes' life. He tries to cram down the message of an eccentric man with huge visions that no one else can comprehend. He seems mad when he tries to re-do and innovate his movies or his aircraft. Sometimes his compulsive behavior gets in the way of his dreams, but in the end he deftly fights off the skepticism of his collaborators or the threats from the competition, in the form of Pan Am founder Juan Trippe. He, like Tim Burton's Ed Wood, is an oddball who perseveres and usually gets his way in the end. Burton's is the better movie, however, because it does not have the gloss of triumphalism that Scorsese's movie does. Scorsese tries to portray Hughes as a sympathetic and ambitious individual, and while he may have plenty of ambition, he is not exactly a more sympathetic individual than, say, his airline rival Juan Trippe. Viewers can see through the attempted good-guy image that Scorsese gives Hughes to see the battle between the airlines as one of survival of the fittest.

This movie is pretty fun to watch overall. One should see it laid back on a sofa with a bag of microwave popcorn and a can of soda. Just sit back and enjoy the energetic performances. It's not high art, but it is decent cinema.",7
5 September 2020,Could Have Been Much Better,"I had high expectations for this movie but it didn't stand by the expectations. Neither the movie nor the direction was upto the mark. Half way through the movie, I was bored and wanted the climax to come ASAP. It was irrigating when it ended with DiCaprio saying the same sentence again and again. Main problem was it's pace and the screenplay was also little bit weak. There is some good acting which was saving point for the movie. The only good scene in the movie is when the Howard Hughes character has to defend himself. Overall, this movie could have been much better.

18 February 2005,Hell's Angel,"Hell's Angel

The Aviator Dir- Martin Scorsese Cast- Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin Written by- John Logan Rating- ****

Howard Hughes was in many ways similar to Charles Foster Kane, the enigmatic and imposing central character of Orson Welles's legendary masterpiece 'Citizen Kane'. The fact that Kane was modelled on media-mogul William Randolph Hearst is not relevant to this review. Like Kane, Howard inherited a large sum of money and found himself at a very young age, equally the richest and the loneliest man in the world. Both were visionaries who always dreamt big. Hughes even had a fascination for large breasts! Both set out after pursuits that seemed stupid and reckless to everybody but themselves. And they both always succeeded. Both amassed large fortunes and attracted media attention. And sadly, both of them didn't know when to stop! While Kane ended up as a lonely millionaire, Hughes suffered from a more terrifying descent into madness.

In Martin Scorsese's 'The Aviator', we are not made privy to Howard Hughes's disturbing later life. In that sense it is a rather shallow biopic. But when viewed as a movie, it is as complete as complete can get. 'The Aviator' doesn't try to delve into the life of it's lead character but rather concentrates on one chapter in his life, a ploy employed by the recent 'Finding Neverland'. But unlike 'Finding Neverland', 'The Aviator' doesn't take cinematic liberty and tamper with the facts. John Logan's screenplay introduces us to a young Howard Hughes(Leonardo DiCaprio) working on his ambitious 'Hell's Angels' which took over three years and three million dollars to make. A rank outsider, he is ridiculed by the reigning tycoons for using twenty-six cameras to perfect a shot. Hughes completes the film, then reworks it with sound, before eventually releasing it to universal acclaim. Hughes goes on a roller-coaster of popularity, popping flash bulbs, acquisition deals with TWA and talked about high-profile romances with famous leading ladies. The most significant of his dalliances is with Katharine Hepburn(Cate Blanchett). Not only do we sense a real admiration and possible love between the two, but this interlude is also the most enjoyable portion of the movie. Hughes's visit to Hepburn's family estate in Connecticut establishes as the best scene overall. The Hepburn-Hughes relationship doesn't work probably because they were too similar to each other, both equally headstrong individuals.

Concomitantly, obsessive compulsive disorder(OCD) begins to cast its shadow on Hughes. We witness this rich man rendered helpless in a public washroom as he awaits someone to enter so that he can leave without having to touch the doorknob which he fears is not germ-free! His bouts worsen as he begins to repeat words uncontrollably and quarantines himself in a room where he walks around naked, mumbling, and pisses into empty milk bottles. But Hughes manages to curb his eccentricities and restores himself for a congressional hearing which will determine the future of his aviation company(his mammoth plane Hercules especially) against Juan Trippe(Alec Baldwin) and his Pan-Am airways. Hughes fights it out with the wily Senator Brewster(Alan Alda) and defeats him in a battle of wits. Hughes successfully flies his Hercules, but we see his OCD still looming upon him. Scorsese and Logan refuse to take us any further. We don't get to see Hughes succumbing to his madness and dying in a hotel room, at the age of 71, with his hair grown and nails unclipped!

Leonardo DiCaprio is not an obvious choice to play Howard Hughes, but he essays his part brilliantly. His struggle to hide his imperfections and keep them in check is very convincing. Cate Blanchett's performance as Hepburn is one that you can't describe in words. She is simply put- amazing, and truly deserving of an Oscar. Another person deserving the statuette is Robert Richardson. His cinematography elevates the movie from a simple biopic to an intriguing character study.

Puritans might argue that by removing the darker facet of Hughes's life, Scorsese has tried to sanitize a fallen figure. Rather, Scorsese doesn't make any excuses for the way Howard is. Scorsese never apologized for his characters, be it 'Raging Bull' or 'Taxi Driver'. The denouement of this movie somewhat lends it a haunting feel. As Trippe says of Hughes in the movie, ""People should remember him as he was"". And Hughes was ultimately a visionary, a creator and an aviator!



Note- 'The Aviator' is nominated in 11 categories at this year's Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor(Leonardo DiCaprio), Best Actor in a Supporting Role(Alan Alda) and Best Actress in a Supporting Role(Cate Blanchett).

Rating- ****

* Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent

18th February, 2005",8
11 January 2005,Good but overall disappointing,"I went to see this film with a fair amount of trepidation following Scorsese last effort, the truly awful Gangs of New York.

However 'The Aviator' is certainly a cut above this. Contrary to what others have said though it is no where near the quality of Raging Bull or Casino et al.

DiCaprio's performance is excellent. His energetic depiction of the brilliant and often reckless Hughes is highly engaging. But it is perhaps in his portrayal of Hughes's hidden battle with mental illness that he most excels in this role.

Cate Blanchets performance as Hepburn whilst very likable seems to be somewhat over-acted, but nonetheless is very effective.

Notable mentions must go to Alan Alda as the corrupt Senator Brewster. This is by far his best screen work to date. Also Alec Baldwin turns in another noteworthy performance following 'the Cooler'.

Kate Beckinsdales role seems almost unnecessary within this film. I not really sure what she was trying to do with her role. I not sure a poorly acted Marilyn Monroe is what Scorsese was looking for in Ava Gardner.

The story itself is quite an interesting journey to start with. Ultimately though this is a film that never quite gets anywhere. Not that there is anything wrong with how it all ends, it just seemed anti-climactic.",7
5 January 2005,Could have been better Casting,"One very important factor in doing a biopic on Howard Hughes is the casting of the lead. As I watched this film, I wanted to buy Leo as Hughes, but it felt like Tom Cruise playing Hughes. Leo is definitely a pretty boy, and this is certainly the biggest role of his career. But I felt that perhaps someone else could have played him better. Someone else who could perhaps give you a glimpse inside the madness. Russell Crowe, although not a match physically, had that kind of insight in ""A Beautiful Mind"". Alongside that, as much as Cate Blanchett was serviceable as Kate Hepburn, I could easily imagine Emma Thompson personifying Hepburn much better.

I have no other major complaints about a film that took eons to make the big screen. It is certainly to the audience's advantage that a film about Howard Hughes be given the big budget treatment. The test flight scenes, as well as the ""Hell's Angel's"" unprecedented aerial scenes are appropriately depicted with top-notch CGI. Perhaps, along with ""Gangs of New York"", having DeCaprio attached was the along way it could get made. For Scorcese, this is his best film in years. He is able to delve deeper into a character than your average Hollywood filmmaker. Scorcese does an excellent job depicting Hughes' descent into madness. The extra length of this film dedicates a good deal of time to this sad aspect. You have sympathy as Hughes fights the takeover of TWA, and the upbeat ending is welcome.

The production design is perfect, no corners were cut. Camera angles and pacing are engaging. The make-up on DeCaprio is excellent. The use of period film quality is unique, and creates an outstanding sense of 'living history'. This film deserves Oscar nominations for almost every category, except the acting. Once again, there's nothing wrong with DeCaprio & Blanchett, but they are not perfect.

I will probably see this film again, only because I can identify with the seemingly overwhelming odds against you when trying to achieve a personal accomplishment. I also identify with being a misfit, but yet being valued by society.

I give it a 7 out of 10.",7
24 March 2007,Scorsese and Dicaprio shine through Howard Huge's tragedy,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",9
25 January 2005,A new Scorsese classic,"Martin Scorsese's ""heroes"" usually aren't heroes at all; rather they end up being only one of the unbalanced characters through whom we see the entire film. Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Last Temptation, Goodfellas, Casino, Bringing out the Dead and Gangs of New York--who would want to really be any of these guys? Even Jesus has issues.

In the Aviator, Scorsese has made a slicker, more Hollywood friendly film, and it will likely be rewarded with Oscars for his more accessible approach. But the themes still remain: a troubled misfit attempts to shape the world to meet his wants, but the world is not his opponent--once again, it is his demons.

There will be people who criticize this film because it's not as ""Scorseseque"" as most of his work, but come on, guys, not much has changed really. The editing and special effects might diminish the grittiness that permeates most of this great director's work, but Martin Scorsese is at his peak as a storyteller here; the film is three hours long but I didn't even know it until I looked at a clock after exiting the theatre. It feels like it plays in half that time--the movie is a very entertaining masterpiece about one of the most influential and complicated industrialists in American history; the man Howard Hughes was a true visionary, and dare I say in the world of aviation... apparently an artist. But like so many artists, this one is troubled, and DiCaprio plays him very, very well.

I still liked Gangs of New York better, but this is a great movie and if it nabs Scorsese the key Oscars he has never called his own (Best Picture, Best Director) then he can finally fulfill that tiny blank space on his resume. If not, who cares? Scorsese doesn't need an Oscar to prove he's the greatest of all American filmmakers.",10
31 December 2004,Scorsese's energetic biopic reminds audiences of the mystique of Hughes,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him..

11 December 2006,A bowl of oatmeal,"And I'll explain that - it is like every flake of Howard Hughes's life was tossed into a bowl and regurgitated haphazardly. For one, his OCD is shown in extremis through parts of the film (he lives naked, surrounded by tissues and bottles of his own urine) and yet he is able to drag himself together and appear coherently in front of a Senate hearing.

Yes, I would buy there were tiny signs of his disorder early in his life, but it was not full blown until the last decade.

I didn't like Leonardo in the part, he is too much of a one-note actor to handle the complexity, sexiness, power and drive of the Hughes character. DiCaprio is too slight in every way. Cate Blanchett, as Katharine Hepburn needed a more tenacious grip on her character, her accent and mannerisms were too inconsistent, but then again she was playing off the anorexic performance of DiCaprio.

The time-lines were completely out of whack, one example: Katharine leaving Howard for Spencer? No.

Ava Gardiner was seriously miscast as well, if anyone has caught her in one of her incredible film performances you will know what I mean, she is woefully ill-served here.

Some of these larger than life heroes need a story that will reflect their magnetism and the reality of their lives and with more care taken to the details that are often anachronistic and irritating in attempts such as these. (Example being the opening mommy hygiene scene which is used to back-story his OCD, please, we're not quite that gullible!!) A shame. Some of the bigger scenes are truly wonderful, the scene within the Cocoanut Grove being one of them, the busy backlots and the CGI scenes of the flights being a few more. Also the music was captivating. And marvellous cinematography. Howard was poorly served here. Perhaps the casting of a George Clooney type might have helped. We needed to see the power and complexity. 7 out of 10 for such a big attempt to diminish such a huge character.",7
10 September 2012,Overcooked and lacking in nourishment,"I admired this for its high production values but was disappointed that it is pitched more as an entertainment than as providing any insights into Howard Hughes the man. One test I have for film biographies is whether I get more understanding from the film than reading a Wikipedia article. This movie failed that test for me, since it did not give me any better understanding of Hughes than I had before seeing it. Hughes had an interesting career and personal life with many irons in the fire in both spheres. Maybe his life is too rich to be covered in a single movie that can go beyond hitting the high points of his work in movies, his aviation achievements, and more than a hint of his romances.

Leonard DiCaprio gives it his best, but I feel he did not capture the essence of the man. In any archival footage of Hughes that I have seen he evinces a charisma and intelligence that I did not get from DiCaprio's performance. I found Hughes was presented here as rather one-dimensional, always barking orders and instructing his assistant to mortgage everything to support his current passion. Hughes wound up as one of the wealthiest men in the United States, but I never got a feel from this movie as to how he amassed his fortune--he had to be more of a cunning businessman than what we are given here. As much as I like Cate Blanchett, I found her portrayal of Katharine Hepburn created more of a caricature than a character. She got close on the voice, but I have to believe that Hepburn was a more serious person than the flippant and shallow person created. Best for Scorsese that Hepburn never saw this movie as I am sure she would have ripped him to shreds. Alan Alda, as U.S. Senator Brewster, is the only actor whose performance engaged me. The battle of egos between Brewster and Hughes provided a spark, missing in most other scenes.

Hints of the obsessive compulsive disorder that was to ravage Hughes in later life are dropped along the way, like his wanting his peas served in a 4x4 matrix and being upset when someone disturbed the symmetry. I found it curious that nobody ever directly addressed this, either to Hughes or to friends, early on. I think that most people who saw a friend behaving this way would be concerned and bring it up as odd enough to be of concern long before the sickness reached a level where it could no longer be ignored.

There are some spectacular shots of planes of the era. The scene where Hughes crashed an XF-11 into a Los Angeles neighborhood is rendered in harrowing detail. The mock-up of the Spruce Goose (which in fact was made primarily of birch) was wonderfully realized.

I quickly tired of the exaggeration for effect, like Hughes burning all his clothes on the floor of his house and letting Hepburn fly his plane over Los Angeles at night when she had never flown before. The scenes in the nightclub were so amped up in order to create a sense of chaos and frenzy that they were unbelievable, capped off by a band leader who was ridiculously gesticulating like a mad man.

This is a passable entertainment, but disappointing, given the effort put into it and the fact that it comes from Scorsese.",5
29 December 2004,Not Scorcese's best film,"Not Martin Scorcese's best film. Almost cartoonish with over rich colors and overacting. However, the costumes and sets were wonderful. Short and baby faced Leonardo DeCaprio was grossly miscast and seemed to know it and consequently overplayed his part and his squeaky voice grated. Only during the Senate hearings in 1947 did he look like Howard Hughes. John C. Reilly always succeeds and was great as Noah Dietrich. Alec Baldwin was terrific as Juan Trippe, the head of Pan American Airlines, and Alan Alda was just fantastic as Maine Senator Ralph Brewster, the corrupt Republican (are there any other kind?) in the pocket of Juan Trippe and PanAm. Cate Blanchett could not have been better as Katharine Hepburn. Kate Beckinsale was okay as Ava Gardner but didn't have the cachet. The movie ended with Hughes' descent into madness in 1947-1949 and did not include any of the scenes of the Sands Hotel days when he had long fingernails and long hair. He owes his obsessive compulsive disorder to his mother, who ""washed"" his penis when he was an adolescent, which is the disturbing and totally unnecessary opening scene.

The best parts of the movie were (1) fantastic airplanes and old cars throughout, (2) Hughes' amazing survival of a spectacular crash of an experimental plane into palatial homes in Beverly Hills, (3) the takeoff and flight of the Spruce Goose, (4) the Senate hearings, (4) the night time flight over LA with Hughes romancing Hepburn, (5) dinner with Katharine Hepburn's family in New England, and (5) the crash landing of another experimental plane in a beet field. Worth it just for those scenes. The film was marred by about 30 to 40 minutes of boring scenes that seemingly would never end of Hughes going mad, urinating into milk bottles, compulsive hand washing, muttering to himself, etc.

Certainly not a film to see a second time, which is always the mark of a good film for me. A movie nearly 3 hours long can not drag and this film sure as hell dragged. With the exception of Alda, Baldwin, O'Reilly and Blanchett, most of the young actors and actresses had no idea who they were playing. The film failed to show the importance of Hughes's role in the aviation, oil and film industries.",5
18 September 2005,Crashed and burned.,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I had ever seen. Almost 3 hours long, and not even 20 minutes of it is worth watching.

There doesn't seem to be any attempt to make Howard Hughes even interesting. Nor any of the other characters as a matter of fact. Most of major ones goes by as ""who the heck are they?"" all throughout the movie. Not even the great talents of Alan Alda nor Alec Baldwin could have saved this movie.

Instead of showing the struggles, the loves, and the eccentricities of Howard Hughes, it just shows him as a pointless nut-ball. Nothing more than a historical footnote. And that he is portrayed just as apathetic, if not just as pathetic, as Alan Alda's character.

Weak characters, poor story line, impotent action. In fact the crash sequence mentioned by the MPAA uses more sophisticated special effects than what was used on Star Trek Generations or Nemesis, and whose budget was more than the 2 movies Star Trek movies combined. But in every way the Aviator's crash sequence was inferior to either one of those 2 crashes.

If this movie were to even be nominated for any awards, make it a Rasberry award for worst picture.",1
21 February 2005,Totally uninteresting film !!!!,"So where do i start ..hmm . film is really uninteresting i had watch the movie until end only cause my girlfriend push me to it..for her only reason why film is good cause Di Caprio is in it !! So i would agree with other users that was one big TORTURE !!And the end of the film also what happened with with Howard and when did he died ,or did he finished in hospital , the film was only about before-war years and war years and i don't know what to say anymore but for me this film was one big disappointment..

And yet, despite the obvious talent of all those involved and Scorsese's ability to effortlessly fill three hours, something about The Aviator fails to completely satisfy. Without wanting to sound like a film student, movies should, ultimately, be ABOUT something; love, honor, courage, redemption, the BIG ideas and themes that are the fuel of the plot. What was the drive of The Aviator? A rich guy recklessly spends lots of money to indulge his personal obsessions and gets away with it.That is all point of the movie and i don't know how can that be interesting for the viewers ... So here is my vote ..1 (awful) >>!!",1
30 January 2005,"""Wake Up Marty"" You're Sleeping On The Stick !","I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",1
29 June 2005,So So,"This movie had great potential. The acting was done well enough to convince me. I don't think they missed Howard Hughes' personality by much. What let me down was the reliance on ""Special effects"" to carry so much of the films load. I was under-whelmed by the special effects. On a 27 inch TV screen, they will probably be very convincing, but on the big screen, they were a distraction rather than an enhancement. Like so many modern movies, I think they cut short on story line and put too much focus (no pun intended) on special effects. Katherine Hepburn was easily as irritating as the real Katherine Hepburn, but there was too much of Howard's love life and not enough of his technical achievements. Unless I missed it, there was no mention of him designing what has become the modern hospital bed during his ordeal in the hospital. He was definitely a disturbed individual, but he was also an inventive genius. A more vigorous presentation of the battle between genius and disturbed mind, would have made the film more interesting for me.

30 June 2005,not enough entertaining,"Set in the Hollywood Golden Era, this is an excellent and lavish biopic on Howard Hughes, one of 20th century most charismatic and influential figures. Nevertheless, despite its being an energetic and evocative job of recreating atmospheres of the 30's and 40's, I find it's quite disappointing on the whole. The 2 hours and 46 minutes runtime is very, very long, too long. So, though interesting for being a tale about a successful businessman who climb higher, higher and higher (Howard Hughes is somehow a forerunner of many nowadays tycoons), I figure ""The Aviator"" is neither that interesting nor able to catch the audience attention for all the entire time. Besides, Scorsese doesn't manage to get into the lead's head, unveiling men's dark side, like he did in taxi Driver for instance.

12 February 2020,A Trip Into Madness,"I saw this movie maybe a year or so after it came out, but I don't think I really appreciated it as much back then. I just watched it again from one of the movie channels and I'm really blown away at how good it really was.

I know some here have mentioned Leonardo's portrayal of Howard Hughes OCD as being extremely good. I found it to be almost too god because as Howard Hughes slipped further into madness it became more and more uncomfortable to watch because it seemed to ring true. Without a doubt he captured the Howard Hughes we've seen from public clips, but also the Howard Hughes as reported by others. What a great study.

28 May 2005,"Scorsese continues to shine, Still not best director","Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin,Ian Holm, Alan Alda,Danny Huston, Gwen Stefani, Jude Law, Matt Ross, Adam Scott, Kelli Garner, Frances Conroy, Willem Dafoe. Directed by Martin Scorsese.

Scorsese continues to shine. Still not best director.

Sadly Marty didn't make the cut for best director instead Million Dollar Baby won. But in my opinion well it's a close call because Eastwood and Scorsese are two brilliant directors. Aside from the dexterous dialogue which was brilliantly written by John Logan and the crash sequences that featured the star Howard Hughes (DiCaprio) the movie is still fantastic. With the set design, costume and the special effects it just makes a good movie and when you put Martin Scorsese in charge of the movie you better believe it's going to be good.

DiCaprio plays the mad man Howard Hughes who was the leader of Aviation in the 1930's-40's. But the best part is how charmingly insane ha was. How he worked non-stop on his planes. My final rating 8/10. Close but so far Scorsese, maybe next year.",9
26 April 2016,admirable sketch,"to present the life of Howard Hughes is one of ambitions who could define only the career of a great director. because it must have the most inspired form of screen. and, behind the secrets and speculations, to present the flavor, atmosphere, pillars and drawings of events - parts of an ambiguous existence seems be the best option. Scorsese use a perfect cast, use an inspired script, impose fragments as surrogate of entire story and recreates a world of glamor, vulnerabilities and power. result - not exactly a biography of Howard Hughes but an excellent sketch of his period. for Leonardo DiCaprio, the lead role represents a great challenge and he does an admirable job looking define Hughes in different aspects. but the best part is represented by Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale , each proposing seductive interpretations of legends of Hollywood. a film who surprised. and remains interesting for the art of detail.

2 September 2005,I get mad when people touch my peas toodisturbingly mad.,"In my opinion, out of the nominated films for best picture, The Aviator is the movie that should have won, along with Scorsese as director. The story of Howard Hughes is a fascinating one; on one hand, a forward-thinker and genius of aviation (among many, many other things) and on the other, a man crippled by obsessive-compulsive disorder. Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as the lead and the movie (focusing more on Hughes' younger years) is an amazing, enjoyable watch from start to finish. Nice work with the CGI too. The commentary is decent, as are the other DVD extras. If you want to learn more about Hughes, the History Channel documentary on disc two is the thing to watch.

4 September 2006,Hits you in the gut,"This film takes the most well-known weirdo in pre-Michael Jackson American history and exposes him as the great hero he actually was. Without turning it into a sickening flag-waving idol portrait... but by making you FEEL it in the gut instead. What a cinematic accomplishment.

Leonardo DiCaprio finally escapes the 'hunk yard', and comes out as the fine actor he actually is. Which surprised me the most, until my wife reminded me of ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" True, he is talented far beyond the typecasting he sunk into on top of Titanic's stern, and we can only hope that this will be his springboard into some serious character stuff.

Everybody else has rightly praised Cate Blanchett, and all I can do is agree... and Alec Baldwin... and Alan Alda... but most of all, this is Scorsese at his very best.

FINAL GRADE: Stop wasting time reading this review, go out and buy the DVD instead.",10

5 July 2005,"Howard Hughes, flawed genius.","Superb movie! It deals with Hughes' early adult years, from his 20s through his mid 40s, when he left Houston and invaded Hollywood and Washington, forcing lasting advances in movie-making and flight, and calling the bluff of devious politicians. By any measure Howard Hughes was a genius, always thinking ahead, bigger, better, higher. Nothing was impossible, as long as you had enough money and enough people working for you. He never hesitated to risk going broke when he believed in a project. Suffering from mental disorders now known as ""obssessive/compulsive"" , as it got worse Hughes spent much of his old age as a recluse. But his ideas and those of scientists he hired have changed aviation, space exploration, electronics, communications, and even movie-making. The 2-set DVD has a number of interesting ""extras"" which show how wide Hughes' impact was.

Leonardo DiCaprio is Howard Hughes, and delivers an award-quality performance. Always dependable Cate Blanchett is equally good as Katharine Hepburn, very closely capturing the unique cadence and sound of her voice. Other stars include beautiful Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, head of rival Pan Am Airlines. Alan Alda as the shady Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow and Jude Law as Errol Flynn.

The opening scene shows a young boy of about 10 or 11 standing nude in a tub of water, his mother bathing him while she says and spells ""quarantine"", while warning young Howard about the dangers of various diseases. This we assume was the seed planted by his mother which, germinating and growing in his adult mind, was responsible for Hughes' mental illness. When both dad and mom were dead while Howard was barely in his 20s, he took the Hughes Tool (oil drilling bits) fortune to Hollywood and satisfied both of his interests, making ""Hells Angels"" about fliers in WW I.

The movie does not try to cover all of Hughes' life, but touches on significant events of a 20-something year period. Desiging and flying a plane that broke speed records. A record flight around the world. Near-death crashes. Failed military contracts, including the Spruce Goose. Romancing the stars. His growing phobias. A landmark film.",
17 January 2005,The Aviator - Fiction as history,"What amazes me most about the film is how historically inaccurate it is. The purported Hepburn/Hughes relationship is the worst. This is what really happened.

Howard Hughes and Kate Hepburn met originally in late summer 1935 while she was making Sylvia Scarlett. She didn't care for him and was also involved with her agent, Leland Hayward. KH didn't see Hughes again for over a year.So the scene of him picking her up on the Sylvia Scarlett location to go golfing is incorrect.

In November, 1936, Hepburn broke up with Hayward. Hughes, as he frequently did when pursuing a woman, renewed his effort to get to know Hepburn knowing that she was on the rebound from a failed relationship. This time he succeeded and they began an affair in January, 1937 while she was on tour in a play.

After the play ended in May, 1937 she moved into Howard's house in Los Angeles. Hepburn and Hughes lived in his house for one year, from May 1937 to June 1938. By then her career had taken a dive and she lost her contract with RKO. She decided to go back east to do a play. She moved out of Hughes' house.

In her autobiography, Me, Stories of My Life, she said that the romance really ended at the time of the September 1938 hurricane which destroyed her family's summer home at Fenwick, Connecticut. She wrote: ""The next day God sent the hurricane of 1938. The house at Fenwick disappeared. Howard had a pilot fly in with water - - and I knew that Howard and I had become friends and not lovers. Love had turned to water. Pure water. But water."" As can be seen, their affair lasted a little less than two years, from January 1937 to September 1938. The film has the relationship lasting from 1935 to 1941 which is completely incorrect.

Three years after she broke up with Hughes, Kate met Spencer Tracy. This was in August, 1941. Tracy and Hepburn commenced a relationship that lasted 26 years until his death in 1967. Kate beginning a relationship with Tracy had nothing to do with her break up with Hughes which had happened three years prior. Since the two events were totally unrelated, there would have been no scene where Hughes was upset about Hepburn telling him that she and Tracy were involved and no break up with Hughes because she had met Tracy.

Hughes never bribed a tabloid editor to keep 'compromising' pictures of Tracy and Hepburn out of the tabloids. To begin with there were no tabloids to speak of in the 1940s. That was a phenomenon of the 1950s. Second, there were never any compromising photos of T&H. Third, if there had been compromising photos of them, their studio, MGM, would have dealt with the issue. They never needed Hughes for that purpose. MGM had a hell of a lot more clout with the press than Hughes would ever have had. In fact, every mention of Tracy in the film is completely fiction. There's no reason to have him in the film at all since he had nothing to do with Howard Hughes or the Hepburn/Hughes relationship.

The film has a scene where KH goes to a film premiere with Hughes. The date isn't clear but I guess it's 1939? Ava Gardner shows up at the premiere as well even though she wasn't in Hollywood. As has been previously noted, KH and Hughes broke up in 1938. It's ludicrous to show a scene with KH at a premiere with Hughes in 1939. She wasn't seeing Hughes at all much less going to social events with him. The other point, of course, is that Hepburn never went to premieres, not even the premieres of her own films nor to nightclubs. She was also known for not wearing dresses. The idea that she was prancing off to nightclubs and movie premieres in dresses is just plain silly.

Howard Hughes did not lock himself in a screening room for several days (or weeks) during the time frame that The Aviator covers. That episode occurred in 1957. And, of course, in any event Hepburn would have not been trying to coax Hughes out of the screening room since she wasn't involved with him in either 1947 or 1957. This scene is completely fictional.

Hepburn's father was a distinguished urologist and surgeon who was the head of the urology department at Hartford Hospital. Hepburn's mother was a well known advocate of women's rights including the right to vote in the 1910s and 20s and later the right of women to use birth control. They were not independently wealthy. Dr. Hepburn worked for his money. They didn't live in a palatial mansion. They were not snobs and they certainly didn't look down on Hughes. KH said in her autobiography that ""my family was not too sympathetic to Howard. In the first place, he was everlastingly on the telephone. And the telephone was in the dining room. Long telephone conversations did not suit the atmosphere. . . ."" While, it's true they didn't get along with him it wasn't because they thought he was beneath them. So this whole scene is false as well as being incredibly insulting to the Hepburn family.

There are many other errors but the 1000 word limit keeps me from describing them all.

It's quite obvious that the film makers decided to portray Hepburn in the film because she's still well remembered. She, in fact, was only briefly involved with Hughes and he was involved with many, many women. If the film makers wanted to be accurate they would have included Billie Dove and Jean Peters but then, no one remembers them so they invented a grand passion between Hughes and Hepburn which simply never happened.",
11 June 2019,A must-see moviegoing experience!,"For all the virtues of the film ... the second crash sequence is just *unreal*.

I'm sorry, you have to see this in a theater (of sorts), or turn the lights down low, or something ... but sheesh! Talk about the brakes being *off!*

Nature, in all its cruelty -- in the form of Gravity, in all is indifference -- is rendered, here. Not ""shown,"" mind you, but ... ""catapulting"" you?

You're like, ""No, no ... no no no ... no he's not going *down*--""

Yes. Yes he is.

And the houses, and the tearing ... *relentless!*

More violent, in its own way, than any Scorsese movie, including ""Goodfellas.""

You'll stay up night, but not be disgusted. The kids'll always remember it, and never fail to wear their seat belts, just on general principles!

Bravo!

(And, oh yeah: To the extent that -- not unlike the Maestro itself -- you eat up all the old-school Hollywood stuff, if you're the type who can't hear enough Humphrey Bogart or Billy Wilder stories, the scene-after-scene review in ""My Lunches With Orson"" only whetted your appetite (""But Henry, you're interrupting the story ... ""), you'll love this! Or, at least *dig* it, Daddy-O.)",7
1 August 2005,Episodic bio-pic never really adds up,"Over 2000 years ago Aristotle observed that a selection of true incidents from someone's life doesn't necessarily add up to an effective story. THE AVIATOR proves Aristotle's point.

Here's a movie that takes a lot of really interesting people and makes them -- not very interesting. The weakness is mainly the superficial script, which covers Hughes the aviation pioneer (much of this is quite exciting), Hughes the Hollywood producer (this is sketchy and disjointed), Hughes the womanizer (sketchy and uninvolving), and Hughes the obsessive-compulsive eccentric -- but never quite succeeds in pulling all these elements into a persuasive whole.

At the end of this very, very long film, I didn't really *feel* anything about Hughes, either positive or negative. He seems as cold and remote at the end as at the beginning and the last hour drags.

What Scorcese needed was a screenplay that would make us care about Hughes -- either love him or hate him -- the way CITIZEN KANE does. But THE AVIATOR is no KANE. It tries to cover too much, and you never really know why some things were included and others omitted; the result is the incidents covered seem shallow, obvious, and quickly glossed-over.

Still, there are a number of excellent scenes in the film. My favorite is Hughes' visit to Katherine Hepburn's family, where her relations -- as headstrong and self-involved as she is -- treat him with hilarious rudeness.

I should confess I have a problem with DiCaprio: I have trouble accepting him as a grown-up. He always seems to me like a 14 year-old boy playing an adult in a junior High School play. He's a pretty good actor; he applies himself and he's quite talented. I don't know why that boyish thing bothers me, just as it did in TITANIC, where Kate Winslett seemed more like his aunt than his lover.

Even Scorcese's period mise en scene fails to persuade. The sets and costumes are all so colorful, so squeaky-clean, they seem made for a musical comedy rather than a serious period drama. And Scorcese makes too many obvious choices, such as the movie Hughes watches that convinces him the public now wants sound films. Of course it's THE JAZZ SINGER.

As in NEW YORK, NEW YORK, there's a ton of painstaking period detail, but it doesn't ring true. You don't feel you're really in the 1930s and 40s, any more than you believe Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow. Cate Blanchett tries a little too hard as Katherine Hepburn, though it's basically an intelligent and effective performance. Her strenuous efforts to imitate Hepburn's well-known vocal mannerisms are distracting at times.

So I can see why THE AVIATOR lit no fires either at the box office or at the Oscars. A huge amount of work and money went into a film that is frequently interesting, but finally not all that compelling.",5
14 February 2005,"Performances and Flight Sequences soar in the Aviator, but it's a tedious ride","I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",7
24 November 2014,No Favor to Hughes,"Say what you want about the old studio biopics that often turn up on cable channels. They were too often schmaltzy, shameless, and as historically accurate as a politician's memory. But at least they knew how to tell a story and make it interesting. On the other hand, The Aviator replaces story line with jumbled imagery, dialogue with rapid-fire editing, and a heavy-weight subject with a light-weight actor who gets serious by scowling and stamping his foot as any 12-year old might. Surely Hughes deserves better, I know the audience does. The moral is that no amount of fiddling with period detail or special effects can make up for a chaotic core. Shame on you, Martin Scorsese for lending your good name to this cinematic mess.

2 January 2013,A Candy-Coated Treat,"A movie extravaganza of style that is bigger than life, like the infamous Howard Hughes. His life was so brimming in every aspect that it would be virtually impossible to be complete or even comprehensive when undertaking such a vibrant and eccentric man.

This film is more of a candy-coated treat. A slight insight and palatable piece of cinema that is always a bit overdone and somewhat fancy. It has the look and feel of a carnival ride that is fast, thrilling, and over the top. There is nothing here that is profound or insightful and it barely tries to be so.

It is entertainment. The ""real"" HH is left for the Documentaries and the Biographies. This is a movie about movie making, empire building, and creative charisma, about the life and times of one of the most flamboyant flakes that ever captured headlines and trophy girlfriends.

It is as fun as it could be with the subtle touches on the troubling psychosis and the constant financial shenanigans. The move could be called a ""Hollywood Bio"" because that is exactly what it is. Nothing new, or revelatory, just a glossy Movie Magazine look at one of the Twentieth Century's most enigmatic pioneers.",10
9 July 2016,Fantastic study of an incredible life,"The life of Howard Hughes: film director and producer, aircraft designer and airline owner. A pioneer in all these fields he was a man who had a massive influence on aeronautical advancement, the airline industry and the aviation industry in general plus gave the world some movies which helped the progression of that art form (in particular, Hell's Angels, Scarface and The Outlaw). Not content with being a highly successful and wealthy businessman, leading aircraft designer and movie mogul he even test flew his own aircraft! His private life was equally epic, having long-term relationships with Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner and dating almost every female star in Hollywood at some stage. But he wasn't without his faults, eccentricities and demons, and these are explored here too.

A fantastic study of an incredible life. Master-director Martin Scorsese turns a linear biopic into an incredibly engaging, enthralling and illuminating journey. Despite being over 160 minutes long the time flies by, such is the pace, energy and interest of the movie. Hughes was a larger-than-life character and incredibly influential person on history and Scorsese shows him the respect he deserves.

Not that he paints him as a saint though. He is portrayed as reckless at times and, as mentioned, his personal issues are also covered, and they are covered well. We see how his eccentricities and disorders - germaphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder plus potentially other mental issues - have a large bearing on his life and work. We also see how he manages to go on despite these. Very sensitively and appropriately covered by Scorsese.

Superb performance by Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role. The movie got him his second Oscar nomination, and first for a leading role, and he was unlucky to lose out, having to compete with a brilliant performance by Jamie Foxx in Ray.

Cate Blanchett is superb as Katharine Hepburn and well deserved her Best Supporting Actress Oscar (her first Oscar and her second nomination). Alan Alda got a Best Supporting Actor nomination for playing Senator Brewster.

The remainder of the cast is star-studded too: John C Reilly, Kate Beckinsale (as Ava Gardner), Alec Baldwin, Jude Law (as Errol Flynn), Ian Holm, Danny Huston. Even the minor parts include Gwen Stefani (as Jean Harlow) and Willem Defoe and the musical numbers include Loudon Wainwright, Rufus Wainwright and Martha Wainwright!

A masterpiece.",10

22 January 2005,Little more than riveting eye candy....but the ride is enjoyable,"Martin Scorcese delves into the mastery, ego, and madness of oil, tool, cinema, and aviation magnate Howard Hughes and comes away once again (without as much blood spattering and violence) with an unspectacular but pretty period piece, best described as riveting eye candy. ""The Aviator"" is every bit as visually stunning and devoid of substance as ""Gangs of New York"". The cast, however, tries really hard to capture the mood of the era and the persistent force that Howard Hughes became to a generation that just preceded and endured the Second World War.

I am no fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, but I must give him credit for trying hard to capture a personality in this film. He looks way too young to be Hughes (though his age at filming was similar to the age of the character he portrays) but he gives his all in his attempt (and it's a great try) to encapsulate the hardheaded ego of Hughes, a man who refused failure and closeness simultaneously during his troubled lifetime. Cate Blanchett (who should still be publicly flogged for filming ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"") perhaps does the best long-form impersonation of a famous public figure in the history of film, and I mean that sincerely. We will never know the full vim (and vinegar) of Katherine Hepburn's private life because we could never see it. We have seen her characterizations on film, however. Cate captures, in her performance, a stunning replica of Hepburn's on-screen persona in what could have been the real role of Hepburn's life had she been able do it ( that is, to portray herself in an autobiographical role).

The rest of the cast are dressed up for and act as period 1930s and 1940s personalities of the day. Even Alan Alda, who is not always much more than Hawkeye Pierce in any role he has ever done, is pretty convincing as the conniving Maine Senator Brewster.

I thought the Dicaprio scenes of madness were a bit overdone (we got the point early in the film) but the cinematography and general feel of the picture were fine other than that.

This is no Scorcese classic. However, the dude knows how to cash in on ""nice"" films. I am sure his more than ample retirement fund will be supplemented by the box office for this number.

If you want to laugh, cry (well not really), and kiss 10 bucks goodbye on a feel-good piece of post-art-deco-and-slightly-more-than-pap theater, then by all means, go see this. If ""The Aviator"" wins Best Picture, just realize that this has been very unspectacular year in cinema (unless of course you actually think anything by Michael Moore could be loosely considered cinema, then, of course, you need a red room just like Mr. Hughes).

For those of you who think all I do is hack bad films, you have been disappointed. Well not completely...

Here is the oddest sequence in this film. Leonard DiCaprio, a 31-year-old actor, looking younger than a 25-year-old Howard Hughes would have looked at the opening of his 1930 film ""Hell's Angels"" is arm-in-arm with 35-year-old (I have read she is actually 40) pseudo-teen-slut songstress Gwen Stefani attempting to portray a 19-YEAR-OLD Jean Harlow.

In 50 years, there will be a film on the life of Gwen Stefani called ""Tragic Kingdom"". In it, she will be found in a sealed room covered with red padded walls and rolling on the floor while listening to ""I'm Just a Girl"" or ""Spiderwebs"". The pounding of her fists on the floor will be peppered with her mumbling ""Take a chance you stupid ho!; Take a chance you stupid ho!"" The basic story of the movie will be how a troubled teen woman makes it from 16 to menopause without ever having lived a second of her life as a mature adult.

Note to Hollywood...don't take that chance, not even with another actress' ""million-dollar contract"". A 40-year-old playing a 19-year-old? 19-year-olds (other than Janis Joplin) never have facial lines. Come on now; you've got to be kidding me.",5
8 September 2021,Beautiful + Sad + Thrilling,"I'm going to be incredibly blunt here with two things displaying some ignorance: I knew little to nothing about Howard Hughes before I watched this film. I'm also very late to the game with watching it in general. Last night, on a whim of a rabbit hole of watching films nominated for best picture, it was time to finally watch The Aviator.

From the first few minutes of the film, I noticed that I was actually smiling at the screen and excited. The things Hughes was asking and demanding of his workers was all but ludicrous but he was asking anyway. His character drew me in almost immediately, as did every single supporting actor / actress.

I don't like to offer spoilers to my reviews if I can help it, with this one I'll say it's easy not to. If you enjoy Scorsese films, have a few hours on your hands, and are ready for an adventure on your couch - choose this movie. You won't regret it. Brilliant. 10/10.

27 December 2004,Portrait of a Mad Genius,"THE AVIATOR (2004) ***1/2 Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Ian Holm, Danny Huston, Gwen Stefani, Jude Law, Adam Scott, Matt Ross, Kelli Garner, Frances Conroy, Brent Spiner, Willem Dafoe, Edward Herrmann.

Portrait of a Mad Genius

Martin Scorsese is perhaps the only filmmaker who could've done justice in tackling the Herculean effort of presenting a biography of the notorious Howard Hughes a bonafide by product of the American Dream and his quest for excellence as well as greed paying the ultimate price in the end: never fulfilling the emptiness in his life.

The millionaire is depicted in his brash youth as the inheritor to his father's fortune and up through the stormy aftermath of a congressional investigation in the mid-40s to his supposed 'war profiteering' through his various excursions into literal flights of fancy. Leonardo Di Caprio, Hollywood's Golden Boy, is the perfect choice here and does an excellent job in showing how a focused young man became a laser-eyed optimist even if it meant the brink of bankruptcy.

Among his sexual conquests were a bevy of Hollywood starlets including Katharine Hepburn (smartly played by Blanchett eschewing the possibilities of rank caricature) who he courted for some time and previously with the starlet Jean Harlow (a vague Stefani making her screen debut) and subsequently with Ava Gardner (Beckinsale providing enough grit and heart equally) who was not for sale as she makes abundantly clear.

His attempts at film-making were as brash as his business dealings with his first film ""Hell's Angels"" which took up to nearly three years at approx. a million per and his run in with PanAm honcho Juan Trippe (a subdued yet oily Baldwin) as he attempted to start his fledgling company TWA for international jet setting and commercial aviation as well as the aforementioned witch hunt led by Senator Brewester (a truly conniving weasely Alda).

Clearly Hughes was a visionary and a master of his own foresight as well as a cantankerous perfectionist with his share of setbacks including an incredibly scarily realized maiden test flight with a plane that crashed in Beverly Hills nearly killing him. On top of that came his slow deterioration into mental illness, which the film touches base with in getting an inkling of the tragedy to come. Scorsese deftly depicts this in short bursts with DiCaprio repeating himself ad nauseum while conversing and so germ phobic at one point he has to wait in a men's room until the door is opened from the other side.

The film excels in its sleek, retro production design by Dante Ferretti, gorgeous cinematography by Robert Richardson and snappy score by Howard Shore keeps the pacing of Scorsese's editing collaborator vet Thelma Schoonmaker at a decent pace in its nearly three hour run; my only gripe is it would've been best if they finished what they started in by showing the last chapter of his extraordinary man.

Scorsese is a truly gifted artist and expresses obsession like no one since Hitchcock and to show how one man's mania for flying high  literally and metaphorically  may in fact land him his first Oscar. It's long overdue.",9

1 June 2005,"Love the colors, Marty!","I suspect I am one of about 17 people who figured out that Martin Scorsese and cinematographer Robert Richardson were attempting to mimic the palette of two-strip Technicolor during the first half of this film. Big deal. After the ugly visionary debacle of Gangs of New York, our 'greatest living film director' seems to have been reduced to spending 100 million dollars to score points with the film geeks. The Aviator is digital eye candy; stunningly shot, beautifully costumed, lavishly decorated, intricately edited, and nutritionally valueless. The Motion Picture Academy got it dead right: awards for all the technical categories, and a complete shut out for everything else. The Best Supporting Actress award for Cate Blanchette is the exception that proves this rule: her performance as Katherine Hepburn is an over-the-top technical marvel quite lacking in any dramatic substance whatsoever.

It is incomprehensible to me that a film about one of our most fascinating American legends could be this dull. As many posters to this site have pointed out, The Aviator is factually dubious; nevertheless, couldn't Scorsese and screenwriter John Logan at least have used lies that are fun? Why not adapt Charles Highham's scandalously lurid biography? That would have been a film to see, a film about an amoral colossus, at once so public and so secretive, whose enormous appetites, implacable will, and resolute daring propelled him to the peak of power and influence. Then, of course, we could witness the inevitable fall, when those same qualities turn against their bearer, leaving him shriveled, quivering, and helpless in a Mexican hotel room.

Instead we get Arnie Grape with money, some airplanes, and a nice suit. DiCaprio's performance is not bad; in fact, it is often rather good - it is just the wrong performance in the wrong film. He never once convinces as Howard Hughes, although, later in the film, DiCaprio sometimes looks uncannily like a young Orson Welles, circa The Stranger.

I doubt the resemblance is coincidental. Because, in truth, this film is not about Howard Hughes at all. It is about Welles, and Von Stroheim, and Coppola, and, yes, Martin Scorsese - Hollywood outsider visionaries who took on the establishment suits and who, in turn, were destroyed by them, because they threatened the establishment's power and prestige. It is the same story that Coppola told in his infinitely better film Tucker, The Man and His Dream. It is a consoling story for a man like Scorsese, who hasn't made an indispensable film in close to 25 years, but one that has an air of desperation about it, as if Scorsese realizes that, in his case, it just won't do. After all, no one was giving Welles or Von Stroheim $50-100 million dollar budgets during their fall from grace.

Look Marty, everyone knows that no one, including DePalma, can set up and shoot an intricate, lengthy, single-take tracking shot like you can. Everyone knows that your encyclopedic knowledge of film history makes Quentin Tarantino look like a wheezing punk. Everyone knows that you can get remarkable once-in-a-lifetime performances from your actors. You have nothing left to prove on these scores. So cut the sh*t. Stop wasting money on all this bloated, empty crap. For God's sake, Welles, in F for Fake, which cost peanuts, showed more insight into Howard Hughes in ten minutes than The Aviator showed in three hours. Start emulating those Italian Neo Realists whom you understand so astutely. Take a few million out of the bank, grab a couple of digital cameras, head downtown, and make something vital. I, and a lot of other people, think you still have it in you. Your strengths are intimate, not epic. Take a chance. Go for it. Be a real Hollywood outsider. Wave of the future, Marty. Wave of the future. Wave of the future...",3
29 October 2006,Hollow but visually impressive portrait of America's favourite loon!,"The early life of billionaire flier and racist (not tackled for box office reasons!) oddball Howard Hughes.

There are some people whose name comes with a built in full stop. A moment to pause while you think of all those things they did, achieved or represented. Howard Hughes is one such case, but you cannot rank him up with the great visionaries or the great eccentrics like Einstein, Van Gough or Michael Angelo - these people mixed talent with their madness. As director Martin Scorsese is forced to admit (after the entertaining crash-bang has ended) - most of the things that HH came up with didn't work or couldn't work.

(Jane Russell never wore the bra he designed for her over-sized breasts - a point that the film skirts around.)

Hughes took the money of his (far more brilliant) father and while entertaining with it - didn't spend too much time at school learning the basic rules of flying or film making (you try sitting through anything other than Hells Angels). However with money you can buy your own trophies and good PR- and Hughes had very deep pockets.

Martin Scorsese revisits some of his greatest hits and greatest flops in this movie. The long drawn out entrance to a night-club from Goodfellas and the souped-up camp of New York, New York: When you to any night-club in a film you can be sure that every extra will look like a professional dancer and the main players will smoke/drink (although Hughes didn't) and exchange loaded barbs. Amazing how witty the whole world is in films!

Leo DiCaprio has an unfortunate face. He is destined to look 15 until late middle age and you can't do a thing about it. Stick all the fluff you want on his face and then add a bottle of hair grease and he still looks like he has stepped out of Buggsy Malone. He is not a bad actor (and getting better) but no one can claim he was cast for anything other than box office. Worse Martin Scorsese uses lighting to try and bring gravitas to his unconvincing appearance. He is just miscast and that is the end of it.

Katherine Hepburn (here played by Cate Blanchett: Deserved as Oscar? I'm not sure!) had no taste in men. She liked to be the superior partner is her relationships so she chose oddballs, broke artists and addicts. Maybe these were the few men she didn't scare away. Hughes had money and toys and while it is presented here as some central relationship (Hughes treated all women as if they could be bought, sold or exchanged) it was nothing of the sort. Spencer Tracy was one of Americas greatest actors but also a chronic and incurable alcoholic. In him she found her ideal match!

Madness is hard to capture on film. It is often not a level dip. It can come and go, get worse, get better, even be effected by the weather. No one has a clue if it is was two planes crashes (there might have been more) or some disease that took HH out of circulation. Clifford Irving thought Hughes was too mad to dispute his fake autobiography (not featured here) but he pulled himself together. Even from his self-made lunatic asylum bed!

It is good to see that Scoresese is back on something like form after a string of so-so efforts. Despite the money he is given to spend on props the quality of actor isn't around to pull this kind of thing off. Too many dough boys with plastic teeth and empty eyes. Without these bricks nobody - and I mean nobody - can make an engrossing classic film. All you can come up with is pretty backdrops and sweeping scores and hope nobody notices the lack of major talent in the speaking parts.",7

Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",6
29 December 2004,needs more balance but still excellent,"I remember a lot of the press about the very eccentric Howard Hughes and also read a biography on him after he died.

the film I think somewhat overemphasized his obsessive compulsive disorder and could have done more about his accomplishments. he was for example a pioneer in pushing for fuselage flush rivets which added immensely to airspeed for any plane.

all the actors and actresses handled their roles very well Cate Blanchett although she does not resemble Hepburn in appearance she nailed down the unique voice right to a T. Kate Beckinsale who is proving to be very busy is even more beautiful than the original Ava Gardner.

Decaprio is excellent as the movie mogul aviation real estate billionaire. no doubt he has indispensable insight into Hollywood intrigue.

the film is about 3 hours and ends rather abruptly. then again, it only shows Hughes until just after the 1947 hearings. I am curious as to whether the filmmakers used transcripts from those hearings. I wouldn't be surprised; a lot of people underestimated Howard Hughes.

20th century aviation owes a great deal to the adventurous spirit of Howard Hughes. perhaps we would have had even more rapid advance had he not been periodically put out of commission by ocd (feel free to do a google search on the topic). it was unfortunate for Mr Hughes that he was born too soon to take advantage of a spectrum of serotonin uptake inhibitors that would certainly greatly alleviated his suffering. I know what I'm talking about, I've had the condition since 1973 but it is nowhere remotely as bad as it used to be. I therefore truly sympathize with Howard Hughes; it is only fair that he made billions of dollars considering what he did for civil aviation and a plethora of other engineering fields.

see the movie for insight into his life.

I find it ironic that a man who had a great deal to do with the advancement of airplane designed passed away in one while it was in flight to the hospital in his home state of Texas.",9
2 February 2005,A Beautifully Crafted Film!,"I won't deny it. I'm a huge Martin Scorsese fan and have rarely been disappointed with any choices the director has made. The Aviator met my high expectations and in many ways surpassed them. One could not ask for a more gorgeous filmed movie. Every scene is so lush in detail and color, and did I mention detail! If one ever wants to see a true biopic on old Hollywood or even a museum of knowledge about 30's and 40's pop culture, this is it. Besides the eye and sound candy is the acting caliber. The Aviator has one of the best casts this year led by Leonardo Dicaprio and Cate Blanchett. They both give wonderfully rich and absorbing performances and should make the Academy's job extra hard at crunch time. Highly recommended.

7 February 2005,Good if you're not hung up on accuracy,"I enjoyed this movie, though as a fan/scholar of classic films and pop culture history, I thought it missed the mark a lot. A few observations:

Though he looks nothing like Hughes, I thought DeCaprio did a fine job. He was especially startling when portraying the older Hughes.

I thought Cate Blanchett captured Katharine Hepburn pretty well. Maybe three times I heard an ever-so-slight trace of Australian accent (actually, it sounded rather southern U.S.!) that marred the New England aspect. I was kind of bothered by the portrayal of her family; I don't think they were rich and snobbish; just liberal and eccentric.

No one ever looked like Ava Gardner, nor could hope to, but I thought Beckinsale did a fair job of evoking her personality.

The costumes were stupendous, but the chronology of the music was all outta whack. The choices and the authenticity of the reproductions were great, and yet we were hearing early 1930s recordings (and renderings of music in that style--e.g., ""Happy Feet"") when it was already the mid-thirties. The mid/late thirties were skimmed with a Benny Goodman tune, and the 1940s suddenly seemed to explode on the scene without transition. Then in 1947 we hear Glenn Miller's ""Moonlight Serenade,"" a hit from many years before that was no longer in style by 1947. Nitpicky, you say? Mebbe, but would it have been that difficult to get it right?

I didn't know that much about Hughes, but I was aware that he didn't go into the reclusive/not-emerging-from-his-room mode until the 1950s.

But, hey--what biopic ever got it right? This was an entertaining movie. Well-made in many ways. Long. As Lina Lamont would say (chirpily) ""I liked it!""",7
19 June 2020,Rise and fall,"'The Aviator' was one of the first collaborations between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo Dicaprio. A film that bears the imprint of the director in print and could be one of the least valued in his career, despite its high stylistic quality. The story tells the life of the well-known Howard Hughes and how he went from being a recognized magnate to a self-contained man, added to his obsessive compulsive disorder that increased year after year. Finally, the film is about a man who was at the top and had everything, but who for different reasons lost it. This theme is highly recurring in Martin Scorsese's filmography, and although this film is unusual for the director, its style is fully incorporated. However, this very identifying style of the filmmaker undergoes some changes, such as greater attention to the use of colors. Visual changes mostly, because the narrative follows the same line as other Scorsese movies. There is not much more to say besides that this film is yet another proof of Scorsese's masterful ability to tell a story of power and subsequent fall, but more important than that, it shows his ability to innovate in the way of telling stories.",9
6 February 2005,Okay but overrated,"The Aviator is an okay movie. I'd probably have enjoyed it a lot more if it hadn't been surrounded by so much Oscar buzz and hype, though.

Let's start with the positives. The acting is fabulous. Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett both turn out excellent performances. It's movies like this one that serve to remind us that, despite Titanic, DiCaprio really can act.

Viewed as a biography of Howard Hughes, this is an excellent movie. Viewed in terms of its storyline, it's a bit uneven at times. Still, I found The Aviator to be enjoyable and interesting.

Worth seeing, yes. Worth buying on DVD? Probably not. 5/10.

13 May 2008,High flying bird,"Modern epic cinema of the highest order and proof that there's life in the old dog yet as Scorcese fashions a spectacular drama around the ""living years"" of celebrated billionaire, inventor, recluse and all-round megalomaniac, Howard Hughes. In fact perhaps the only nondescript thing about the whole enterprise is the rather dull title, otherwise there's much to feast on here. Scorcese has shown himself at home with the milieu of America in the 30's and 40's (I'm thinking particularly of his in my opinion unjustly overlooked masterpiece, ""New York New York""), but here the drama is embellished by edge-of-your-seat special effects, especially the aerial ballet of the filming of ""Hell's Angels"" to the judderingly realistic plane crash when Hughes personally takes up one of his prototype aircraft. At the heart of the whole is Leonardo De Caprio delivering a superb turn as the by turns electric then desolate Hughes driven on but eventually driven down by his inner demons. This is a performance of great maturity, as the Hughes character moves from the years 1926 - 1946 during which time he assumes the roles of gung-ho film director, billionaire playboy, maverick inventor, spendthrift magnate to his eventual succumbing to the madness of his obsessive behaviour disorder, manifested most of all in his obsession for cleanliness. The remainder of the ensemble is mostly fine, with Kate Beckinsale alluring and headstrong as Ava Gardener, Alex Baldwin formidable as Hughes' nemesis at Pan-Am, Juan Tryppe and Alan Alda (long time no see) just right as Tryppe's man-at-Congress, Senator Brewster who attempts to bring down Hughes at a post-war Senate hearing but gets bitten himself as Hughes turns the tables on him. Less satisfactory is Cate Blanchett in another of her true-life impersonations, not quite looking or sounding enough like Kate Hepburn to convince, difficult task as that is. Perhaps the film lionises Hughes a little too much as at times he was clearly an unsavoury, selfish and cruel person, which his illnesses can never fully excuse - consider the point, for example, too lightly made, that three stunt men died during the making of ""Hell's Angels"", his WW1 flying epic or that his two ""triumphs"", which bookend the film, the eventual release of ""Hell's Angels"" after years in production and Hughes' successful piloting of the massive ""Spruce Goose"" / ""Hercules"" sea-plane on her test-flight, were Pyrrhic victories at best (""Hell's Angels"", for all its box-office success, failed to recoup its huge production costs and the Hercules never made it into commercial production) and symptomatic of Hughes' delusions of grandeur. A man with his money and flair could have left far more lasting legacies than these and I don't think Scorcese makes that point (or even wished to), which is no doubt why we don't get to witness Hughes complete submission to his illness in his old age. Nevertheless this is a bravura piece of Hollywood mythologising with the veteran director expertly marshaling his massive resources in creating a wonderful movie that sweeps you into a whole other world and the not-quite ""beautiful mind"" of a gifted but tragically flawed individual.",9
9 January 2005,Interesting but limited,"I enjoyed this movie. And it didn't feel like a three hour film. It moves along quickly, helped by good acting by everyone involved. DiCaprio was particularly good as Howard Hughes. He even aged well.

My wife didn't like it as much as I did and I suspect that's because this is a dick-flick (a movie for men!). The movie is at its best when it describes the technical breakthroughs that Hughes pioneered. Even the numerous romances were handled in a fairly brisk. manly fashion.

This movie is not a Hughes biography. It covers a small part of his life (the flying bit) and, even then, only part of that (up until 1947). This gives the movie an incomplete feel and leaves you wondering what happened next.

But, all in all, it's a good film. Entertaining and well acted. Just don't expect to learn much about Mr Hughes.",7
22 September 2018,Great inspiration,"This movie got a place in my toplist,it is one of the great inspiration movie I ever watched.martin scorcese always make a movie with too perfection, its also same as for this movie .Leonardo did his role amazing. Movie tells how the business man should trying to change the future of the world. A good business can not work only for money ,he works to achieve a great success in his life by providing best future for people who believes him.

9 January 2005,The second worst film I've ever seen.....,"I really wanted to be able to name one redeeming feature about this film. I've thought about it long and hard and I finally realized there was one. It ended!!! Don't go to this film it's long and brush, I actually heard people snoring in the theater. Though Leo did play a very convincing part, the rest of the film really had absolutely no redeeming qualities. No matter how interested you are in Howard Hughes don't I repeat Do Not waste your money or the 3 hours of your life you'll never get back watching this movie. For those interested the film I thought to be even worse than this was monkey-bone. Horrible, Horrible.

21 June 2005,The Aviator: Fact or Fiction ?,"""The Aviator"" has all the great elements of a great film yet its still a typical Hollywood movie. There is a great scene when Katherine Hepburn tells Hughes: ""we are not like others, are we Howard?...don't let them(publicity) in because they will make you into a freak"". I think Scorsese did exactly that, he doesn't let you into the real life of Howard Hughes. He feeds you what you have heard or read in tabloids over so many years and there is nothing new you will discover in this film.

I don't know why but Aviator didn't feel like Scorsese's film? it looks and feels more like Spielberg or Ron Howard film?. Then again Scorsese's last few films are a far cry from his ""Raging Bull"" days and this is where I was kind of disappointed because Scorsese use to push the envelope and didn't conform so much to the Hollywoood formula. This film with all its great photography and cast yet it remains an empty film and not the work of a great film maker like Martin Scorsese.

Aviator got a lot of great reviews and nominated for many Oscars and I admit I did enjoy watching it for its masterful film craft but at the same I think there was so much more about the elusive life of the great Howard Hughes that some how this film refused to even make a hint of it. For example its true that Hughes was a great womanizer but its also true that he also liked to sleep with Men; he lived bisexual life for many years, he had many affairs with stars like ""Cary Grant"" and ""Guy Maddison"", and even ""Gary Cooper"", etc,this is all documented in Darwin Porter's book ""Howard Hugues: Hell's Angel"". This is why again I find the similarities of Spielberg/Ron Howard childish eye candy style of film making, whom both made their own version of books like ""Color Purple"" and ""Beautiful Mind"" and decided to omit that dirty little secret.

I just think if you are going to make a film about someone's life why not be more honest; sure Hughes was depicted as being as arrogant with a huge ego but in this day and age to make a film and depict someone so one dimensional which adheres to all myths and tabloids its just playing it too safe for someone like Martin Scorsese. Oliver Stone's film of ""Alexandra"" may have not gotten such great reviews maybe because he debunked how history had depicted Alexandra, but yet he stated the truth written in History about the Greek way of life at that time and Alexandra's relationships with both men and woman; his sexuality didn't make him less of a man and the same would apply to Hughes. However, Stone refused to compromise his integrity as a film maker and I am really sorry to see Scorsese has in the Aviator, and please don't think I am saying because I some some GAY advocate, because I am not, the truth about Howard Hughes has been well known for years in Hollywood.

I was impressed with De Caprio's performance mostly in the second half of the film; but I still felt he was too young for this role. If you see any photos of Hughes even in his twenties he looked very mature and even older; he was big man, brisk in stature, 6""4 in height and well built. I once saw a TV mini series called ""The Great Howard Hughes"" played by Tommy Lee Jones and I must say to this day I have yet to see anyone match that performance; because Tommy Lee Jones comes from Texas and even looked like Hughes and he really nailed it, De Caprio doesn't even come close to how Hughes looks or to that performance of Tommy Lee Jones, but for today's young audience they wouldn't even know the difference; De Caprio is picked because he is liked and well known by a wide audience regardless he fit this part or not.

Overall this is a good and entertaining film about a fictional version of Howard Hughes but one really has to question how much is fact and how much is fiction?. Perhaps the court hearing are the high point of the whole film, one has to admire and respect Hughes for his integrity fighting for his beliefs and love of Aviation, I hope one day Mr Scorsese does the same when it comes to making films the way he use to.",
2 January 2005,1and 1/2 stars at best,"I was more or less sure that I would'not like this movie and alas I did not!! None of the characters were believable. The casting was about as bad as you could get. When a movie goes out and gets all of the available stars--one should know, it's probably not a very good film!! While maybe the Howard Hughes story is worth while telling, this attempt was way off the mark. So assuming it could have been, not only a passable movie, but maybe even an award winning piece of work. One would have to start totally over--DIRECTOR-WRITER-AND FOR SURE THE CAST!!!!! If this movie wins any serious award, I'll be surprised and even more so wonder did they see the same thing I saw.

5 January 2019,"How to achieve the American Dream at all costs, even when you are a mental patient. Howard Hughes showed us how to do it.","This direction by Martin Scorsese is epic in vistas. Glorious soundtrack by Howard Shore. Great supporting role by Cate Blanchett. Really impressive epic psychological portrait of billionaire Howard Hughes who is tormented by mental disorders and struggles to stay sane.

It's 1945, and 2 aviation companies fight each other for control of the American skies. One aviation company is a new comer and headed by Leonardo di Caprio. Will he succeed in becoming a succes? Or will the powers that be cripple Leonardo di Caprio's attempt of becoming the biggest aviation company in history?

This is a story about how to achieve the American Dream at all costs. True story by the way, based on billionaire Howard Hughes. Just google that name, quite extra oridinary story. What makes this epic story unique is the portrayal of all the psychological fears that plague Leonardo di Caprio while he is trying to achieve succes as a newcomer in the aviaton business.

In his role as a CEO of a huge aviation company, Leonardo di Caprio has got OCD (Obsessive Compulsion Disorder), a mental disorder in which fears are entirely controlled by obsessive repeated thought and behaviour patterns. To put it more simply, the man has got excruciating fears of being touched or touching anything which he fears isnt clean. These obsessive fears cripple di Caprio while he is simultaneously trying to achieve to become the biggest aviation company of the world. I usually dont care much for di Caprio's acting talents, but this acting performance of the mental downfall of Howard Hughes is pretty impressive!",8
31 January 2005,"Spectacular Effects, Beautiful Sets, Fine Acting, Yet Lacks Heart","The Aviator,helmed by legendary Martin Scorsese, had so much going for it: spectacular visual effects, wonderful costuming and set design, and extraordinary acting from Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett. And you would think that a film that has all the elements OF a great film would also have something that The Aviator unfortunately lacks: heart.

The film opens with Howard Hughes as a child, his mother bathing him and telling him how dangerous the world is. It then cuts to Howard Hughes in his twenties, on the set of Hell's Angels where it is immediately apparent just how powerful this young playboy's drive is. He wants absolute perfection at his craft, which is making a realistic and believable film about war and combat, which he succeeds at. His peers do not take hi seriously, however, because of his age and his somewhat childish look on things. Howard Hughes begins the film young and powerful, an by the end, has aged and started to let his infatuation for cleanliness and germs to wither him away to just an obsessive compulsive loner who locks himself in his office for months at a time.

Leonardo DiCaprio has never been a more finer actor, taking his boyish features and completely transforming himself into Howard Hughes. Every gesture, the accent, his compulsiveness, it is amazing just how wonderful Leonardo has evolved from the pretty faced boy in Titanic to serious Hollywood actor in The Aviator. Not to mention, the chemistry he and Cate Blanchett had on screen jelled, bringing Hepburn's strong will and Hughes's dependence on that to function.

Cat Blanchett was, not to say the least, amazing at recreating a legendary Hollywood icon, playing the part of Kathrine Hepburn to a tee. It was quite apparent that a lot of research by Blanchett was done to perfect all of Hepburn's little mannerisms, and larger than life character. Blanchett is in much need of an Oscar for her portrayal in the film, for it is nothing short of amazing.

The sets and costumes were extraordinary, to watch The Aviator is a trip down memory lane for older generations and an eye opening educational venture for the younger generations. The Hollywood premieres that were recreated, the legendary actresses such as Ava Gardner, it gives a sense of longing for the golden years of Hollywood before everything became so commercialized. There are spectacular camera shots throughout the film such as the flight of the Spruce Goose, the filming of the air battles in Hell's Angels, and the spectacular plane crash in Beverly Hills. All these make for one adventurous film.

Yet, with all these elements going for it, The Aviator really lacks heart. Though the first half of the film, Howard Hughes is at the top of his game, and the audience is entertained, yet kept far away enough where they will not really care that Hughes is slowly letting his OCD take over his life. At a nearly three hour run time, by the end of the film when Hughes's has finally completed his decent into madness you may be fidgeting and squirming from boredom. Martin Scorsese put together the life of Howard Hughes, yet kept him emotionally far way enough from the audience that they are more an observer of Hughes than actually caring for him. And that was the biggest problem of the film. Great films have characters you deeply care for, and that is all that prevents The Aviator from being that: Greatness.

Come Oscar night, there is no doubt that The Aviator will walk away with some awards, that is a given. The Aviator is recommended for it's stunning recreation of old Hollywood, the pioneering of aviation, and the incredible acting by DiCaprio and Blanchett. Unfortunately, by the end, you may be fidgeting, waiting for the film to finally end.

Recommended.

31 March 2011,"This is the way of Scorsese, the way of Scorsese, the way of Scorsese, the way of Sc...","It doesn't have the look, the style, but when the movie is over, you realize this is a cinematic experience like only Marty could have provided: a huge and dazzlingly decadent celebration of the American Dream from the mature -but never cynical- perspective of a true patriot. This good American is no one else but Howard Hugues, a precocious pioneer who has everything: he's rich, he's an aviator and a real one -this is no Frank Abagnale- and he's handsome. And no one but Leonardo Di Caprio could have embodied these 'no contradictions', and made me so doubtful that such a story would inspire me I'm glad I was wrong 

The thing when you're a fan of Scorsese, you try to find a bit of Travis Bickle or ""Goodfellas"" in every film he made since, especially the latest ones  movies whose masterful confidence in the directing and flamboyant ambition in the story almost worked as obstacles for the Scorsesian touch. When I was watching the scene where Howard Hugues, the handsome playboy, makes Jean Harlow literally melt of desire, I totally forgot about the first scene, where he was spelling the word QUARANTINE with his mother (?), probably the origin of his obsession with cleanliness. I forgot about this scene and I thought, okay, here he comes, the handsome guy will get the pretty doll, pretty dull, isn't it? Leo would play Leo all through the film, whose only redeeming qualities would be the beautiful and convincing recreation of Hollywood's Golden Age, and the incredible characterization of Katharine Hepburn by Cate Blanchett. Thankfully, these fears didn't last, when I realized how truly Scorsesian was our lead character, and that the success story is less due to luck, or gift, than to a sublimated obsession.

Obsession, this is what drives Howard Hugues, not ambition, because in a way, ambition admits the possibility of failing. But the obsession of Howard is not to fail, it's to win, it's to build the best planes and to make the best movies. Don't call it perfectionism, this word is absent from his vocabulary, for nothing can be too perfect for him. It's simple; either Howard Hugues is the craziest character ever or the most inspiring. When the movie starts growing on you, you realize he's both, and that each of these sides of his personality drives the other. Scorsesian characters have this in common; they look straight-forward to escape from that thing behind, haunting them  The source of the psychological torment, always rooted in the spirit of the character, creates either noble or despicable motives, but in both cases, everything has a point, and everything has a reason. The question is: where will this lead? To the top, or to the fall  Let's just say, that ""Aviator"" is the story of a character whose Scorsesian condition leads to the top, literally 

The inspirational aspect of ""The Aviator"" is how it reconciles with the idea, almost a cliché, that whatever doesn't kill you makes you strongest  and that your very flaws or so-called weaknesses shall never be hidden or repressed because they might be the key of your personal accomplishment. Your difference is your strength. The film is about the transcending craziness into an gigantic ambition, so out of proportions, that only in America, it can work it's the idea that nothing is impossible. It's almost pretentious, as if Scorsese defended the idea that only tormented men made the world, but is he wrong? Let's face it, for goodness or badness, this world has been built by men with visions  and Howard Hugues had these visions, this extra sensibility that transformed his paranoia into a prophetic capability.

And these obsessions, tormenting the mind of Howard Hugues: cleanliness, perfection, repeating the same sentences, were not an invitation to label him as crazy. Calling him this way is missing the point, he's not crazy, he's simply alienated by his obsession of perfection, the idea behind Howard Hugues' story is that when we want to become something, that something finally becomes us. Clean, perfect, efficient, everything must obey to a total physical and spiritual harmony and it does drive you crazy  this is the maddening yang of the successful yin. For each construction, there is a destruction, a gargantuan plane flying has cost many others to crash, for every kiss with a star, Jean, Kate, Ava or Jane, there was a rib broken, or a burnt skin. If it wasn't for all the flash, and all the distracting Hollywood's portrayal, this would probably be the deepest and most philosophical Marty's film.

I reckon I felt immediate empathy to Howard Hugues as soon as I got the gravity of his obsession, because I could put myself in his shoes, and I liked him, even more because I hated him first, I was jealous, it's like I wanted him to get a comeuppance for a fault he didn't commit. But this strengthened my empathy even more, and the more he got hit, the more enthusiastic I was, when I could see him hit back. Because he illustrated the struggle of the mad but inspiring visionary facet of the American dream to overcome its most perverse aspect: thirst for monopoly and financial power. It's not TWA vs. Pan Am, its two American philosophies confronting each other in a Scorsesian arena.

It's almost a referential film, as if Scorsese uses this character as a therapy to justify how his own obsession with a certain idea of film-making, was the key for his personal salvation, and a blessing for Cinema  I felt like feeling the spirit of the 70's Marty  and even Leo kind of reminded me of Robert De Niro at one point, in a performance that blew me away  ""The Aviator"" is one of Marty's greatest films!",10
18 April 2022,One of the very great stories of new era,"I remember watching this movie and I still remember feelings. It was like watching machine plant shown in a way that makes each screw fantastic.

Director is a man who can make miracles. However cinematics in this movie makes the film speaking for itself.

And choices. Choice of actors. Di Caprio definitely has a good agent. He selects his movies carefully. Each one is like a ribbon on his chest. No wrong moves.

Better watch it....

8 March 2005,A worthy attempt,"This larger than life Biopic of the legendary Film Producer and Aviation Pioneer Howard Hughes is well intentioned and carefully directed by Martin Scorsese, but finally leaves one somewhat unsatisfied. It's the over long running time, and Leo DiCaprio playing Hughes. His enthusiasm for the subject, and strenuous effort at creating the character often dominates the screen, however his youthful looks are at odds with, and he lacks the statue for, the portrayal of such a notable, complex, and commanding figure and his decent into dementia. Hughes is regarded in America as some sort of hero for his spectacular failures as much as his achievements, then his weird reclusive life in the last years. He inherited a fortune from his father, and the fear of germs from his mother. At first looking as much like a baby faced James Cagney as Howard Hughes, DiCaprio is at his best in the later scenes, when makeup has given him some gravitas, and his handling of the dramatic mental decline. It is however the supporting actors that give the film most impact, notably Cate Blancett as a very convincing Kathleen Hepburn, Alan Alda as the aggressive Senator, and Alex Baldwin as CEO of Pan Am.

The flying and cabaret sequences are well executed, the feeling for period effective. The film has a striking over the top pictorial quality as we might expect from a veteran like Scorsese, who as usual turns in a well crafted picture. Certainly worth a visit as it lifts a curtain on some of the more oddball aspects of the elusive Mr. Hughes and indeed Miss Hepburn.",8
30 November 2020,High flying perfection,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not.

2 January 2005,3 Hours does not an Oscar winner make,"I went to see this film with great anticipation. I was looking forward to it for many reasons, not the least of which was to learn something about Howard Hughes that I didn't know. The film taught me nothing. That having been said, I was still enjoying the film through the first hour, staying with it through the second hour and completely losing it through the third hour. This was one of those films that less would be more. Three hour movies become extremely tedious to the average movie goer, the same as double headers did to baseball fans. This movie could easily have been cut by 40 minutes and would not have damaged it at all. I thought DiCaprio did a fairly decent job of playing Hughes all though others I have spoken with all felt he was a bad choice. I also thought that Cate Blanchett nailed Kathryn Hepburn, both in looks and in sound. John C. Reilly did his normally excellent performance as I have come to expect from him and Alex Baldwin was fine as Juan Trippe. One of the highlights of the movie were the special effects. I would recommend the film only if you know going in of it's length. I will say it again, 3 hours is too long for a movie.",7
29 March 2020,Interesting movies,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him..

As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",7
17 December 2004,"Surprisingly, A Snooze","I didn't think it was possible, but Martin Scorsese has made a boring film -- a great big, gorgeously shot, beautifully art-directed bore, but a bore just the same. Howard Hughes and his involvement with advancements in aircraft technology and the Hollywood of the 30s and 40s ought to be a no-brainer. The fault is in the casting of Leo DiCaprio. He's a callow pipsqueak, who, while gifted as a child actor, has not made a satisfying transition to adult roles. Since ""The Aviator"" hinges on the personal magnetism of an obsessive and ultimately unhinged pioneer, this is a fatal flaw. First, there's the voice -- a crucial instrument for an actor -- and DiCaprio's nasal whine is rather sad. The depthless blue eyes don't help. Then there's the boobie face, with nary a character line (one furrow between his sculpted eyebrows doesn't count, although he works it with all his might). His petulant, furtive body language is like something displayed by a troubled teen in an after school movie. He does make an earnest try, thrashing around in naked desperation in a couple of scenes, and miming all the mannerisms of a soul afflicted with OCD, but it's all affectation. He's not much of an actor, and he's not a leading man.

The audience with which I watched a preview gasped with delight when Kate Blanchett popped into the picture as a brutally bubbly Kate Hepburn, all swagger and need. She captured the actress and woman without turning her into a caricature -- no mean feat. The scene at her family's dinner table is a revealing look at the privileged Yankee eccentrics who shaped her.

Once again, Alec Baldwin turns in a convincing performance as a high-powered bad guy, in this case the head of Pan Am, with Alan Alda, cast against type, as his unctuous henchman in Congress. John C. Reilly has nothing to do except wear fedoras, and and in her amazing jewel-toned wardrobe and jewelry, Kate Beckinsale is quite fetching as Ava Gardner. She's no Ava Gardner but that's not her fault -- nobody is.

A handful of riveting action scenes pick up the pace of the story, especially a crash landing in Beverly Hills which nearly killed Hughes, then it's back to Leo, and the movie flags. I wanted to like ""The Aviator"", and I just didn't. I'm blaming DiCaprio.",6

9 November 2018,Auto Pilot,"Continuing the run of Biopics that dominated the 2005 Oscars, ""The Aviator"" tells the life story of Howard Hughes from film producer, to Hollywood playboy, to aviator entrepreneur, to recluse.

Given the many and various things that Howard Hughes attempted in his life, the movie feels to me like it's skimming over his story somewhat. I think it would have been better suited to take a deeper dive on one or two key aspects, rather than trying to cover it all. It makes some of it feel a bit disjointed, for example, Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) comes and goes from his life without much explanation of how they connected, or reconnected following a violent breakup. There's little information provided about how things really turned out, his film for example, ""Hell's Angels"" is given a sceptical standing ovation at the Premier, but we're never provided any information on how the film turned out.

Whilst I'm stuck on the negatives (and I know I'm criticising a legend here) I don't think some of the choices for shots are great. There are occasional hyper kinetic pan shots that I had to look away from to stop from feeling queasy. There are also some horrible overlays in establishing shots of locations and occasionally the effects haven't held up very well (although that's not the case in every scene).

Which is not the say that the film is terrible, or bad even. Performances are great, across the board. It's a very mannered performance but Cate Blanchett is worthy of her best supporting Oscar for her performance as Katherine Hepburn. John C Reilly and Matt Ross are also good. There are a myriad of little performances, sometimes only in one scene, from the likes of Jude Law, Willem Defoe and Danny Huston that add to the quality of the production. But it's Leonardo DiCaprio's film. He's in virtually every scene and his performance was definitely good value for the nomination, though I'd agree it's not better than Jamie Foxx in ""Ray"".

Never dull despite its running time, ""The Aviator"" is tremendous from a performance viewpoint, though a little shallow, making it solid but not essential.",6
27 December 2004,Much ado about zip,"I was so looking forward to seeing a flick this year that might be worthy of Oscar. Still looking.

I have read the reviews posted for Avitator. They are nearly uniformly praiseworthy of this effort. I disagree.

First, Leo is not effective as Hughes. Particularly when he bursts loose with profanity. He looks absolutely childish. I literally laughed out loud each time he got angry. One reviewer noted, correctly, that the Senate hearings provide his best work as Hughes. Indeed, those scenes are, in my opinion, the only good work he does in this film.

Blanchett is quite good as Hepburn. The rest of the ensemble don't register anything, as they are in the movie for such short bursts that who can know, or care, if they turned in a good piece of work.

This movie disappointed me. I was hoping for so much more. And, I cannot figure out the generally positive (alas, sometimes rave) reviews for this film. It is very mediocre.

Maybe Million Dollar Baby can save the year in film.

27 December 2004,Scorsese lost it,"I am a genuine lover of films. I write this not to be hateful but to give my honest opinion about a film that is getting hyped by critics but that left me and my friends baffled. Quite frankly, I can't remember a film I despised so much as THE AVIATOR, a beautifully photographed leaden piece of metal with no more heart than a piece of left over scrap metal from the Spruce Goose. Howard Hughes is an admittedly difficult subject matter for a film (perhaps this is why so many announced film projects about the eccentric billionaire have gone by the way side) -- Peculiar to a fault, Scorsese fails to make Hughes sympathetic or understandable to audiences he expect to go on a three hour journey into Hughes madness (which is pretty much the same in the third scene in the film as it is in the last.) DiCaprio does his best, but the character of Hughes has nowhere to go. So he's rich and eccentric and troubled. Why should we care if we can't sympathize or at least empathize? And we are really excepted to believe his life long phobias are the result of a single conversation with his creepy mother during a bath?

The lone bright spot in this film is Cate Blanchett who manages to turn in a richly textured performance of Katherine Hepburn. But her presence ain't worth the boredom you have to wade through the other 2 hours and 45 minutes she's not on film. This is a film critics seem to love, and I'm no critic. But I know when a film leaves me bolting for the exit at the end.

If the site of naked, half mad Howard Hughes lining up rows upon rows of milk bottles filled with urine is your idea of a good time, THE AVIATOR is the film for you.",1

26 June 2010,A Remarkable Story For A Remarkable Man!,"In The Aviator, star Leonardo Dicaprio delves deeper into the psyche of his character than he has for any performance previous. Not since his breakthrough performance in What's Eating Gilbert Grape has DiCaprio fallen in so believably into his role. Beyond his uncanny resemblance to the reclusive Howard Hughes, DiCaprio's emotional output in the role is emotionally stunning. His performance eclipses all others in the film, despite his co-stars' not insubstantial contributions to their characters.

The Aviator is a movie that simply succeeds on multiple creative levels. It is also an emotionally gripping biography and a beautiful film in both technical achievement and performance. A stellar cast, fastidious period detail, staggering production standards, a highly compressed narrative and a defiantly downbeat ending reminiscent of Scorseses 1970s heyday.

Scorsese utilizes every tool at a filmmaker's disposal. But for all of the film-making pyrotechnics, it is the clear-eyed empathy Scorsese brings to The Aviator that makes it one of the most emotionally rewarding films of his career.

you don't wanna miss this!

A perfect 8/10",8
26 August 2008,Scorsese and DiCaprio at their best,"That plane crash was probably one of the most brutal scenes that I have ever seen. You could see Scorsese winning Best Director right there.

The performances were all excellent. Leonardo Dicaprio gave a so far career best performance. When he is in the car covering his mouth as he said the same thing over and over, It was very impressive.

Blanchett gives the Hepburn in the movie life, energy, humor, depth, one of the best performances of the year. Beckinsale was also good. When she tears down the tape in the house, she serves the movie the way Blanchett does, though without as much depth, but still is excellent.

Alan Alda deserved his nomination. He is a good villain, but also one who is thinking about playing the Washington game. The whole chairman scene with Baldwin was a good entry for his character. Also with the Baldwin character-Citizen Kane did pop into my head. It was probably the set, but his powerful character doing what he can to tear down Hughes reminded me of CK.

The Aviator is one of the best movies of the year, even if it drags with the hearings, it provides for the set up for one of the more triumphant scenes with the flying of the Spruce Goose.",8
30 October 2006,Great,"This movie is important to me. I realize that, as a relatively high budget and heavily marketed film, certain facets of this biopic have been sensationalized. However, the image this movie constructs of the great modern eccentric Howard Hughes is fascinating.

The film is also emotionally powerful. The way the movie depicts Hughes' degenerative mind is haunting. We see the tics evolve, eventually dominating Hughes' personality. It is interesting to indulge in the guided observance of the effects these eccentricities had in Hughes' relationships with other people as both impressive and sad. Gloriously tragic.

22 September 2019,The Aviator is ideal for those boring afternoons in January when there's nothing on television and you're tired of sales.,"This is reflected in the film's exquisite look. It represents the cinematic looks of the three centuries in which the tale takes place, and is a wonderful recreation of Hollywood's golden ages and aviation, all glamorous night clubs, wonderful clothes, lovely houses and sleek Art Deco-inspired aeroplanes.In the period, there is a sense of total immersion, and just how exciting and elegant this was a time. The performers mix perfectly into this globe. DiCaprio is convincing as Hughes appears in nearly every scene, maintaining our empathy even when in his screening room pissing into milk bottles, but Cate Banchett acts off the screen.Actually, she doesn't look like Kate Hepburn, but her mannerisms and vocal performance are so spot on that I forgot I didn't watch the true lady. A cast which comprises Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, John C. Reilly, Jude Law, Ian Holm, and Kate Beckinsale supports them ably.

The Aviator is ideal for those boring afternoons in January when there's nothing on television and you're tired of sales. Empty your bladder, pick up some popcorn and sink into it.",9
27 December 2004,A Biopic About a Very Brilliant But Very Disturbed Man,"Hollywood loves biopics and, judging from past and recent history, the more whacked-out the subject the more resources go into the film. It doesn't matter if the average moviegoer knows anything about the spotlighted character (as in ""A Brilliant Mind,"" how many knew about that Nobel Prize-winning genius?). Actually it may be an advantage to not sit there comparing recollected reality with silver screen confabulation.

In any event I doubt many people under sixty know much about rich inventor-cum-movie producer and director Howard Hughes. Hughes shifted gears from a fulsome dose of Obsessive/Compulsive Disorder (OCD) to full-blown madness decades before death released him from an affluent but miserable life.

Martin Scorsese is massively fascinated by Hughes and his sprawling film is a testament to the man's brilliance as well as his descent into tragically isolated insanity. Having cast Leonardo DiCaprio in the much overpraised ""Gangs of New York,"" he recruited this versatile actor, who owes his preeminence in Tinseltown to the runaway success of ""Titanic,"" to portray Hughes from his mid-1920s life as producer/director of the uber-over budget World War I aerial combat flick, ""Hell's Angels,"" to the late Forties.

As portrayed by DiCaprio, Hughes was a driven perfectionist. Nothing wrong with that in a surgeon but with a movie production there's a time to wrap it up and Hughes took years to reach that point. His obsession with detail, well reflected by DiCaprio, was simply an early and useful mirror of his increasingly handicapping OCD.

That movie's success brought gorgeous women flocking to his side but the most interesting liaison was with rising star Katharine Hepburn. Cate Blanchett inhabits Hepburn, a risky role when so many both remember the recently deceased icon and were mesmerized by her out-sized, bigger than life personality. Well Blanchett did it - no surprise. She inhaled Hepburn's clipped, staccato speech and her mannerisms, not all of which were always gentle or kind, even to loved ones. An Oscar nomination, I hope, will follow.

Hughes, an experienced but often reckless pilot, germinated ideas for novel aircraft design and he had the sense, the judgment to recruit the best minds to translate his concepts into operational models. Much of ""The Aviator"" focuses on Hughes's drive to produce the fastest planes and the biggest for the military. DiCaprio's Hughes balances ambitious plans well laid out with the creeping advent of uncontrollable mental illness. Closeups show a Hughes who knows something is going rather wrong but he hasn't the ability to fight it (or the shrinks).

As Hughes's lover Ava Gardner, Kate Beckinsale is very grown up and convincing. She's a versatile actress and she proves it again here.

The denouement of Hughes's public life was a vicious scandal engineered by Pan Am's Juan Trippe (a smooth, venal Alec Baldwin) who controlled Maine's Senator Ralph Owen Brewster (a not as nice as we usually expect him to be Alan Alda). Trippe coveted a monopoly for international flights for Pan Am (anyone see a Pan Am plane lately?) and Hughes's TWA was an obstacle that had to be neutralized by law or acquired by coerced sale.

The Senate hearing is over dramatized but it reflects a dirty world of false accusations and behind the scenes chicanery that, I understand, actually occurs from time to time. Shocking.

Perhaps Hughes's greatest gift to mankind was not his into the air briefly only once, eight-engine Spruce Goose, but his getting Jane Russell in ""The Outlaw"" to the screen past the censors. Many male libidos owed much to that film's release. But the men who couldn't bare to have Russell's ample cleavage on big screens held up the movie's release for SIX years. Awful!

Jude Law who is in nearly every movie these days shows up as Errol Flynn. A forgettable performance.

DiCaprio, Blanchett, Beckinsale, Alda and Baldwin make a good team with a master director, Scorsese. Wonder what's next?

Good use is made of period newsreels and the score helps keep the dialog moving nicely.

1 January 2005,Flies high but not an epic,"""The Aviator"" is an engaging drama which may be the best film of 2004. Then again, 2004 was a rather lackluster year at the movies. Like most viewers, I am not informed in detail about the actual life of Howard Hughes, so I cannot say how revisionist ""The Aviator"" is. The strengths of the film are the excellent acting roles by the leads Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett, vivid period sets, seamless special effects and an interesting story to tell. Howard Hughes is portrayed as a complex larger-than-life character with bizarre instability offsetting his genius. In itself, the movie is a captivating walk through a portion of his life. But that is also its weakness. Without a distinct starting point or ending, the story lacks a sense of purpose. Sure, it is fine to watch, but after all is said, so what? ""The Aviator"" might win Oscars, but it certainly will not become a cultural phenomenon like ""Titanic"" did. On that note, ""The Aviator"" also lacks a memorable soundtrack. Probably about as fine a depiction of Howard Hughes as one could ask for. But ultimately somewhat hollow. 8/10

24 January 2019,An Amazing Performance and Big Screen Biopic,"30 December 2004. Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn stands out as one of the best performances of all time - her acting and capture of the one of the greatest actresses is a tribute to both Hepburn and Blanchett - a strong contender for best actress. The Aviator also captures one of the most frightening and dramatic crash scenes (the literally bursts even further from the trailers). This intense and psychological and physically revealing movie is raw and hard-hitting. Leonardo offers up a spectacular breakthrough performance, maturing as an actor and taking on the more difficult job of method acting (having to become another person) and shed his own persona and his past historical performance from Titanic. Interestly, this movie isn't perfect in that unfortunately, this movie is only half a movie and is unable to offer its audience with the Godfather I and II effect that would make the movie experience complete.

This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",1
16 December 2013,The Story Everybody Wants To Be Termed Theirs. ♦ 77%,"Now I am not talking specifically about OCD, but some people do rejoice at the fact they suffer from it. The Aviator talks beautifully about the guy who pioneered aviation. His actions, through THIS film, will set a role.

Leonardo DiCaprio is a maverick. His Oscar loss is the brightest example of flawed judgment. The way he lives as Hughes in this biopic is beyond anyone's skill or repertoire. And his interpretation of OCD, coupled with startling agony is one of the many genius antics he does and amuses in this film. With a beaming supporting cast and very-well written plot, the film advances good in the first hour. Then as the camera focuses on the personality & his disorders & thoughts, the screenplay quite makes it boring at two or three nodes. And although it has nothing to do with the 170 minute run-time, the dullness is the only bad thing about it.

With complementing music and apt direction for such a biopic, Martin Scorsese proves that he is one of the phenomenal directors of all time. I just love his topic-driven films and The Aviator is no different. Just, the editing & polishing could've been better. Awesome cinematography & clever use of CGI.

BOTTOM LINE: A well-written, inspirational film. highly Recommended!

Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES

20 June 2005,only worth seeing because Blanchett is wonderful as Hepburn,"It seems to me that a great director, Martin Scorsese, after making magnificent movies like ""Taxi Driver"", ""New York New York"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Casino"", is creating disappointment lately with ""Gangs of Newyork"", ""Bringing out the dead"" and ultimately with this movie, ""The Aviator"".

It lacks depth in many ways. The plane crash scene is very far from reality. The only relationship of Howard Hughes that is given properly is the one with Hepburn. Ava Gardner and the others comes and goes without making sense.

DiCaprio is awful. I think he performed very well in ""Catch me if you can"" but Howard Hughes proves to be beyond his acting skills.

The first part of the movie was promising, with the shooting of ""Hell's Heroes"" and the affair between Howard Hughes and Katharine Hepburn keeping the pace up. Cate Blanchett is doing a wonderful work playing the legendary actress.

But after the first hour the movie turns its interest to the aviation war and Hughes as a producer and film maker disappears from the scene. Further developments and the changes in Hughes character is getting more boring with each minute. Leonardo DiCaprio is not convincing and Scorsese could not manage to pull it together properly.",4
16 February 2015,The story of a man who was a success at being a failure,"The first time I saw this film I thought, ""It's pretty good,"" but the second time I watched it I came away with a much different perspective.

Most of us knew about Howard Hughes' obsession with germs and about the Spruce Goose but not a lot about his early years or the extent of his involvement with airplanes.

""The Aviator"", but virtue of its very title, lets us know that flying was Hughes' magnificent obsession and everything else came second.

Watching the film the second time I was stuck by the importance of color. At first I thought something was wrong with the color on my television because when Hughes and Hepburn are playing golf the grass and leaves are a bright turquoise instead of green and the color of the sky looked odd too, yet the flesh tones were correct. Then it hit me that the color must have been ""correct"" too, according to something Scorcese wanted to imply. What that might have been I don't know but it got my attention and the colors kept my attention for the rest of the film.

Vibrant decor and flashes of colors showed up throughout the film while the clothing and characters remained bland in comparison. People wearing brown jackets and slacks stood in rooms with bright green upholstered furniture or dark red walls, and the people seemed to fade into the background. Your attention was on their surroundings, not them, so that you concentrated on what they were saying instead of what they looked like.

But what do I mean by saying it's the story of a man who was a success at being a failure? Hughes, for all his billions in financial assets, never truly was a success at anything, according to this film.

Hughes' movies could never recoup their extravagant costs, he kept losing (or driving away) the women he loved, and even all his aviation dreams fizzled out when he lost contracts and ultimately a whole airline. He put too much of himself into everything he did, trying to achieve perfection, which only pushed him further and further away from it, and I came away from the film feeling sorry for Mr. Hughes. Whether that was Mr. Scorcese's intention, again, I don't know, but that was the message I got.

If you're looking for just another biopic where characters are explained to death and situations are always resolved, this isn't the film for you. But if you're willing to relax and let the images and characterizations take you over in a more subtle way, you're in for a treat.",8
21 December 2014,This film puts the cheese in cheesecake,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

One: they didn't have extremely interesting roles and two: the story still remains a piece of ....(you get the idea) no matter who plays who! and the worse thing of all was leonardo dicaprio who in my opinion is a low-budget and extremely not-talented actor (and using this word makes me feel uncomfortable). i mean, if it wasn't for this dude, i might have enjoyed the movie.....NOT!!!! but he's a real pain in the ass anyway! in conclusion another one that is extremely well regarded and reviewed but in fact is just a piece of...(you get the idea!!) the only thing that was good about this film was Cate Blanchett! she did an excellent job and it really made a great impression on me!! but besides that.....if you guys would make -x stars for the vote i would really appreciate it!!!cause this movie sucks big time!!!

10 January 2005,"Scorsese no longer great, now just good","To a certain degree, all biographical films are as successful as the audience's knowledge of the character. That has never been more true than with 'The Aviator.' I walked into Martin Scorsese's epic knowing little about the bizarre tycoon Howard Hughes, therefore I walked out reasonably satisfied. To those who have studied Hughes, I wonder if their reaction to the film will involve shrugged shoulders.

There is a depressing quality to 'The Aviator' that enters as baggage that has nothing to do with the film at all. I watched 'Gangs of New York' recently for the first time and disliked it entirely. Scorsese's newest work is considerably better but leaves a bitter taste still.

While watching Leonardo DiCaprio finely portray Hughes, I remembered Scorsese's earlier work. He is the master of presenting the anti-hero. I was reminded of the chief characters in 'Raging Bull' or 'Taxi Driver.' The success of his films, to a large degree, fall around the stories encircling his troubled stars. Look, for instance, at the backdrop of 'Goodfellas.' Everywhere the Ray Liotta character goes, he is in a perpetual state of danger. He is surrounded by friends he cannot trust and the law who wants him locked up. Most importantly, we felt it the whole time.

Those films were masterworks and even for what 'The Aviator' has its sights set on, as a perfect film it would not reach that grandeur. The film begins as Howard Hughes is painstakingly attempting to complete his war epic 'Hell's Angels.' At the final cost of approaching $4 million it is an irony that the amount is a mere fraction of what the actor playing Hughes normally gets per film! The meat of the picture involves Howard Hughes' relationship with actress Katharine Hepburn, played by Cate Blanchett. At first I feared Blanchett would create a caricature of Hepburn, but the actress is far too gifted for that. The brightest element in this film is, in fact, the quiet moments between the two. As it ends up, Blanchett's performance is the best in the film, eclipsing even DiCaprio's portrayal.

That the film is totally about Hughes is made obvious early on. DiCaprio not only has the energy to show the early Hughes filming 'Hell's Angels,' but he also is capable of descending his character into inevitable madness. It is a complex role for DiCaprio and he is clearly up to the task.

There are ambitious shots, especially those of Hughes flying his many airplanes. But like 'Gangs of New York,' much of the scenes seem ""stagey"" and enclosed. I wonder if Scorsese should abandon larger scale epics and return to personal stories.

Much of the scenery is beautiful and the production team did well to show the different time periods and locations. The cast is a who's who of the neo-Hollywood elite which helps us feel we are among the giants like Hughes must have felt around Hepburn, Errol Flynn and Ava Gardner. Sadly, this is not the same Scorsese. The ambition is glitzy but lacking real substance. To say it is good is fine, but to say Scorsese is now good makes me sad. *** out of ****",6
2 August 2005,Solid Movie about Howard Hughes.,"Okay, I'm still recovering from ""The Titanic"" debacle, so I didn't buy into Leonardo Di Caprio playing Howard Hughes, and although Kate Blanchett's portrayal of Kathryn Hepburn was shrill and annoying, and the pseudo-psychology used to explain Mr. Hughes's idiosyncrasies were flat-out crude and ludicrous, and the scene where Mr. Hughes is staggering around in his hotel room naked utterly devoid of any entertainment value, still this is a solid movie. It's a solid movie because of the life of Howard Hughes itself. The story of Howard Hughes is not his mental illness, nor his affair with Kathryn Hepburn, nor his run-in with Congress. Rather the story of Howard Hughes is about what Hughes did, what he built, what he accomplished, what an incredibly great and gifted man he was. He was rich man, but he was also a worker, a test pilot, a builder, an innovator, an inventor, as well as a pioneer Hollywood producer and director. No matter how hard this movie tries to portray Mr. Hughes as some kind of oddball, and no matter how unbelievable and superficial is Mr. Di Caprio's portrayal of Howard Hughes, the man's accomplishments could not be ignored or denigrated, even in this movie, and they speak for themselves. So Howard Hughes had mental problems? So what? What is important is what Howard Hughes did, and for that reason this movie should be watched.",8

12 May 2005,Must Watch: Caprio & Blanchett have done a great Job!,"Plot Outline: The movie traces the life of millionaire movie mogul and aviator Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) from his late teens to his early forties. Set in the 1930's and 40's, the movie depicts the protagonist's mindset as he romances Hollywood's babes Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) and his wild planes with equal zest.

Comment: Scorsese makes a great effort to portray a crazy genius in the best possible way anyone could. Although a lot of my friends who've seen this movie say that 'emotion' is missing in this movie in a big way, I prefer to say that Hughes was a character about whom there is very little in the public domain, especially about his childhood and old-age. Further, it is extremely difficult to portray someone's thought process, something as wild as Hughes' with accuracy and emotion. I would say that, within the given constraints, Scorsese has made his best.

The Five Oscars that the movie got are really well deserved. In fact, I would say that Aviator deserved better than Million Dollar Baby. By saying this, I mean that Underdog-winner concepts have always struck the sentimental chord. It would be pertinent to recollect the success of movies such as Seabiscuit, Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar, etc. Caprio has rendered a brilliant performance which has been under-rated by many. Other stars did a great job too. Blanchett had the meatiest role of all.

20 December 2004,Dreary acting and mis-casting,"Just another example of DiCapprio's lack of acting abilities. Not to mention mis-casting of the actresses. Shallow performances all around.

Story is decent, but overshadowed by the lack of skill of the cast.

I was hoping for a better bio-pic, but it seems to be a skill that Hollywood is now lacking. Gone are the days of great character actors playing roles in good films, they weren't always historically accurate, but at least they were viewable.

By the end of The Aviator I wanted my money back. It's so tiring to keep seeing the same group of actors who, because of too much media hype, think they are great acting talents. It would be interesting to see what Jim Carey would have done with the part.

27 December 2004,Really disappointed,"I don't know...there was so much hype about this before it came out. I fell asleep in the first half hour and fought to stay awake for the remainder of the movie. I thought Leo and Cate were great however...I do believe that there were more ""impersonations"" rather than acting? The story line was very choppy.

I always love Leo movies...I think he's an excellent actor. And there isn't one movie that Cate's been in that I haven't enjoyed...until now:(

The costume department did an awesome job. Most of Leo's costumes

were identical to what Hughes wore.

It's ashame; I was really disappointed and if anyone asks me, I'll tell them to save their money and see something else. Sorry, fans:(",1
7 January 2018,Howard Hughes biopic and a mixed bag,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",6
12 March 2005,Hard to invest in a fella we care little for,"Care factor zero is behind the dramatic failure of Scorsese's latest, a visual essay on aspects of the life of Howard Hughes (Leonardo De Caprio).

The presentation is glossy and too slick; I never felt any sense of danger in the dogfight sequence because planes were impacting with the lens and emerging on the other side. It was like watching a cartoon.

Hughes, an odd fellow, developed an unhealthy obsession with cleanliness. The movie spends quite a bit of time showing him combating filthy things and imagined filthy things. After a while it got boring.

Even though Hughes spent millions on projects that never flew, he never came close to going bust. His accountant got plenty peed off at him when he continued to pour dollars into his epic flop HELL'S ANGELS, but still, he never faced any visible hardship as a result. It's like I was watching an extended promo on the life of Hughes The only time the film arrested my interest was when Hughes was put on trial and went head to head with crooked politician Alan Alda. We learned something about his motivations here and enjoyed his underdog status (if only briefly).

Immensely disappointing.",
26 January 2005,Great looking film with an only average narrative,"The Aviator is a fictionalized account of the peak years of tycoon Howard Hughes from the late 20's to late 40's.

I went to see this movie because I like history and learn about historical figures in the context of the times they lived in.

Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Hughes, who inherited millions from his father's drill bit company and spent millions on making movies and fast airplanes. Hughes was also a ladies man having relationships with many of the women who worked in Hollywood.

I didn't buy DiCaprio as Hughes early in the film. He seemed far too young and in close ups one could see his ""soul"" patch that the actor likes to wear. It wasn't until after the horrific test crash when he gets Hughes' trademark pencil mustache that I started to see Hughes. DiCaprio even had the same kind of wrinkles Hughes had on his forehead when he was intense. That creeped me out.

Even with the slight flaw DiCaprio showed the range of Hughes. From driven multitasking tycoon to disturbed germophobic, his acting was great.

Cate Blanchett plays Katharine Hepburn, Hughes' first serious paramour. Blanchett gave an excellent performance. You could tell she spent time studying early Hepburn films and reading interviews.

Kate Beckinsale plays fiery Ava Gardner. Beckinsale had Gardner to a tee going from loving to tyrant just like the real actress.

John C. Reilly played Hughes business manager Noah Dietrich. Dietrich paid attention to the business side of Hughes even though the boss could care less. Reilly turns in another excellent performance.

The film was beautifully shot and the time period seemed authentic. I expect that from Director Martin Scorsese but the story misses the mark.

Some stories indicated that Scorsese made the film using different color processes to match the time periods in the movie. This is a gimmick only a film geek will love. The only thing I noticed was a dinner scene that had blue peas.

Some people will applaud the lack of graphic sex scenes but in this case the film really didn't sell how much of a womanizer Hughes was. They showed him focusing on a woman and sweet talking her till she swooned but there was no sex scenes or even a scene where the couple wakes up the next morning. It would also add some insight to see if Hughes' germophobia affected his sex life. For a man who would freak out seeing a spot on some else's suit how would he ever get through a night of lovemaking.

Then there are the scenes where Hughes, on the rebound from Hepburn, is dating a 15 year old. What?? Where did that come from?? The couple are at the local club and no one seems to notice or care. During that time people weren't open with those kind of relationships. Fatty Arbuckle and Charlie Chaplin had run ins with the law over under aged lovers.

The best parts of the film are when Hughes is multitasking. Talking to his aircraft designer about a design and in the next sentence ordering scenes cut from a movie he was making. Another great scene is the Senate hearing where Hughes is called to answer the charges he was a war profiteer. There are some great quotes that can apply to our current defense contracting issues. Alex Baldwin, as Juan Tripp, Hughes' airline rival, and Alan Alda as Tripp's paid Senator Brewster were equally slimy as the villains.

The film is 2 hours and 45 minutes and the first half seems to focus on Hughes relationship with Hepburn. I am not sure she deserved as much focus as she got.

The plane crash sequence went on far too long for what it delivered. Yes, it was needed because it was defining moment for Hughes. He lived with the health issues from the crash for the rest of his life, but the special effect shot just wasn't need to run as long as it did.

One special effects shot I did love was filming the climax to the movie ""Hell's Angels"". It was obviously a computer shot but was breath taking none the less.

Overall I thought Scorsese channeled Hughes the director too much. There was much that could be trimmed downed or dropped and still tell a good story. What is on the screen is fine but it just misses being a great film.

5 January 2005,Gorgeous but basically superficial look at Howard Hughes' life...,"THE AVIATOR is a film as eccentric as Howard Hughes himself. It never really explains the germ phobia that possesses him since we are only given one brief scene of his mother bathing him as a boy and requiring him to spell the word ""Q-u-a-r-a-n-t-i-n-e"". This is supposed to explain his lifelong fear of germs--in effect, it's Martin Scorsese letting us in on the ""Rosebud"" behind his movie before the story even starts--a tribute to Orson Welles perhaps.

With that mystery out of the way, the film proceeds to tell, at length, about the most productive years in the producer's life, a span of twenty years during which he gave the world HELL'S ANGELS, SCARFACE and THE OUTLAW when he wasn't immersing himself in the mysteries of flight.

Like HELL'S ANGELS, the film is best when dealing with the aviation scenes, although all of the Hollywood period elements are done with style, taste and flair. Cate Blanchett, although not exactly a facsimile of Hepburn physically, plays Kate Hepburn with a marvelous sense of timing that catches the Hepburn mannerisms. Instead of dealing with Hughes' other affairs with actresses, Scorsese concentrates mainly on Hepburn with fairly good results. The scene where she takes Hughes home to meet her clan of kinfolk is hilariously staged.

The big test flying accident that did considerable damage to Hughes physically, is stunningly recreated for maximum effect. It certainly never damaged his spirit--and Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hughes with considerable enthusiasm as a man with strong convictions about his passion for aviation. He does a brilliant job despite the fact that he was not ideally cast to play Hughes. His fans will be proud of his work in this one.

Not so fortunate is Jude Law, who, mercifully, appears briefly as Errol Flynn. This is the first truly bad performance I've seen from Law, and a major casting error even though his screen time is limited. Gwen Stefani in no way resembles Jean Harlow facially--only the bleached blonde hairdo lends any credibility to her role. Kate Beckinsdale does a remarkably fine job as Ava Gardner--stunning to look at and giving plenty of gusto to her feisty role.

DiCaprio carries the film and does so with a superb, consistently on target performance. It's clearly his best work since TITANIC.

For a really insightful look at the man who was Howard Hughes you would have to look much further than this slick, extremely well made film that will no doubt please the average movie-goer.

He was a complex man--a billionaire whose conflicting traits made him a paradox--part playboy, part businessman, part inventor--and possessed by demons that eventually destroyed him. It's quite an interesting film but Scorsese never really captures what makes the man tick.",8
30 January 2005,What's the big deal?,"It was a so-so movie...but why all of the Oscar buzz? It wasn't that great of a film. I guess it has been a slow year in Hollywood and Oscar is just looking for a film that is halfway OK. But really, this movie is not Oscar worthy! I'm really tired of poor movies being produced...remakes galore!! Has the movie industry run out of creative people? Anyway, Leo seems to do better when he is portraying biographic figures. And the casting for the supposed ""look alike"" stars was annoying! I know you can't really find another Flynn or Hepburn but I found their characters really distracting. I just wonder if there wouldn't have been a better way to deal with Hughes private life? 6/10

6 June 2012,"""A bad experience with a dog""","The biographical movie is these days more able than ever to be frank about all kinds of madness and sordidness. In fact it's more than that. It's practically a prerequisite of the modern biopic that you present your subject as some kind of flawed genius. The trouble is, no matter how interesting the individual, an interesting movie is not a guarantee.

The Aviator is directed by Martin Scorsese, whose love of antique cinema surely gave him some special interest in the project. However, I don't see what the idea was of making the early scenes mimic Howard Hughes's two-strip colour process. It doesn't have the authenticity to hark back to the real thing, no other lost classic techniques are resurrected to keep it company, and frankly it looks ugly. As usual Scorsese's showy, jumpy manner of filmmaking is a bit hit-and-miss. He's still great at capturing states of mind, albeit a bit heavy-handedly, but he is seriously short on ""wow"" moments these days.

The protagonist is portrayed by Scorcese's new favourite Leonardo DiCaprio. He's perfect as the young Hughes because he'll probably go on looking eighteen until he's fifty. Trouble is he still looks (and sounds) eighteen when he's playing the middle-aged Hughes. The acting however is first class, subtle yet forceful. The same unfortunately cannot be said of Cate Blanchett's terrible impersonation of Katherine Hepburn, which copies a few of Hepburn's speech patterns in a grotesque caricature. And she gets the accent wrong. No-one else really stands out as good or bad.

In spite of the general mediocrity of the production, Hughes's life as presented here does offer up some great moments. A nice little montage of clips from Hell's Angels which makes it look even better than it probably is in reality. The occasional humour in an incredibly rich man who thinks he can get anything to happen by simply buying the experts. Our ability to actually route for Hughes when he comes back blazing and cleans up at the hearing after everyone had written him off as a nutter. The eventual poignancy as his condition resurfaces. However it's The Aviator's failure to weave this into some kind of grand narrative that makes it seem so plain overall.",6
3 August 2006,Good biopic but not really fully worthy of all the Oscars and nominations.,"This is a good movie but really not worthy of all that Oscar nominations. It's not among the best of 2004 and also certainly not among the best biopics of all time. But you have to give credit where credit is due. ""The Aviator"" is a good movie about an interesting man and an even more interesting life. With every other normal other director at the helm, more people would had been satisfied with the end result but since this movie was directed by Martin Scorsese, people expected more. What a pressure this must be for him. In the end Scorsese doesn't really delivers and his movie is lacking in moments of true greatness. This movie proofs that Scorsese's best years are behind him and that he is lacking in true creativeness in his recent movies. ""The Aviator"" feels as a formulaic done movie that follows all the rules by the book. It's wonderfully done but also because of this the movie doesn't ever really become a remarkable or very memorable one.

Even though the movie is almost 3 hours long, it never drags. Leave it up to Scorsese to make a long, consistent movie, that never loses focus. The story is told with lots of pace and flows well, perhaps even a bit too fast at times. Some sequences don't feel complete and leave an unsatisfying feeling. At times I wanted to know more about a certain event or character. This is unfortunately often the case with biopics. Movies like this, often tell the life of one single person. How is it possible to put everything that happened in a lifetime, in a just under three hours movie. Of course the pace has to be fast and certain events have to be cut down, in order to achieve everything with the story.

Still I feel kind of cheated afterward by the story. While watching this movie it becomes obvious that Scorsese admires Howard Hughes. He glorifies him as a movie-maker and aviator. The movie mainly focuses on his best years and too often too little on the negative aspects of the character. The movie also ends when Hughes was at his prime, when he starts to fall back again, the movie ends. Even though we all know how Hughes eventually ended up, I'm still of opinion that the movie should had shown this, in AT LEAST a prologue before the end credits.

The movie also leaves lots of things unclear, regarding the main character. It's never explained why he was the way he was and how he got so mentally ill. The movie made it seem that he could be normal when he wanted and had to. It makes the character a sort of an inconsistent one, that we never fully get to understand.

Leonardo DiCaprio does well as Howard Hughes, the main character. He proofs that he is not only a great actor but also can handle big roles and can carry a movie. Other actors that were really great in this movie were Alec Baldwin and a surprising Alan Alda. The rest of the actors feel a little miss cast. They all seemed to have been cast because of their names. This goes for Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe who play some very uninteresting roles. And Cate Blanchett seemed to had been cast because she's Cate Blanchett, not because she looks like Katharine Hepburn and Kate Beckinsale seemed to had been cast because she's Kate Beckinsale, not because she looks like Ava Gardner. This also goes for actors such as; Jude Law and Gwen Stefani.

But sure on the other hand the movie is technically near perfect. It's well looking and has convincing looking sets and costumes and it manages to recreate the atmosphere mainly of the '20's and '30's. Also great was the cinematography by Robert Richardson but I did not particularly liked the color use, for which this movie received so much technical praise. The special effects were also a big letdown. Why don't I ever hear anyone complaining about this? The flight sequences, which are some of the most significant moments in the movie, looked far from convincing.

The movie is compelling enough to make you keep watching it till the end, since its basically in the end still a very well made one. The end result won't disappoint you but it will probably still leaves a sort of a bad aftertaste, considering that the movie is not entirely a satisfying one.

I don't think that ""The Aviator"" will ever grow into becoming a classic Scorsese movie over the next years, such as with his previous movie ""Taxi Driver"" was the case. The movie is too formulaic made for that and it too often choices the simple path. It lacks true creativeness. Still of course the movie is a great one, that is well made and is far better than any other average biopic/drama. But worthy of all its Oscars and nominations? Sorry, I really don't think so. It makes you wonder, would this movie even had been nominated for that many awards if it was directed by a different director?

1 January 2005,"Great Man, Good Movie","Greetings again from the darkness. Having read quite a bit about Howard Hughes and having some of my most memorable movie experiences be from the eye of Martin Scorcese, I was most anxious for the release of the film. This may however be one of the few times when Mr. Scorcese actually underplays the importance and legend of a character. The movie is wonderful (typcially breath-taking Scorcese visuals), but falls short of being great, in part because Leonardo DiCaprio is not able to capture the presence of Hughes the man. The look and mannerisms are fine, but we never experience that feeling of greatness that so many talk about when discussing what it was like to be around the man. Some artistic license was taken with Hughes' withdrawal after the near fatal plane crash. Scorcese draws on what he became later to show that the head injury was the beginning of the fall for this very brilliant, tormented man. As usual, Scorcese provides a stellar supporting cast including Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, John C. Riley, Jude Law and Gwen Stefani. Baldwin's ""meeting"" with Hughes held with a door between them is a riveting Baldwin performance similar to ""Glengarry Glen Ross"". John C. Riley perfectly captures the puppy dog loyalty of Noah Dietrich, but the performance that jumps off the screen is Blanchett as Kate Hepburn. I truly believe these two were soul mates who understood each other, but were misunderstood by most everyone else. Hepburn's independent boldness was way ahead of her time. Overall, the movie captures Hughes at the most creative point in his life and does an admirable job, just not great.",8
3 August 2019,Very nice!,"The aviator has a very developed script that keeps you interested all throughout its runtime. Beautiful performances from DiCaprio and Blanchett steal the show which adds to the beautiful cinematography. Although I don't believe it should've won the Oscar for best Cinematography because there were definitely more attractive movies of its year that showed more style. Other than this is was overall great!

18 July 2005,What a turkey,"What happened at the Oscars? Why should the man behind this get Best Director. Apart from a couple of flight scenes, this movie was painful to watch. The main actors (DiCaprio and Blanchett) were completely miscast in their roles. There is little story to speak of. There's no background to base Hughes' life on when the movie begins, no depth or realism to his grittier, seedier side and no bite or grip taken on his madness. Instead we get a bird's eye view, gently floating over the mostly trivial aspects of his life. I learned nothing from this movie. I was not wowed by any special effects. I did not gasp at any beautiful cinematography. I did not revel in the absolute immersion of an actor in his character. I did not feel that I had to go out and buy the soundtrack, though this might be because I already have ""The Cat's Meow"" soundtrack which shares some of the tunes and certainly the spirit and, by the by, is a far superior movie in my estimation. I will never get the time that I spent watching this back. Scrocese has made some good movies and some great movies but this idea, unlike it's protagonist, does not fly!

4 February 2005,"great movie with an ""updated"" period feel","Martin Scorsese is undoubtedly one of the great living masters of motion pictures.

The Aviator succeeds as a motion picture, not so much as a drama. I think this has to do with the changing of times. Persons looked, spoke and behaved totally different some 70 years ago. The actors all generally look too sweet, too gorgeous for the roles of real-life actors they portray (that is: when compared 1:1 with the originals).

When we look at the original actors on old movies or newsreels, they were much edgier, much louder and in a way even cruder. People in general clearly have become sweeter looking and more soft spoken. Even the most brilliant casting would not be able to produce a closer resemblance - and I cannot think of a better cast.

Of course Cate Blanchett stands out for her Kate Hapburn portrayal not only concerning the voice and behavior but also the hard part: beneath that skinny, bright, talented, tomboyish upper class chatterbox there was a gorgeous and lovable woman who does care. Remarkable (both the original Kate and Cate (destiny?) Blanchett !

On a technical level the movie fully succeeds. The computer generated effects fit seamlessly into the live action. The carefully controlled colors and film grain are an eyeful to behold. There is a lot of testosterone in this movie as well. Pure male pioneer spirit. The aircraft all look breathtaking - of course men can better understand why one would drool over the deafening sound of an old radial engine and why someone's heart would pound faster just by looking at all these classic precision crafted Mitchell movie cameras (I am still drooling). This definitely is a movie about (and for) boys and their toys.

I found it more than adequate that no attempt was made to ""explain"" Howard Hughes obsessive compulsive behavior. We are just presented with the drama of that mental disorder. Any ""explanation"" (I am still not over the ending of Hitchckock's Psycho) would have taken away from the mystery of the man.

The same goes for Huges' totally insane business decisions with his loyal personal employees doing the best to hold everything together. We don't know if Huges' was acting on instinct, impulse, knowledge, relying on luck, had a vision or something else. That's the whole point: no one knew. It is a surprise how articulate he appears opposite Alan Alda (brilliant as usual) during the public hearings.

Leo di Caprio gives a great portrait. Of course he looks more boyish and more handsome than the real Hughes, but we are living in the 2000s and our minds interpret persons in a different way now. In a way this movie updates the characters for the actual times we live in.

The women in this movie all look drop-dead gorgeous, not like their real life counterparts but most likely very much as they appeared to someone some 70 years ago.

One small observation: great English stage actor Ian Holm, still best remembered as Ash the robot from Ridlety Scott's Alien, is once again totally underused in a role as a sincere scientist. Please give that man some better roles in the near future. Nevertheless a nice touch.

Great movie - the three hours flew by. Literally.",
13 September 2010,Slow Pace at Times; Still Remarkable,"I think Scorsese wanted us to see the full Hughes package. He wanted us to get inside the head of one of the most remarkable tragic figures in history. Since most of Hughe's demons appeared later, the inventiveness and risk taking billionaire (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) dominates the screen. He is a pile driver and gets his way. It makes you wonder if this man had been poor early in life, what would have been the result? This film captures him in his ups and downs. Through all it, however, is the undercurrent that is put to us in the opening scene, that the world is dirty and we need to be protected from it. Howard begins his compulsive behavior at this early age, the seeds of destruction planted by an over protective mother. Along the way we meet Katherine Hepburn, Ava Gardner (his equal in arrogance), Faith Domergue (""This Island Earth""), and other Hollywood stars (Errol Flynn and Carol Lombard). The movie is a circus. It is fraught with big scenes and painful scenes. I have trouble with biopics because they often are based on one man's view of things (Oliver Stone, for example), but I had a sense that Scorsese had done his homework and was able to keep to the more public Hughes.",9

18 January 2005,Tedious and LONG.,"I love almost everything Scorsese has ever done, save this film. It's too long by almost an hour. There's an adage that a director should never put something on the screen more than once to illustrate that which has already been clearly exposed. With the help of Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese has always succeeded in maintaining incredibly prolonged sequences of punch and great verve throughout his movies, up until now. It's not clear what went wrong. Maybe Ms. Schoonmaker wasn't given an adequately free hand in this one. I'm not a DiCaprio hater, but there's such a doting absorption with the way the camera lingers on his pretty face here that it's hard to come out of this movie without being sick to death of him. What's worse, Leo's terribly miscast in the role. When trying to play the older, disheveled Hughes, he appears not so much a sloppy eccentric as simply a man-child in an over-sized suit. There are exactly three instances of levity in this film, and all of them fall completely flat. Compare this with every other Scorsese film, from Mean Streets to Gangs of New York, all of which were alleviated by brilliant, memorable moments of gallows humor, and you'll understand immediately what would happen if the director were to completely lose his ability to play with his subjects. And while it's true that Hughes had an interesting life, it all seems like a very long life when you're forced to watch his unhappy compulsions replayed compulsively, what seems eternally, and worst of all, not very originally, for hour after hour after hour (after hour after hour after hour, as he might say.) The flight sequences don't do anything for us, because we've seen it all before. All the pretty tinting to make the film look like it was shot in hand-tinted black and white can't rescue this goose. Actually, the fact that it just won a Golden Globe says more about what's happened to the Globes than it does about this film. I wish I'd gotten my money back when I left the theater. I wish I'd downloaded it; watching the progress bar would have been more exciting than the movie itself.",3
15 June 2005,"Not worth it. Lacking, without soul.","A very artfully filmed (visual) and acted film. But, not worth the price for movie tickets, DVD, or pay per view. Wait till it comes on network TV. Do not get me wrong this film is worth seeing for those who remember when Howard Hughes was the richest man in the world. I it just isn't worth paying to see. The story fixated on Howard Hughes decent into madness and only briefly touched on all other aspects of this genius and his life. I don't know just what this film lacked, soul perhaps, but save your money for something, anything, better......

The acting was superb, Leonardo, Cate and Kate all gave worthy performances. But not enough to save the film.

If you ever saw a biography you would know that this film didn't even mention most of the most fascinating achievements and aspects of Hughes life. Ever wonder what happened to all those billions? They are still around. Every year 100 million are given to support medical research.",2
15 January 2021,"boring, old, complicated","I am disappointed by this movie. It shows us something we are supposed to understand, but not all of us are aviators and producers, so I think it is high expectation. It is some complicated business. Could not watch the whole movie. Talk and negativity dominates in form of arguing, divorce, revenge, bids. Also do not like these genres and old times. I expected less talk, more action, and more positivity. Leonardo is not my favorite actor, I think he is better suited for older folks who understand him and such times. And worst of all, movie is too long, wastes our time too much. Not worth it. No lesson, no motivation, nothing to like. Just shows some disordered lifestyle, spending too much money, lack of morality and responsibility. This makes not only this movie uninteresting, but also the original person movie is about. Similar to Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood (2019) which is just as boring, but at least that one is saved by Brad Pitt, who showed some fun and action. These are worst movies - movies about movies.

22 November 2009,Straighten Up and Fly Right,"At last!

The mystery of Howard Hughes is revealed!

by Martin Scorsese (director), John Logan (scripter), and Leonardo DiCaprio (star), in ""The Aviator"". Their biography begins with young Howard (Jacob Davich) being erotically bathed by his mother. Mind you, this is long after the teenage Hughes should be washing himself. So, he's practices spelling ""q-u-a-r-a-n-t-i-n-e"" while mother (Amy Sloan) bends down to well, it's ""suggested"" incest (there is nothing overtly sexy in the PG-13-rated film). Presumably, this is why Hughes lost his marbles; read, this is his ""Rosebud"" moment.

""The Aviator"" would have been better off following Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" model more closely - about, but not quite so, a familiar figure. Then, the film could be described as ""thinly disguised"" instead of wildly speculative and outrageously fabricated. Herein, the ""love"" of Hughes' life is revealed to be a sexually aggressive and fidgety Cate Blanchett (as Katharine Hepburn). This bizarre characterization won Ms. Blanchett a ""Best Supporting Actress"" Oscar. At times, her awful ""Kate"" seems like Faye Dunaway's ""Joan Crawford"".

Hughes' compulsions for aviating and Hollywood are followed through the 1940s. The good news is that this is a beautiful-looking, Scorsese-directed production. There is outstanding work from the acclaimed director and his collaborators; including cinematographer Robert Richardson, editor Thelma Schoonmaker, and musician Howard Shore. DiCaprio does a marvelous job with the role; he grows into the role so well, that the later scenes - especially those with Alan Alda (as Senator Brewster) - make it seem like the hours flew by.

******** The Aviator (12/14/04) Martin Scorsese ~ Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda",8
27 February 2005,A Truly Underrated Oscar Nominee,"While most critics and Academy voters saw it fitting that The Aviator should receive a Best Pic and Best Director nod, it seems most of America's film-going public felt another way about it. ""Overblown"" ""too long"" and ""not perfect"" were words I have heard used to describe it. In the Scorcese vs Eastwood debate, many claimed they'd rather see Marty win for a better film. But this is, without a doubt, one of Scorcese's finest. Though perhaps too similar in scale to the similarly dismissed ""Gangs of New York"", this is one swift, cunning piece of directing on the part of Mr. Scorcese.

Depicting those years where Howard Hughes teetered on the edge of sanity while achieving so much in so little time, the film's most touching moments are the quietest, when the camera and the actor and director all seem to try and calm down a minute, take a breath, regain control.

Shot and edited like the way Hughes lived, it has a frenetic, implacable chemistry, jumping from extreme excitement to terrifying emotional scares. A credit to Leo DiCaprio as an actor, the sequence at the Coconut Grove bathroom is one of the film's finest, and sloppiest in a way. And that's the way the whole film plays. It almost feels improvised. It has the storytelling of a nine-year-old boy out of breath from a great adventure. And you can't help but connect it's hair-brained energy and logical flow to its anchor, Howard Hughes. And while I won't stay up too long lamenting Scorcese's fifth loss at the Oscars, I will note that he went down with another of his best films. Hopefully, someday very soon, he'll find the connection to his art that Clint Eastwood has found at age 74, and see there's so many more of his own stories to tell. But still, the Aviator is one of those too, and please look into it more closely before you blow it off.",9
21 January 2006,Ain't that a kick in the head?,"Leonardo Dicaprio here is starring at Howard Hughes one of the most filthiest people alive in his day. Notorious for frivolous projects and chasing women, Hughes basically set a cornerstones for the Hiltons and the Trumps for today. Martin Scorcese of course, does a marvelous job of taking us back in time. This time during the 1930's, when everything was almost coming down, except for the extremely rich. DiCaprio is actually quite fun as Hughes, playing every tick and nuance (I was especially impressed with how he portrayed his obsessive-compulsive disorder). The supporting actors are all great too with of course the truly amazing Cate Blanchett as Kate Hepburn. I'm just amazed she pulled this almost impossible task off the way she did.. No wonder she won an Oscar for it! All the rest of the cast is quite good too. (I especially loved my main man Alec Baldwin as the sneaky Pan Am Chief.. Go Alec!). The only problem I had happens 2/3 of the way through, with Hughes' dementia getting progressively worse. I think that segment could've been trimmed down somewhat. Finally, I just love the in-joke that no one seems have picked up on with the throwaway line about the preview of Lon Chaney's 'London After Midnight', which is a classically 'lost' film, and a film Scorsese is nuts about, so that was interesting.",7
21 October 2005,"""I got six turnin' n four burnin !""","I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",3
29 December 2004,Holy Cow,"Normally when I see a movie I will tell myself ""wow, such and such and actor is really good at that part"" ... this time, no. While watching ""The Aviator"" I saw performances that transcended the roles that they were playing. Leonardo Di Caprio WAS Howard Hughes: I lost track of the fact that he was an actor and not Mr. Hughes himself. I have never seen OCD played out so well --- and I see it every day in a member of my family. Cate Blanchett WAS Katherine Hepburn --- she had come back to life in that theatre and on that screen in no better tribute than could be imagined. They both happened to be in a movie on the screen in front of me and playing parts... and blew me away. I felt that I was watching a newsreel at times --- it was so REAL it was spooky with the casting and the costumes. (A9lthough if you blink you will miss Gwen Stefani!)

Is the movie genius? Maybe. It is long and tedious at times but you cannot fault the acting ... Howard Hughes' descent into madness did not happen overnight, nor did his career in aviation or the movie industry.

A definite movie to see ... an epic film on so many levels: just bring a cushion to sit on.",9
24 January 2005,"Fly Away, Fly Away","The Aviator is a good movie. and I guess what upsets me is that It should have been a GREAT MOVIE. It stumbles and falls so far away from Greatness that it leaves me yearning for the great movie that it could have been.

I'm not gonna repeat the plot, it's a basic bio-pic, in which Leonardo DeCaprio SHINES as Howard Hughes. It's his performance that holds the movie together.

If anything, I find most fault in the SCREENPLAY by JOHN LOGAN which was LAZY and un-layered. In John Logan's world people just don't suffer complexities, they fall easily into Hollywood archetypes --- the fighter, the dreamer, the risk-taker, each of these Howard Hughes get a scene. But none of these traits come together to give him a three-dimensional personality. John Logan is a good writer, he can spin a good line, but he can't string together plot, or character complexities to save his life.

Martin Scorcese is a master, YES. Goodfella's was AWESOME, I even loved, THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, one of my favorite films. But with Gangs of New York, and The Aviator, he seems to be trying to HARD. Martin Scorcese is a MASTER, YES, but in The Aviator he is not masterful. He does not strive to give us a great film. just a great looking film.

The idea of a RICH MAN with a DREAM that goes on to make his Dream happen in itself is not very exciting. I mean, he is after all A RICH MAN, it's very easy to make your DREAMS COME TRUE when you have all those resources. So, his fears, his phobias, and his psyche, all the things that would have made a great bio-pic are in the end only merely mentioned and never fully explored and this is why the film never delivers on its promise.

All in all, The Aviator, however, still works. It has very little emotional impact. But damn, it's sure a pretty picture to look at.",4
29 May 2005,Hughes life does not lend itself to film.,"Three biopics were nominated for the Best Picture of 2005: Finding Neverland, Ray, and The Aviator. After seeing both Finding Neverland and Ray--which were well made films with an appropriate story arc--I expected similar quality in The Aviator. Boy, was I disappointed.

Howard Hughes certainly led an interesting life. But by failing to focus upon a particular area of his life, this film was ultimately a meandering, bloated mess. Screenwriter Logan attempted to piece together several stories from the middle third of Hughes life into a coherent story. He failed. There was no discernible theme in this overlong, frequently dull movie. And whatever talents Scorsese may have as a director, they do not lie in storytelling.

On the upside, the acting was superb across the board. The film looks glorious, especially during the in-flight shots. And several of the narratives worked well enough as stand-alones--especially the Pan Am vs. TWA battle.

But ultimately, this movie simply does not work. There is too much material for the time (even at 2 hours and 40 minutes). And it lacked the grand unifying theme or story arc it needed. Rent if you must, but don't get your hopes up.",4

31 May 2005,Too big and bloated to really get airborne. Like that plane.,"Like the ""Spruce Goose"" or ""Hercules"" as it was called, this film just cannot soar to the heights its makers intended. Though a great-looking picture, and full of great performers, the film is too long and lacks any truly gripping moments. Leonardo DiCaprio cannot sell me on the fact that he is Howard Hughes, nor did Scorsese sell me on his need to tell the story.

The Aviator is the story of eccentric filmmaker, inventor, and playboy Howard Hughes. After an early snippet from his childhood (which is never properly explained) we see him attempt to make an epic film with his own money involving hundreds of planes, actors, and a lot of cameras. The parts of the film dealing with Hughes the filmmaker are some of its finest moments. We see his obsession with perfection and his own vision triumph when everyone else around him plays the part of naysayer. By the second half of the film, we mostly see Hughes battle to save TWA airlines from a dirty senator and the owner of Pan Am. We also see Hughes become increasingly paralyzed and anti-social due to his fear of germs and human contact. Strangely enough, he is scared to death of things like a speck of lint on a colleague's clothes, yet he'll apparently jump in the sack with any young woman he sees. That inconsistency of his character is not fully explained to the extent I would have liked to have seen. The film concludes with Hughes repeating a line of dialog into a mirror like a broken record after finally getting his giant plane to fly around for a while.

Honestly, this film is no more helpful in providing an explanation of Hughes than any one-hour documentary on the History Channel could have been. His affairs are not that interesting, nor is his battle with the senator. His time sequestered in a screening room urinating in those milk bottles was intriguing, but not much of a payoff comes from it. The Howard Hughes this film presents us with seems normal in one scene, then merely functional in the next, then downright looney a few minutes later. The film really doesn't go to great lengths to explain any of it, though.

One word about DiCaprio... This guy just doesn't have it yet. Maybe some day he will, but all the accolades he got from this performance are simply not justified. He never once made me believe he was Howard Hughes. I know he doesn't physically look the real guy, but that shouldn't matter. Anthony Hopkins doesn't look a thing like Nixon, yet by the end of that film, I truly believed he was our 37th(?) president. I could much sooner believe Cate Blanchett as Hepburn, or even Jude Law as Errol Flynn for that matter. Scorsese has used DiCaprio in his last two big budget films, and I don't think it payed off in either. I don't know, maybe Scorsese is the problem, but that is far less-likely. The film may have received 11 Oscar nominations, but the box office figures don't lie. It will need huge rental numbers to break even.

5 of 10 stars for The Aviator.

Better luck next time for Scorsese. The Hound has spoken on this matter.",5
7 February 2005,The Aviator,"The Aviator, is based on the true life story of Howard Hughes. Howard Hughes, was very eccentric and he directed such films as Hell's Angels and Scarface. Howard, had a lot of money so he founded his own aircraft company where he would design and build aircrafts. He even broke a couple of speed records with some of his aircrafts. Howard, also dated a lot of women including actress Katharine Hepburn, and later in his life he lived mostly in a hotel room running his business from there. The Aviator, has good direction, a good script, good performances by everyone involved (especially Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Howard Hughes), good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction, good set decoration and good costume design. The film is made by director Martin Scorsese, who I like very much as a filmmaker but I wasn't very impressed with his last film Gangs Of New York. Martin Scorsese, makes up for that film with this one. The Aviator, is entertaining, well made, is very good visually, is interesting, compelling, Leonardo DiCaprio gives an Oscar worth performance, the film is enthralling, the film is stylish, a good character study, gives us another Oscar worthy performance by Cate Blanchett who plays Katharine Hepburn and is just a very compelling and excellently made film from it's acting down to it's in detail production design. I would have liked to have known a little bit more facts about Howard Hughes, and his life but that is only a small complaint and I was very pleased with the rest of this film.

7 July 2005,So So,"I'm giving this movie a ""5"" out of generosity to my Spielberg of counterculture, Martin Scorcese. I'm also taking into consideration that Dicapiro, despite this atrocity, has done Gilbert Grape and Gangs of New York  a casting situation I laughed at the same way I laughed at the casting for Silence of the Lambs.

It's an episodic mess, but since Scorcese has more to offer the world in perspective than any priest or diplomat than I've ever met, I'm going to be lax. The way I see it this is Scorcese's Nixon. I don't think it will end his career since he always comes back with something Anyway, my point is Scorcese has more to offer this world than most people and if he does a duck ever now and then we have to suck it up and what for him to get his thing together and give us the good stuff.

16 January 2005,Big Disappointment - Don't believe the hype,"This film is a big disappointment considering the first rate director, cast and crew. It is an over rated and over hyped grandstanding of a big name, Howard Hughes. What is it with great directors when they get a little too successful? They seem to throw away all the good film-making traits that made them great. The problem is the story - there isn't one. But, gee, the cinematography is so pretty, isn't it. This screenplay is pretty much a rip off of Charlie Kauffman's Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. Confessions was ten times better than The Aviator. Now that is how a biography should be filmed. There is no clear story in the Aviator. Of course, this is common for true stories when you want to avoid unnecessary dramatization. But, you would think a genius like Scorsese would pull it off. He does well with keeping things moving for three hours - but the story is lacking. Then again, that may be a Scorsese style. But, it doesn't work here. There was a great opportunity to play with Hughes' psychosis, much like Clooney and Kauffman did in Confessions, and Scorsese made a feeble attempt at it here. But, he gets off track and the psychosis is lost as a very small subplot - even an after thought. The result is a story line that goes all over the place and stays with nothing for very long. Well, that's my first impression, anyway.

Nonetheless, despite my rant here, I find this an excellent film. It is compelling. Maybe it's because we know it's based on a real person's life. There's something compelling about stories based on true events. After seeimg this film numerous times over, I added this paragraph instead of retracting my initial statement. Usiually seeing a film over and over makes you tired of seeing it. But this one grows on you. Yes, the Hollywood marketing hype played up the film, which seemed like a lot of hype itself, probably because it's about Hollywood and larger than life characters. So, I don't blame my initial disappointment on Scorsese od DiCapprio. They did a fine job of reflecting what Hughes and his world were all about. It's the reality itself that's somewhat disappointing I guess. That's the trouble with reality. It's just not dramatically focused enough.",9
27 December 2004,Stop trying to sell us this crap!,"I swear every time a Miramax picture comes out in December I hear things like ""masterpiece"",""genius"",""Oscar-worthy"". Well, guess what! AVIATOR IS NONE OF THESE THINGS.Hype, hype and more hype, more like. Just because you spent 100 million dollars on making it and advertising doesn't mean it's any good. I know that guys try so hard to sell us the idea of Leo DiCaprio being the best actor this year but I just found the whole experience embarrassing beyond belief.He is HOPELESSLY miscast as Hughes.

Scorcese could be the biggest sell -out in history for all I know. In fact I don't even feel like watching any of his great films again after this disaster. Now go get your f..... Oscar, Marty!

31 December 2004,"A truly smashing, psychologically bound blockbuster","Martin Scorsese strikes again with a powerful cast and expert crew, but the subject matter is what really got me into the grip of The Aviator. Scorsese and writer John Logan focus, of course, on the prime of the life of Howard Hughes, a kind of c.f. Kane with airplanes and movies substituting for the newspapers. While Scorsese dives right into his technical mastery, Logan dives into the private life of Hughes as well as the public. As a kind of 'golden-age of Hollywood' production the film hearkens back to the greatness from the old days, but also taking on a subject that is a tough one to take on- Hughes' obsessive compulsive nature. On the outside to the public he does go like this to a degree- spending millions on his air epic Hell's Angels, going past the limit of what to spend on planes for the second world war (and ""the Hercules"" which the press dubbed the ""Spruce Goose""), and with women. But on the inside, he gradually became a full-blown germaphobe, repeating words, and locking himself in a room at one point and not coming out (this would later be what many remembered him for, the notoriously reclusive Billionair hermit of the 20th century).

With Scorsese's outstanding cinematographer Robert Richardson, experimenting with different touches of light and composition, and with his veteran editor Thelma Schoonmaker (partly responsible for the immediately recognizable pace and style in Scorsese's films), they get into the mind of someone like Hughes better than any other film I may have ever seen. It's often kinetic, focusing on the smallest things, and going (appropriately) sometimes like an Olver Stone film. Although Gangs of New York, Scorsese's previous epic, contained a good pace, I may have not seen one as intense and effective since Casino. Adding to this is Dante Ferreti, one of the greatest of all production designers, giving life to all of the locations in the film.

Most surprising, and satisfying, is that the acting is better than expected, or at least topping expectations. Di Caprio, who was the originator of bringing Hughes' life to the screen (he also has an executive producer credit), dashes off any minor doubts I had that he could pull it off. He can be a superb actor, engaging fully a character (What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Gangs, and Basketball Diaries being good examples), and sometimes not (Titanic, Catch Me if You Can). This time, he hits it right on the head, giving (though it's never a big deal for me who wins or loses) an Oscar caliber performance. By the time the story and Hughes swing deeper into his disease, before and following a tragic, heart-racing plane accident, he finds all of the touches to make Hughes believable, flaws and all. It certainly is, along with it being the convincing take on o.c.d. technically, the finest portrayal of someone with it. But even greater is that he finds the notes when with his co-stars.

There is Cate Blanchett (as if not more terrific than Di Caprio) as Katherine Hepburn, Hughes' love interest for about ten years. Something of an eccentric character herself, but also very down to earth, Blanchett doesn't skip a beat in finding her own voice within the star. There are also parts like John C. Reilly, Hughes' financial adviser (and part father-figure), Alan Alda, a senator who brings Hughes forward to be questioned in a public committee, Alec Baldwin as Hughes' 'foe' Juan Trippe, and so on. Even for an actress like Kate Beckinsale, who I feared would be hardly worthy to fill a role like Ava Gardner, the environment Scorsese gives to them is very natural considering the Hollywood backdrop.

It's always tricky calling one film the best of the year. Many other films that came out this year were big contenders for such a somewhat pretentious title. It could be appropriate for one to say that The Aviator, while not one of Scorsese's best, is one of the best Hollywood productions of the year. At the least, if only from my perspective, it delivers a Scorsese film where he takes a risk at a subject he doesn't know too much about (aviation, though he didn't know much about boxing either for Raging Bull) and runs with the people in the film, reaching for a height some might feel he can't really take.

29 January 2005,The best American film since Citizen Kane,"A rare uniformity of talent and intelligence was brought to this project. John Logan's script is based on primary source research and reveals Hughes' character in a sequence of carefully deployed scenes that embody this in the context of the national hysteria (mania), which characterized the US from the end of of the 14-18 war through WW11. His seeming debilitating neuroses find a perfect psychiatric logic in that he sees the outer world as something which may come between him and his dream..a very rational view. The timing of his psychic crises always came as his dreams were most in peril and served the purpose of isolating him, protecting him from negative forces. His bacteriaphobia was symbolic and useful.

Leonardo Dicaprio (whose project this originally was) is astounding in his vision of Hughes and his realization of it. Again, Logan has provided the right words in the right place to carry this through. Cate Blanchett's Hepburn further confirms this actress's brilliance. She knows that an accent, a pattern of speech, are part and parcel of character and she portrayed this with an intelligent vibrancy seldom seen on the screen today. The supporting cast was uniformly excellent.

Scorsese had now made a great American film, his subject a very difficult one, but he shows the greatness of Howard Hughes, his flaws and debilities intertwined with his astounding abilities and imaginatively demonstrates them as inseparable and dynamically necessary.

The cinematography is the capstone of this achievement, just as it was in Welles' Citizen Kane. Combined with the editing, this is a visual as well as a textual masterpiece.",10
20 May 2005,Smear Campaign,"One would expect a movie about Howard Hughes with Aviator as the main word in its title would be about Howard Hughes and his accomplishments in aviation.

And one would be wrong.

Spending far too much time on Hughes's eccentricities, this film appears to be an attempt to explore psychosis more than anything else. Depicted to the point of hyperbole, the man's difficulties are slathered over this stylish and vacuous portrayal.

Meanwhile, the tale of Hughes Aviation is relegated to stage dressing punctuated by a few instances of genuinely exciting feats.

If you have any knowledge of the history of Hughes Aircraft or the man behind it, you will be disappointed.

Perhaps most indicative of the lack of real interest this movie has in aviation is the simple failure to accurately depict even the most basic concepts of flying. If you throw the stick forward, the plane will not go faster, it will nose over and crash into the ground.

This movie throws the stick forward.",4
13 February 2005,Aviator Wins Bafta and Tipped For Oscar? - Everybody Panic!,"I'm all for technical excellence in my movies, but no amount of ""consumate professionalism"" can redeem this dull, dull fare. Moreover, the fact that it won the coveted BAFTA fills this writer with dismay. It's one thing blaming the praise already heaped upon this dry and soulless piece of movie-making upon the stupidities of ""Hollywood"" (cf. last year's win for the essentially ephemeral LOTR 3 and that vacuous gaudy bauble Chicago in 2003), but when the UK homeland industry movers and shakers give it the Big Gong, it really is time to panic.

I saw the movie last night merely to see the Dicaprio and Blanchett performances and to check out the whole thing in the light of impending awards and got less than I expected. To start with, Howard Hughes was off my radar aside from ""Howard Hughes smiling at the majorettes smoking Winston cigarettes"" line from Genesis' The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway (1974), and one does like to keep abreast of history. But considering the fellow had such an interesting life it was some sort of ""triumph"" of Scorsese and whoever turned in the script to present us with effortlessly one of the most boring movies I have ever paid cash to see. Though illuminated by Blanchett (and cheered enormously to see mon hero de musique, Rufus Wainwright in the early moments), the thing collapses in the last hour or so pretty much completely as a piece of drama. The lack of care in terms of narrative presentation was truly shocking, I thought. In short, what drama? Where dramatic tension? This by the end was a film dying on its arse. And then one has to contemplate its triumph over infinitely better films last night: Vera Drake is inferior to The Aviator in British judgement? I can only imagine that many of the voters were pulling for Raging Bull and Goodfellas and hadn't even seen the film they were nominally voting for: in effect, this has to have been a vote for Scorsese.

What an utter travesty.

30 January 2005,"Good, but not Great","This was a good movie - well put together and well acted. BUT ... I don't get all the buzz. Is it because it's another epic? Is it because Scorcese is due? I don't think those are valid reasons for a movie to be considered Oscar worthy.

The best part of the movie for me was Cate Blanchett. Katherine Hepburn is my all time favorite actress and I think that Blanchett's stunning portrayal of her should earn her an Oscar.

What I did like about this movie was the historical aspects of it. I liked learning more about Hughes, especially his earlier days. But I don't believe it deserves ""Best Picture"". It was way too long (I nearly fell asleep in some places). I like to be moved by a film. I want to leave the theater and say ""Wow!"" I didn't with this one.

24 June 2007,Nominated for 11 Academy Awards? Did the Academy even WATCH this film?,"I rented this film after hearing a lot of praise for it. However, I had high hopes that were never realised. To be blunt, it was painful to watch.

This film is one of the most boring movies I have ever watched. In fact, I stopped it after less than an hour to take a suddenly-desired nap. After resuming, I kept looking at the clock wondering how much longer I was going to have to sit through the film. I have no problem with lengthy films, as long as the story can maintain the attention span. And, a film doesn't have to be action-packed to do that. ""Patton"" and ""Ray"" are great examples of long, biographical films that keep the audience interested.

Granted, I did learn a little about Mr Hughes (as most film biographies intend to do). A lot of his personal issues were presented, but nothing came of them. Most of the film built the background for the Senate Committee hearing, but that hearing itself was shown for about 15 minutes and the outcome was not known. What was the point of even bringing it up? As an aside note, I found it funny how the Maine Senator heading the committee looked a bit like Vice President Dick Cheney. Coincidence? Or did Mr Scorsese try to make another Hollywood political statement? I just couldn't wait until this film was over. But, I was surprised at the abrupt ending. One minute you are watching this guy go through another OCD attack, the next you are watching the credits. I thought ""What? It's over just like that?"" but reminded myself to be grateful my suffering had ended.

This movie sucked.",2
11 November 2009,"""Come in with the milk""","I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",10
20 March 2020,CB is simply sublime.,"At first, I was not so impressed with Cate's performance cause I found it a little bit too dramatic but as the story unfolds, she started to shine. Leo also delivers a solid performance.

6 January 2005,Should be titled 'dirty rotten movie',"This was the longest, dumbest movie I've seen in years. There was no plot worth mentioning and whoever cast a very young 20 year old as the mature Howard Hughes without providing any aging makeup was an idiot. The entire cast (excepting Alan Alda) reminded me of little kids dressed up in their parents clothes playing 'adult' (badly). The 'special effects' were noteworthy for being totally unrealistic and the acting was non-existent in most cases. Alan Alda was the only adult in a featured role with all the rest of the older cast portrayed by a very youthful cast. This movie was made for teeny-boppers with a crush on DiCapprio, who should be limited to only those movies requiring a pretty face: preferably without any dialog required.

29 January 2009,"Long biopic, good Leo but great Cate","This is a long but fascinating take on the early life of the billionaire aviator, oil man and TWA owner Howard Hughes. Leo is fine in the lead although he looks too young, but its Cate Blanchett playing Katharine Hepburn who steals the show. She owns the screen whenever she makes an appearance and won a richly deserved Oscar. Kate Beckinsale is miscast as Ava Gardner. The rest of the cast are fine. The film takes a sympathetic view of Hughes as it depicts him fighting to control his sanity, even as he is being questioned by the Govt. for alleged improprieties. Some of the scenes detailing Hughes' Obsesive Compulsive condition go on too long and serve little purpose in the script.

Overall 7/10

16 December 2004,Dos not show all the true facts,"Over all it is a good film but it does not show all the true facts about Howard Hughes. Hughes was supposedly bisexual and had an affair with Randolph Scott and Cary Grant. This is has been avoided as a plague in the film. It is sad to see that Hollywood always tries to change or hide the facts about a persons sexuality especially when it comes to homosexuality. The best example is Richard Burton's Alexander the great where he was shown to be straight as an arrow (ha, ha, what a bunch load of lies). I am not a gay activist but sincerely feel that true facts are most of the times never shown by Hollywood. Leo and Cate Blanchett have done a great job though. Despite the complete truth not shown about the legend in the film it is good and worth watching once 6/10. Talking about the Oscars, I feel that Jamie Fox deserves it over Leo for Ray. Jamie was superb as Ray. He was Ray and not Jamie Fox. I am sorry to say that at many places in the film Leo behaves like the super star Leonardo Di Caprio and not Hughes. But amongst the actresses, Blanchett rightly deserves the Oscar. She is absolutely superb as the legendary Hepburn. Her voice, mannerisms, body language, wow! guys, this is what great acting is!! Absolutely brilliant.",1

21 January 2008,"""I care very much about aviation.""","Considering he is often heralded as one of the finest directors ever to work in Hollywood, I find it rather surprising to discover that my experience with Martin Scorsese is embarrassingly limited. Outside of his all-time classics {'Taxi Driver (1976),' 'Raging Bull (1980)'}, the enjoyable 'The King of Comedy (1983)' and the interesting but uneven 'Gangs of New York (2002),' I had seen very little from the famed director. 'The Aviator (2004)' was a film about which I was very enthusiastic, as glossy biopics are a favourite sub-genre of mine, and its success at the 2005 Academy Awards {5 wins from 11 nominations} suggested that this film was a type specimen. Unfortunately, Scorsese's biopic of Howard Hughes proves a bit too ""glossy"" for its own good, though there are certainly multiple moments of brilliance amid the fast-moving 170 minutes of skyward drama. Leonardo DiCaprio, finally breaking free of that ""baby-faced"" persona that had clung to him throughout his career, is impeccable as notorious film producer, aviator and billionaire, whose mental deterioration and descent into reclusiveness is well-documented in history.

'The Aviator' opens in 1927, with a young Howard Hughes directing his first ambitious motion picture, the epic war-time aviation drama, 'Hell's Angels (1930)' {a film that I'm now determined to track down}. Despite countless setbacks, and an expanding budget that stretches into the millions, Hughes is determined to complete his film, whatever the cost. It is in these opening scenes that 'The Aviator' truly hits its stride, and the remainder of the film struggles to keep up; being a director himself, Scorsese obviously delights in retelling an epic film-making tale, and some slick {if not entirely convincing} visual effects help to capture the sheer majesty of Hughe's vision  I think that it would have been even more charming for the film to have created these aerial scenes using the same tools that were available in the 1920s {however, there were obvious safety considerations, considering three pilots died during the making of 'Hell's Angels'}. The remainder of the film concerns Hughes' fascination with aviation, his company's tussle with Pan American Airlines, his various female liaisons, and his struggle with obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Though he is still perhaps too young to correctly portray a man reaching his forties, Leonardo DiCaprio {in his second collaboration with Scorsese} is excellent in the film's leading role, successfully capturing Hughes' eccentric personality and his OCD-afflicted symptoms. Of course, the film is arguably stolen by Cate Blanchett {in an Oscar-winning role}, who faultlessly channels the spirit of Katharine Hepburn, mimicking her well-recognised tone of voice, mannerisms and general demeanour. Kate Beckinsale {Ava Gardner}, Gwen Stefani {Jean Harlow} and Jude Law {Errol Flynn} also do their best at playing popular Hollywood figures, but these three pale in comparison with Blanchett's epic portrayal. Also memorable in 'The Aviator' are John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Ian Holm, and especially Alan Alda {of TV's ""M*A*S*H""}, who plays a senator allegedly in the pocket of Howard Hughes' greatest rival, Pan Am owner Juan Trippe.",7
30 December 2004,There could have been a lesson to this movie,"There could have been a lesson to this movie. Instead, the whole painful three hours skirted around it, whitewashing a truth that was far more interesting than this odd portrait of Howard Hughes.

In his prime, Howard Hughes was 6'4"" tall and strong: a strapping man. When he died, he weighed 93 pounds. One of the striking images of my youth, was that of this shriveled, white-bearded little human being carried to the car by his bodyguard. Howard Hughes had become a tiny, grotesque, skeletal puppet.

Watching ""The Aviator"" was not unlike the tour of Graceland, the home of Elvis Presley. In both places, we are treated to a view of the eccentric and wonderful genius, but something is left out.

And that thing, is the drugs.

Yes, Hughes was obsessive-compulsive, germ-phobic to a point of the bizarre, but his paranoias were increased, honed, finally made all-encompassing by something far more understandable  his drug addiction.

Howard Hughes did indeed have the enormous plane wreck that's depicted mid-way through ""The Aviator."" The amount of morphine, codeine, and goodness knows what else that would have been necessary to treat that much burn tissue, broken ribs, and collapsed lung, would make an addict out of anyone. Add a compulsive and addictive personality, and all the money in the world, and it's not hard to understand what happened to Hughes.

What is hard to understand, is why that wasn't in Scorsese's movie.

In one interesting scene, we see Ava Gardner reappear in Hughes' life to get him ready to appear before a congressional hearing. Hughes had locked himself in his movie studio, and then in a wing of his mansion, refusing to touch anything, delusional, insane. In scriptwriter John Logan's version, Gardner shaves him, cleans him up, gives him a pep talk, and this cures his insanity and he's ready to go head to head with the United States Senate.

This makes no sense, of course. And how much more sense, how much more interesting and valuable an episode could this have been, if we saw what seems far more likely: that what Gardner did, was truly to ""clean him up."" She got him sober. She put him back together, straightening him out just long enough that he could face something other than his drug-strengthened demons.

There are great bits in this movie, strong parts that contribute to the tragedy of this movie's inevitable vacuousness. Cate Blanchett's impersonation of Katherine Hepburn is so spot-on that it's funny, and finally even touching. When a film is released in December, you know that they're shooting for Oscars, and this one is surely aimed at getting a nomination for DiCaprio, but he's miscast. Hughes by all accounts was large, terse, intense, and DiCaprio is too energetic and boyish for this mature role. The camera and visual direction are lovely, if too long. The aviation scenes are fabulous.

OK, so perhaps a defense of ""The Aviator"" would go like this: this movie wasn't supposed to be about drugs. It was about Hughes in a few years of his life when he was directing movies and changing the world of aviation, which he surely and undoubtedly did. It's about the congressional investigation and his start into the world of madness. Presenting the drugs would have made it, finally, a picture about an addict, instead of about an aviator.

If so, then the my-mom-told-me-germs-are-bad didn't need the massive play it got. The mental illness it too central to the entire picture. Personality disorder is the driving force of ""The Aviator,"" and it's wrong.

That defense doesn't work, furthermore, when the movie claims to be a biography, and anyway the essence needn't be ""Howard Hughes in Trainspotting."" If ""The Aviator's"" Hughes had, locked in his studio, taken some pills just once; if Ava Gardner had shown up in his mansion and thrown away the prescription bottles; these small gestures would have made the point about the truth without becoming a preachy anti-drug lecture. Instead, it made up a fiction.

By the end of this film, I practically wanted to stand up and shout at the entire audience, ""He was a drug addict! When he died, he weighed 90 pounds! What is this nonsense?"" Instead, I just left, and returned home to look up one glowing review after another on the internet. One of Time Magazine's reviewers has put it on the top of his ""Best"" list for 2004. Time Magazine was the one that had that famous picture of the shriveled and near-death Hughes on its cover, in 1976. (http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,1101761213,00.html)

Removing the drugs from the lives of Howard Hughes, and Elvis Presley, is not a virtuous whitewash that allows us to retain our heroes. Rather, it loses the value of the tragedy. When I was a high school teacher, I could look kids in the eye who were starting to experiment and say to them: ""Look at the people lying on the street in their stupors, and ask yourself: 'How many of these people thought they were going to become addicts?' The answer is none. 'How many of them thought, as you do, ""That won't happen to me. I'm different. I can take it or leave it as I wish""?' The answer is all of them. They're just like you.""

Addiction could happen to hard-working, generous, perspicacious, brilliant men such as Howard Hughes, and Elvis Presley. And look what it did to them. This story would have been a far, far more interesting, compelling, and honest film, than this look-at-the-nutcase bit of Hollywood tinsel.

Instead, this movie does something that Hughes, himself, might very well have appreciated, something that he did while in Hollywood. It told a story full of pretty faces and dishonesty: one that didn't make very much sense.

Perhaps there was a lesson to this movie, after all.",3
18 June 2020,The Academic Definition of a Cinematic Biopic,"There is something peculiar and special about Martin Scorsese's biopics that stood way out of your average biopics. Scorsese's main focus in making a biopic is not to just pay homage to the figure he is attributing to or just laying out events after events, but he makes it into a character study. It is the same greatness he puts into Raging Bull and The Wolf of Wall Street. In this seminal work, we the audience explore the life of Howard Hughes and his battle with obsessive-compulsive disorder - a very serious mental illness. As well as shows his character's rise and fall as a billionaire as he strives in life in amidst of the struggles and challenges from his mental illness.

One of the most fascinating things about this picture is the technical achievement of it, particularly the cinematography. The story behind it is Scorsese's reminiscence of watching films of the era when he was a child, and he wanted to translate that color techniques in modern filmmaking context. Phenomenal work by cinematographer Robert Richardson who successfully imitates the early American Technicolor dye-transfer process to replicate the vintage look. The cinematography is an evolving color, with two-strip and then three-strip and then modern. All of which is reflective of the period of the time it depicts. Additionally, the films' use of color alteration in every situation, emotion, production design, costumes, and make-up are all used in a very very purposeful way to transcend the depth and meaning through all that. And that is the beauty of a Martin Scorsese picture.

Now one cannot praise this picture without acknowledging the two elephants in the room: the acting performances by Leo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett. This is my personal favorite Leo DiCaprio's performance for the way he just throws himself into the role with a lot of flexibility and portraying the essential emotions of Howard Hughes so intricately. Cate Blanchett is my second favorite actress ever, I never thought she could nail Katherine Hepburn's accent and mannerism like that. She truly truly pays tribute to the great Katherine Hepburn herself. Cate Blanchett has pulled off many amazing performances over the years, as Queen Elizabeth I, Katherine Hepburn, Bob Dylan. If that is not range, I'm sorry but I don't know what is.

Overall, Scorsese's biopics are always more than just a documentary or an average biopic, he always ventures deep into the psychology and emotion of the character and not just events after events. Scorsese's films will be studied for years and forevermore.",8
12 February 2007,Over-over rated waste of time,"This is supposedly about the life of Howard Hughes, a tall thin man who I met a couple of times. There have been better movies made about his life than this. This one is not very accurate and the casting is bad.

Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't resemble Howard Hughes in the least and never really captures his character. Even worse is Cate Blanchett playing the part of Katherine Hepburn. Hepburn was a rail thin beauty with a special marvelous voice and Blanchett is just the opposite, unattractive, average build, and with nothing special about her. The way she played Hepburn was a travesty, particularly to Hepburn fans. But then the relationship between Hughes and Hepburn was fictional and never really happened as shown in the movies.

The movie focuses on Hughes' foibles but for the most part they are overemphasized or taken out of context or even contrived. Hughes' life was a long and complex story which unfortunately is too abbreviated in the movie, such as omitting his marriage to Jean Peters",3
4 November 2010,Enthralling movie,"This is a great movie. I think I probably enjoyed it more because I did not know two things - (1) I didn't know much about Howard Hughes and (2) I didn't know that Martin Scorsese directed the movie.

The acting by Leonardo diCaprio in the lead role is fantastic. He is a very good actor and totally dominates this movie. The only guy that comes close to him is Alec Baldwin as the boss of PanAm.

Scorsese very cleverly weaves in some hints about Howard Hughes' mental problems early on in the movie, including what appears to be obsessive compulsive disorder. It was quite remarkable that a person with such health problems was able to achieve so much.

There are some excellent scenes in the movie. The lunch scene with Katherine Hepburn and her family is very memorable as is the scene before the Congressional committee. There are also some humorous scenes such as his defence of Jane Russell's mammaries in the movie The Outlaw.

While the movie is quite long, I would have liked to see the movie continue to the end of his life. However, from what I understand of Howard Hughes' later years, it may have been quite difficult to film given how erratic his behaviour became.",8
8 January 2005,Scorsese is on form with this exciting biopic,"The Aviator traces the life of millionaire businessman, film producer, film director, and aviator, Howard Hughes, paying particular attention to his middle years as a record-breaking aviator and movie mogul.

With nearly three hours of viewing time, The Aviator has quite a lot for your money's worth. Fortunately, most of it is gripping enough to keep you fascinated to the very last frame. Scorsese seems to have documented much of Hughes life very accurately, focussing on his exciting involvement in aeroplanes and film-making, rather than the murkier world of his behind the scenes involvement in politics, and stopping before he gets too bogged down with Howard Hughes the weird recluse.

With a host of stars, Leonardo DiCaprio pulls off the title role admirably, the likes of Kate Beckinsale (as Ava Gardner), John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, and Ian Holm all put in good work, and the delightful cameos of Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow and Jude Law as Errol Flynn keep things moving nicely; but the show-stealer for me was re-creation of screen legend Katharine Hepburn by Cate Blanchett, whose character comes as a vibrant breath of fresh air against a backdrop of fairly right-wing, power-seeking individuals.

In The Aviator, Scorsese has found a subject who is nothing if not interesting. Howard Hughes set revolutions rippling through Hollywood, making - at the time - the most expensive movie ever produced, and his attention to detail is one that Scorsese perhaps admires and even successfully emulates. As an aviator, Hughes pioneered new engineering techniques with almost fanatical zeal, not only breaking most known airspeed records but introducing along the way countersunk rivets and retractable landing gear to reduce wind resistance and so make planes go faster. His own involvement was charismatic  he would fly the planes himself, often risking life and limb, whether to test new prototypes or, even in earlier years, to do dangerous stunts in his films. His brushes with the censors (he created the half-cup bra for his protégé Jane Russell) add further colour to what was already an over-the-top lifestyle, and the fact that he often actually succeeded, even when taking on big business or the government, prevent him from being dismissed as a mere playboy.

Howard Hughes also had some sort of mental aberration, expressing itself as phobias to obsessive behaviour, but the film manages to suggest, to me at least, that his illness may even have helped him towards greatness rather than making him accept and adapt to a more normal level of achievement. But as is often the case with Scorsese, there is no underlying philosophising, no artistic flights of fancy, no deep questions asked or answered. What we do have is good story-telling, and it would perhaps be a bit mean and overcritical to say the result is a bit flat or unimaginative.

As traditional Big Picture movie making goes, The Aviator is a success, and will no doubt garner many awards and delight audiences for years to come.",7
26 January 2005,Disregard the bashing,"I have to say I completely disagree with almost everything Yessdanc, for one, felt about this movie; I barely hesitate to say he/she seemed to want to find problems in the performances. I think Leonardo DiCaprio is great in general, but I honestly didn't expect to be as impressed by him (in this film) as the awards voters have been. However, his performance was absolutely fantastic. Howard Hughes was an amazingly complex individual, and DiCaprio made his every eccentric move plausible and real. He studied Hughes well and got amazing depth into his psyche. The accolades are deserved. As for Cate Blanchett seeming like a caricature, maybe -- but only in the sense that Katharine Hepburn herself was kind of like a caricature. Again, the performance was over-the-top only in a way that resembled Hepburn's constantly over-the-top personality. Many actresses would have to cower in shame trying to imitate the late, great Hepburn, but Blanchett did it naturally and without apology. Kudos to her as well. As for the film in general, it's wonderful. At 2 hours and some 40 minutes, it might lag for some, but the material is deep and true, while the acting and directing are heartfelt and energetic. It's a story well told, and it might even get you looking up a little history after the credits.",8
27 January 2005,Disappointing,"The story was interesting and the cinematography was excellent. Scorcese did a good job of accurately relating many of the events of Hughes' life. My disappointment was in the casting. DiCaprio looked and acted juvenile. I thought I was watching Titanic again. Hughes was 6'4'' and rangy. Leo looked nothing like Hughes. I felt he looked like a little boy, and sounded like a young Tom Cruise. He looks less than his age anyway, and he certainly didn't look anything close to the 41 that Hughes was in 1947. He tried hard, but was just miscast. Cate Blanchett gave her all as Hepburn, but in my view, was over the top. Jude Law looked little like the tall and powerful Flynn, and his accent was extreme. Gwen Stefani, at 35, looked her age and certainly nothing like Jean Harlow in her early 20s. I thought Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin were OK in their supporting parts.

10 September 2009,Good insight into the demons that plagued Howard Hughes,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",8
2 January 2005,Absorbing biography of a troubled aviator,"Even though a lot of viewers were disappointed with this movie, I enjoyed it. It was a thoroughly absorbing biography of a brilliant, but mentally ill, aviator, innovator and filmmaker. The scenes of the Hollywood nightclubs and film sets in the 1920s, 30s and 40s were interesting and vividly recreated that glamorous, excting world. Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job of depicting Hughes' charm, brilliance and creepiness. Cate Blanchett was wonderful as Katherine Hepburn, and Kate Beckinsale was good as Ava Gardner. The film isn't perfect. Some more information about Hughes' childhood (i..e, he was an only child, dropped out of high school, took engineering classes at Cal Tech, etc.) would have been helpful. I agree with another reviewer who said that implying that his mother caused his mental illness is unfair and inaccurate. I also agree that some of the scenes dragged on too long, especially the scenes with Katherine Hepburn. That said, it was an absorbing, well-acted and well-directed movie about a fascinating, brilliant and tragic man.

13 November 2022,A movie that shows you how creative Scorsese is at turning biographies into epic films,"A very, very, very good movie.... I can't describe the amount of fascination they felt in this movie.... This movie showed me Scorsese's creativity in taking written biographies and turning them into cinematic masterpieces that perpetuate history.... Scorsese's ability to portray the era of the twenties And the performance of Leonardo DiCaprio in the role of the pilot and director Howard Hughes was one of the most wonderful and greatest cinematic roles I have ever seen... The film is very wonderful. Cinematography was great. The camera scenes were great, and it depicts Howard, although it is just a picture, but it appeared in a legendary way... The story in general is wonderful, I am a reader Howard Hughes' biography was good, not that great, but Scorsese was very creative in filming and directing it....and even that the movie was a great success and won 5 Oscars, unlike the movie before it by Martin Scorsese, ""Gangs of New York"".... a true masterpiece 10/10 of course.

3 February 2005,Come Fly With Me in My Flying Machine.,"The life of reclusive mega-billionaire Howard Hughes (dynamite role for Leonardo DiCaprio) from his innovative film-making in Hollywood in the late-1920s to the post-World War II era where he had to legitimize his role in military aircraft aviation and governmental spending. His relationships with movie starlets (Jean Harlow, played by Gwen Stefani, Katharine Hepburn, played by Cate Blanchett, and Ava Gardner, played by Kate Beckinsale) and confrontations with bigwigs Alec Baldwin (running Pan Am Airlines) and Alan Alda (the senator who ended up bringing Hughes in front of the Congressional Committee) are imperative focal points in this tale. All this and Hughes' never-ending bout with an obsessive-compulsive/germophobia disorder are the major keys in director Martin Scorsese's ode to a highly complicated man and old-time California glitz. Wonderful turns galore (also by cameo performers Ian Holm, John C. Reilly, Willem Dafoe and Jude Law) and screenwriter John Logan's intelligent take on the material combine with all the aforementioned attributes to create a truly stunning modern-day epic that stands tall with all of Scorsese's earlier credits. With movies like this, the sky is truly the limit to its greatness. 5 stars out of 5.

21 February 2005,Hollow Eye Candy,"The Aviator. I've always considered Leonardo DiCaprio a good actor in the right role, and Martin Scorsese is one of my favorite directors. I must admit, prior to viewing The Aviator, I knew little about Howard Hughes, except for the fact that he made Hell's Angels and had a psychotic breakdown later in his life. But anyway, I had hope for this movie. Sadly, it left a lot to be desired.

The good news first; the movie was visually amazing. Scorsese and Co. did an excellent job creating the world of Hughes through a generous combination of set pieces, costumes, and CGI effects (most of which did not look phony). There are some exciting moments in The Aviator, most of them involving airplanes (shooting Hell's Angels, crashing in Beverly Hills, etc).

The bad news; the film was almost completely devoid of emotional depth, character development, and structure. This makes a big difference in a film like The Aviator. This sort of thing is what puts a film like Ray or The Elephant Man on top ten lists and sets movies like The Aviator aside from the good ones. Since the film wants us to devote our three hours (believe me, it feels far longer) towards caring about Howard Hughes, it would help a little if we could learn anything from him besides the fact that he wasn't afraid to break limits and push boundaries. I mean, the latter is slightly compelling at first, but it wears thin after a bit, and I began to grow restless for something new about Howard. Leonardo DiCaprio himself is acceptable, yet seems somewhat strained compared to other roles of his. His performance often feels one layered and thin, yet in his defense, John Logan, the screenwriter, gives him very little to work with. Cate Blanchett's accent makes you jump at first, but it also loses it's vigor and becomes two dimensional. These characters are simply animated puppets who impress you upon introduction, but leave you pining for something. There is also very little introduction to Howard himself. One moment his mother is bathing him as a child, and then BAM, he's using his oil profits to finance Hell's Angels. It was structuring like this that made The Aviator feel like a moving photo album that made the audience grow restlessly impatient. I say this because the movie far outstays it's welcome. It clocks in at slightly less than three hours, but it might as well be three hundred. When the ""climax"" finally hits, we don't know if it's really the end or if we have another decade or two of Howard's life to look forward to. I remember when the credits began to roll, half a dozen people sitting around me cried out, ""WHAT?!""

In short, The Aviator felt like an over-sized birthday cake that is nice to look at, but has no flavor, succulence, or zest. Best Picture of 2004? I truly hope that American entertainment has not come to that (especially when ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Sideways"", or even ""Finding Neverland"" are the contenders). I rest my case.",4

11 June 2013,A great film about a very unusual man.,"THE AVIATOR

This film is a biopic about Howard Hughes, the film director, producer, businessman and aviator.

Howard had some problems in his life including an anxiety disorder. He was obsessed with hygiene and cleanliness of everything. He had to wash his hands every time he shook someones hand.

The film is very interesting. I didn't really know much about Howard until I watched this. The story is gripping and interesting, his career and relationships with the people in his life was a roller-coaster.

The casting was perfect in this film. Everyone played their characters brilliantly. Leonardo DiCaprio played Howard. He did a great job. I always hated Leonardo, but the more I watch if his work, the more I think he has a skill with acting. Other cast members are Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Ian Holm, Gwen Stefani, Jude Law, Brent Spiner and Willem Dafoe. A few of these actors only made cameos, but they made their mark on the movie. I was surprised at how well Gwen Stefani acted. I am a fan of No Doubt and I know she can sing, but she is a talented actress too. I hope she makes more movies as I would like to see more of her work. Cate Blanchett played Katharine Hepburn... she was so annoying. I hope she wasn't like that in real life... she was really irritating the way she was and spoke.

The way this film was shot was brilliant. Martin Scorsese does a great job again. The scene where Howard crashes his plane into the houses was absolutely immense. It looked amazing and was by far the best scene in the whole movie and even the best crash scene I think I have ever seen. That scene will stick in my mind for a very long time.

I have never seen a Howard Hughes movie, but I will be looking out for one to see what it is like.

I will give this film 7 out of 10.

A very entertaining movie, but don't take it all as fact as all biopics are not 100% true.

12 February 2005,Where is his life?,"If you take all of the bad moments from a mans life and remove the amazing stuff and you are talking about Howard Hughes then this is the movie you would end up with. I feel like I just watched a hit piece on the poor guy. Yes he suffered from mental illness and I'm sure this is important but I just spent far too much of my time in the lowest parts of his life. Frankly I would have loved to focus on the life of his party and not his decline. Money seemed to for some reason come out of thin air. no mention of what he was doing right. Also he was an innovator and very little time was spent on this. Come on Martin this guy's whole life was about innovation. Shame on you Martin what did you have against the guy...

Scorsese just can't seem to get it right any more! After the total catastrophe with ""Gangs of New York"" he now tries again with Di Caprio in The Aviator. One major flaw in this film in my opinion is the casting of Di Caprio for the role of H.Hughes. He just isn't right for the part, which cannot be said for Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale both of whom do a great job impersonating respectively K.Hepburn and A.Gardner.

The second and to me most important flaw is in the script. The characters are not well developed and the storyline is somehow discontinuous. As a result, we never really understand who Howard Hughes really was, what he felt, what the relationship between him and the women in his life really was, and ultimately as a consequence, we cannot feel for him. To be great, a movie has to generate some kind of emotional response in the viewer, and this one doesn't, it leaves us cold. It would have been different if the film had spent much more time in showing Hughes' feelings, his doubts, his financial troubles and how he risked to overcome them. Instead, in the film it seems that he was just an eccentric genius who had some great ideas and who needed only to order his people to ""fix it"" in order to have them realized. Nobody's life is that simple, and I cannot imagine Hughe's was either.

In other, camera and special effects where rather good and not exaggerated, the sound average. The overall large amount of Oscars and Nominations the film received is in my opinion, undeserved. All in all, The Aviator is a mediocre to good, but not great, filmed biography that will probably soon be forgotten.",7
6 December 2011,Epic craziness.,"Crafting a biopic about Howard Hughes is like running downhill - no more interesting and complex personage graced the 20th century and perhaps with the exception of Ben Franklin and maybe Abraham Lincoln maybe all of United States history. The challenge Martin Scorsese faced involved mostly keeping the fascinating stories about Hughes to just the film's 170 minute running time. Scorsese holds the movie to under 3 hours by focusing only on Hughes' establishment of TWA and Hughes Aircraft and his film production career. Although this period probably covers the most cinematic of Hughes' adventures it does miss his rise to become the biggest employer in Nevada, stints living in London, South America and finally the Caribbean. It also only covers just the early days of his madness which progresses to a far more debilitating stage later in his life. Leonard DiCaprio delves into this madness and the Hughes' genius delivering a convincing and compelling role. He never quite loses himself in the role in the way Charlize Theron could no longer be discerned in her performance as serial killer Aileen Wuornos - we always see DiCaprio behind the character. DiCaprio appears in nearly every shot but he receives the support of some excellent casting choices including Cate Blanchett , who took home an Oscar for the performance and the highly underutilized Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda and John C. Reilly. The editing of their work under can be choppy at times particularly in the beginning where titles describing the action and timeframe become necessary to keep things straight. However, once the film settles into more linear storytelling and its focus on Hughes' romance of Katharine Hepburn the nearly three hour run time moves as smoothly and quickly as one of Hughes' more successful aircraft designs. In short, the excellence of ""The Aviator"" and the genius and psychosis of its subject invite a sequel from Scorsese.",7
21 January 2005,Good movie,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",8
1 March 2006,Probably the best biographical film I've ever seen.,"The Aviator is an outstanding and epic film about the life of eccentric businessman Howard Hughes. It chronicles his life from his turn as a film director up to when he got his flying boat, the Hercules (or as we know it as, the Spruce Goose) to fly. It covers his relationships with some of Hollywood's most famous women as well as his struggle with obsessive compulsive disorder.

In my opinion, this is probably Leonardo DiCaprio's best role. Every single person in the cast literally becomes their role from DiCaprio's spot on performance as Hughes to Cate Blanchett's incredible performance as Katherine Hepburn. I also enjoyed how a few great leading actors popped up in bit roles and played them really well, such as Jude Law as Errol Flynn and Willem Dafoe as a reporter. Martin Scorsese did a great job as always directing this movie. He has a real good eye for the movies he chooses to direct, because he does them all wonderfully. I really think that he was robbed of a best director Oscar. Million Dollar Baby really didn't deserve the best picture Oscar over this far superior film.

The movie is about 3 hours long, but if you're interested in this type of film, it shouldn't really matter. It covers all the important things you need to know about Howard Hughes. I would now really like to see a film about the later years of Hughes' life. This is one of the best movies of 2004, and I highly recommend it to everyone who likes an epic film.

4 November 2007,"Dedicated and Colourful, didn't move me an inch","Scorcese was, until the creation of ""The Departed"", the black sheep of the Oscars. In ""The Aviator"", Scorcese delivers an outstanding carnival of eccentric clothings, fresh visual tones, and sly filmography scenes. Seeing the movie, one utterly is deviated into the majestic scenario of powerful dresses, settings, decorations that the focus on Howard Hughes is sometimes lost. Di Caprio applies fabulously to his work, so does Cate Blanchett and Alan Alda. There is a gigantic cast; which will fascinate you with the presence of stars. The luxury and excess of the movie is the contrast that sharpens the grey and unmoving story of Hughes. We like his story, we understand his fall but it doesn't emotionally move us. Scorcese has derogated into a path of visual content and left aside unpolished the strength of what meant to be a great biopic.

20 January 2005,The Emperor's New Clothes,"The Emperor's New Clothes is a Hans Christian Anderson fable about tailors who convince everyone that only a fool wouldn't be able to see the suit they make for the Emperor. One small boy has the guts to speak out that there is no suit, the Emperor is naked. This sums up this film perfectly: A-list stars, A-list Director, A-list budget = fabulous outfit, but there's nothing there. It is a con.

The Problem: the actors behave as if it's a talent show to be the best impressionist, thus focus on themselves resulting in an inability to accommodate interaction with other actors. The characters are separate, exaggerated caricatures of memories. The only actors to mimic effectively and have awareness of others were Jude Law and Kate Beckinsale, who gave connected performances. Watching Di Caprio manically overtly acting a tortured soul, who was upstaged by the make-up department, was not only soullessly stupid to watch, but embarrassing for him because he thinks he is being different from his usual roles. He had not built any humanity into the previous scenes, hence there was nothing for the audience to grasp and care about when he was ill. His performance makes Russell Crowe look like a genius in Beautiful Mind and Martin Scorsese's directing makes Ron Howard look like the master of biopics. This film is a completely disjointed, arrogant, pretentious pile of meaningless images with no depth, understanding, feeling, narrative direction, believability, nor entertainment value. Knowledge and interest in aeroplane technology did not help me like this film, because it did not show any passion or insight into this subject matter! The film is so boring it hurts.

Question: why is this film nominated for 14 Oscars? My Rating: 1/10. The worst three hours incarcerated in a cinema ever. I was boiling with anger at being conned into watching such rubbish. Of the thousands of films I have seen (of all Nationalities and eras), this was the worst at all levels. The interesting musical score was the only reason I sometimes stayed awake.

Why see this film: because you are in love Leo Di Caprio and Martin Scorsese, or because you can see the Emperor's New Clothes.",1
22 January 2006,Why Leonardo DiCaprio?,"This is one of those rare films where, if you can ignore the main character, you'll enjoy it a whole lot. Not for one minute did I buy Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes -- I'm guessing the only reason he was cast was his ability to sell lots and lots of tickets to that other big-budget movie he was in. If he weren't a big name, you'd assume the casting people scoured the nation's high school drama clubs, found the prettiest boy, and dressed and made him up to resemble a mature man. DiCaprio IS a competent actor, just 100% wrong for this movie. I also took issue with the pitifully inane reason they came up with to explain all Hughes's mental health problems. Rather than take time to fully explore this in the script, in their haste to get those tickets sold, there is a scene early in the film, with Hughes at age 6 or so, which we're supposed to believe explains EVERYTHING. Not the only biopic to take the easy road -- screenwriters were doing this as far back as Words and Music, wherein we're expected to believe that Lorenz Hart drank himself to death because he couldn't deal with being so short. If you can get past the Hughes portrayal, there's a lot here to enjoy: Cate Blanchett as the insufferable Katherine Hepburn; Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda in the Bad Guy slots; exceptionally fine supporting performances; and some neat special effects. If they had only cast an actor who could convincingly portray a grown man -- not a stretch by any means -- I would probably have given this a 9.",6
1 September 2005,"Scorsese, please stick with film restoration","How far the great masters of cinema can fall. THE AVIATOR is a spectacularly bad film with a mere handful of terrific moments.

It has been many years since I have seen a major Hollywood A-picture so filled with grotesque continuity gaffs. I am still scratching my head over how the stellar duo of Scorsese and Thelma Schoonmaker (perhaps one of the greatest living film editors) could have allowed such a sloppy film to go out like it did. Was the bulk of it farmed out to a team of cutters working on PowerBooks with 12"" screens, so they couldn't really make out the detail in the Panavision frame? There are an astonishing number of severe goofs, from characters facing the wrong direction after cuts to hats on heads where they weren't worn in the previous cut to overlapping dialogue which starts on closed mouths, etc. Period detail ranges from very close to completely forgotten (costumes, hair and makeup are often strictly contemporary). Attempts to replicate the ""look"" of 2-strip, and then 3-strip Technicolor are cute but highly inaccurate, and in the case of the 3-strip sections, utterly distracting.

But the problems aren't limited to technical errors. Everyone is miscast. DiCaprio couldn't be more inappropriate as the middle-aged Hughes. Cate Blanchett turns in a very moving performance, but barely echoes Katherine Hepburn. Alan Alda plays... well... Alan Alda competently enough, but is a total one-note. Only Alec Baldwin, as a restrained Pan Am executive, pulls it off. And I won't even mention Kate Beckinsale's non-take on Ava Gardner.

Perhaps the most appalling aspect to the whole mess is the reliance on CGI digital effects for the bulk of the action sequences. What is the difference between THE AVIATOR and a video game? Answer: none. How could Scorsese ""honor"" the pioneering action direction of Hughes on HELL'S ANGELS by replacing it with completely soulless, one-dimensional computer-driven animation? The mind reels.

This is a very, very bad film.",3

23 January 2005,Best Film of 2004 to 2005,"I really think this is an exceptional film in every single way. It is very entertaining for everyone twenty plus, and covers an interesting period in American history between late twenties to end of Second World War. The general story is very interesting, Tracing Howard Hughes life with his connections in early Hollwood and his exceptional genius in aviation design. It captures an essential part of American History in a very real and interesting way - covering early Hollywood and its transition, early passenger aviation, political corruption (similiar to what we witness today!) The acting and directing is of the highest caliber. This film definitely deserves several Oscars and hopefully will get them All I can say is it is brilliant!

15 December 2005,"Too much Hollywood, not enough Howard Huges","My wife and I just watched this movie on cable with great expectations. Wow! How many ways can one be disappointed in a movie? The biographical aspects of the story were more supermarket tabloid than History Channel.

DiCaprio and Blanchett must have talent, because almost everyone liked them in Titanic, and this movie has had great acclaim also, but I don't see it in either movie. In Titanic, they played two-dimensional stereotypes with such a predictable uninteresting story line, that I found myself looking for the iceberg 20 minutes into the movie.

In The Aviator, DiCaprio and Blanchette seemed to me to be playing caricatures--not characters. Maybe it's the writing, but I did not care about anyone in this movie, with the possible exception of the Alan Alda character, Senator Brewster--who was played just low-key and unscrupulous enough to be believable...so I hated him.

Casting. In spite of the obvious effort he put forth, I just cannot see DiCaprio as Howard Hughes. I think I might have cast Gary Sinise in that part. As to Katherine Hepburn, playing that part is like playing Superman--a lose-lose opportunity. Played straight, you say, ""She didn't sound anything like Hepburn."" Played as Blanchett did, it seemed more like stand-up comedy than movie drama. Alan Alda was perfect--no stereotype crooked politician mannerisms, no tired old-time movie politician expressions. Alec Baldwin is easy casting for a villain. Since so many people dislike Alec Baldwin anyway, it is easy to dislike his character.

Writing. I've already commented on the 2D characters. The other thing I consider unacceptable in a period movie is modern day expressions. Maybe, like the DiCaprio-Blanchett paring, this is to appeal to young audiences, but personally I find it distracting and consider it lazy writing and still another historical inaccuracy. If you are going to write a screenplay about a time other than now, take the time to learn the language of the era.

Good special effects. I enjoyed the aircraft scenes. My wife found them boring. I have to file this movie with Titanic, Pearl Harbor, and War of the Worlds under, ""It's too bad that someone doesn't put a good story with these modern effects when they retell an old story or remake an old movie."" If you want to see a better movie about Howard Hughes, find ""The Amazing Howard Hughes"" a TV movie from the 70's based on the book by Noah Dietrich. Best yet, read the book.",5
5 April 2010,Something's missing,"With a record of deep and troubled portraits: Travis Bickle and Jake la Motta, Scorsese has all the ability, and more, to deliver on a strong level about Hughes. But somehow it doesn't.

On the good side there is the slick and rich production, the moving camera (adapting FW Murnau), the design, the flight sequences are extraordinary, even if a little too CGI, but still exciting. The romance with Hepburn is intriguing but it goes nowhere and doesn't say much about Hughes at all. Blanchett really takes this movie over in her performance.

On the negative side, when the Hepburn story is over the movie drops in intensity. Hughes is a weird and ill man and unlike Scorsese's other damaged properties, the illness just removes any possible connection. Sure, as Pauline Kael said, ""Raging Bull"" was about pond life, but it had an eloquent story about America for that group of people. Here the overt illness and script are more like a boys own adventure gone wrong but it does not connect to the wider themes that Scorsese was probably targeting, as he has in other movies. At the end the resonance is not there as it was with Travis Bickle: Hughes is not like the viewer with his OCD.

But more difficult is the casting of DiCaprio, where he is a capable actor but his face is wrong: it's too sweet, it's too young. It's not fair, because he does a good job but it still doesn't fit the movie but DiCaprio is a key reason why it falters. Billy Wilder said casting is everything and here that maxim is true. Movies rely on faces and close ups and how audiences respond to faces, and with movie stars, the baggage they bring, how the audience feels about them and the roles they take is crucial to acceptance. In this respect DiCaprio should have passed on the role.",7
10 February 2020,Another great Scorsese/Dicaprio movie,"This movie like many other great one of this century is a look at Hollywood, itself, but if you haven't seen it , I can say that it isn't as dark as Sunset Boulevard, no as Bright as the first 2 hours of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, but not as critical as Birdman, it is a wonderful mixed between drama, while it is more leaned to the drama.

This movie is not as mastered as The Irishman, but at the time Scorsese used all his knowledge in film-making which also give the impression that this movie is the transit between glamour film like The Irishman and Casino, and more mature show like Shutter Island, The Departed, The Irishman.

Finally, you really need to see all the collaborations between Scorsese and DiCaprio which also includes The Departed, Shutter Island, The Wolf of Wallstreet, I was never disappointed by these collaborations.

23 February 2005,Major Disappointment,"I was looking forward to this movie probably more than any other this year. After all, I love aviation, aviation history, the 1930's, the 1940's, and am a fan of biopics. Based on the early reviews for it, I was not going to be disappointed. But regardless of the acclaim that this film gets or the awards that it may receive, ""The Aviator"" is pretty much a mess.

To be fair, although I have always found him interesting, I am not very knowledgeable on Howard Hughes' life. I knew that he had contributed much to aviation, that he was very rich and successful, about the ""Spruce Goose"" fiasco, about his reclusive end, and I had loved ""Hell's Angels."" It's tough not to admire a pilot pioneer whose main passions appeared to have been flying, making films, and hot women. But all of these elements failed to live up to those things on screen.

""Hell's Angels"" is one of the most interesting and unusual films that can be seen today. It wasn't a dramatic masterpiece; it was more of a guilty pleasure. Today we marvel at the incredible stunt work and visuals from that film, as well as a zeppelin attack that resembles campy science fiction, a silly love triangle with over-the-top acting, and images that have been colored by hand, long before movies were in color. The stories behind the making of that film are equally interesting; it is rumored that three pilots died while making it, and that Hughes himself performed a stunt that nobody else would. These things are only mentioned as an afterthought at the movie's premiere.

Then there is Hughes' ""womanizing."" Leonardo Dicaprio is too boyish, and just not believable when it comes to this. Since we know that Hughes had every major starlet at some point, we are just supposed to accept that Hughes had the charm and wit to get them. But what is his charm, other than that he's a hot-shot pilot with lots of money (ahem... did I just answer my own question?) A scene where HH seduces a cigarette girl (added at Leo DiCaprio's request) is poorly written and flat-out unconvincing--he's doing a poor man's imitation of Trent seducing the cocktail waitress in ""Swingers,"" at best. Leo never has much chemistry with the women who come and go throughout his life. Why did they stay (if, only briefly) with him? A scene with Catherine Hepburn's family makes us believe that she was his most important connection, yet the scene really doesn't fit in with the rest of the story--it is a plant with no payoff.

Many other scenes are just there, yet provide no drive or momentum for the film; why do we need to see Jude Law play Errol Flynn (also unconvincingly) in one scene? What was the point of the (suppossedly hilarious) scene in which Ian Holm tries to convince the ratings board with calipers that the cleavage presented in ""The Outlaw"" is acceptable? What I was most disappointed with in ""The Aviator"" were HH's achievements in aviation. We all know that he was an important pioneer in aviation, but after seeing this film, I can't exactly say why. The dream of expanding the airlines is mostly dealt with by depicting the rivalries of Pan-Am and TWA--not very interesting. Most of his daring exploits are, again, poor imitations, this time of the daring exploits from ""The Right Stuff""--a far superior film. Great emphasis is placed on the ""Spruce Goose,"" which is probably not something that HH should be too proud of. The film really loses steam in its last third; by the time he made it to the hearings, I really didn't care whether HH won or lost.

Howard Hughes was a lot of things, but I can't tell what was most important about him after watching ""The Aviator."" Grade: C+",5
22 February 2005,"Some Turbulence for ""The Aviator""","""The Aviator"" is the biopic of maverick film producer and aviator Howard Hughes as directed by Martin Scorsese. In ""The Aviator"", we follow certain events of Hughes life (those determined important by the filmmakers) episodically during a time span of roughly twenty years.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hughes in a solid performance. While DiCaprio does nothing extraordinary, his occasional nervous ticks and varying degrees of a furrowed brow add a nice element to the film. Cate Blanchett in a supporting role as one of Hughes' love interests Katherine Hepburn is quite impressive. Blanchett obviously put great effort into the part as characterised by her rapid, accented dialogue. Alec Baldwin (at his sleazy best), Ian Holm and Alan Alda also put in commendable acting efforts. Sadly underdeveloped are the characters portrayed by John C. Reilly and Kate Beckinsale. Reilly's character is Hughes' second in command, yet throughout the film, he only seems to take notes and complain about Hughes' spending habits. Beckinsale as Ava Gardner essentially replaces Blanchett after Hughes' romance with the latter falls apart. However, while Blanchett fared prominently, Beckinsale floats in and out of the picture.

Perhaps the biggest problem with ""The Aviator"" is its plot. While most of the plot is actually quite good, there are two serious missteps. The first is in a short scene that starts the movie and is later recalled in a flashback. It tries to link Hughes' mental problems to the single event of his mother bathing him (when he is at a preteen age) while offering neurotic advice (whether this should also explain Hughes' obsession with 'mammories' and milk, I do not know). The second is the brief reappearance of characters whose use in the movie had already ended. There are several examples of this: Blanchett returns much later to see Hughes, but does not and never returns, Jude Law appears for one scene and then reappears in a 'walk on' part only and Beckinsale reappears to 'save' Hughes and then leaves.

Visually, ""The Aviator"" is beautiful. Scorsese uses his full array of camera tricks to get the desired effect. Scenes set in different periods have different looks. The CGI, while not seamless, is not overused. An added bonus is a spectacularly filmed aeroplane crash sequence that is actually quite startling.

In terms of directing, the film marks another excellent effort by Martin Scorsese. While not as good as ""Goodfellas"", ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Raging Bull"", it is on par with efforts such as ""Gangs of New York"". As mentioned previously, the Director uses all his camera tricks expertly to show the viewer what the character is feeling. Interestingly, the director chooses to express some of Hughes' eccentric behaviour in a humorous tone.

In conclusion, ""The Aviator"" is an excellent motion picture with mild annoyances. Fans of Scorsese, DiCaprio and Howard Hughes should not be disappointed, but the film's running time of just under three hours may be too much for some.",8
29 May 2007,Very uneven movie,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",6

1 March 2005,Leonardo DiCapprio does it again!,"The Aviator is an excellent movie, and the acting was superb. Leonardo DiCapprio plays millionaire Howard Hughes who first started off making movies such as ""Hell's Angels"" and then moved onto to make airplanes. Cate Blanchet's performance as Katherine Hepburn was incredible, that you can see the striking resemblance between them.

Also, this movie focuses on Howard Hughes's obsessive perfectionism. He wanted everything to be just perfect, and Leonardo DiCapprio pulled of the performance without a hitch! Howard Hughes was also famous for making the Spruce Goose, which is now a historical landmark! Too bad The Aviator didn't win an Oscar for Best Picture, seeing this movie you can see why it was Oscar worthy to begin with. I hope to see Leonardo DiCapprio in more great movies in the future. I give The Aviator 4 stars!

26 December 2004,Surprisingly Entertaining,"Well color me surprised. Scorcese does wonders with this film. It is very good, but not great. The cinematography and direction of this movie is inspired. Scorcese throws in plenty of interesting camera work, and his directing considers every period detail. Perhaps the only thing that I found odd about this period piece (1930s - 1940s) is that it never really deals with WWII. The characters are so insulated that WWII only surfaces in relation to airplane deals and congressional expenditures.

In any event, this movie is thoroughly entertaining despite its almost 3 hr running time. Hughes' life provides plenty of interesting material for movie, even if the movie doesn't take us to the sordid ending of Hughes life.

DiCaprio does an excellent job as Hughes. He is very believable as Hughes at all levels of his life. I was pleasantly surprised by his performance, as I am not a fan of his (didn't like Titanic and thought his performance in Gangs of New York was weak by comparison to Daniel Day Lewis). His efforts to portray Hughes' genius, eccentricity, and ultimately his mental illness were seamless and believable.

Blanchett as Hepburn was great. She plays her over the top, full of life, and very interesting. Whenever she was on the screen the movie just hummed along.

Surprisingly, the next best actor was Alan Alda as a corrupt Senator. What a wonderful effort being cast against his sensitive nice guy image.

While the movie doesn't have a real emotional or philosophical center to it, it is still entertaining as hell. Perhaps the lack of center isn't so much a defect as a realistic view that most lives do not neatly convey a philosophical message or unfold in a clear cut manner (despite the fact that Hollywood tries to give biopics some philosophical theme or message). Whether it is the draw of fantastic wealth, the gambler's spirit, the womanizing with Hollywood's most attractive starlets, or the inventive entrepreneurial spirit, the Aviator is entertaining from start to finish.",10

25 February 2005,Up there with the driver and the fellas.,"Fantastic. That's what The Aviator is. Yeah, it's a little long, but overall, fantastic. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the performance of his career in this, and Marty is excellent as always. He's paid his dues, I think it's time Academy voters. Yeah, it's not as good as many of his other films, but is still very excellent in its own right.

The music, the cinematography, and oh, the colours of it all. All excellent and visually grand. One of the best aspects of the film.

The acting was great also, of course DiCaprio. Cate Blanchett was alright, little on my nerves, Kate Beckinsale was very good with what little she had, and even the bit parts by Gwen Stefani, Jude Law and even random cameo by Willem Dafoe were all very well acted. I was disappointed with the lack of more for Ian Holm to do, but he still did very well.

Overall, a solid effort, and a 9/10 approval. Not the best film of the year, but deserving of recognition. One of Marty's best films, ranking up with the likes of Taxi Driver and Goodfellas. (Although, not better)",9
16 October 2021,Paradoxical tycoon,"What a fascinating movie and story too, fascinating character, exceptional and full of paradoxes. This man who also was a self destructive human being, who was scared of germs of all kinds and who did not wash himself for weeks, locked in his room. This womanizer at a scale that you can't even imagine, at a scale that no movie could show them all and. A billionaire, the second most wealthy tycoon in the USA at this time, who wore dirty clothes, like a wagrant, who sometimes borrowed a couple of bucks to some one in the streets, a gifted flight pilot and also TWA big executive. I read the book written by those two American journalists and all details are impossible to be spoken of in this movie. But believe me, this is hair rising or laughable; totally crazy ad incredible. Leonardo Di Caprio is excellent as this terrific lead character. Also an awesome Hollywood world depiction and analysis.

2 January 2006,Brilliant and Eccentric,"I was expecting a long conventional biopic and much to my surprise this picture turned out more eccentric and interesting than I thought it would. The SFX were understated and perfect, particularly the brilliant use of large-scale remote controlled model aircraft instead of cheesy-looking CGI. I kept guessing why the color palettes shifted so wildly and inexplicably (the movies doesn't really kick into full color until we are introduced to the celestial lair of Hughes' arch-rival Juan Trippe.) The cast is eccentric and spot-on. Everyone noted Blanchett's turn as Hepburn, but the rest of the cast rises to the occasion; Adam Scott is especially fun as Hughe's pencil-mustachioed, fast-talking publicist. There's the odd mix of dangerous and jolly fun from ""Goodfellas"" here in the progressions of Hughes' philanderings and worsening mental illness, and the movie builds steadily to its climax. Stick with it and you will be rewarded.

25 September 2021,The Aviator,"Disappointed before I watched the movie. I thought it would be cinematic masterpieces, but the movie seriously disappointed me. The film's two biggest drawbacks are the length of the film, which was very long. It was possible to remove it from the film for half an hour. The text centered on Howard's sexual relations. Had the movie been based on Howard's struggle against the rival company, it could have been a lot better. The characters in the movie were superficial. You can summarize any letter in one or two words. Except for Howard who was a complex and interesting character. The movie's music was mediocre in some scenes, it was excellent and in others it was poor, Scorsese directed was great but not enough to make the movie excellent, the movie is good but could have been a lot better, I recommend watching if you're a fan of Scorsese or DiCaprio.

27 December 2004,The movie had God's name in vain over 50 times with Jesus and Christ as well and on Christmas day,"Let's see,I found the movie boring and much too long. I watched six people walk out before the movie ended. I am only glad I paid the early show price. After 3 hours of watching my life waste away I had plenty of time to think about this, save your money! If you are thinking of going to the theater and watching this and you think I'm wrong thats fine, just please wait until it comes out on VHS or DVD. As an Oscar contender, this movie flops in every sense of the word. DiCaprio fails miserably in his portrayal of the late great Howard Hughes. Don't waste your money on this bomb. If I was not with two other people I would have walked out after the first hour. There was,however, one good part about the movie... The end credits!

9 January 2005,Good but not great.,"I give this 6 star out of 10.

I would have given this 7 stars but the ending was not well done. I have to admit, I liked this movie although I did not want to since I cannot stand Di Caprio. That being said, he performed the part of Howard Hughes very well.

The movie focused on parts of Howard Hughes life I did not know about. Howard Hughes was a rich man who inherited a fortune from his parents' business of making machinery tools. He, however, was not interested in the tool business and came to Hollywood to make movies. While making movies, he became interested in aviation as a result of making the movie Hell Cats. He created the now-defunct airline TWA. He became embroiled in personal battle with Juan Trippe, who was the head of Pan Am Airways. The film also showed how Trippe used his influence with public officials to stop TWA from expanding its business into Pan Am territories. In between all these projects and battles, he had time to date many women including starlets.

I knew these facts, that I mentioned above, from seeing a documentary about him a while back but I did not know the intimate details of the relationship of some of these women he had relationship with and how his battle with Juan Trippe nearly drove him over the edge. Speaking of over the edge, I had no idea Howard Hughes had a huge OCD problem or obsessive compulsive behavior problem. This movie showed how this behavior became a constant thorn in his side.

I could go on and on but I really liked this movie and this is in spite of Di Caprio and also Alec Baldwin. Now the reason why I gave this a 6 rather than 7 or above is that the movie does not go further than early 1950's of his life. I want to know more. I think a good biography of a person should show his beginning and also the end. Maybe the creators of this movie did not want to make a long movie but it leaves movie goers with only a half view of his life.

Another thing I had problem with is the choice of actress to portray Ava Gardner. Ava Gardner was truly a stunning woman and the actress who portrayed her was pretty but does not come close to being on par with Gardner. With all the beautiful girls out there who are trying to make it into show business, couldn't the movie makers pick more beautiful actress to portray Gardner?",6
8 April 2019,A True Tale of Obsession and Genius,"The Aviator shines from start to finish with the epic tale of the life of Howard Hughes. Inventor, Director and Aviator Mr. Hughes life was one of extreme interest and Scorsese does a great job of displaying that in this film. Incredible performance's all around from the cast, my only complaint being its a bit lengthy watch but maintains its momentum well.

12 April 2005,Never Quite Ended,"To be entirely honest, the movie was fairly entertaining,for the first hour and a half maybe. But MY GOD! Sitting in the theater was just brutal, a few times I thought it was about to end and I was pleased, and thought it was a good movie, but it just became ridiculous, it kept going and going and became extremely tiring. Hearing Leo repeat the same thing like 50 times (doubt thats even an exaggeration) because he had some disorder *just shakes head* it was brutal. After the movie was finished my friend and i just stared at each other, ran outside and screamed. Couldn't believe we actually sat though it. The movie could have been really good, I just think it could have been edited a heck of a lot more to reduce its length considerably. THEN I would find it tolerable.

27 January 2005,Agonizing!!,"I can often judge a movie by how often I look at my watch. This was a ""4 plusser"". The first time was only an hour into it; I could have sworn I'd been there for several days. The movie was filled with so many anachronisms that I lost all respect for it early on. You'd think that Hollywood would have a better sense of its own history. (Also,is it utterly impossible to find a zaftig blonde anywhere in Hollywood to play Harlowe? I think the answer in the land of bulimia is ""no"".) I found the colors garish, the dialog plodding, the pacing tortuous. And where on earth did the costume designer dig up those hats for the Ava Gardner character - from an old Kathryn Grayson musical? When the characters were attempting to discuss the technicalities of their aeronautical work they were about as convincing as junior high school kids making an adventure video. It was obvious that they were saying the words but had no idea of their meaning. Poor Ian Holm was the only one deliberately playing confused. And what was the purpose of his character other than comic relief? I suppose DiCaprio will garner awards for playing a crazy person, which seems to guarantee a performer kudos (see Rush and Jolie among others.) I think those critics who raved about this movie, which will no doubt win the Oscar for Scorsese, should wait a few months and then go see it again, this time with their eyes and ears open and some strong coffee at hand. Remember ""Titanic"", guys?",1
8 April 2005,"Made well, but the plot sucked","Martin Scorsese's The Aviator is a depiction of the life of Howard Hughes. Howard Hughes was a pilot, a billionaire, a businessman, and before anyone else, a ""womanizer"" and a victim of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). He cared very much about what he did, and demanded a good title, not the rich boy from Texas. Now, did this movie, with Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, portray his life well? First we need to look at what Hughes' life was. In a sense, his problems started with his mother. In the beginning of the movie young Howard Hughes is being adamantly bathed by his mother, ensuing the OCD, and talking to him on how ""he is not safe,"" ensuing paranoia.

This is normal for one of Scorsese's films, considering many of his main characters have problems and/or are trying to find their way in life. The director did portray the drama in Hughes life, putting special emphasis on the presses flashing light bulbs, screaming, stepping on light bulbs, etc. I, personally did not like how much emphasis they put on the drama. I think they made the film kind of confusing on what it was really about, which makes it hard to do things like this. When I walked into the theater I thought I was going to see an awesome film about planes, and movies, because that's what Howard Hughes is essentially known for, by most people, but it trailed from film, to aviation, to the drama in his life and women. I thought to much was focused on the women in his life such as Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani), Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), and other teenage whores.

Leonardo DiCaprio did a good job, however, of transitioning through these. So I guess it made it less abrupt. He also did a good portrayal of Hughes in general, making his passion for what he did believable, and I was impressed by the determination he bought to life. He did an excellent job as Hughes, but personally I didn't think it was the best portrayal of a character, but that's my opinion.

Now, this is one of the best portrayals of a character that I have seen, Katherine Hepburn, played by Cate Blanchett. Just a few things that made it good, the looks, the fake laughs, the accent, the attitude, the words she used, it was brilliant. I would like her to win her Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

This is one thing I like about directors like Martin Scorsese, Peter Weir, and others; they get really into there movies. They make sure they are down to the point historically correct, and they actually care about them, and in a sense they are the only people who produce it. For example, Scorsese recommended to Blanchett to watch Hepburn's first 15 movies to get everything down, so she did, and she also took cold showers, something Hepburn is known for, whether that helped her acting or not I don't know.

The movie portrays two decades of Hughes' life, and Scorsese must of wanted it all because he put it into a long, dragging 3 Hours (2 hrs. 46 minutes). What is interesting is it won the Oscar for best Film Editing, but they should of edited out about an hour, then I would understand.

Another thing I didn't like about The Aviator was that it kept switching plots. It's called The Aviator, so plane people go in there, rightfully expecting aviation, and aviation is 25 % of the movie, I went in there because I heard of his movies, another 25%, etc. I liked the movie, but I thought it was a good movie for people who have never heard of Howard Hughes, it sums in basic terms.

It had the lead in the 2005 Oscar Nominations, 11 total, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Leonardo DiCaprio and Best Supporting Actress, Cate Blanchett. However it went home with only five, Best Supporting Actress- Cate Blanchett, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design",8
7 August 2008,Brilliant,"The Aviator is amazing biopic about one of America's most famous figures, Howard Hughes, during his most exciting, innovative and formulative years in the 1920s to 1940s. During this period he was obsessively involved in first making a film and later Aviation, the biggest love of his life, where he faces opposition from a PanAm chief(Alec Baldwin) and a corrupt and power hungry Senator (Alan Alda). As well, his own Daredevil behaviour, unwavering idealism, brash decisions, and constantly growing Obessive Compulsive Disorder and Germaphobia throughout the film threaten to derail him.

'The film is the shortest and most captivating 170 minute film I've ever seen. The screenplay, the editing and the sheer determination of the filmmakers in capturing this exceptional man on the screen make it a wonderfully gripping experience. It excels in every department, from design and FX to Howard Shore's great score.' Martins decision to imitate two strip technicolour (blue) for half the film is also interesting and looks great. Its a period piece that actually manages to portray the period perfectly,a historical epic, biopic that doesn't forget to engage the audience with heart and humour.

Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Howard Hughes and while he doesn't look like Hughes (and doesn't ""age"" well, At All), he manages to portray Hughes charm, arrogance, mannerisms, obsessions, recklessness and ""madness"" almost perfectly. However he is equally matched by Cate Blanchett in her Oscar winning role as actress Katherine Hepburn. Every Actor in the film is brilliant, though some are underused such as John C. Reilly.

Overall this was a great and very enjoyable film. It has its faults but films that try to portray larger then life people always do. 8.5 out of 10",7
20 February 2005,Biopic for those who don't know Hughes' story ends up just OK,"Howard Hughes had a pretty crazy life. That's what I could sum up this biopic as trying to say. There was no reason to release this film at this time, but Scorsese did a pretty decent job, and therefore, the directing saved this pretty anti-climactic story There were hardly any resolutions when Hughes, played very consistently by Leonardo DiCaprio, would see a problem with his insanities throughout life, which made his story seem less and less likely to end up great. In fact, a lot of friends I know thought this was suppose to show the genius behind him, but in actuality, the film seems to make him more like an OCD sufferer and man who cheats death throughout his life rather than any kind of public-figure-turned-hero/genius.

All of the acting was done very well. I got tired of seeing Cate Blanchett's ""Katherine Hepburn,"" but I guess I should blame Scorsese for allowing that over-the-top delivery over and over again. Gwen Stefani played Jean Harlow, who seems to never say much other than kissing some Hughes butt publicly (at least that's what you think whenever you see her role in The Aviator). Hughes, being a man of the ladies of Hollywood, knew and dated many a celebrity back in his time, and this film got that fact across, and he probably would've continued had his drive to work more than love taken over.

The film completely overlooks his death and some other points of his life, but again, Scorsese sums up a good amount of it. The film was a bit long (about a man whom some have never heard of before) to get it point across, but it was nice to hear that some of past's moguls were not so boring and that they had their problems, too.

I don't know if I'd see it again, but it was a great summing up of Hughes' life. I gave it a 7/10 because it had a pretty typical story of a man's rise and fall throughout life, but it was nice to see the many facets of humanity that were realized before Hughes' eyes when he was at the height of his career. A good rent, when it comes out, but I wouldn't buy.",7
3 September 2010,Scorsese's Biopic Has the Style but Not the Heart,"Martin Scorsese's biopic about the rise and fall of eccentric entrepreneur Howard Hughes has energy to spare -- indeed, it barely pauses for breath -- but it remains a somewhat unengaging piece of cinema anyway. It's technically accomplished, but cold and lacking in heart.

Leonardo DiCaprio played Hughes and gave audiences the first indication that he was capable of a mature film career after ""Titanic."" Cate Blanchett steals every scene she's in as Katharine Hepburn in a performance that manages to be a dead ringer for the real thing without being a mere impersonation. And Alan Alda is deliciously villainous as a corrupt senator. Other casting -- like Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner(!?) and Jude Law as Errol Flynn -- works less well.

Grade: B+

15 April 2014,One of 2004's best films,"Martin Scorsese's historically accurate drama about the life about Howard Hughes' career from the late 1920's to the mid 1940's is to me nothing short of great. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes who at the time of his life was the richest man in the world had many different jobs such as a film producer, plane designer, aviator, and pilot. DiCaprio plays Hughes perfectly in this well done biopic. Director Martin Scorsese knows history movie accuracy and not only the movie had a great camera crew and cast. But the movie showed us who Howard Hughes really was. The movie also has great work from Cate Blanchett, John C. Reilly, Kate Beckinsale, Alec Baldwin, and the legendary Alan Alda.This movie sort of reminds me of Flight which was directed by Robert Zemeckis, But Martin Scorsese's The Aviator was much better in my opinion. Also the movie has great costume design, art direction, and especially great photography from the magnificent Robert Richardson.

6 March 2012,It takes more than film-making skill,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",7
18 September 2006,First movie I've ever given a 10,"I was shocked at the excellence of this movie on all levels. Every time I see Leonardo DiCaprio is in a movie I think, ""How good could he be in that role?"" But every time I come away convinced that he is truly a great actor. It's when you see him in candid, camera-in-your face interviews that he comes across as a flustered youth. As an actor, however, he's gotta be top twenty.

The Howard Shore score and John Logan script are first rate. The special effects are impressive. I came away liking Katherine Hepburn, an actor I never really enjoyed much.

Martin Scorcese got robbed at the Academy Awards. He should have won Best Director. Next time, big guy, next time.

25 April 2020,Been a while since it was released - sad to say...,"...it has not 'aged' well. DeCaprio gives a decent performance but the scenes reminded me of Beatty's mess 'Reds'. Ex. the scene in the nightclub with Jude Law (Errol Flynn) acting foolish - there was no editing to a script from scene to scene.

6 November 2005,The Aviator,"Howard Hughes' life was like a dark fairy tale, one in which the hero woos all the princesses and becomes a hero to the people, but at a terrible personal price. Chiefly remembered by most people as the loony billionaire recluse of the 70s who shuffled around his penthouse hotel suite with his feet in tissue boxes, he was, of course, a genius. And, like many geniuses, he balanced precariously on that line that divides genius and madness for much of his life before toppling irrevocably over in a fashion as spectacular as the air crash that left him with nearly 80% burns.

With their opening scene, a strangely eroticised 'flashback' of Hughes as a boy being bathed by his mother and warned about cholera and typhus and q-u-a-r-a-n-t-i-n-e, Scorsese and scriptwriter John Logan seem to place the blame for Hughes' subsequent phobias and obsessive-compulsive disorder squarely on the shoulders of his mother. This may be true, but a solitary scene before moving on to the filming of Hell's Angels does little to convince or inform, or provide credible background for Hughes' subsequent mental problems.

Apart from this one scene, the film focuses on an approximately twenty-year period from 1927 to the Brewster Senate hearings and Hughes' piloting of the Spruce Goose after WWII. Hughes' love life, his engineering and business genius, and his increasing phobia over germs are given pretty much equal screen time, and the film does a reasonable job of slowly focusing more on the phobias as they begin to take over his life. Strangely enough, you'd think this aspect of his life would make up the more interesting part of the film, but it's when Hughes is shown at his most damaged that the film begins to drag. The imagery at this point is clumsy and uninspired and the film threatens to veer as badly out of control as Hughes did. Perhaps that was Scorsese's intention, but you're left with the impression of having been given a peep at a freak show rather than an examination of a man's breakdown.

Leonardo Di Caprio continues to surprise with his success at tackling difficult roles for which he would seem to be unsuitable. He gives an entirely believable and sympathetic performance here, capturing both the energy of the man and the mental and emotional insecurities he suffered, while managing to avoid the pitfalls that are inherent to such a part. The supporting cast also deliver uniformly excellent performances. Cate Blanchett, while not really resembling Katharine Hepburn, manages to capture her tone and inflections and mannerisms, while Kate Beckinsale is passable despite never really capturing the essence of Ava Gardner in the same way that Blanchett does with Hepburn.

This being a Scorsese film, it is, of course, technically brilliant. His decision to play with colour on some scenes is perhaps a little misguided, but he does tone down his often kinetic style, which would have been wholly inappropriate for a story like this. There are some great aerial shots and an incredible air crash, but the highlight for me was the barnstorming Brewster Senate Committee Hearings in which the malicious senator, excellently portrayed here by Alan Alda, is torn to shreds by a briefly recuperated Hughes.

While this film isn't flawless, it's doubtful that we will see a better biopic about Howard Hughes. It's just a shame that so many of the CGI effects are so blatantly shoddy.",8

16 March 2005,What a surprise!,"What a surprise! I had many doubts going to see ""the Aviator"" after watching "" the gangs of New York"". After watching the director and lead actor before I wonder why they ever would work together again. I was wrong, there is a chemistry the 2 have together. Great acting and directing. The movie does not seem to be the 2 hours that the movie is. Hugh's phobia towards germs is never explained. Can a phobia ever be explained? Alan Alda is great! Nice to see Alda in a different role. The Avaiator shows that graph and politicts have not changed over the years. Worth watching. I give Aviator a 8 out of 10. The movie show's Hugh's as a risk taker.

15 February 2005,Too long but the acting was great!!!!,"After seeing this movie I have a new respect for Leonardo. I never liked anything that he did beforehand but he was great in this. After seeing million dollar baby last week I didn't think I would like another movie better. I don't like Aviator as much but the acting was well worth it. I can honestly say that Leonardo and Cate Blanchett deserve the Oscar. I came away from this movie feeling an understanding of Howard Hughes that I had never knew before and sadness for the disease that overtook him. Leonardo moved me with his stunning and very moving performance. If you want to see great acting you must see this movie.

8 January 2005,A Nutshell Review: The Aviator,"This almost 3 hour bio-epic of Howard Hughes, the second collaborative film between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio (the first being Gangs of New York), may seem as mammoth as the sproose goose, but with excellent casting, acting, sets and pacing, you'd be clammering for it to continue as it barely scratches the surface of Hughes eventful life, as director, aviator and visionary.

Squeezed into the film are so many themes and subplots, it makes you eager to want to learn more about this fascinating icon, in addition to the Early Hollywood to post-WWII era covered.

Hollywood - this is at its earliest, with classic screen legends brought to life again. The first 15 minutes of the film lets you into the production of Hughes' Hell's Angels, and other classics of his like Scarface and The Outlaw were covered, with the latter's friction with the censorship board on mammaries bringing huge doses of humour. Also, look out for Jude Law's Errol Flynn! Romance - between Katharine Hepburn, played so perfectly by Cate Blanchett, and Kate Beckinsale's Ava Gardner, who teases and asks Hughes of nothing more than buying her dinner. Minor love relations are briefly mentioned, or given the ""Tabloid Treatment"".

The Aviator - Hughes designs, builds and then test flies his own planes. We get to see him being the fastest man on earth, circling the globe, critically crashing his Air Force's spy plane prototype, and piloting his crowning glory, C-130's granddaddy Hercules.

Corporate Business - Business is war, between Hughes' WTA and Alec Baldwin's PanAm. Watch how they scheme against each other for the battle of the skies! Corruption - Politics and money don't mix... or do they? We get a sneak peek into the corruption and bribery of the early days. Oops, or should I say, generous donations? Excessive Compulsive Disorder - Hughes suffers from ECD, and is obsessive with cleanliness. He uses his own bar soap in public loos, doesn't stand anything raw, or the tiniest speck of dirt on anyone else's shirt. We see the disorder zapping his of his sanity, and he declines into living in filth (the irony of it) and stark naked in his projection room, suffering from the disorder at its worst, before Ava plucks him out of his rut.

I have to admit I ain't much of a Martin Scorsese fan, till now. I haven't watched Goodfellas, and my recent memory of Scorsese is Gangs of NY, and the lending of his voice for the blowfish in Shark's Tale. Here, he masterfully mixes and weaves the themes together into one long compelling narrative.

I have always been a fan of Leo DiCaprio's acting abilities, from What's Eating Gilbert Gabe, to spouting Shakespeare in Bahz Luhman's R+J. This is yet another occasion where he plays someone real and does one heck of a job.

This show has something for everybody, is Oscar worthy, so don't miss it. Now I gotta hit the stores to get one of his biographies...",10
24 July 2019,my notes,"Really good movie. about as good as a bio pic can get. phenomenal job by dicaprio, blanchett and others. the history covered in this movie is very interesting (2 viewings)

4 January 2005,Di Caprio is excellent in this film,"I thought that Leonard DiCaprio was excellent in Titanic, but has been less than spectacular in all the movies I saw him in since. But he has turned in another excellent performance in The Aviator. His gestures in this movie was excellent as well as his overall performance. His dark hair and mustache made him look just like Howard Hughes. This movie although long should boost Leonard's film career and he should be in the running for an Academy Award. I also thought that Kate Blanchett was excellent as Kate Hepburn as well as the rest of the cast. It was a pleasant surprise to see Leonard in a complex role. Go see this movie as it is well worth the price of admission.

3 October 2010,The Cult Of Howard Hughes!,"Howard Hughes: Aviation Pioneer, Successful Film Producer and a man suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder. 'The Aviator' is about him, this genius, this winner, this master-mind.

Martin Scorsese directs this biopic with remarkable understanding. I have always said that, Scorsese is a filmmaker who creates inspirations through his cinema. He is one of the most talented and dedicated filmmakers in recent cinema history. 'The Aviator' is amongst his finest efforts to date. The Cult Of Howard Hughes unfolds with sheer magic.

'The Aviator' is 169 minutes long in running time, and there is not a single minute when you disconnect with Mr.Howard Hughes. You feel for him when he has to face himself, he is a very memorable character into a film. Scorsese knows that his film is based on a very important person, he understands him. His direction is amazing, as always. Robert Richardson's Cinematography captures the journey of the man stunningly.

Performance-Wise: Leonardo DiCaprio is fabulous as Mr.Howard Hughes. Leo is one of the finest actors to have stepped in films, and this biopic proves that fact yet again. Cate Blanchett is flawless as the legendary Katharine Hepburn. Kate Beckinsale is good. Alec Baldwin is superb. But the real show-stopper here, is undoubtedly, Alan Alda. The veteran plays the role of a Con/Senator with great style and ease.

On the whole, An Oustanding Film In All Respects. A Biopic That Leaves You Dazzled! Two Big Thumbs Up!",10
14 June 2005,Well made but in some need of objective editing,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier.

13 April 2005,Heavy going,"Too long, too intense. I had a migraine before the film had finished.

Reasonable acting: I especially liked Alan Alda's character. Performances by Cate and Leo were also very good.

An interesting biography exploring Hughes early career, it left me wanting to know more about the man.

One aspect I enjoyed was the exploration of Hughes' character: his creative genius, his determination and his extraordinary ambition. He blew the lid on what was impossible because to him, if you thought it, you could do it.

A bit of trivia: both Hughes and his one-time love Ava Gardner had the same birthday - 24th December.

I suspect this film was more ""one for the boys"". My husband loved it.",5
4 March 2005,Oscar for film editing? ? I think not.,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",7
13 February 2005,Ahead in the clouds...,"When it comes to filmed biographies, I set a simple standard. For me the minimum expectation in seeing a film biography is that, in the end, I walk away with the feeling that I have met someone worth meeting. Just because the subject of the film is famous or important won't impress me; the film has to prove that that person should be important to me.

I mean, when I left the film MELVIN AND HOWARD, a slice-of-life comedy about Melvin Dumar whose brief encounter with celebrity gave him his 15 minutes of fame, I was exhilarated; the film introduced me to someone unique, someone I was glad I met, no matter how fleeting the meeting or fleeting his fame. On the other hand, when I walked out of RAGING BULL and GOODFELLAS, two wildly overpraised bios by Martin Scorsese, my honest reaction was ""So what?"" Jake LaMotta and Henry Hill were of no interest to me before those films and are of even less interest to me now. And nothing Scorsese did stylistically within those films made those characters in any way interesting. I think RAGING BULL and GOODFELLAS are lousy movies because those characters did not touch me in anyway.

Now here is Scorsese, the maker of those two films, directing a biopic about Howard Hughes, the Howard in MELVIN AND HOWARD. The film does have one thing in its favor immediately: Hughes was one fascinating individual, so it would seem almost impossible to make an uninteresting film about him. Though, one would have to overlook THE CARPETBAGGERS, the silly 1962 soap opera loosely based on Hughes' life; and to take into account that the subject of THE LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ was also an incredible individual, yet Scorsese managed to do a total hatched job on him.

THE AVIATOR suffers from the same problem as most biopics: too much story, too much man, too much legend and too little time. Who he was competes for screen time with what he did. Even as it pushes toward three hours, it barely touches upon the influence that the man had. A whole film could have been made just about his dabbling in movie making. But the film does a great job at targeting the highlights of his early life and using those moments to illustrate his advancing state of mental illness. And even then, the film seems incomplete as it ends his story long before the intensity of Hughes' mental illness took control of his life. Ironically, the film takes on too much of his life and yet doesn't cover enough of it.

Perhaps the most interesting thing about THE AVIATOR is that it a sympathetic story about a multimillionaire. Indeed the film's advertising sells it as a man-against-the-system success story, even though the battles he fights are largely designed to consolidate his power and increase his wealth. What Hughes does in the film seems neither more nor less ruthless, reckless and/or self-centered than any of his adversaries. He was, it would seem, born into wealth; lived the life of a spoiled playboy, noted for his numerous affairs; and excelled at being an aggressive businessman, not above hostile takeovers. Just the sort of character that Hollywood loves to hate. The film could have easily painted a very cruel and negative picture of Hughes, but, perhaps because of his mental illness -- or perhaps because, like Scorsese, Hughes was an obsessive filmmaker -- the story is at the very least respectful of the man and his accomplishments.

At first Leonard DiCaprio seems far too young to play Hughes, especially as the prevailing image of Hughes is either that of an older man in his prime or as an old man, stewing in the decay of his own mental illness and the cocoon of wealth. But DiCaprio does a remarkable job of showing us that Hughes had a youth, that he was an angry, aggressive young man of considerable ambition and a degree of genius. And DiCaprio takes Hughes past the stages of callow youth and into the physical and mental decline of a wounded warrior. One hopes that DiCaprio will revisit the character in a decade or two to explore the second half of the millionaire's eccentric life. There is more to be told and DiCaprio seems to have the talent to see this man's life through. DiCaprio's efforts are only overshadowed by Cate Blanchett's scene-stealing turn as a strong-willed and tough-minded Katharine Hepburn.

If I have any real problem with THE AVIATOR it is that it does seem to adhere to the standard biopic blueprint of this-happened-that-happened. The story might have been better approached in the style of CITIZEN KANE, juggling the past with the present, telling the story from various viewpoints. After all, Hughes was a Kane-like figure: powerful, ruthless, kind, self-important and contradictory. KANE's message was that you can't really get to know a man; THE AVIATOR seems to think it knows its subject a little too well. But as is, the film is a solid and entertaining piece of stylish and colorful film-making. It takes off and stays aloft until the end.",7
7 February 2005,"Europeans, beware of the good rating!","I made the mistake to read only American reviews before seeing the movie. I would have avoided the film. European reviews draw a different picture of it. The reason is simple: The movie assumes a lot of knowledge about the subject and American zeitgeist. You need to catch some keywords and names, and you need to recognise their meaning and produce the associated American emotions. If you cannot you will see a long and confusing film. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying the movie is bad. I am just saying non-Americans have a harder time understanding and thus enjoying it. However, if you want to get a glimpse of how the entrepreneurial spirit of our brothers and sisters on the other side of the Atlantic has evolved this film might be for you.

22 January 2006,Could have been a wonder,"This movie could have been a wonder if the main character had been portrayed by anybody else but Di Caprio. I have to confess that I appreciate Mister Caprio's efforts to fit the great and complex character, but its not enough, obviously. He does not succeed in making us forget leonardo and see Howard. The womanizer Hughes was not present at all: Leonardo is shy and appears as such. The ""Lolita"" scenes with the 15 years old actress is not believable. seduction and Bluff parts of Hughes' personality were not there. Good rates: Alan Alda, mean and corrupted ; Kate Blanchett as Kate Hepburn: wonderful!; John C.Reilly: good as usual in a supporting role; the story. Other bad rates: the coloring choices: interesting but not always relevant (ex: the golf party between Hughes and hepburn).

Please watch it anyway, it's worth it, but it could have been a great movie. Robert Downey Jr did well in ""Chaplin"" what Leonardo Di Caprio fails here. But it was not an easy challenge. Congatulations anyway for your real efforts, Leonardo.",5
28 June 2007,Utterly boring,"The tempo is slow, there story is very thin and apart from the senate hearing this movie is utterly boring and most of all irritating. While I am sure it is possible to depict Howard Hughes'OCD problems in a way that makes it interesting it is only annoying in this movie.

Apart from that the personal portraits of more or less everyone except for Hughes himself are vague, hastily done and poorly introduced into the plot. This goes especially for the women in his life.

There is a saying; never send a boy to do a man's job. This has never been more true than in the case of Leonardo Di Caprio. He'd better stick to playing lover-boy in his early twenties, because whenever he tries to play a grown-up man he fails utterly.

21 March 2023,The Man. The Legend.,"Howard Hughes was an ambitious man, visionary and a pioneer in his field. He had dreams he wanted to realize at all cost. And he did. He was wealthy and determined and became a legend.

'The Aviator' is the fascinating story of billionaire aviator and movie producer Howard Hughes' life, how it all started and his accomplishments regardless of the many obstacles he had to overcome.

Leonardi DiCaprio delivers a fantastic performances as Howard Hughes. The cinematography is very good, with excellent aerial photography, and good visuals.

'The Aviator' is a fantastic production, but I found the runtime of almost 3 hours just a tad to long.

20 February 2005,Biopic or testimonial?,"This Scorsese-DiCaprio epic is a visual and audible feast. All the media blitzing seems warranted from the perspective of bang for your movie bucks. The special effects are thrilling. The camera work is hypnotizing. The shots are suitably grand or movingly intimate. And, the viewer is guaranteed 170 minutes of semi-solid entertainment. I cringed at the initial sound of Cate's Kate, but I was won over very quickly. I winced at the first sight of Beckinsale's Gardner, but I was soon reassured by her delivery of Ava-speak, frank and earthy. Mr DiCaprio's representation of Hughes was less problematic, since the recluse Hughes left a relatively forgotten audio-visual legacy. Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda were really quite good. Alda's Senator Brewster rivals Charles Laughton's Senator Cooley in Preminger's ""Advise and Consent"" (1962).

But, is it biopic or testimonial? And, as either or both, is the film a well constructed and coherent piece of work? The exploration of Howard Hughes' eccentricities certainly is coherently and cogently done. This is no mean feat. The man lived a relatively long and very eventful life, despite crippling personality traits. The political material late in the film did seem more testimonial than biopic. I felt I was fairly warned by the earlier scene, in which Hughes scolds the rich socialists at the Hepburn table in Connecticut. In any case, I think it fair to summarize one of the movie's underlying prejudices as ""Unrestrained capitalism is good."" It is indeed a timely message. However, I wonder if this timely viewpoint will stand the test of time and art.",7
28 January 2005,Not all it was cracked up to be.,"Although Hughes was well known in America this film perhaps assumes the international viewer has too much knowledge of Hughes' oddities and wealth. I watched it with two others who kept needing background information. The film dragged at times and both others wandered off before the ending. The film seemed to end too abruptly as if someone from the studio had said 'enough already' and Hughes' descent during the latter years of his life was ignored. Leonardo was good at times (especially the Senate hearings) which was a surprise, and he had some fabulous performances supporting him. It'll probably win Oscars but only because Hollywood all get together to agree the Emporer is wearing fine clothes. At the end I am left wanting only to go buy Hell's Angels and Scarface.

2 April 2006,Excellent!,"The Aviator/2004/

Main Stars:

Leonardo DiCaprio

Cate Blanchett

Kate Beckinsale I never knew Howard Hughes's life was really that interesting. I thought that Howard Hughes was just a rich obsessive-compulsive guy who wasn't worth knowing about. When I saw this movie that thought definitely went away. He really had a big influence on planes and movies about them. Of course, seeing Leonardo DiCaprio's buttocks was extremely nauseating but the movie itself was amazing! Some people may be familiar with the movie ""Hell's Angels"" (a movie about World War I) and in this movie there was a big scene about that with planes flying around like one hundred birds in the air. What I really thought was amazing in this movie was the cinematography (the filming) because of how the camera moved around it is really difficult to explain why it was so good but in my opinion, it just was. Actually, the movie did win an Academy Award for the cinematography so apparently I'm not the only one that thinks this movie had really good filming. As you probably know, this movie won a few Academy Awards and was nominated for a few more besides cinematography and I thought it really deserved that. I especially wanted Leonardo DiCaprio (playing Howard Hughes) to win an Academy Award for Best Actor but he was only nominated for that. He, along with Cate Blanchett (playing Katherine Hepburn) and Kate Beckinsale (playing Ava Gardner) were the best actors (actresses) in the movie. Howard Hughes is known to be obsessive-compulsive. He also is known to be one of the most famous aviators of all time. Katherine Hepburn is known to be outgoing, independent, and to me she seems quite annoying in a way. And Ava Gardner is known to be adventurous, quite calm, and also independent. In my opinion, the actor and actresses that played them played their roles perfectly. In my opinion, nothing at all was boring in this movie but my brother really thought so because he doesn't like these types of movies at all. He really is a big fan of vulgar comedies. Anyway, in this last sentence, I will tell you what this movie was about- this movie was specifically about the history of Howard Hughes's life. I'm sorry for a very long review but there's just a whole lot to talk about in this classic film. By the way, this movie is very long (about three hours) and I think you know what I am going to tell you- go to the bathroom. Movie directed by Martin Scorsese.",
5 September 2015,One of Scorcese's Very Best Works; Ten out of Ten,"This is the first Scorsese film I ever saw. It is also, with the admission that I have not seen anything close to all his films, one of his greatest. At over two and a half hours long, it is a sprawling epic through the rise and fall of one of the era's biggest personalities. Yet it seems quick, much like some of the airplanes Hughes sought to build. Not short in any way, shape, or form. But quick. It doesn't lag. It doesn't linger too long.

Martin Scorsese, managing to not show any signs of slowing down even after all those decades of filmmaking, has developed such an intuition for film that it makes this film look like it itself has an intuition. Every time it needs to stay on a moment, it stays. Every time it needs to whip through time, it does so properly (you'd think this one would be simple, but it can be done great (this), well (most films), or badly (the first thing that jumped into my head was The Notebook, which jumped across the one big event during its timespan (WWII) in about five minutes)). When it lifts you up, you feel like you are flying. And when it takes a turn for the emotionally disturbing, you feel like your spirit crashed. This is a film that gave me the feeling that it knew exactly what it was doing and that never let me down.

By the way, is it just me, or is 2004 an underrated year for film? Both this film and the last one that I reviewed (HP:PoA) were made in that year. As were The Incredibles, Million Dollar Baby, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. All five of these films have passed into the category of 'If you don't like this film, your taste leaves something to be desired.' Four of them (sorry Million Dollar Baby, I really like you but I don't love you) are in my top 100 films of all time.

'Twas a quite competitive year indeed. Yet I do believe that in many respects, this film tops it. While it is not my favorite film of the year (that would be ESotSM), it is the film that I believe should have won best picture that year. If there is one movie that best represented achievements in cinema in this year, it is this movie.

As a fan of aviation, I had heard of Howard Hughes. I knew a general outline of his life. But my prior knowledge was naught but a skeleton compared to what I now know. I do believe that I am one of the best arguments against those who say that film cannot educate you about the physical world about us. I have learned far more about the world and the people in it from films and articles than I ever did from school. to quote Mark Twain, ""I have never let school interfere with my education."" All this is a roundabout way of saying that this film paints in your mind a stylish picture of Hughes' life that both rings true and resonant.

I am surprised that there had never been a good biopic of Hughes before this. Given how eventful his life was, it wouldn't be hard. And given his contributions to film, I'm surprised Hollywood hadn't taken an opportunity to once more pat themselves on the back. He is one of the truest examples of the eccentric, popular, multi-talented, billionaires that make the first few decades of the 20th century some of my favorite in all of history and that are so noticeably absent from the world today. And I would argue that few people made more of an impact on this time period than Howard Hughes.

This film shows that. The brash young Texan goes into movies and aviation and... a lot more.This is the first sentence of his Wikipedia page: Howard Robard Hughes, Jr. (December 24, 1905 – April 5, 1976) was an American business tycoon, entrepreneur, investor, aviator, aerospace engineer, inventor, filmmaker and philanthropist. He was a man of high highs and low lows, and there is no one better to show these complexities than the man I consider to be the greatest actor of his generation, Leo DiCaprio. As a fan of Leo and of Hughes, I was hoping that he would deliver. And he did. While I think that he should have an Oscar or two by now for various roles, he is at his absolute best here. I would even argue that it is one of the ten or fifteen greatest performances ever filmed.

You may notice on that Wikipedia description that he did not die until 1976. This film does not show him in his last few decades of life, usual for a biopic. There is a reason for that. With disabling OCD and without proper medication, Hughes went... well, insane.

This film handles that, like everything else, very well. It shows his descent into darkness in startling detail, filming it in such a way that one could not think anything but that he was going insane. Many films would have shyed away from this. Others would have exploited it. Not the crack team of Scorsese/DiCaprio. You get the feeling that you are in cold but unmaleficent hands. What is shown is exactly what needs to be shown for purpose's sake. Nothing more or less.

Watching the film again, I almost wanted Hughes to die in the plane crash so he wouldn't be subjected to torment. But it wasn't a simple feeling. Rather, it was a complex, fully realized one. Not that many movies back me feel that way. Like its subject, it is one of a kind.",10
2 November 2016,Di Caprio's finest performance!,"I had never before heard of Howard Hughes, let alone be aware of his nature and his achievements. After watching this movie I thought I was watching Howard Hughes himself living, in all his eccentric, paranoid self and his love for aviation. Leonardo Di Caprio is my favourite actor, and after watching this movie in 2016, I cannot help but wonder, how can any performance surpass his depiction of Howard Hughes for the Oscars!! The movie was beautifully directed by the legend Martin Scorsese. Subtle details like the use of lights, flashes etc to highlight eccentric nature of the main character were phenomenal. For instance when Howard Hughes locks himself up in a room, my focus was on his fingernails which they showed to have grown several inches as he hadn't gotten out of that room. In all a must watch movie for everyone who wants to enjoy good film making.

12 January 2005,Leonardo v Tommy Lee Jones,"Although I thought Scorcese had done a good job on this picture, I think it disappoints by not really getting to really express just what Howard Hughes was all about. In two and a half hours a lot more story and lot less glitz could have been shown. I have read several books on Hughes including the Noah Detreich tome. The film missed a lot about Hughes the man and really spent too much time on just a few of the movies he made and a fairly watered down version of what the man achieved as an entrepreneur aviator and inventor. Anybody going to see The Aviator to learn about Hughes would not be much wiser after seeing it.

However, it is a good film and I enjoyed it. The only problem I have with Martin Scorcese is that he has made so many great films I think I just expects him to be near perfect every time.

Just a footnote, an earlier TV movie ""The Amazing Howard Hughes"" with Tommy Lee Jones as Hughes and Ed Flanders as Detreich was a much more informative account of the life of Howard Hughes. If Howard Hughes is of interest to you this version also based on Detreich's book is well worth checking out.

After seeing ""The Aviator"" I watched the Tommy Lee Jones movie again on video as I think Leo De Caprio must have also. I mention that as Leo's impression of Tommy Lee Jones playing Howard Hughes was near perfect. Both actors have great talent but which one is most convincing.",7
3 March 2007,Million Dollar Baby's got NOTHING on This!,"This is a great film. Don't be put off by the long running time. It flies by and is over before you know it. It really leaves you wanting more. Despite the fact that I often call him Decrapio, Leo really shows that he's a very capable, even (gasp) good actor. He really brings out Hughes' personality (whether this movie is an accurate portrayal of Hughes or not, I don't know nor do I care) from his start in the film business with hints of odd behavior to his aviation skills to his descent into paranoia and OCD. I daresay that this is Scorsese's best-looking film. The crash sequence is simultaneously beautiful and deeply disturbing. It gets a little artsy here and there but overall it's breathtaking. It loses points for two things. First, I never felt much sympathy for Hughes for most of the film, except for the end, where his disease overtakes him. I don't know if this is the fault of the character, the script, or the actor, but I felt an odd detachment throughout this film. The other is Cate Blanchett's role as Hepburn. It struck me as more of a parody of her than a portrayal. But this should not stop anyone from watching this film. It's not a classic, but it's still a great and memorable film.",8
1 March 2006,Flying high in the sky!,"A great film! It does have its faults but they are few and far between. After working with Martin Scoresse on Gangs Of New York I was a little skeptical on whether this would be the same fare, Leo being out acted and not really achieving much of a sensible story, but here it all comes together and why Leo never got that Oscar is beyond me, the boy is marvelous!

Playing Howard Hughes, an aviator and film director/producer and rampant womanizer with a passion and obsession leo pulls it off and truly shows he is not just a pretty face!

Direction is what truly makes this film and Scoresse shows his love of the old days and their films, its like watching a fan of golden oldies talk about the old films and industry. Fulid camera work, a mesmerizing score and nods the stars of old and still telling a story of obstacles and victory, of happiness and sadness and with tragic under tones makes the Aviator a film not only to watch but to own!",9
25 January 2005,"Brilliant, sad","Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator"" is the tragic story of how a man's grand genius practically destroys his mind. It's also a glorious homage to the golden years of Hollywood, and to a man's strength in expanding upon his empire, defeating his criticizers and, most of the time, winning.

The man is Howard Hughes, infamous movie and airplane mogul who got his start directing ""Hell's Angels"" in the late twenties. The movie opens here, with Hughes begging for just two more cameras, so that he can have twenty-six instead of a mere twenty-four to make the big climactic dogfight scene. Once he succeeds and the movie is nearly done, but then ""The Jazz Singer"" is released and Hughes decides to re-shoot the entire movie in sound. His assistant Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly) is skeptical. Everyone is skeptical. Hughes ignores them and does it anyway.

These beginning scenes have a breakneck pace and involve Hugh emptying his pockets over and over again. To everyone else this seems like a plan to go broke, but Hughes sees things in the long run, knowing that if ""Hell's Angels"" is made with sound, more people will see it, more times. He is wise, and knows his plans will pull through in the end; it's his high-strung, nervous demeanor that puts everyone else off.

After ""Hell's Angels"" Hughes switches from making movies to making airplanesfast, revolutionary airplanes. He makes his planes the same way he makes his movies: dozens of last minute improvements, mind-changing, and lots and lots of money loss. He remains confident; it is his stubbornness and ego that drive him to his accomplishments.

But he has a problem, one few know about. It is severe OCD, though I don't think the phrase had been coined yet. Because of some scarring episodes with his mother when he was a child Howard goes through the rest of his life worrying a lot about germs. Since he is an inherited millionaire he is able to feed his worries: people accept it when he asks for one steak and exactly six peas.

Meanwhile he manages to balance this with a life of womanizing. Hughes was famous for dating many successful actresses, of which Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) and Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) are seen most in the film.

Cate Blanchett does not significantly resemble Hepburn  she probably wouldn't be the first to come to mind for the part  but after seeing her in it I can't imagine anyone else in the part. She is perfectthis girl can act. For anyone else it would be an impersonation but for Blanchett it's a performance. Her scenes are wonderfulthe presence of Hepburn in the movie is not used as a gimmick or a cameo, but as an actual part of the film, a significant part of Hughes' life. She has some very heartwarming and heartbreaking scenes, her performance is a delight, richly deserving her Oscar nomination (and maybe a win too).

Indeed, since most of the cast are playing celebrities, it opens it up for them to overact or impersonate their characters, but all of the actors hit just the right note, like Kate Beckinsale as the proud Gardner or Jude Law showing up as the gaudy, obnoxious Errol Flynn. Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda play Hughes foremost enemies: scheming Panam head Juan Trippe and Brewster, the senator that Trippe has bought.

Both Baldwin and Alda have excellent scenes where they try to play off of Hughes' OCD to throw him off during negotiations: one where Trippe speaks to Hughes through an office room door and blows his pipe smoke through the keyhole into the room and another where during a dinner Brewster places a fingertip on Hughes' glass while serving him nearly raw fish. Hughes reacts to both these situations in a different way, but he is always desperately trying to maneuver himself out from under the schemes of those plotting against him.

Hughes does a different kind of maneuvering, in the scenes where his money pays off (or doesn't) when he flies his planes. One scene in particular, is stunning, when Hughes takes his newest plane for a ride, breaks a speed record, but loses control over Beverly Hills. It would be a sin for me to spoil what happens, but I can say that it is an exciting, scary thrill of a scene.

Martin Scorsese directs excellently, this is one of his best films. Many of his films take place over a span of many decades, but this is the first one I've seen that captures these periods so beautifully. The cinematography is wonderful, filming each decade the way movies were filmed then (just, with colour), not a gimmick but a smart way of creating a flow. Most films are either all style or all substance, but Scorsese is one of the few who can meld them both into an emotionally and visually intriguing film.

Oh, and Howard Hughes is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, not the first actor you'd think of (like, say, Jason Robards). He doesn't look like the man, no, but why should that be an issue with acting? DiCaprio masters the mannerisms, the glory and the madness. It is a magnificent performance, one that takes a person who was a potential genius and follows him through his life. The film ends on the perfect note, which pretty much sums up the remainder of Hughes life. It is a film to see.

6 February 2005,Better than I thought and an unsurprising Oscar contender,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs

A film chronicling the first year in the life of Howard Hughes,the aviation expert and movie mogul from the 1920s to 1940s period of his life.

What surprised me more than anything about the film was the surprisingly commanding lead performance from Leonardo Di Caprio,who delivers a very good portrayal of the arrogant,domineering,self-absorbed and increasingly freakishly eccentric Hughes,working his way through two relationships to women he never really loved and working his way through an assortment of other arm candy for use at film premieres and so-on yet his real passion lay almost autisticly in flying.Di Caprio has good support in the shape of Alec Baldwin as the head of his rival air company Pan Am Airlines,Kate Blanchett as his first girlfriend,actress Katie Hepburn,and Kate Beckinsale as his second girlfriend,movie actress Ava Gardner.That's not to mention a cameo from Jude Law (surprisingly good for once!) as movie heart-throb Eeroyl Flynn (it says a lot that the best thing I've seen him in so far has seen him with screen-time of just about a minute!)Yet as good as they are,it is simply Di Caprio who carries the film.He deserves to win the Oscar.

The film is also served well by a good script,with nice dialogue.But it's weakness is probably the story,which lacks coherence slightly,Nevertheless,it's a very good film,very well made and very deserving to win at the Oscars.*****",
13 September 2006,"Great DiCaprio, good movie","I've never liked DiCaprio before, but this film has changed my mind. Here he's excellent and the main pillar of this quite long movie.

The story is OK, but photography is a piece of art. Sometimes the camera reminded me of the famous scenes in Taxi Driver, the music did anyway.

For me, the most impressing thing about this film how DiCaprio displays the paranoid side of his character. He must have studied persons suffering from this disease before.

Even if you're not a particular fan of aviation, Dicaprio or Scorsese, you cannot go wrong watching this movie. Enjoy!

1 October 2006,Excellent!,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",10
10 June 2005,Fly away...,"While ""The Aviator"" is by no means a badly made movie, it isn't what this reviewer would call a compelling enough film to own or to watch more than once. That is of course unless your extremely fascinated by Howard Hughes, planes, or aviation history in general.

Yes, Howard Hughes was an eccentric, obsessive compulsive billionaire who had his share of Hollywood romances. And indeed, he is an important historical figure.

""The Aviator"" suffers from one main thing: script! This biographical account of Howard Hughes just isn't that intriguing to watch more than once. With all the millions spent on the production and the actors, it would have been nicer to see a more enticing script & dialogue that would prove worthy of multiple viewings.

Leo, Cate, John C Reilly, Kate Beckinsale and all the others due fine jobs in the film. Leo is an outstanding actor, and so are the others. His portrayal of Hughes is just fine, and I doubt that anyone could have done any better.

After viewing any film, one has to ask themselves...""would I want to see this again""? Some people are more than content seeing a movie only once, and then moving on to the next film.

What I find to make the difference between good and great movies, are the ones that leave the audience wanting more: whether in the form of a sequel or in the form of a repeat viewing.

At almost 3 hours long, I had had enough of ""The Aviator"" by the time it was done.

I'm glad I saw it once, but I wouldn't want to see any more. On the contrary, a film like this might have proved better by the ""less is more"" theory.

Oscar worthy? No...not really. Not for best film or director that is for sure. Leo deserved his nod for ""Best Actor"", but I can clearly see why Cate Blanchett walked away from the Oscars with the real victory of the film. Her performance of Katherine Hepburn was short and exhilarating - which is one thing that the rest of ""The Aviator"" could have benefited from. The crash scene in ""The Aviator"" does stands out as a very livid and intense sequence though. It's a very well done segment.

If you go into ""The Aviator"" with no expectations and without believing all the ""hype"" that it's such a fantastic movie, then it shouldn't fail to disappoint you. Otherwise, it more than likely will. By the time the end rolls around, ""The Aviator"" can only be summed up as just an ""O.k."" movie.

Worth the rental, but for the movie itself (excluding extra features); just not worth the entry in this reviewers DVD collection",5
27 August 2021,Very Good,"Performances were great.

Leo and Martin did a great job as usual.

A movie that describes its era very well. I like it.

5 April 2006,"Bravo Mr. DiCaprio, Mr. Hughes, The Entire Cast and Story, Bravo!!","This is the movie changed my mind about DiCaprio - he is positively brilliant as Howard Hughes a man whom I've always held in the highest regard. Having said that makes me also focus on the films one flaw. the compulsion to portray the exceptional as eccentric or flawed psychologically. At the beginning of the 20th Century we much admired the brilliant and extraordinarily productive; now the trend - indoctrinated by the NEA schools and academia - is to find them abnormal and praise, instead, conformity. All part of Dewey's plan for education to create a docile compliant citizenry. How VERY wrong that is. Fortunately the gifted people who produced this film and the superb acting by all make this a truly memorable experience. HBH

5 January 2005,Way too long,"I concur with many of the other user comments: this film could have been so much better. The actors are astounding; they make you believe they are the character just as actors are supposed to. Leonardo, Cate Blanchett and Alan Alda give stand-out performances. Cate, as Katherine Hepburn, actually made me forget it was a role she was playing. Leonardo, in a very nuanced performance, was in nearly every scene; quite a task for a performer. He carries the film without getting tedious with his performance. It's the subject matter as presented I have fault with. I didn't care about Howard and holding the camera on his compulsive traits did not make me care about him more. The things I did care about (the drive of life for Howard and the people around him in the 1930s) were sort of glossed over. Martin Scorsese: I expected so much more from you!!

11 March 2023,"Simply put, it's a great movie","The movie starts off light and, in my opinion, is not particularly exciting

About halfway through the movie, I was thinking of stopping it. However, I'm glad I didn't, as it became an engaging film from that point on.

A bit more details The film chronicles the early life of Hughes, from the late 1920s to the 1940s, highlighting his accomplishments as an aviation entrepreneur and movie producer. The movie shows Hughes' passion for flying and his determination to build advanced aircraft. It also touches upon his personal life, including his romantic relationships and struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder.

8 January 2021,Mix of all the best things in cinematography,"A time ago I couldn't decide between all the movies that Leonardo Dicaprio already starred but this one made my choice. The technique (teal orange) used in most of the half part, the environmentalization and the cast was a perfect mix. Scorcese did for sure one of the greatest works of all time.

10 February 2005,Pretty Much A Movie In Search Of A Purpose,"""The Aviator"" is tiresomely overlong, anti-climactic, and indeed as purposeless a screen biography as I've ever seen. Further to the film's discredit, Leonardo DiCaprio is overparted in just the way Patty Duke was when she attempted adult roles. Lacking sufficient presence, he too looks annoyingly just like a high school student dressed up to play a grownup. This limitation robs almost all his scenes of any clout. An exception are those in which he debates with a Senate committee and to succeed needs only recite the well written, David Mamet-like lines there given him. Otherwise, he's pretty much a disaster. Even worse, though equally overpraised in the press, is the usually fine actress Cate Blanchett who does not so much act the role of Katherine Hepburn as mimic that great star in the manner of a female impersonator. With her thrust forward jaw and quavering ""Howids,"" she too was impossible to believe for a minute. Two stars to this film for the scenes mentioned, the fine retro ties, and the art deco and forties sets.

10 February 2005,It's a talkie!,"A great night out at the movies. Leonardo and Scorcese are a great combo, different from the Deniro-Scorcese combo, but just as strong and a dynamic-duo all the same. They seem to be more of a positive combo than the dark films Scorcese made with DeNiro. ""Aviator"" is Scorcese's most ""Hollywood"" movie since ""Cape Fear"" and is about 100 times better. One thing about Scorcese is you can tell he is passionate about his subjects. Howard Hughes is a real ""American dream"" and has a rise and fall and rise again story that everyone loves to hear about. All of the actors are great. Blanchett is annoying but only because she does Hepburn so well (Hepburn was, to me, annoying, but also endearing). Leo DiCaprio is great as Hughes. Alda and Baldwin add to the mix. It was really just a very entertaining film, one of my favorites of the year and a pleasant surprise. It really made me more interested about Howard Hughes, how he literally lived every day like it was his last and what it cost him along the way. 9 out of 10. A-. In my top five this year.

7 August 2012,The Dark Side of a Hollywood Hero,"Biopics almost always run the risk of being criticized for not being accurate representations and 'The Aviator' has had its share of flack. But, rather than being a film about Howard Hughes, it's more specifically about Hughes's passion, whether for films or airplanes, and how he struggled and what he sacrificed to pursue his ultimate goal.

Scorsese's films unique technique has often been praised and the slightly washed out sepia tinted picture in the initial portions of the film do add to a feel of the first half of the 20th century. Additional credit must go to the set designer, art director, costume department, makeup artist and score for recreating the 20s, 30s and 40s. The cinematography is fine. However, the overuse of turquoise in the sepia tinted scenes was a little distracting.

After showing a glimpse of Hughes's childhood, Scorsese focuses on his life from the 20s to the 40s. He was married and was known to have liaisons with various glamorous women but the 'The Aviator' focuses mainly on his relationship with Katherine Hepburn and Ava Gardner and does a superb job in depicting them. The obsessive compulsive mysophobia was cleverly introduced in the film and becomes a crucial obstacle for Howard. His mental torment and struggle to fight his own demons is captured very well.

This is another career redefining film for Leonardo Dicaprio who performs all guns blazing. Playing a complex character with so many shades couldn't have been an easy job but Dicaprio proves that he is capable of doing it. Fiery Cate Blanchett is spellbinding as Katherine Hepburn. How she captures every nuance of the legendary actress is astonishing. Luminous Kate Beckinsale is a delight and she plays Ava Gardner with subtle sensuality and elegance. John C. Reilly, Matt Ross, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda and Frances Conroy provide fine support.

'The Aviator' is ambitious, stylish and classy. I would have liked to see more of Hughes's mental struggle and how he learned to live with it and perhaps more about his relationship with his wife. Then again perhaps this would make the film too long for the standard Hollywood pic.",

28 December 2005,Stewardess get me a pillow this is going to be a long flight.,"The first hour had me but as the film dragged on I didn't really care anymore. Planes, planes planes, wash hands, planes, wash hands, planes, wash hands... The choice of Leonardo Di Caprio to play Howard Hughes seemed logical for the first scenes when Hughes was in his 20s but as he progresses into his 30s and 40s Di Caprio cannot shake off those boyish young looks taking away much of the believability and his constant forced furrowed brow really bugged me. I wanted to yell ""Leo stop squinting!"" Cate Blanchett i found interesting and her slight over caricature of Kate Hepburn didn't bother me. John C. Reilly (always on top form) and the use of Technicolour for the scenes set in the 30s is ambitious as is some of the cinematography.

Unfortunately we learn little about Hughes which for a biopec is pretty pointless. We don't get any insight to how his parents founded his empire, how much he was actually worth, why he suffered from mental illness and compulsive cleanliness or what inspired him to become a visionary engineer. In the end the story just waaayy toooo slooooow and i reverted to forwarding past the boring conversations in the hope of something interesting...it never came. As much as I wanted to like it put both my girlfriend and I to sleep and we turned it off before the end. 5 YAWNS.",5
24 January 2015,All about action...,"""The Aviator"" is a movie which is based on the life of director and aviator Howard Hughes and in his career. This movie has to do with the career of Howard Hughes and especially how this influenced his life. Also in this movie we can observe the every day life of Howard Hughes, which were his ambitions for his life and of course his routine.

I liked this movie very much because first of all it's based on true facts, secondly because of the cast and its interpretations and thirdly because of the direction. I believe that the interpretation of Leonardo DiCaprio who played as Howard Hughes was really good and in many cases outstanding but I have to say that the interpretation which left me speechless was Cate Blanchett's who played as Katharine Hepburn. The direction of Martin Scorsese for one more time was really good and I think that he deserved a credit for it.

Lastly I believe that ""The Aviator"" is a must see movie which everyone has to watch. This movie can teach us and give us many things to think about such as the another part of our selves.",8
4 March 2005,A Brilliant High-Flying Epic,"Focusing from his early years (from the 1930 production of 'Hell's Angels' to the 1947 test flight of the blue Spruce,when he was 42),this is the story of how Howard Hughes transformed a small fortune into a massive one.Howard Hughes(Di Caprio) quickly moved to LA to become a Hollywood film producer,where he helped launch the career of Jean Harlow and other scarlets,and producing such as classics as Hell's Angels,The Front Page and the 1932 Scarface.Hughes legend come not from focusing on just Hollywood,however as he simultaneously branched into industry after industry,including aviation in 1932(including TWA Airlines,and during World War II,defense,leading leading to the creation of the Spruce Goose,a flying boat of immense size).

Martin Scorsese once again make a brilliant movie of high flying epic abut story of Howard Hughes.There's no doubt about his works because he always gives the best effort to make a gorgeous and high class films such as Taxi Driver,Goodfellas,Raging Bull,etc.Scorsese also made his second collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio after Gangs of New York.DiCaprio gives a wonderful performance and become more mature to select a good role.We can give him a big applause for his talented acting to play the character of Howard Hughes.

But don't forget Cate Blanchett.She plays the character of Katherine Hepburn and once again gives her high class acting and Oscar performance.John Logan who write the script has done the job very well.Not perfect but it doesn't disappoint me.And the last I'd like to give an honor to the beautiful score composed by Howard Shore and very nice cinematography captured by Robert Richardson.

I really recommend this movie.My opinion,this is absolutely Film of the Year! Maybe The Aviator isn't better than other Scorsese's movie,but Scorsese has work very hard this time and deserves to get the Oscar.I hope so.

25 May 2014,"Beautifully Filmed and Realistic,","The Aviator is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. There was clearly an awful lot of money put in to making this movie and it really shows. It is beautifully filmed, you can tell that Martin Scorsese was really intrigued by the life of Howard Hughes and went through so much effort to make this biography a realistic and authentic portrayal of the man's life.

The film does tend to drag. Running at almost three hours, there are a lot of details that I found unnecessary and made the movie somewhat monotonous for me, it lingers on many scenes that are far too dialogue heavy.

Leonardo DiCaprio is not someone who would strike me as perfect casting for Hughes, he seems like a person that should be played by a more flamboyant actor. However, he succeeded beyond my expectations, he was extremely dedicated to the part and did a great job going from a snobby billionaire to an absolute psychopath later on in the movie. Cate Blanchett also delivered an outstanding performance as Katharine Hepburn. She is one of the greatest actresses in Hollywood at the moment and definitely deserved her Academy Award for this film, especially if you read in to the trivia for the amount of preparation she went through.

Wildly entertaining, energetic and well acted, The Aviator is an outstanding film that I would recommend to all moviegoers.

Biopic that follows the early years of fussy film director and aviator Howard Hughes, a man who always dreamed about the future.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",1
20 December 2004,King Leo...,"i originally did not want to go see this movie, but on a cold December (20th) Monday, off we went. at one point in time, i was totally infatuated with Howard Hughes (HH), & read everything i could about his life. so, i assumed the movie would be not only full of distortions, but also ""thought"" Leo was a terrible choice.

1st, the bad news, Scorsese did the requisite surface research, but, just did not seem able to capture the magic of Hughes's essence. the ""rosebud"" theory re: HH's slide into germ madness via his mother's influence was never really explored accurately, just little bits & pieces, haphazardly strung together at different parts of the movie, that come across as a convenient lazy way to attempt to explain Hughes inner depths & subsequent slide. in fact, it was both his mother & relatives who re-inforced his awareness of germ spread, as well as the premature deaths of both his parents, the smothering of his mother, & other personality-forming events from his 1st 18 yrs that may have equally contributed to his later madness. no one really knows. Scorsese's appearance of 1sthand knowledge of HH's relationships, scenes, & conversations with Hepburn & Ava appears to be too much artistic interpretation of HH's Hollywood yrs. Scorsese seems to accept too much of the hearsay as gospel & the relationships come off as affectations of the director, unfortunately. movie biographies are incredibly difficult to bring to the screen, & to bring someone as complicated & larger-than-life as HH's early yrs to the screen is particularly difficult. its too bad, Scorsese is not as attuned as this story demands, but given the amazingly difficult subject matter, he ""sort of"" tells the story within a framework that gets ""close, but only 1/2 a cigar"".

on the positive side, i must ""eat my hat"" & anyone else's who does NOT think that Leo was not an inspired choice! he was perfect! he was sublime! just as i became an early believer in Brad Pitt's terrific acting, i am now a believer in Leo's! he no longer has to prove himself. to say he ""nailed"" HH would be an amazing understatement. it was eerie watching his performance - he WAS HH. from his boyish good looks, just as HH's was, to his appearance before the congressional committee, to taking up the controls of the ""spruce goose"", he actually made you feel as if HH had come back to star in this film. an earlier review could not have been more wrong. anyone who has taken the trouble to read & view photos from these several periods in HH's life would HAVE to agree there is a remarkable similarity. capturing HH's obsession with the aerial scenes in ""hell's angels"", Russell's bra n ""the outlaw"", the aviation speed records, the undertaking of building the largest aircraft ever, the appearance before the congressional committee, the treatment of subordinates, the phobias, the obsession with details was sublime. as i said above, Scorsese does get close. maybe it was just too difficult.

in conclusion, with someone as brilliant, as complicated, as mad, as HH; it is virtually impossible to capture these nuances & transfer to the screen. ""Hollywood"" always errs in translation, then excuses itself for failing by falling back on the tried & true ""entertainment for entertainment's sake"", a la Oliver Stone unfortunate falsehoods wrapped in sincerity. on the other hand, no one should ever go to the movies expecting the truth. so therefore, Hollywood's ultimate contribution is story telling. knowing this, ""the aviator"" could have been made somewhat more interesting, less boring, & certainly shorter. true, it was too long, true, a number of scenes were unnecessarily long, as many in the audience expressed leaving the theatre. however, i did not share that sentiment. why? because, in spite of everything i have said, this was a good ""movie""! i believe Leo nailed the role better than Scorsese's direction, & a long movie was necessary to tell the story. wishing for a more factual rendition is probably too far beyond the talents that believe they have more talent than they actually have. if i had not been so mesmerized by Leo's unbelievable performance, this movie would not have been as entertaining. BUT, due to Leo's performance, the movie does take on life, & makes you believe what you're watching IS the early period of Hughes's life. the theory that the story is always the main feature is mostly a truism; however, every once in a while, an actor comes along that is able to ""lift up"" an endeavor, & we should all be appreciative.

as for HH, on the whole it was a sad life; however, for his 1st 45-47 yrs, he was a truly brilliant American pioneer who captured the public's imagination with his derring-do, warts & all! although the ""warts"" did not surface til later. one can say whatever they want, but his 1st 47 yrs could not have been more exciting or more magnetic.",8
3 January 2005,Great Entertainment,"The Aviator is a completely enthralling experience as a movie that excellently connects and communicates the ""BIG"" characteristics of its subject matter -- Howard Hughes, the Hell's Angels production, Hollywood, the emergence of aviation and the power of its technology, government, America's new obsession with stars, big business, and the destructive power of mental illness. Leonardo DiCaprio, who for years seems to have been searching for and consistently missing opportunities in which his talents are suited, is so fitting in this role. He knows ""BIG"", as a superstar following the Titanic craze, and as such is prepared for the burden required to play Howard Hughes in his heyday. The film is remarkably filmed, with such attention to details that work together to convey the ""BIG-ness"" of the story -- even down to the energetic performances of the singers in the lounge Hughes frequents. The musical score is a terrific partner in this effort as well. Alan Alda, now far enough away from his M.A.S.H. days, is believable in his role as the dirty Senator. Kate Blanchette, while off to a rough start as Katherine Hepburn (has an initial vibe of a caricature), finds her pace as the movie progresses and is able to deliver the duties of presenting Miss Hepburn as the last normal thing in Mr. Hughes' life. There is tremendous fun and excitement in this movie, but it never tumbles into the traps of over-doing it or cheesiness. Scorsese has crafted a wonderful cinematic experience, for those interested in a smart biographical portrayal.",9
25 February 2005,Shallow as the sea in low tide.,"Minor spoilers.

I will start with the only ray of light in this picture - Cate Blanchett. Her portrayal of Katharine Hepburn was simply immaculate, providing the so much needed depth and insight to this movie.

The rest is darkness. The Aviator is storytelling at it's worst. Covering 20 years of Howard Hughes' life the movie is actually more of a biographic encyclopedia entry rather than anything else. We simply follow the main character from one point in time to another (""Two years later..."", ""One hour later...""), from one project to another, as the movie lists his accomplishments and sometimes mentions his failures. The overall impression is that of a series of publicity shots, arranged to portray one of the most controversial figures in American history as the perfect American, living ""The Great American Dream"". The only fault that Howard Hughes appears to have is his compulsive behaviour disorder, and even that is attributed to his mother's dominating and apparently sick parenthood.

The movie is incredibly long, and yet three hours later we still don't know who Howard Hughes really was and what drove him (besides his love for airplanes of cause). We learn in the most ""matter of fact"" manner that 3 pilots were killed during the shooting of ""Hell's Angels"", but we never get to see how Hughes dealt with this fact on any level, personal or organizational. We see and hear of scores of women who entered his life and left a bit later, but they are just passing names to us. We see him hire an underage girl for ""private services"" but do not know why he did it. The list can go on forever.

Everything is made as simple as possible. Pan Am - bad, TWA - good. Mother - bad, Howard Hughes - good. Even the physical appearance of the main characters doesn't change - even though 20 years pass within the storyline, they all still look the same, including the hairstyles. Such a simplified portrayal of Howard Hughes and his times is an insult not only to the man himself, but to the viewer.

So shallow was the movie, that even though we are introduced to Hughes' character in 1927 and leave him around 1947, the Second World War is not mentioned till approximately 1946, with the tiny exception of the Hercules project specifications. And just as the shallow and self-obsessed Hollywood, portrayed by Scorsese, failed to notice the war, so did Scorsese's picture.

If you feel like watching a three hour long issue of E!-channel retro issue of a celebrity watch program - this one is for you. If you don't - just read the ""Hughes, Howard Robard Hughes Jr. (1905-1976)"" entry in your encyclopedia.

5 out of ten just for the breath of fresh air called Cate Blanchett.",5
30 January 2005,Gravitas,"There is casting and then there is acting.

The Aviator is well acted, with Cate Blancett in particular turning in an outstanding job.

The film is poorly cast because few of the actors have the heft necessary to portray their characters. DiCaprio is a boyish lightweight. Ava Gardner had a presence that her imitator lacks. Hepburn was born to privilege, Blancett merely acts. Alan Alda is charming but not believable as a powerful man. Alec Baldwin, in contrast, suggests the seriousness, complexity, and deviousness of a major business player in the 1940s.

What does it mean that the actors of today cannot convey the actors of yesterday? Maybe Errol Flynn is beyond imitation, but I think not. Perhaps preferences for both actors and acting styles now discourage larger-than-life figures. The earlier era valued beauty, boldness, willfulness, and wit, none of which are in vogue.",7
21 February 2012,Scorcese's Epic,"Martin Scorsese delivers an almost three hour epic masterpiece with Leonardo Dicaprio becoming Howard Hughes, with all of his strange behavior, often funny but also tragic. The obsessive compulsive germ phobia manifested by Hughes was rooted in lectures by his mother in his early childhood.

Even with all his bizarre behavior, Hughes was a great visionary, both in aeronautics and the early days of the film industry. Genius and insanity often go hand in hand as was the case in Hughes life. In spite of his mental problems, Hughes managed to build ""The Spruce Goose"" a wooden airplane which was the largest aircraft ever built in the 1940s. He was truly a man ahead of his time.

His movie company enabled him to date many of early Hollywood's leading ladies. Kate Beckinsale shines as Ava Gardner, the one true love of his life. Gardner was the one person without an ulterior motive in Hughes life and the great British actress portraying her really delivers here.

Even with the length of this biography, the story is compelling from beginning to end and is a triumph of film making by Scorsese.",10
5 January 2005,"I LOVED it, beginning to end......","I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",10
29 March 2021,Passion,"Man, does Martin Scorsese love the movies. He takes the life of one of the most enigmatic individuals of the twentieth century and provides such an incredible focus on the movie side of things, even when he fully demonstrates that Howard Hughes saw himself as an aviator first and foremost. The only successful biopic of Howard Hughes made since his death, The Aviator is a glorious look at a man who made the most of the money he inherited, following his passions wherever the led him, told by a master of the form with more money than he'd ever worked with before.

I remember contemporaneous reviews of The Aviator that complained that the movie made no real attempt to explain Howard Hughes' mental illness. Having made my opinions on movies that make light of mental illness by trying to provide easy answers (generally calling them trite), I'm actually a big fan of the direction that Scorsese and his screenwriter, John Logan, take in dealing with Hughes' mental state. They simply present it. There's no event from his childhood that is the source of his germaphobia or obsessive compulsive disorder. There's no fix to the issues. They simply get worse over time, allowing him, for moments, to beat it back through focus on externalities, but never leaving him.

The movie begins in 1927 after Hughes has moved from Houston following the death of his parents that left him the fortune from their drill bit empire, and he has decided to make a movie, eventually released in 1930 after several years of production and the transition to sound. He has a vision for a film in his head, and the only reason people go along with him is because he pays them. They don't need to see it, as long as he can meet payroll. One way that he plans on making this happen is by using a total of twenty-six cameras to film his big dogfight, but he only has twenty-four. So, he goes to the Coconut Grove, a setting that helps show the passage of time across the film, to see if Louis B. Mayer of MGM would lend him a pair, which Mayer, of course, refuses to do with condescension. These early scenes are important because they demonstrate Hughes' intractability, his ability to see things others can't (his vision), his pickiness which is the earliest form of his germophobic obsessive compulsiveness, and his complete ease with women when he picks up his waitress by barely even trying.

Hughes' big bet on Hell's Angels pays off with box office returns and accolades. His embrace of spectacle through a massive dogfight filmed with his twenty-six cameras is thrilling, and it touches Hughes' central passion: aviation. While working on the film, he also employs an aviation engineer, Odie, as they try to dream up the fastest airplane in the world with Hughes questioning the need for a top wing when they could build monoplanes instead of biplanes. He sees something, and he just needs Odie to see the task at hand, a couple of steps behind, before Odie gets on board and gets as excited as Hughes.

In walks Cate Blanchett's Katherine Hepburn. Hughes just flies up to a shooting location (seems like George Cukor's Holiday), picks her up for a game of golf, and Blanchett makes a terrible first impression as Hepburn. It's arch-imitation to the extreme. It's like she's playing Hepburn playing a part. After that, though, Blanchett tones down the imitation and begins to perform as an actor, and she becomes kind of great as the box office poison Hollywood star who finds some charm in this unconventional and slightly deaf transplant from Houston. She's tender, excitable, endearing, and hurt in different measures. What she means to Hughes is she is someone he feels like he can trust. When he offers her a sip of his milk while she's flying his plane, he takes a cautious sip afterwards. She means something to him, allowing him to force his fears aside and live his own life.

Airplanes do a similar thing for him. Talking about sending passenger craft tens of thousands of feet in the air over the weather gives him the kind of focus and passion, but his demons creep in. While discussing his plans, the entire conversation gets sidetracked because of a piece of lint on a lapel. As time progresses, and he works his way through the Second World War, developing planes for the Army that never see action, he becomes so obsessed over his work that Katherine drifts away towards Spencer Tracy. He replaces her with a string of young actresses, manifested most particularly by Faith Domergue at fifteen years old, and Ava Gardner who seems to see Hughes most clearly out of everyone. She never pretends love, refuses his gifts, but she's still surprised at his levels of paranoia when he reveals that he's bugged her house.

The planes, though, are where Hughes seems happiest. The flight of his XF-11, his spy plane, is probably Hughes at his height. A craft he designed completely, it flies beautifully until something goes wrong and he ends up crashing the plan horribly, disfiguring himself for the rest of his life and barely escaping alive. He built something, sinking not only government funds but his own into its creation, he flew it for a while, and it all came crashing down either because of a small design flaw, pilot error, or a manufacturing error. It's kind of the microcosm of Hughes' whole life. He saw the impossible, he made it real, and it all came apart in the end.

He ends up facing off with the federal government and Pan-Am Airways in the form of Senator Brewster from Maine and Juan Trippe from Pan-Am. Owning TWA and with the first 40 Constellation aircraft that can fly for three thousand miles, Hughes wants to take TWA international from New York to Europe, but Pan-Am has an effective American monopoly on that, and they want to preserve it. So, Trippe writes up legislation for Senator Brewster to file in the Senate that will make the effective monopoly into a state sanctioned monopoly, which Hughes fights, and for having the audacity to fight, Brewster decides to humiliate Hughes in a public Senate hearing. Since Hughes has little shame and has lived his sordid life in public to one degree or another for years, the threat of embarrassment does little for him, and he enjoins Brewster in the battle of words and wit, ultimately coming out on top when he admits to having poured his own money into the undelivered planes he was designing for the war effort, negating the idea that he was a war profiteer. This gets framed with the single flight of the troop plane the Hercules, the Spruce Goose.

Why get involved in this man's life? Why watch a three-hour film about the first half of his time on Earth? First and foremost, the man was interesting and he did interesting things. He bedded movie stars, made movies, flew and designed airplanes, fought the US government and won, and he did it all while battling undiagnosed mental illness that ultimately hobbled him. That Scorsese is able to take that story and tell it with his nearly trademarked energy and visual inventiveness is what makes the whole affair fun to sit through and watch unfold. The use of digital color grading to imitate color film production from different eras gives the film an incredibly distinctive look, especially the early parts that have bluish greens like were produced with two-strip technicolor.

Scorsese drops us into this world, and it's thrilling from beginning to end. Hughes led a life we would all love to lead at some level. He lived brashly, well, and dangerously. Going along for the ride with well-rounded characters, impeccable cinematic technique, and strong performances all around, The Aviator is the work of a master filmmaker bringing his passion into a project and making it his own.",10

This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",6
28 November 2019,Soars above!,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

18 August 2019,Brought much truth to the enigma that was Howard Hughes,"First off, Martin transcribed this complex man into a digestible and interesting film. Secondly, Leo delivered once again.

In earnest, this film did one thing for me. It made me want to learn as much as I could about the real HH, and see for myself what an eccentric character he was. One of American history's most intriguing individuals, no doubt.

The film is done well and the cast does well in portraying the events that took place in HH's life. The kept to the main ideas without straying too much away from the myth of the man.

Overall, an excellent film and I would happily recommend to anyone.

19 January 2005,One of the best movies ever made!,"One of the best movies ever made. Dicap gave the performance of a life time and it's going to be a toss up between Jamie foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio for the Oscar. But the aviator takes best picture no doubt about it. Cate Blanchett gives a stunning performance in the supporting role of the famous Kathren Hephbern. This movie tells the amazing life of Howard Hughes. Everything about this film was amazing. The aircraft scenes were spectacular and the screenplay superb. This is Leo's best movie yet and that makes 3 great movies in a row by him. This movie, overall, deserves a 10 out of 10. Don't miss out on this one. It's a memorable performance as well as a memorable film.

29 October 2021,DiCaprio is: The Elevator,"Amazing movie. I didn't know a ton about Hughes before this, some vague generalizations of him being ludicrously rich and the Simpson's bits letting me know he was a germaphobe but beyond that, nothing. Watching The Aviator though feels like a journey into the mind of obsession in a wonderfully compelling way. It's long, it's ponderous and there are weirdly moments when I'd like it to be more thorough but it's not a documentary, it's a biopic. It's weirdly shocking to see this was directed by Scorsese, it's so lacking in his normal gangster themes and I really appreciate that and would've loved to have seen more of it over his career.

All in all? This is a really solid movie that somehow feels like a more neurotic version of The Wolf of Wall Street. It's long, which is probably the only real roadblock for people to watch this. Do yourself a favor though and clear out a block of time and give this one a go.

9 January 2005,The Aviator Flies High,"Billionaire Howard Hughes is the subject of an epic biography, The Aviator, and it is just big enough to encompass the early adult years of a reclusive, eccentric original who battles the doubters and his own inner demons. Spearheaded by Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Hughes, this project started with Michael Mann (who remains a producer) and was ushered to realization by director Martin Scorsese.

The film wisely settles on Hughes' life particularly between 1927 and 1947. A brief opening scene shows Hughes as a boy being washed by his mother while preaching quarantine and cleanliness. Cut to Hughes in the late 1920's as a young man with a tool company in Texas who is trying to film a large scale war film, Hell's Angels. A perfectionist, Hughes is determined to capture great aerial scenes no matter the time and cost. He hires Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly) to watch the company's finances as he begins to explore the limits of airplane design and travel. He discovers a young starlet, Jean Harlow, and begins romancing some of Hollywood's female glamour stars like Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner. Gradually, his compulsive disorders worsen and are complicated by his failed relationships and a couple of near fatal air disasters. His urge to fly and create bigger and faster planes puts him on a collision course with a competitor from Pan Am and ultimately the U.S. Congress.

While Howard Hughes' life has been the stuff of movie material for decades, this big budget film finally marshals the appropriate talent and resources to do it justice. Previously, 1964's The Carpetbaggers seemed inspired by Hughes' film career. In 1977, a TV movie called The Amazing Howard Hughes featuring Tommy Lee Jones did a good job of spanning his life. Even the fanciful comedy/drama Melvin and Howard played on a thread of Hughes' supposed encounter with a stranger. Yet it took the combined might of Miramax and Warner Brothers to give the story the needed blockbuster budget. And if having Scorsese direct a biography is like asking Picasso to do a Superman comic, then so be it. He does an admirable job of depicting intimate scenes and set pieces intermixed with period and story. It is a solid piece of storytelling by a master director working off a good script by John Logan (Gladiator).

What is compelling about Hughes is how reckless and human he was while at the same time becoming a sympathetic victim of his afflictions. As his ticks and behavior become increasingly obsessive, there is a genuine sense of inevitability as we watch the beginnings of his legendary, sanitized lifestyle to come. The scenes involving his clash with the U.S. Senate are like watching a newsreel come to life. It is fascinating stuff even as we are rooting for Hughes to prevail. In the end, Hughes is a slice of the American Dream crossed with the American Tragedy.

DiCaprio is quite good as the aviator and while those that remember the real Hughes may never have dreamed of young Leonardo playing this role, he has embodied the spirit and behavior quite convincingly; he gets the feel and angst of the man. In the latter half of the film, he looks like a dead ringer for Hughes right down to his arched eyebrow.

The rest of the supporting cast is strong. Cate Blanchett is excellent as Katharine Hepburn. She not only has Kate's appearance and vocal quality down, but she has made her a vivid, intelligent human whose relationship with Hughes is the focus for much of his life. This is no mere cardboard impersonation. Kate Beckinsale plays Ava Gardner and does credible job in a role which is also important in Hughes' later life. Alan Alda is a standout as an unscrupulous U.S. Senator who is a henchman for air exec, Alec Baldwin. Even the smaller parts are a hoot with such stars as Jude Law playing Errol Flynn and Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow. Willem Dafoe (The Last Temptation of Christ) has a bit role of a tabloid writer.

As said before, the production is big and splashy. The set designs are top notch from nightclub recreations to air hangars to a congressional hearing room. Costume design (Sandy Powell-Gangs of New York) is like Edith Head reborn. The dramatic musical score (Howard Shore-The Lord of the Rings) is unobtrusive and well integrated in the story. Cinematography (Robert Richardson-Casino) and editing (Thelma Schoonmaker-Raging Bull) in a Scorsese film is always imaginative and unique without calling self attention. The air scenes whether in Hells Angels or the test flights are exhilarating and through live action and special effects, recall some of the exciting moments of The Right Stuff. What are just as impressive are the details in this larger than life production. For example, when Hughes emerges from a self imposed quarantine, his staffers are going about their work wearing white gloves. Film purists will enjoy the clips or references to other Hughes productions like Scarface (1932) and The Outlaw.

Ultimately, this ambitious tale is not only well told, but you get a true sense of the man, and that is no mean feat. Sure, the film is lengthy and drags a little in the second half as it probes his illness, but it isn't long before another scene picks up the plot, and the film moves to a grand scale again. It has been a good year in 2004 for movie biographies, and while The Aviator is the biggest of the bunch it is also one of the best.

28 February 2005,"Aviator should have gotten ""Best Picture"" Oscar","I am writing to say that ""The Aviator"" should have gotten the Best Picture"" Oscar. The Aviator is a riveting, non-stop emotional picture from beginning to end. It almost seems Howard Hughes is at the helm in producing this picture. It has his intensity, his non-stop energy, his emotional ups and downs, his vibrant colorful life and tragedy. To even compare this fast-paced picture to ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a sacrilege in my opinion. ""Million Dollar Baby"" had my mother asleep and me wanting to get there. The pace is SO>>>>>>slow, the actors only mediocre in my opinion. The script was so simplistic compared to the intriguing lines of the ""Aviator."" I thought Leonardo DeCaprio was par excellence as Howard. He put an incredible piece of himself into a very complicated character and came off very believable in my opinion. Thank you for letting me share my comments.

28 May 2005,Dreadful sophomoric trash,"If there is a worse acted movie recently I haven't seen it. Oh yes I have, it's 'Pearl Harbor'. Even Jude Law was terrible and he's a fine actor with remarkable charm. As for Cate Blanchett.. what was she doing? It was like a high school drama fest. She's not a very good actress but this was an astonishingly bad performance. I kept rewinding the first scene to make sure it really was as terrible as I thought it was. I checked out after about a half hour. Life is too short. And all the nonsense about 'Hell's Angels"". That movie is dreck. Harlow is dreadful. There is some good ariel footage but that's about it.

I thought that The Age of Innocence was made by a philistine but it's The Magnificent Ambersons compared to this garbage.

Read a book. Tell a story. Learn how to direct actors. Thank you.

29 March 2005,A gorgeously dressed corpse of a movie,"So many people have already posted about the liberties this movie takes with Hughes' life that I won't waste time repeating them here. That said, I can always ignore a movie that plays fast and loose with history if there's an original point to be made. Unfortunately The Aviator doesn't have a point. After nearly three hours the film fails to demonstrate why we should ever have been interested in Hughes in the first place.

The Aviator's production values are indeed as lavish as the hype suggests and no one can deny Scorsese's ability to move his camera in ways that make every film-school wannabee go weak at the knees. But a slick way with a camera is meaningless if your central character is unengaging. Not only that but The Aviator's woes are compounded by a meandering narrative that lacks a unifying theme (poor Marty has never been at ease with mainstream narrative).

I also question the emphasis on Hughes' time in Hollywood given that those years occupied such a small proportion of Hughes' own life. In terms of the overall theme of the film it's not at all clear what point is being made as we watch Hughes make 'Hell's Angels' and romance Katie Hepburn. I have the horrible feeling that everyone involved felt that lavishly recreating the golden years of Hollywood, complete with some of its most famous names, would be a sure fire route to that coveted Best Picture statuette. For once I'm glad to see that the Academy was not so easily fooled.

Then there's the fatal miscasting of Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes. He's a good actor but in both looks and ability he's at least a decade too young for this role. Is there really any surprise that The Aviator crashed and burned at this year's Oscars? There shouldn't be. The Aviator's technical credentials are impeccable - it looks sumptuous and sounds great - but that elusive spark capable of bringing a character memorably to life, allied to a vision that knows how to take real life and shape it into a compelling dramatic unity, all of that is absent here. The Aviator is the kind of movie you find yourself forgetting as you watch it. Truly, a 'gorgeously dressed corpse of a movie.'",

26 December 2004,Too much Hughes,"Certainly a good and informative film but it lacked dramatic depth and for us didn't generate great emotion. The film so focused on Hughes' ambitions and sad illnesses that the characters with whom he interacted seemed more like part of the scenery than independent characters to care about. (One exception perhaps was Hughes' aviation expert, they did seem to have a real relationship.) Maybe that's a fatal flaw when you set out to cover so much of the productive life of man like this.

I also didn't buy the idea that his mother's warnings and washings accounts for what happened to Hughes. Maybe Scorsese wanted to create a Rosebud/Citizen Kane feel, at least that's what popped into my mind. But Hughes' problems went way beyond an anal mother.

29 December 2011,DiCaprio and Blanchett make this work!!,"I was pleasantly surprised by it. Didn't know what to expect. I was quite impressed with a few of the biopics I've seen - WALK THE LINE, RAY, MIRACLE (that one is more about the Miracle on Ice win but also focuses greatly on the coach Herb Brooks) so I decided to give THE AVIATOR a whirl (ahem). DiCaprio in recent years has proved himself to be quite the actor so I really wanted to see his take on Howard Hughes. Let me tell ya - DiCaprio hit this one out of the park!! By far his best performance!! The mannerisms and all the foibles/compulsive disorders that he brought out in his performance were outstanding!!

I immediately went and read up as much as I could about Hughes and his life. I was already a bit fascinated with this man even before seeing the film - although I must admit that my fascination stemmed more from his latter years as a recluse and the fact that Jimmy Dean's Willard Whyte character in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER was based on him. But I had no idea he played such a huge part in aviation and in the film business earlier in his life. That part of his life I knew almost nothing about. And it was DiCaprio's performance that fed my interest in the man even more. Bravo, Leo!!

And then there's Cate Blanchett as Kate Hepburn - a maaaarvelous performance!! I was like... DAYUM!!! She IS Hepburn!! Leo and Cate basically made this movie for me. Up until then my favorite lead performances of 2004 were Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles and Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks. Both did a splendid job. But sorry... Leo beats them both!!",8
16 January 2005,"""The Aviator"" flies high.","Leonardo DiCaprio gives an outstanding performance as Howard Hughes in ""The Aviator"". He evolves into a true replica of both the image as well as the persona of this complex character. Martin Scorcese is right on track in his direction of this excellent production. Jude Law is especially classy in his portrayal of Errol Flynn. Katharine Hepburn is portrayed by Kate Beckinsale and she gives a very convincing performance. Alan Alda is Senator Ralph Owen Brewster of Connecticut who assaults Hughes publicly in his Senate hearings. The psychopathy of Hughes is very believable and pithy. DiCaprio has obviously studied the psychiatric background of schizophrenia with intensity. One is overwhelmed by his characterization, and sympathy evolves for this extremely wealthy character of an earlier time in American History. The airplane scenes alone are worth the price of admission, and my hat goes off to everyone who participated in the making of this important movie. If one enjoyed ""A Beautiful Mind"", then this movie will be equally if not more provocative.

23 August 2023,Could Have Been An Easy 9 Without Dicaprio,"Unfortunately Leonardo Dicaprio didn't have the talent or range to pull of Howard Hughes. And, as usual, Dicaprio over acted and over dramatized his role. Dicaprio as an Executive Producer was a joke. Howard Hughes was bigger than life, and The Aviator deserved better. Howard Hughes deserves better!

Aside from the DiCaprio casting mistake (there were actually several casting mistakes), the movie was entirely too long, with boring and nonessential mundane events. I will give a High-5 to Alan Alda, who played the stereotypical corrupt Senator to perfection. I have to blame the loss of opportunity to make a colossal and historic movie about an important man in American history on Martin Scorsese's Directing role. I am sure that script writer John Logan got a little carried away as well.

If you know much about the life and contributions made by Howard Hughes, spend a little time thinking about how The Aviator could have (and should have) turned out. What a shame, what a blooming shame!",5
27 June 2015,Magnificent acting by Leo DiCaprio,"The story really has to get a grip for itself because the movie seems not to be depicting a balanced portrayal of a person. But it may yet slip through as the person depicted lived more than fifty years ago. I see the movie a little too much in depicting Hughes' weaknesses, particularly his obsessive compulsive behavior and his paranoia of just about everything. But that in turn gave Leo his chance to elaborate on his acting. Thus the acting overall is indeed a great work in my eyes. Leo DiCaprio did very well in depicting the movie's version of Howard Hughes. I really like the way hoe Leo's acting seems to carry Hughes' weaknesses to other scenes, even on the ones in which Hughes is a strong person. Having John C. Reilly and an assortment of A-list talents really helped to balance the whole acting overall and took it to the greatness level it deserved.

1 April 2005,"This movie is disappointing, boring","I started watching this movie, but I caught myself starting to use 8x fast forward on my DVD player very often, because movie is boring.

Leonardo Di Caprio's acting seems unconvincing.

Colour scheme used on the beginning on the movie: some call it, and praise it as ""artistic"", but it only annoyed me. (what's the point of using that color scheme, when it looks bad, and also,very few people know how did colors of from the 1930 movies looked alike, so they can't understand why is the grass blue)

There are some Martin Scorceses movies which I like (Casino etc), and also Leonardo Di Caprios (Catch me..), but this one is horrible.

Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",8
2 May 2020,Marty's Direction and Cate's Acting in its bests.,"Howard Hughes was one of the richest man in his time, a prominent film producer, record setting pilot, engineer and above all a business magnate, who also suffer from Obsessive - Compulsive Disorder (OCD). In this biopic Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hughes, in his youth with all his passion, dedication, craziness and eccentricity. He is so daring that the movie is as much a thriller as it is a drama. And there we see another beautiful collaboration forming up with Scorsese and DiCaprio.

Let me take some words to say about the brilliant Oscar and SAG winning performance by Cate Blanchett. She plays a real life actress who was known for her unconventional off screen life. Now acting is one thing and acting an actor is a whole another thing and not just any, but the greatest female star of Classic Hollywood Cinema, Katharine Hepburn herself. For a 3 hour long movie she had such a short screen time but she was simply stunning with her mannerisms replicating Hepburn.

Scorsese designed each year in this movie to look just the way a color movie from that time period would look. Seeing it for the second time was even more enthralling and made me adore the mastercrafter even more. This is clearly one of the best directed movies i have seen of any directors. Scorsese earned his 5th Oscar, 6th Golden Globe and 6th DGA nominations with this film.

Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 5, the highest number of nominations and win on 2005 Oscar, 14 BAFTA nominations and 4 wins including Best Picture, 6 Golden Globe nominations and 3 wins including Best Picture and Lead Actor, this is

THE AVIATOR A MARTIN SCORSESE BIOPIC on HOWARD HUGHES",9
27 December 2004,Slick & modern but animation effects were over the top.,"Today we saw The Aviator, in a full house. I liked it. I knew it would be long, though I did not warn my wife about that or she would not have gone (don't tell). The story moves right along for the most part - - the cutting is very good (as expected) but I feel Mr. Scorsese could have lost 15 or 20 minutes easily, with no loss of story. I also appreciate the reluctance to do so. I am, however, a little frayed with overly used digital special effects, and I do wonder how an old school Scorsese-type would be persuaded to choose this path during the storyboard process. I feel we are now crossing the line, with directors choosing this method over other available effects. The process is just not 100% right. The impossible ""camera"" angles are distracting (to my taste, irritating), violating all sorts of physics laws which causes an observant person to instantly question the process of placing animations in serious films, and it therefore becomes a dead giveaway: he knows he is viewing a cartoon. It reminds me of the early days of S-T-E-R-E-O, very few younger people would understand this concept. I think James Cameron gets it but who knows for sure. Digital animations were probably required for this; I am suggesting that some moderation of it and additional use of models might make sense.

This would be my prime criticism then, that the effects are in your face; they are anything but subtle in certain scenes. This was true with the other film I saw this weekend (The Flight of The Phoenix), there's relatively little in the way of special effects differences between them. I am witnessing this on an increasing level. All that said, The Aviator visuals are nonetheless impressive (some great plane crashes), and the storytelling, though very good, is artsy. I give the effort a must-see, on balance. This film looks very modern but handles the period feel with brilliance; it is indeed slick. The score and adaptations (Howard Shore) are fitting but not something I'd want to own beyond a possible DVD of the film itself, later on. And you have this: after seeing the film, there is little doubt in your mind who Hughes was, or what sorts of things cranked his gear. -- Don Forbes",8
29 January 2005,Seems like a celebration of celebrity culture,"For most of this movie I kept trying to figure out what it was about the story that made it worth being told. Was it just that this was a powerful figure of American history? Was it his celebrity status or the fact that he was bound up in other famous peoples' lives? These are somewhat obvious questions, I know, but the fact that I couldn't justify making this movie to myself made me wonder why anybody else would think it was.

Given the array of historical figures that could merit having a ""biopic"" made about them, why an American industrialist who seems to have contributed little to this country besides underwhelming motion pictures and better airplanes? Why not people who contributed the cultural and moral advancement of society? These questions are rhetorical, but I have the feeling that many people will wonder themselves why this movie was made when they watch it.

4 April 2016,This is the story of entrench millionaire Howard Hughes and his journey through Hollywood and endeavors as a aviation innovator.,"Howard Hughes was one of the first Hollywood major directors and this story tells it greatly. Martin Scorcese's masterful direction and years of experience pay off because this movie is directed greatly from the grand sweeps of cinematography to small shots of people at tables. Leonardo DiCapreo plays this legendary director with the nuance of his mannerism to his overarching larger than life presence. The writing is smart and intelligent and gets to the point when it needs to and pass along the story with a stable brisk pace. All the supporting cast helps to put order when Howard Hughes more awkward mannerisms take over the story. Kate Blanchet has excellent chemistry with the lead and the two work of each other well. Everything comes together to make an exciting and odd true story of an unusual filmmaker, aviator, and person.

3 March 2005,Crazy movie,"And the story is also that of a crazy man, the famous millionaire Howard Hughes who had a tremendous initiative power always acting stubbornly against all tides and winds to achieve his aims. Besides a great businessman he also excelled in such different activities as plane driver and movie director. Crazy and unpredictable but also a human being with all the respective frailties and idiosyncrasies. In my opinion DiCaprio was not a good choice for this character since his boyish appearance and manners make the character very unconvincing. It would require a more strong personality such as of De Niro or Liam Neeson for instance. And a curious note: the portrayed characters never get physically older. All of them during the about 30 years in which the story develops itself, keep the same physical aspect which they had at their first appearance including the main character after all those vicissitudes he had to endure. Also the sudden changes of Hughes from sanity to insanity and back are not well characterized or explained, with DeCaprio revealing himself a mediocre actor once more. But except these flaws the movie is well done, the story is solid and sound and its events develop themselves in a good rhythm and the music is excellent. The scenes of the Senate Committee hearings are also a high moment in the movie. After all this movie is worth to be seen.",7
1 July 2012,"Pretty to look at, but oh so boring.","I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle.

10 February 2005,Leo is a downfall and so is the lack of insanity,"---- i thought that H.H. was really insane--- in this film he is presented in a nice light--- and why not--- if you want the gory details get a biography on the man--- Why oh why did they pick Leo to play H.H.--- what a foolish thing to do. I can't stand him. He has a hard time playing older characters on film --- he never seems old. Granted if I was in his place I would take that as a compliment but he can't transform like Cate Blanchett. She played Katharine Hepburn like a fiddle. In fact the best parts of the movie focused on their relationship.

It is hard to separate someone's incredible life from a movie depiction of it. I feel that H.H. life was far more interesting in real life (and more complex) than anything that could be put on the screen. Martin Scorsese did a great job in trimming a potentially 35 hour movie down to a palatable hunk. All in all i recommend seeing it.

14 September 2006,"Good cast, pretentious movie.","Considering that this is an attempt to tell the story of just part of the life of one of the most enigmatic people who ever lived, it was a mistake to have even considered it in the first place. The cast, generally speaking, is excellent. The production values and art direction are extremely high. The script, in a word, stinks. This movie should have never been made. First of all, this film deals with only a small part of Howard Hughes' life. It seems fragmented and disjointed. There is no ""beginning"" to the story, we're just thrown into his life in the late 1920's and not given any background as to who this is and where he's from. The movie ends pretty much the same way. As what apparently is not said anymore in the movie business, what's the motivation? There doesn't seem to be any. We are treated to a somewhat clinical observation of a multi-millionaire and his various psychological exploits. This makes the character flat and a non-person. Some of the other characters such as Katherine Hepburn are given the same consideration. They are merely names and dates in history without personalities and depth. Is this what Mr. Scorsese actually intended? Is he tearing down these people or is he actually not aware of what was happening? On some level it could appear that he has a personal grudge against Howard Hughes and most of the rest of the characters because he doesn't bring out any dimension or humanity in these people. That's for minds more qualified than mine in psychology to delve into. I'm only writing my opinion about what I saw. Dramatic presentations about historical events and people are never accurate and so don't go into this film expecting the absolute truth. As is usual, they got the names and dates right but not the story. Howard Hughes was extremely complex, not normal by societal convention, and much more than just a megalomaniac womanizer as portrayed here by the inept, incredulous performance of DiCaprio. Rent this if you have the time to waste.",2
22 January 2005,Baby Faced Leo Flies High,"The focus of attention naturally is on Leo DiCaprio but Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn steals the picture. A very ritzy lady indeed and I'm glad Spencer Tracy found her so wonderful for so many years. Now to be serious, DiCaprio does an EXCELLENT job as Howard Hughes but he is MISCAST. Even with a moustache, he looks like Hughes's son with a moustache. Even when Leo grows mean,ugly and disturbed in Hughes's later years, he still looks like a warped kid. Indeed, Leo is a very gifted actor but throughout the entire film he reminded me of Jack in ""Titanic."" Oh well, maybe I have a one track mind? The special effects are STUNNING. The color is STUNNING. The story is fascinating. It's going to cop many Oscars and maybe even one for the longest picture of the year however, although I can't pinpoint it,the film lacked that certain something to classify it as monumental. I classify it as a very good picture but NOT great by any means.

2 October 2019,Why Do I Want To Give This An 8?,"The Aviator is a good film. Scorsese and Leo team up this time, for a tale of movie making, womanizing, and living the dream.

The story of Howard Hughes is an interesting one, mixed into the Hollywood scene and general business dealings. It's fun to see the rise of man, and also his fall. It's haunting towards the end, when you see of what could really become of someone who had it all at one point in his life.

There are also memorable portrayals by Alec Baldwin and Cate Blanchett.

6 June 2005,"""Citizen Kane"" light","Billionaire entrepreneur,raconteur and legend Hoawrd Hughes led two lives. One,as a handsome,charismatic young dreamer who was able to spin gold out of straw,creating planes that worked and movies that sold. The other was the OCD-hobbled eccentric who furiously bucked the system he also wanted to serve. The bridge between these two is explored in Martin Scorcese's nearly three hour long epic.

Leonard DiCaprio's Hughes makes up for a physical lack of authenticity(he stays fairly boyish looking through two decades of change,including after surviving a life-threatening plane crash!)by being able to commit to the passion and affliction that was Howard. His willingness to sacrifice his body and portray a mental illness that is somewhat difficult to encapsulate is nothing short of remarkable.

HAving said that,probably the real standout here was CAte Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn. I suppose it betrays a lack of movie sophistication to admire an actor for their ability to mimic a real celebrity(and my familiarity with KAte may not be THE best) but it's still hard to forget ones that are dead-on(Val Kilmer's Jim Morrison comes to mind)and Blanchet's KAte Hepburn is just that! Her vocal cadence,speed of talking and her general demeanor of defiance seemed to so mark Miss Hepburn's persona. She is a unique person for her era and she is very aware of it,and her being different is at least in part why she can recognize and love Howard for his quirks and style.

The heavies are a senator from Maine(Alan Alda,very good here)and the President and CEO of Pan-Am Airlines(Alec Baldwin,not especially memorable but still serviceable),the latter having the former in his deep,influential pockets. The tricks that they play on Hoawrd's state of mental health SEEM minor,but are actually quite insidious and snide(e.g.blowing cigar smoke his direction,leaving fingerprints on his drinking glass,serving food bloody and rare).

The rest of the cast rounds out nicely with John C. Reilly(as NOah Dietrich,Howard's longtime bookkeeper and friend),Adam Scott(as JOhnny,Howard's longtime associate and confidant),KAte Beckingsale(as Ava GArdener,who also had a short and tempestuous affair with Mr.HUghes),Gwen Stefani(appropriate as Jean HArlow),MAtt Ross,Kelli Garner,and Brent Spiner. Cameos by Jude Law and Willem DaFoe catch the eye but have only small impact on the film.

While I cannot quite call this film a classic,it is still a very worthy movie to watch,especially if you are interested in 20th-Century American history and the impact of celebrity has on it. Also,Mr.Hughes' life is very fascinating,IMHO. The title line of my review isn't to say that I believe that Mr. Hughes and C.F.Kane's(proxy to W.R.Hearst) life stories are direct parallels,but that the aim of both movies seems to be the same. Namely,the documenting of a great,brilliant man whose sense of ego and frailty become to(greater or lesser degrees)his undoing. While lacking full originality,either in subject or approach, it still is able to evoke interest and personality,which makes the awards it was nominated for(And the relative few that it won)quite deserving.",9
15 January 2005,Potential Lost,"The Aviator is a movie that had the potential to be good...and ended up being okay; barely. DiCaprio did a decent job, but did not capitalize on the historical character he portrayed, Howard Hughes. Blanchett was totally unbelievable as Kate Hepburn. Instead of the portrayal she gave, she should have considered the strong women she played in The Missing...forget the phony accent(peripheral) and deal with Hepburn's strength (principal). Beckinsale was great as Ava Gardner.

The movie's tempo was like the daily ebb and flow of the tide. Even when this tempo was ""disturbed"" (fatal crash), the movie rushed to return to its daily ebb and flow. These were real dynamic people, who came across as detached and deranged (DiCapriob as Hughes), a boring, selfish,brat (Blanchett as Hepburn), are the eye of the storm (Beckinsale as Gardner).

Very disappointing considering the talent in and behind this film.",3
21 March 2006,Absolute p*sh,"Okay maybe that's not too fair....oh wait...it is....this firm sucked like Elton John drunk on champagne. Looked great but where was the story? It was longer than John Holmes on poppers. I watched it to the end and forget the start of the film! Martin you deserve your eyebrows shaved for this one!

There was zero structure and Leo still looks like he's acting in a school play. Ther worst thing is that I told my wife this film would be good. As a direct result, I'm having to watch American Idol and Masterchef. Oooooo Scorcese or whatever you're called, when I'm famous and sniffing coke off the back of a Texan beauty queen, I'll be having a quiet word with you son!

8 March 2005,If this is the best that the Oscars can come up with...,"If this is the best that the Oscars can come up with then they really should be trying harder...

On the whole a quite boring film, and Leonardo DiCaprio is again miscast. You just cannot take him seriously, are there no other actors out there!!

The film was also lacking in not giving more background to the origin of the Hughes family wealth, okay we know it came from tool bits, but more here would really have been interesting.

In the same way that a film with 'Tom Cruise' in nowadays is going to be an overblown bloated fish.. so this epic of a film felt.. - oh dear, just had a recall of the dreadful 'Gangs of New York', another Leonardo classic!

Back again to Leonardo I'm afraid, maybe with someone a little more commanding in the role it would have given it a bit of bite, I doubt it but you never know.

Don't waste your hard earned cash on this, watch 'The Bourne Identity' or 'Leon' again and feel good!",3
3 January 2005,Worthwhile and interesting biography,"Martin Scorcese does not reach the heights I felt he reached in ""Gangs of New York"" but his bio-pic of Howard Hughes is, for the most part, gorgeous and well-done. DiCaprio proves he is up to the challenge as does the rest of the cast.

Scorcese is such a talented director that I wish he would focus his talents on some smaller projects, because three hours can be a bit overwhelming.

The music and cinematography are used to great effect and, at times, I became totally immersed in the story forgetting that the actors I was watching weren't the actual people.

The CG effects were not quite on par with some recent sci-fi and fantasy epics by the likes of George Lucas and Peter Jackson, but the visceral impact of many of the flight scenes was terrific.

I felt the focus on Hughes obsessive-compulsive hypochondria was a bit overdone, but important to show the internal struggle of the character. I went in to the picture thinking ""Tucker: A Man and his Dream"" and left thinking ""A Beautiful Mind"".",7
4 February 2005,Epic film- Great Historical tale,"went by myself today to see the ""Aviator,"" at the Falls. It was an epic film, and I enjoyed learning more of the history of Howard Hughes, and see how he built up his empire, his craziness, and the historical sweep of the movie. I also enjoyed the cinematography and the surround sound. The actual story itself was a bit of a bore, and the acting can't hold a candle to ""Ray"" or ""Million Dollar Baby."" For my money, having seen 4 of the films I would vote for Million Dollar Baby, but wouldn't be upset if Ray won, (which was my favorite before seeing Million Dollar Baby.

DiCaprio, to me, was DiCaprio. I couldn't make the transition to Hughes, although his make up was astounding in some scenes. I kept seeing Care Blanchette as an elfish queen in Lord of the Rings. I couldn't make the transition to Katherine Hepburn.

I think it is a good film to see on the big screen for its epic and historic sweep and grandeur and don't think it would have the same power on DVD.",5

21 January 2011,A Herculean achievement.,"Martin Scorsese, long considered the greatest living American director, certainly solidified this status with three gargantuan, monstrous and epic films during the 2000s, portraying three very different time periods in American culture, all while exhibiting his fluid camera style, crisp editing and boundless creative storytelling. Perhaps of the three films, The Aviator might be the most ambitious, extravagant and compelling if only because it tells the story of a real American attempting to pursue that infamous American dream and does so in a massive way, only to lose it in the process through no fault of his own.

Howard Hughes, the most ambitious and impulsive businessman of the 20th century, is a fascinating character not just for his successes but also his failures. Very few, if any, could match his insatiable thirst for success and prestige. Scorsese captures this in nearly every scene, building up for the first 2 hours an enormous tale of lust, greed and ambition that is nothing short of astonishing to watch. This is due in equal parts to Scorsese's magnificent direction and Leonardo DiCaprio's brilliant rendition of Hughes the man.

Scorsese guides the story through nearly every major facet of Hughe's life beginning in 1927 when he is a young kid from Texas using his parents' money to make a Hollywood film, Hell's Angels. His obsessive perfection leads to the film costing nearly $4 million and three years of production. He goes on to make films such as Scarface and The Outlaw, both of which courted much controversy for their content. However, his true love was aviation, which he poured millions of dollars into to stay at the top of the game. His creations were astounding and Scorsese's recreations of such crafts as the X-11 and the Spruce Goose are nothing short of incredible.

For his personal life, Hughes hit the Hollywood jackpot by dating one star after another. Scorsese focuses on the two most important: Katherine Hepburn, his one true love, and Ava Gardner, who saw him more as a soul in need of salvation than a lover. Cate Blanchett won an Oscar for her role as Hepburn and it is something to behold; the magnificent way she embodies Hepburn's insatiable New England smugness and conceit. However, DiCaprio's status as one of the very best actors working today needs only this film to justify that statement. He is in practically every scene and owns all of them. His facial expressions, stage presence and overall body language is so perfectly sublime, subdued and structured that he does become Hughes. All Leo haters must look at his work here as something that demands great respect.

Along with Gangs of New York and The Departed, Martin Scorsese and Leonard DiCaprio created three magnificently entertaining films dealing with similar protagonists: a man tortured by his past and struggling to forge ahead in the future. This is not so unlike other Scorsese characters like Travis Bickle, Jake LaMotta or Rupert Pupkin. There is also a bit of Scorsese in Hughes' professional life. Both are obsessed with detail, focused solely on the task at hand and very successful because of this. A great tribute to a great man from a great director.",
8 September 2016,below that Scorsese can do more is a good movie,"The Aviator is below many films that Martin Scorsese made even more so is a good film, based on real facts , here we see the second time one of the best partnership of cinema, Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio , DiCaprio does a great acting, the cast also this very well , Cate Blanchett this very good , John C. Reilly , the beautiful Kate Beckinsale , Alec Baldwin, Danny Huston , Alan Alda , Ian Holm and etc , the script is good, more believe weakens the third act , I found almost three film, unnecessary , thought very long , and is tiring , since the pace is also not so good, the picture is excellent, the costumes it's great , and has very good scenes , the Aviator is far to be the best film of Scorsese , more is still a very good movie with a great cast, great performances , most unfortunately wanes in the third act.

21 July 2007,"Scorsese's best ? i don't think so, Di Caprio's Best? Indeed!!!","Martin Scorsese is taking the art of film direction to another level (hey, guys this is my personal point of view please respect it! ;) ), no director on earth can get the best of Leonardo DiCaprio better than Scorsese.

The art direction is amazing in every aspect, the editing the cinematography even the costumes, are calling the academy awards.

let us now talk about the acting,Leonardo DiCaprio is dazzling as Howard Hughes the godfather of the aviation industry in America in the first half of the 20th century, he performed superbly the phsycological side of Hughes's life, a well deserved Oscar nomination, thank god he won a golden globe for that role, because it would have been totally unfair for him not to win a major award for such a magnificent performance. Cate Blanchett, is Katharine Hepburn the academy award winning actress, once a girlfriend of Howard Hughes,Cate Blanchett is simply magnetic,she really is the queen of the scene,her presence is lighting the film, i have never been convinced by an Oscar wining role as much as i was convinced by this role(alongside her is Jennifer Connelly in A BEAUTIFUL MIND). the rest of the supporting cast were all amazing, Alan Alda as the embarrassed Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, was truly amazing. this film is maybe the best of Martin Scorsese so far even better than good fellas. and the crew worked with him were very smart.

thank you all for this masterpiece.",9
9 May 2023,Long,"Well made film about the infamous Howard Hughes, who lead a fascinating, wild and weird life. A large and excellent cast throughout its lengthy running time, a common Scorsese problem, is topped by Cate Blanchette's portrayal of Katherine Hepburn, which must have been a bit intimidating I would think. Besides its excessive length, the other problem is its lead actor. While he is not bad, DeCaprio is miscast. He's just too young looking throughout when this was filmed and doesn't have the presence for this larger than life role. Many have talked about filming this story for decades, particularly Warren Beatty. It's such an interesting tale about one of the most famous men to have ever lived that it is a shame now that it has finally been done that it is not special in some way, but it just isn't.

5 February 2005,Spectacular old-fashioned epic,"I really enjoyed The Aviator. Both in terms of story and acting, there was so much to look at and be entertained by. DiCaprio put in an excellent performance, the direction was generally very fine indeed, and the effects were almost perfect (I say ""almost"" because, when the Hercules carrier took off in the end, it was very obviously computer generated). The aviation scenes were absolutely spectacular. All in all an engrossing and pleasant old-fashioned epic which, in my opinion, deserves an 8 out of 10 rating.

Cate Blanchett's Katherine Hepburn was perhaps a little over-acted, but it doesn't matter, because the entertainment value of the role was so great. In the end, she did come across as convincing.

Kate Beckinsale's Ava Gardner had a smaller role, which was a pity. She obviously became very intimate with Hughes, and in the movie we never really saw the two get to know each other. There was just a cut to a point when they were well into an established relationship. That was a little disappointing to me, because I really would have liked to see a larger role for Beckinsale. I think this role was one of her best yet. There was much more *character* in the Ava Gardner part than in any other role Beckinsale has had yet. Such fire in her eyes and expressions! (And, on a costuming note, what a stunning blue and red dress she wore in the scene where she helped Hughes recuperate from his solitary isolation!)

Returning to the story, the last part of the movie seemed a little unfinished to me. The hearing scenes with Hughes being questioned by the senator and upstaging him were good, but we weren't really shown the full consequences of it. I wanted to see more of the aftermath. Also, the whole thing with Hughes' neurotic disorder was never really commented on; never explained or analyzed. Sure, we saw the childhood scenes that must have started it, but why was there no medical interlude of any kind?

So, all things considered, not quite a perfect movie, but one I was fully engaged in and entertained by. That in itself is a rarity with new movies. I do hope The Aviator wins the Oscar for Best Movie. If you ask me, this is the kind of thing Scorsese should be doing, rather than all that boring and foul-mouthed mafia stuff.",7
11 July 2005,A fascinating movie about a fascinating man,"The story of Howard Hughes' life is an amazing one. Where would one even begin trying to tell this tale? Martin Scorsese smartly focuses on Hughes as a young man. It was a time in which Hughes had the world at his fingertips only to let it all slip away in a terrible descent into madness. In The Aviator we see Hughes at his most triumphant but we also see him lose it all as his mind betrays him. Capturing all of this in a terrific performance is Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio is brilliant in portraying the young swashbuckling pilot, mogul and ladies' man Hughes was. He also manages to convince in showing Hughes as the beaten shell of a man he would become. It's almost as if DiCaprio had to portray two entirely different characters and he does a magnificent job of it.

While this is clearly DiCaprio's (and by extension Hughes') movie, there are fine performances by a host of other stars portraying many of the key figures in Hughes' life. Most notable is Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn, the true love of Hughes' life. It has been said that Hepburn herself was a bit of a caricature, certainly not someone who would be easy to portray, but Blanchett does it brilliantly. She captures the mannerisms, voice, style and heart of Hepburn. It would have been easy to hold something back in this performance for fear of coming off, well, a bit odd. But perhaps Hepburn really was a bit odd and Blanchett really went for it and nailed it. In a bit part as Jean Harlow, Gwen Stefani is really not required to do much more than look pretty, a task she is certainly capable of. While by no means bad, Kate Beckinsale's turn as Ava Gardner is nowhere near as good as Blanchett's. We never really get to know her and the movie suffers for that. And while Beckinsale certainly looks glamorous enough, it seems she is just imitating Ava Gardner whereas by contrast Blanchett truly is Katharine Hepburn.

On the male side of the ledger John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda all do fine work. Reilly plays Noah Deitrich, Hughes' right-hand man who must concern himself with the money because Hughes can't be bothered with such things. His ideas are much too big to be limited by money. Baldwin plays Juan Trippe, who runs Pan Am and in doing so finds his company's position threatened by Hughes' TWA. What's a businessman to do when threatened? Why, take advantage of his relationship with a corrupt politician of course. Alda fills that role and the back and forth between Alda's slimy senator and a defiant DiCaprio is among the film's highlights. As usual, Scorsese has gotten the best out of his cast.

Capturing the essence of a man whose life had so many tremendous peaks and valleys is quite difficult. Add in a potentially crippling mental illness and the challenge gets ratcheted up another notch. Very few directors could have pulled this off but Scorsese succeeds. We go along for a fascinating ride, reveling in Hughes' triumphs and agonizing right along with him in his darkest hours. It is a triumph for Scorsese but perhaps even more so for DiCaprio who brilliantly captures both the genius and the madness of Howard Hughes. Perhaps the film could have been a little more concise but with everything Hughes did in his life it's easy to imagine the film could have actually ended up being much longer. It would be impossible to tell the whole story of Howard Hughes. The story Scorsese and DiCaprio give us is a fascinating and eminently worthwhile one.",8
8 March 2009,Unfortunately a bore....,"The Aviator is a boring movie if only because Leonardo Dicaprio stole the show. Instead of Leo portraying a character in a story, he thrust his persona onto the screen and essentially killing the character in it. You are thus not watching Howard Hughes' life and drama but Leo's own rendering of it. I'll admit that he is fun to watch, but after seeing him do the same act in Titanic, catch me if you can, Departed, and another recent movie I can't remember the name, he becomes lame and uninteresting as every repetitive one-man-stand tends to be no manner how funny or charming. I was constantly searching throughout the movie to see one unusual gesture of character that is not of the Dicaprio routine. But unfortunately Leo's character was constantly there at every move and gesture, and every facial expression he made was invariably another one of those already-familiar highly-overplayed Leonardo-Dicaprio displays. Perhaps Leo should begin putting his talent into sequels and series where he will be more interesting as Leo-being-himself-all-the-time rather than Leo-trying-to-portray-another-character.

9 July 2005,sucks,"OK this is my first review, sorry it had to be this way, but i had to comment on it. Hughes was a very interesting person. I was interested in this movie for this reason and direction from friends. I am an avid movie watcher with my own home theater and 112"" TV! I've tried to watch this movie three times now and this movie is so freaking drab and boring and long. I guess people that comment and enjoyed this movie must parallel in this demeanor, because thus far...it sucks. p.s. so does DeCaprio (poor actor). OK, I had to amend this comment three times because this stupid database doesn't allow for you to post slag or anything of the like and likewise the comments have to be ten lines long. This sucks arseholes also.

27 January 2005,Slowest film in history!,"I went to the cinema on a whim and thought I'd watch the new Scorsese film DESPITE not really having liked Leonardo Di Caprio's acting since ""What's eating Gilbert Grape"". In one way I am happy I did go yesterday, though this film has to be the slowest moving film I have ever sat through. The plot, which could have been such an interesting story, was jumping here and there and everywhere and introducing characters that had nothing to do with the storyline just to introduce them. Very confusing and very dull for longer periods of time. What DOES save this film is actually Leonardo Di Caprio! I have not seen this man act as well as he does in this since ..... since his last Oscar nominated film! My hat off for Leo, but Scorsese needs to get back on track and care more of the plot line than the cinematography! This is far from his best film.......

28 February 2005,"DeCaprio Recites Howard Hughes' Lines, Badly","I really wish I could be more inclined to like The Aviator. Howard Hughes lead an interesting, if somewhat strange, life. He covered an era of enormous change & discovery in the world & America, as well as developing & promoting many great developments himself (noteably the cantilever bra for Jean Harlow!).

I also love Marting Scorsese, he's made some marvelous films. Even Leonarod DeCaprio showed great promise after Catch Me if You Can. Yet this films lacks that ""something"", this assembly of parts is less than you would expect when viewed as a whole.

First of all lets start with the good. Alan Alda is terrific, snarly & mean as Sen. Brewster & after this performance Kate Blanchet would surely be the top choice for anyone wanting to do the life story of Katherine Hepburn. Gwen Steffani as Jean Harlow does a passable job, but lacks the uh, ""assets"" that so enamored Harlow to Hughes & Jude Law continues to build up a great body of work as Eroll Flynn. It is admittedly hard to portray such well know people on screen, when you have actors portraying actors.

This is what is so unforgivable about DeCaprio. Hughes is largely unknown to the public, we have seen some old footage resurface with the release of this film, mainly the congressional hearings he was involved with. But DeCaprio simply does not capture the voice, the mannerisms or the look of Hughes. Is it as if he's still at the ""reading through the lines"" stage, not acting at all. What we are left with is Leonardo DeCarpio reciting Howard Hughes' words in a flat, soul less manner. What we are seeing is DeCaprio, only what we hear is Hughes.

Some of the CGI is also flaccid, the crash that played such a central role in the way Hughes' life developed is obviously fake, much like the Japanese aircraft in Pearl Harbor (which would have looked more convincing if they'd been on strings!). Some people get carried away with CGI special effects, they are captivated with the cleverness of what they can do, without realising that the final footage can look simply uninspiring. These directors can learn a lot from such classics as The Battle of Britain for tips on how to film flying sequences that pack an emotional punch, all without a single kilobyte of CGI.

Also the story line is somewhat sanitised. The poster for this film says that ""Some dreamed of the future, he built it"" yet this does not line up at all well with Hughes' insistence on pursuing the Spruce Goose project. This was done both at great public & private costs, leading to a technological dead end. This was obvious for a very long time, yet Hughes wouldn't face up to reality & stuck with outdated technology while the world around him changed. He didn't build the future, he built the past. Whatever his previous achievements were this showed his inability to move on past a certain period of time in his life.

This film ranks along with such other Guff-Monsters as Titanic & Pearl Harbor, although it is a far better effort than either of those two dreadful films. None the less Aviator is in this category because it should be good, could have been fantastic, but in the end it is simply acceptable",5
9 February 2015,Truly worthy of the man,"(89%) Anybody out there who doesn't know who Howard Hughes is then this a real eye-opening treat because the first time I watched this as a teenager I couldn't imagine one man living such an interesting life. And if there must be a biopic of any one man in modern history, then you'd need to go a very long way to find one as worthy. The guy made multi-million dollar movies at a time when a million dollars was a million dollars, while at the same time certain people claimed that the film industry is nothing more a passing fad that will die out within the next ten or so years when people start to get bored with it. And as a matter of fact the film-making side of his life is only scratching the surface of one small portion that defined this unique, yet damaged man. This at times feels somewhat more like a product of Spielberg than of Scorsese, which isn't a criticism because this is as well shot, as it is brilliantly acted, and finely written. For me this is one of the better biopics ever put to screen, and ranks among the directors, as well as DiCaprio's, best work.

28 March 2016,One for the ages,"There will be spoilers.

This film is simply spectacular. The movie is directed brilliantly, the Academy gave it everything: Cinematography, Film Editing, Art Direction, Costume Design the stage is set. Everyone is instantly taken to the time in question. Some may say there are several scenes too much, however if you wish to feel the atmosphere of the film and see the character development makes perfect sense.

On the other side of the camera DiCaprio is astonishing! This was the time for the Academy to recognize he is one of the greats. This was definitely an Oscar worthy performance. The scene ""Come in with the milk"" and the bottles shot are just amazing. The portrayal performance of Howard Hughes is witnessing the maturity of the actor. This is a must see performance and movie as the whole cast is making this a cinematic experience.

Quite simply you will never forget the Aviator.",9
30 March 2005,a cinematic excellence but a shallow plot,"the movie surly did not live up to the hype created. the movie focuses on Howard Huges life in its twenties. his love affairs, his passion for flying and last but not the least his obsessive compulsive disorder. Howard Hughes a flying pioneer dreamed of making big movies and big planes. The movie shows how he translated his dreams into reality. Unfortunately, he was a victim of OCD, a devastating mental disorder. Dicaprio has undoubtedly portrayed the sickness as if he himself was suffering from the same. His fear of dirt, the burning of clothes and washing of hands brings alive the devastation of the sickness and his eventual descent to madness. it also shows the courage with which combats the sickness to make a heavily budgeted movies and his fearless flying. Cate blanchett has done a pretty good acting but not really worthy of an Oscar.this movie marks the ascent of dicaprio from a teen to a man. its worth watching once. the movie though deserves its Oscar for cinematography but is no match with artistic excellence of Gangs Of New York

6 March 2006,gollllllllllllllllllllllly!!,"Along with Ray and Sideways, this was another masterpiece of 2004. It was well acted and very well written. Leonardo DiCaprio was insane as the plane wizard Howard Hughes. He had that s**t cracking to a T. Everything about his portrayal was perfect. In my opinion, I think he is tied with Jamie Foxx for the acting category because there were no flaws in his acting. It was completely smooth. Katherine Hepburn is proudly looking down on Cate Blanchett because of her portrayal of her. Blanchlett stole the first half of the movie. She was absolutely awesome. I liked how she screamed out ""Golly"" during the scene where they flew a plane together LOL. It was really great. Since when did Alan Alda from M.A.S.H turn into such an a**hole. I was hoping that Leo would win that battle at the end of the movie. Overall, The Aviator is one of the best flicks of 2004.

24 August 2005,"Di Caprio is awesome, but the movie is not.","This movie is just far too long and a bit on the boring side. Di Caprio is again shown as one hell of an actor. The actress who plays Catherine Hepurn is incredible. A great cast of characters. BUT, the movie is just a bit too long. It does do a very good job on showing how wacky Hughes becomes as he ages. He was quite the man. By the end of the movie you want to shut it off and call it a night. But stick with it and see the whole thing through. Better yet. If you do not have an interest in Howard Hughes....do not watch this movie.... it will mean nothing to you. I cannot say how accurate this movie is on his life, but I am sure you can research more about him if you wish.

1 February 2005,Intriguing,"Who was Howard Hughes? Howard Hughes was Captain Queeg, both the Queeg who wound up mumbling while juggling ball bearings under cross-examination in court and the Queeg rightly praised for helping defend the country behind the scenes before World War II ever started.

Howard Hughes was Elvis, lighting up the world and then slipping off his drug-addicted throne in the night.

Howard Hughes was Nikola Tesla, genius extraordinaire who wound up a lunatic feeding the pigeons on the steps of the NY Public Library.

Yes, Howard Hughes was a flawed genius. Who isn't flawed? I'd like to meet that person. Hughes' flaws were just bigger than some and ultimately consumed him, but he lived a heck of a life.

As to this film, it also is flawed because it doesn't answer the question of who Hughes was, except to portray Hughes as cool but really, really weird. There is no rhyme or reason given for anything. Things are done because Howard Hughes wants them done. Period. An overused attempt at a ""Rosebud"" gimmick attempts to explain everything, but to me at least, explains nothing.

A glaring problem to me is that there is an almost violent obsession in this film with Mr. Hughes' obsessive-compulsive disorder even though that didn't really take on its grotesque dimensions until late in his life. This film wants to paint him as Rainman at the very moment of his last and greatest triumph, the flight of the Spruce Goose. Yes, he died with long fingernails and so forth and so on. But that was almost 30 years later! And even then, he still, in his final years, was able to conduct a lucid telephone interview with reporters to discredit the famed unauthorized ""authorized"" biography. Hughes was still active in Hollywood until the late 1950s. I think that this film's attempt to paint Hughes as a freak during a time when he wasn't one yet - he was just a lovable eccentric throughout his public life - is disappointing.

The best parts of the film show Howard Hughes in action, making instant decisions and pulling the aviation industry ahead with his teeth. The worst parts are the talky and often clunky melodramatic interludes, with inexplicable scenes of girlfriends ramming their cars into his and so forth. The most striking scene is Hughes pulling himself together to testify before the Senate and turning the inquisition back on the inquisitor. The aviation scenes, collectively, make the film, though.

The person I saw this with asked an excellent question as we left. ""Wasn't Hughes ever married?"" That you can sit through a three-hour film on a man and not even get a hint at an answer to that basic question - in fact, you get all sorts of hints at the wrong answer to that question - is inexplicable.

This film has some of the same flaws as ""Gangs of New York."" That film had some excellent scenes, then fell apart when it tried to become a documentary. This film doesn't quite fall apart, but it loses its focus when it forces in unnecessary allusions to Hughes' later problems. There is a lot of great stuff, and a lot of sloppiness to this film. I think that Scorcese is a great film-maker who needs a disciplined editor.

I liked ""The Aviator."" I consider it one of the best of 2004 for a number of reasons, not least because overall it really is favorable to its subject and continues the justified rehabilitation of Howard Hughes that began with ""The Rocketeer."" Leo DiCaprio gives a fabulous performance. But the script is too indulgent, the editing too porous, the effects too showy. Why? To what end? Those are the questions that need to be answered about Mr. Hughes, and they aren't even asked in this film.",7
4 May 2008,A misfire with good flying scenes,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",5

16 January 2005,A pity this wasn't the extended edition,"It seems that the Aviator is heading for Oscar glory this year, but if it does win I suspect it will be more of a nod to Scorsese's body of work. This is not to say that this is a bad film and it would have really deserved it's likely Oscar success had the majority of the first hour been saved for the extended edition DVD.

The film focuses on the early years of Hughes especially his love of flying. His fight against mental illness is also dealt with and most people familiar with 20th century history will know where the story is leading. DiCaprio puts in a reasonable performance in the lead and is well supported by the rest of the cast including the excellent John C Reilly.

Once the film gets into stride it's gripping during the second act. If you turn up for the screening about 45 minutes late you'll see a really excellent film.

16 January 2005,The Moose Hole - 'The Aviator' Soars!,"The story for The Aviator resurrects the aberrant life of Howard Hughes and presents it in the grandiose, nostalgic, and mythological style that only Martin Scorsese could have achieved so seamlessly and effectively all at the same time. In spite of its lavish three-hour time length, the film's flow and consistency is never once interrupted by abrupt slow periods, nor does it ever outpace its audience's ability to divulge information at a reasonable pace. Already at this point it is leaps and bounds ahead of the bumbling monstrosity that was Gangs of New York. And although the first few minutes of the picture in which Hughes' mother bathes the young boy in a tub of water in a dimly lit room and speaks to him of avoiding the disease-filled residence of a neighbor may seem a bit awkward when it first starts out, given time it will be made all the more understandable as eloquent symbolism to the sporadic nature of Howard Hughes.

Howard Hughes, whether he be the man, the legend, or quite possibly a combination of the two, truly is the focus of this picture and Leonardo DiCaprio, having been snubbed in years past for his roles in both Titanic and Gangs of New York, captures brilliantly the eccentric aviator's maverick personality and from the very first scenes instantly grapples the attention of his audience in much the same way as Hughes would have wanted it done. Whether or not he receives a golden statuette this time around, let alone receives a nomination at the Academy Awards ceremony, DiCaprio, in the short years since his breakout performance in the smash-hit Titanic, has built up quite an impressive resume none-the-less, especially given that he has actually demonstrated true acting potential rather then simply riding the wave of pure publicity and hype. Cate Blanchett, an especially gifted actress who has rounded up in recent years particularly well-deserved acclaim from critics for her roles in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Veronica Guerin, reflects perfectly the extraordinary, if not often curious, nature of the late-Katharine Hepburn. Alan Alda, famous for his portrayal of Hawkeye Pierce in the acclaimed television series M*A*S*H, proves that in all his years in the glitzy Hollywood business he has failed to lose his touch, giving a brilliantly stark performance as the conniving Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. In a particular scene in which the senator invites Howard to a luncheon meeting in a last ditch effort to avoid a public hearing and have him fold on the refutation of his new aviation bill, he appears as though he takes pleasure in tormenting Hughes' now apparent mental condition, going so far as to pick up a glass at the last minute and place a smudge mark on it directly in Hughes' line of sight. Splendidly Hughes, refusing to be baited and racking his bodily functions to fight back the affects of his mental condition, stuns Brewster by drinking straight out of that glass and forces him to be on the defensive, a position no one, let alone a senator of the United States Congress, finds comfortable. Surely not everything that Hughes did, most notably taking money from the government for projects he never completed or delivered and bribing military contractors, can be defined as just but he can not be blamed entirely for that given that those were the sign of the times. If anything, this investigation brought about a change in the way the aviation industry would be dealt with and Hughes' stern rebuttal of Brewster's true intentions single-handedly restored the idea of capitalism in yet another branch of the U.S. industrial system.

Overall, The Aviator, in much the same light as its subject of discussion, is larger then life itself and for what seems once in a blue moon on the screen that does not go aggressively against it, ensuring its rightful place as the film to beat this awards season. The film ends rather abruptly with Hughes standing directly in front of a grungy bathroom mirror, repeating the phrase ""wave of the future"", and should the audience feel angered or disappointed by this conclusion then Martin Scorsese will have successfully pulled off his desired effect. True to form, the life of Howard Hughes' was never the same again from that moment on. For the mythic man who had done so much in his lifetime up to that point and at the same time had far more yet to accomplish, Hughes' condition spiraled out of control, reducing him to live in total obscurity in one of his several casinos in Las Vegas, dying of kidney failure. That, ladies and gentlemen, is truly the disheartening conclusion to the eccentric, yet majestic, life of Mr. Howard Hughes. The man who perhaps was greatly overshadowed by the legendary figure he helped create and whose shoes he could not fill. Scorsese, a man always willing to be daring and take a risk when it comes to the exact look and feel of a particular film, brilliantly  how many times can that be said of him  captures in each year that is represented the accurate visual style of the color film of that time period, whether it was the old-fashioned Cinecolor or the two-strip Technicolor film. And as the story progresses, the film's appearance matures and fills out more, giving The Aviator a visual quality all its own, setting its miles apart from the competition. Undoubtedly this film will not be everyone's cup of tea, as disappointing as that may be to hear given as how apparently masterful it is, but rest assured that given the proper number of viewings and a through understanding of the life and time of the man who was Howard Hughes, it will be easy for anyone to see as to why this will be the film that gives Scorsese his absurdly overdue Academy Award this year.",9
17 January 2005,"Interesting, but not gripping","When I saw this film, I didn't know what it was going to be about, but with DiCaprio and a title such as ""The Aviator"" I thought it was going to be a good action film. Unfortunately this was not the case. The film was the based on the life of the famous director and aviator Howard Hughes. What resulted was an interesting look on the Howard Hughes, life. Hughes himself was brilliantly played by DiCaprio who managed to maintain my interest in the film. Kate Beckinsale also looked amazing in the film adding a bit of colour to it. There were a few moments of comedy and the scenes involving the planes were very dramatic. What let this film down though was its length. I myself had not studied Howard Hughes' life but managed to predict a quite boring ending to what was a very long film. Therefore I lost my interest in it near the end and was happy to get out of the cinema after a quite boring ending. In conclusion, the film is a very interesting look on Hughes' life, but it's not going to keep your attention if you're after an action film.

3 August 2020,Portraying Complicated characters became scorsese trademark,"The aviator Howard Hughes is one of the most perplex , ambitious and philanthropist persons of America ,a great character that the audience embrace and like the most in the movie and by talking about him lets head to the other Katherine the nice and complicated as well the girlfriend that helped him in toughest moments of his life and not to forget senator RALPH well for the performances i consider Cate Blanchett performance as one the best one's in the last decade , and boy how they dare not to give Leo his first Oscar Marty did a great job with camera ,the jump cuts and the fast movement made some scenes, tense, crazy and helped to enrich the story by revealing ""Howard"" sickness If you need lessons for this life i think that Howard bio in this movie is the best for you to know that giving up is never an option

7 January 2005,"It'll win at least one Oscar, but there are definite flaws","I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",7

18 December 2004,This Film Breezes Through 3 Hours,"The Aviator is a fantastic film, depicting the life of John Hughes. The film touches on his unusual childhood upbringing, using his inheritance to fund a big movie project, and his fascination with planes. This film, although spanning just under 3 hours, is a nail-biter all the way. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat, with a great performance by Dicaprio and cast, that comes alive on screen. This film may not be one of the best to come out this year in theaters, but it is a step up from recent big budget releases to hit this Christmas season. The film is definitely worth the money to be seen, and don't worry about the 3 hour run time, it will breeze on by in a flash.

17 March 2005,Tedious at Times,"Despite the hype attached to this picture, the Motion Picture Academy made the right decision for once in awarding best picture to ""Million Dollar Baby"" and best director to Clint Eastwood. ""The Aviator"" is certainly cinematic. All the major roles are exceptionally well acted. The film's weakness lies in the direction and editing. The picture drags in a number of places, particularly in the scenes intended to show that Howard Hughes is one weird fellow. The idea could have been conveyed equally well with fewer scenes and considerably less footage. I have to wonder whether the movie would have been equally interesting if it were fiction instead of biography populated with figures like Hughes himself, Katherine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, Juan Trippe (who ran Pan Am), Senator Owen Brewster of Maine and Noah Dietrich, Hughes' principal aide, not to mention more minor figures (for purposes of the picture) like Jean Harlow, Louis B. Mayer, Errol Flynn. My guess is that it would not have been half as interesting as pure fiction. Part of the charm is watching actors like DiCaprio, Blanchette, Beckinsale, Baldwin, Alda, and Reilly impersonate real people that I personally remember. My bottom line: Martin Scorcese fumbled this by being overly preoccupied with the pictorial elements and insufficiently ruthless in the editing process.",7
23 May 2014,Neat and Perfect movie,"""Huge goals, lots of dedication and bit of craziness, these are some requirement to achieve those you had fixed to achieve"", 2004's ""The Aviator"" is all about the crazy business man, film producer and aviation freak Howard Hughes, he is actually a dreamer who always dream big and pursue to fulfill it, he plans a movie that must create a mark as a richest film of his time and he succeeds in doing so, he comes out with a richest movie of that time 'Hell's Angels', but he never stop with this, being an aviation freak he plans to be a 'fastest flying man in the planet' and built the fastest plane H-1 Racer which succeeds in being world's fastest plane of that time, he goes one step forward and buys TWA Airline the US airline giant of that time and move to become a king of airline, he gets the contract with US Air force to build some advance planes, he succeeds in building one of those kind but end up in huge crash resulting in massive injury to him, but he never let it go, he take up a project of building huge airplane by the name 'Hercules', he faces various problems on his way, like financial crisis, legal restrictions and some relationship scandals, but the huge challenge he happens to face is against his Obsessive Compulsive Disorders (OCD) this makes him to get isolated from the public for some days, he gets locked himself in his projector room and spend days alone, after getting bit better from his problem he resolves all his external obstacles and move on, he successfully fly the 'Hercules' and continues to become a pioneer in aviation field.

With such an outstanding plot this movie gives you a wholesome entertainment and inspiration, no doubt Leonardo DiCaprio had given full justice for the role of Howard Hughes, the making is brilliant especially the editing part and must to be mentioned thing about this movie is the screen play and the direction which is so neat and perfect that never raises confusion anywhere, getting 5 Oscar award is much worth to it, great flick.",8
26 February 2005,The Best of the Year,"The most exciting and intense picture of resent years. Scorsese directs this beautifully lit and moving biopic with the help of the best acting talent around today. Dicaprio shines as the eccentric Hughes. And the seasoned supporting cast keeps up with his dynamic performance in their own unique ways. Alan Alda is brilliant as the seedy Senator from Maine. And Alec Baldwin again perfectly fits the bill as the ""evil"" supporting character. Blanchet turns an impression of Heburn into an entire original character of her own, which leaves the audience begging for a spin-off movie. Perhaps ""Kate"" or ""Kate, the Cursed."" Or maybe she can fight Japanese villains with animals jumping from their chests. Hell, she's Kate Hepburn, why not? The color scheme and set design are beautifully meshed together to form a real feel of that time period. The Aviator deserves every award that it is nominated for. And it is high time for Mr. Scorsese to meet Oscar.

Final Verdict: A+

25 September 2009,The Aviator Crashes and Burns,"The Aviator is a film that had terrific potential to tell a compelling story, but the potential was unrecognized.

The usually bullet proof Martin Scorsese ultimately disappointed with this feature. I'm not certain where exactly he went wrong, but it almost seemed to me that halfway through the film, it was as if he gave up.

The acting is fine & the art direction is wonderful, but somewhere throughout the process of shooting this film, the story becomes bogged down and seems to be stuck in quick sand.

Attempting to tell the story of the super eccentric Howard Hughes and his love for flight, obviously proved to be too much for Marty to handle. There were scenes that were done well and quite interesting, but in a moment, large amounts of time passes to get to the next scene which not only confuses the viewer, but brings us to a moment in Howard's life that if far from interesting or captivating. In short, the interesting, key parts of the film were too short and scenes that were not needed were far too long. This seemed to be the norm throughout the film.

In closing, by the end of this movie, there was still plenty of story that should have been told, as I have an interest in Howard Hughes and his life. For people who were not familiar with him who saw the movie, I think they got a raw deal and were short changed.",4
8 August 2005,"Scorsese does it again! A Must-see for any fan of cinema, best of 04'","Scorsese's film is better after watching it for a second time. I love this film. Its absolutely perfect. A 170 minute film that kept me interested throughout the whole thing. Its a great biopic about Howard Hughes and the obstacles he encountered while making great advancements in aviation and making a few films as well. Scorsese's direction is brilliant, i love the mood and feel of this film. Great job again by my favorite director. The screenplay is very interesting, at times very funny and great drama, John Logan (of Last Samurai, Gladiator fame) does a good job here. The cast is also good, Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances, he is better than Gangs of New York which i previously believed to be his best performance along with What's eating gilbert grape. Cate Blanchett shines as the leading lady, great to see her working with scorsese. The supporting cast is great as well, kate beckinsale was believable and good as ava gardner a few steps up from her poor acting in pearl harbor. Adam Scott was also good in this film. John C. Reily, Alan Alda and Ian Holm all gave great supporting performances as well. The film has a great score by Howard Shore, and great cinematography by a very talented Robert Richardson (Bringing out the dead, u-turn, casino), this guy has filmed some of my favorite films, great cinematography in aviator as well. There was nothing i didn't like about this film, I mean i usually am critical of Scorsese, but i don't see why people bash his later efforts, his past 3 films are all personal favorites of mine and although they don't rank as high as Taxi Driver, Casino, and Goodfellas in my favorite film list, they are still up there. Anyhow, 10/10 for Aviator, #45 on my list of all time favorite films",10
2 July 2021,a total white wash,"There was nothing about the film that interested me besides the production design. Leonardo was nothing like what Hughes was, who was over six feet tall. And to ignore the fact that Hepburn was a Lesbian only goes to show what a cowardly director he is. For some reason Hollywood is in love with everything this director does, and the film going public just goes along. I personally hated, Cape Fear, loved the original, Hugo, Shudder Island, Gangs of New York, Age of Innocence. With the sort of budgets he can command, there is no reason they should not look good. His best film IMO is WOLF OF WALL STREET. That being a huge surprise for me.

6 December 2005,A fabulous film - Two hours and fifty minutes well spent!,"The critics panned it, the audiences stayed away, the Academy didn't give it it's due - all in all ""The Aviator"" was a theater-goer's disappointment all around. So maybe I'm a sucker for a beautiful period-piece or maybe I just don't know a stinker when I see it, but I say that ""The Aviator"" was a superb film that I will watch again & again.

Scorsese has made some mediocre movies (Gangs of New York & New York, New York come to mind) but this isn't one of them. The casting was brilliant, the cinematography inspired (watch how certain scenes of different time-periods have a ""vintage"" cinematic look to them), the music fabulous and the acting spot-on. For those who thought DiCaprio was too ""baby-faced"" or too young to play Hughes, take a look at a few Hughes photographs from the 30's and you will see that he was not the more rugged looking fellow from after his near-fatal plane crash. The baby-face works here and lends even more to the realism that DiCaprio gives to his portrayal of HH.

I was captivated by Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Kate Hepburn as well as Kate Beckinsale's portrayal of Ava Gardner. Both actresses did a bang-up job of giving their characters a panache and fire that would have been necessary to match them against such a formidable lover and opponent as Hughes was to these two paramours. I was disappointed, however, that there was no mention made of Hughes' well known bisexuality and his alleged connection to the murder of rumored lover David Bacon (of The Masked Marvel serial movie fame). This could have been a great side story and I feel it was an opportunity missed by the screenwriters & the director.

All in all, this is a movie I will list in my personal top 20 and once I own the DVD will watch over & over just as I do Tombstone, Titanic, Malcolm X & Wyatt Earp. If you haven't seen it because of the negative comments here or those given by critics at it's release give ""The Aviator"" an opportunity to captivate you. If you've seen it but disliked it because it's not an ""action-packed-thriller"" watch it again and make note of the fabulous sets, the wonderful cinematography, the music and the dead-on portrayal of Hughes by Leonardo DiCaprio. And for heaven's sake if for nothing else watch it for the slick flying and aviation engineering history lesson.

This film is definitely a winner in my book!",9
17 June 2023,DiCaprio Plays Howard Hughes In Another Great Performance.,"When every performance is great, can any performance really ""stand out""? Has Leonardo DiCaprio ever had a bad performance? Or, even an average performance?

This movie was long, but needed to be longer. I hadn't seen this since the mid-2000's, and was surprised that the story abruptly ends at mid-life. Hughes' life had many more interesting stories left to tell, but it seems that Scorsese wanted to end the film on a positive note.

This is a fine film - with a big budget, a great cast, and great camera work.

17 September 2006,One of Scorsese's best-should have won Best Picture,"A fantastic epic following the unrestrained genius of a man who eventually slips into madness. It is remarkable that Howard Hughes is not more of a cultural icon having run a booming company, produced and directed acclaimed movies, designed planes, broken speed and distance records, and battled a senate committee (which was filmed in a fashion that is comparable to any of the great boxing ring bouts).

DiCaprio just gets better with each movie superbly playing a character that can mix it with the best business minds of the time yet has trouble finding his way out of a toilet. John C. Reilly provides another rock-solid support role.

This film also gives us a colourful glamorous insight into the stars of that era with Cate Blanchet, Kate Beckinsale, and Jude Law using their considerable talents to do their take on the black and white icons of the time.

This is an inspiring movie for anyone that has faced a major life challenge and a beacon for those that have confronted dozens.",10
6 December 2004,movie was incredible,"Just saw The Aviator today at a Screen Actors screening The movie was incredible Leonardo DeCaprio was great as Howard Hughes

Cate Blanchet will be nominated for her role, the sets were so wonderful that I couldn't believe what I was watching and without special effects Scorcese captured the 30s and 40s with incredible accuracy and the momentum of the film takes you on a great ride I was not expecting this good a film but it was more than I expected

I rate my movies by how long they are and how many bathroom stops I make

I never left my seat for the entire film and thats a major accomplishment

Enjoy the film The dialogue is delicious and the era is captured

Have a wonderful time at the movies

This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",2
3 December 2006,Excellent in all respects with one minor quibble,"It's still a ten, but: what's with GWEN STEFANI as Jean Harlow? That's a huge miscast. Harlow, for one thing, had BLUE EYES. They didn't even bother to give Stefani contact lenses.

Harlow was wide-jawed and had high Nordic cheekbones. Gwen Stefani is a skinny Italian chick with a pinched little face and close-set eyes.

Stefani is not a natural blonde, never was. Jean Harlow was a natural blonde.

Jean Harlow had a more robust build; Stefani is a scrawny-throated, bony gaggling chicken.

Kirsten Dunst would have been a MUCH better choice. Even Reese Witherspoon would have done better. This was a tribal choice, not an artistic one. Or else Gwennie was doing someone.",10
31 May 2005,"Slow as syrup, but very well executed","I rented The Aviator along with other films that I picked up from blockbuster. Truly, I didn't really know if this was going to be a good movie or not. There has been a lot of mixed reviews on the movie because of its length, even though it was nominated for 11 Oscars. After viewing the movie, I thought it was pretty good. I mean I wasn't really disappointed in the film or happy at all, but it was just right what I actually was expecting. The directing by Martin Scorsese is of course great and he never fails and the acting is great by all the characters especially by DiCaprio and Blanchett by putting up hard roles. What the film lacked was its length and how slow it was. There was ever hardly any build ups to the movie and it kept me pretty uncomfortable in my seat. The movie was just a little too long and it could of been a little faster and not as slow. Overall, it was a pretty good film and it had a great atmosphere revolving around the 20's, 30's, and 40's, but in ways, it could've been better.

2 February 2005,Inside the Mind of Howard Hughes,"Howard Hughes was a legendary figure, remembered for his vast fortune and his eccentricities. Martin Scorsese tells his story in ""The Aviator,"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the young billionaire. Leo puts in an intense performance, showing a driven, concentrating look in his eyes. The story follows Hughes' life from his days as a maverick movie director on the set of ""Hell's Angels,"" to his work innovating aircraft, his descent into madness and his conflicts with the Government. The look of the movie is wonderful, recreating the glamour of old Hollywood. Hughes' love life is also examined, with Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, Gwen Stefani making a cameo as Jean Harlow, and Cate Blanchett putting in a snappy performance as Kate Hepburn. In the end, you might not understand Howard Hughes better, but it's a fascinating ride.

31 January 2005,May contain more information than you want to know.,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother.

8 January 2005,Fun to watch - Lacks purpose,"If you enjoy modern films that depict Hollywood fiction and lore, this is a must see. It's dazzling cast of characters is a wonder to behold. From Ava Gardner to Errol Flynn this movie gives you a glimpse of what Hollywood's golden age might have looked like from within. It contains some enjoyable air sequences and Leonardo does a good job with his role. I would've like to have seen more done with the main character as well as with Hepburn. Their interactions were the most entertaining in the film: Blanchett nails the accent. I just felt like we were watching a heavily editing version of the film. Perhaps the DVD will contain an extended version that will leave you feeling more satisfied.

3 September 2005,Scorcese back at close to top form,"The Aviator finds Scorsese back at close to top form after some of the disappointment that attended The Gangs Of New York (2002). This is partly because in Howard Hughes the director has once again found a driven, flawed character such has typically appeared in his most successful work. Like a Travis Bickle, Henry Hill, or Jake La Motta, Hughes is another self-tortured soul on the way to a dramatic end, a journey whose effects are orchestrated by a filmmaker currently at the height of his powers. And unlike the narrative weaknesses which informed his previous film, The Aviator has a strong story line with a coherent and compelling sweep, one which takes events down several decades with ease. The Academy obviously thought so, as the film won five out of its 11 Oscar nominations.

At centre of Scorsese's biopic is reclusive flyer, aircraft designer, film producer, eccentric lover, and multi-millionaire obsessive-compulsive Hughes, whose colourful career surely provides enough material for a dozen films. He's been portrayed before of course: notably by Tommy Lee Jones (The Amazing Howard Hughes, 1977), and Jason Robards (Melvin And Howard, 1980), and others. But none of these previous incarnations had the benefits of Scorsese's budget or his undeniable cinematic flair. Combined, they make for compelling viewing as we see Hughes' private life and career rise and soar, before entering the turbulent years of rivalry with Pan-Am over the transatlantic aero market and the entrepreneur's increasing mental problems. Indeed, part of the fun of Scorsese's film lies in the symptom-watching, judging just when the hero famously tips over the edge, anticipating his future years hidden away in shrouded hotel rooms with long nails and matted hair. (This viewer has it when Hughes raises his hand into the air, as if suddenly noticing germs, during a late screening of Hell's Angels). Scriptwriter John Logan co-wrote Gladiator, and so he's well used to organising a larger-than-life central character, while his writing on RK280 (1999), an account of the genesis of Citizen Kane, showed an informed and affectionate interest in the legendary tales of Hollywood. Like Welles did with Kane, Logan places the origin of Hughes' personality quirks firmly in his childhood, and includes a suggestive opening scene neatly encapsulating obsession, cleanliness, and aberrant sexuality.

Some critics have felt that the director could profitably spent more time on Hughes' years as a recluse, but this would have meant a different, longer, and perhaps less satisfying film. In fact Leonardo DiCaprio's performance remains strongest when relating to others. His moments alone in his room, while dramatically necessary, are arguably weaker than when the declining Hughes interacts with disturbed intimates, although even in this isolation Scorsese gives madness a fascination of its own.

DiCaprio's acting is to be commended in a film covering such ambitious ground, and is generally successful. One is reminded of Giant (1956), a film in which another youthful actor, James Dean, is called to play a character ageing over a span of years. Like Dean, DiCaprio is perhaps still too fresh faced be entirely convincing as a mature man, but its only a minor distraction. In fact this is the best he's been for some time, proof further that under Scorsese's guidance the actor is doing his finest work. The director certainly has no reservations about DiCaprio having already announced his starring part in a new gangster project, 'The Departed'. A fine supporting cast, notably Cate Blanchett as Hughes' main infatuation Katherine Hepburn - the only woman who apparently gave him a run for his money - and a still sprightly Alan Alda, marvellous as scheming Senator Brewster, helps matters along considerably.

Inevitably in a film titled The Aviator, there's a lot of flying and chat about planes. Fortunately, Hughes thought big, and his outlandish projects (including one seaplane the 'Spruce Goose' the biggest ever built and which hardly flew) are eye candy in themselves, while Scorsese revels in the enthusiasm and drive which Hughes brought to his projects. Indeed Hughes is seen taking almost sensual pleasure in the smooth fuselage of his prototype aircraft, his hands feeling for the flush rivets with the same suspenseful concentration as he had earlier seducing a waitress in a club. In fact one senses that Hughes 'flies' his sexual conquests with the same daredevil and rocky approach as that with which he conquers the skies, as his career runs a fine balance between business and obsessive pleasure, risk and enterprise. The inevitable smash-ups, personal or mechanical, when they occur are well done whilst the surrounding intrigues of Hughes' life, whether in the studio, bedroom or congressional committee provide more than adequate distractions from any mundane aspects of aircraft engineering. In Scorsese's hands ultimately the 'aviator' of the title becomes more than a flyer; it becomes the defining mark of a man who took risks, lived too fast, perhaps rose too high until, Icarus like, he was doomed to collapse back.

If there's a criticism of Scorsese's film it is that a good deal of the real life Hughes' more unpalatable character has been suppressed. Like Ford's Young Mr Lincoln (a film which Scorsese admires), there is an occasional air of hagiography about the man in earliest days, a visionary blessed by his personal integrity. But history tells us that this was someone who was a serial seducer of starlets (a characteristic made more palatable here), was rabidly anti-communist, and hated blacks. Clearly a lot of the extreme Hughes was jettisoned to make him a more sympathetic character but, sometime, there is still yet room for a rabid anti-biography.",8
11 November 2015,Terrific performances,"A brilliant film which brings out amazing performances from Leo Di Caprio,Cate Blanchette and Alan Alda. I have seen it three times and it gets better every time. Scorcese is not my favourite director but he brings home the bacon in this film. How Di Caprio did not get an academy award is beyond me - I believe he should have won at least 3 by now. I think he must have rubbed someone up the wrong way in Hollywood and they are denying him because of some imagined slight. The Aviator is a long film but never seems to be so as the story absorbs the viewer totally. I would recommend it to anyone. It is beautiful to look at and tells Howard Hughes' story really well

19 January 2005,A moving and heartbreaking story,"I went into the theater humongously skeptical about Leonardo DiCaprio, who seemed too boyish and callow to play Hughes, but came out a true believer. The film was incredibly moving and heartbreaking. Cate Blanchett overdid Kate Hepburn a bit, and Kate Beckinsale, who played Ava Gardner, had none of Ava's edge and sophistication and world-weariness (and no one will ever be that beautiful), and seemed to be playing dress-up most of the time, but those were not big quibbles for me.

To watch the gradual descent of this man, who had so much passion and promise, was absolutely devastating, and presented with great care and dignity. Unlike most films that deal with mental illness, the human being came through quite clearly. As usual, Scorcese told a complex story with great wit, compassion, and insight, and tremendous drama and flair. And I didn't realize how long it was until I looked at the time when I left the theater, which is a good sign.

31 July 2005,a waste of gunpowder and sky....,"Maybe Scorsese should have gone for a biopic of Jean Harlow, as this has all her shallow glitter, glamour and artifice but lacks any emotional depth or substance. Might also have persuaded him to hire someone more convincing than Gwen Stefani for the role too, but I digress. Plus points: looks great, though often in a curiously indulgent way (blowing the effects budget on Hughes near-fatal crash for example). Some fine performances, notably Cate Blanchett doing a star turn as Katherine Hepburn, the only impersonation which really convinces (Kate Beckinsale manages to look like neither Ava Gardner nor Kate Beckinsale). Leonardo DiCaprio acts his socks off but to no avail - it's that chubby kid again, pretending to be Howard Hughes this time. Disbelief never suspended, but it's a casting fault, not his. Big negatives: it's so damn boring. It seems to go on for ever. It's very old fashioned, being more concerned with chronology and events than really putting work into the connecting themes. Had Scorsese had concentrated on one relationship - maybe the Hughes/ Hepburn thing, which had some really fine, delicate moments - and built a smaller film around that - maybe with a grown-up playing Hughes - it could have been way better, but I guess he's not that kind of director. I kept thinking of that Jonathan Demme movie, 'Howard and Melvin', where Jason Robards' Hughes is only on screen for a few moments yet resonates through the film (and continues to do so afterwards) in a way that diCaprio never does here. To quote Aimee Mann, and like Hughes own colossally expensive yet largely forgotten 'Hell's Angels', what a waste of gunpowder and sky....",4
20 January 2005,Intriguing for those who look above,"First off I must say that clearly this movie is to be commended. It not only allows you to look back at histories most historic advancements in flight, it also allows you see through the eyes of a gifted but eccentric man who revolutionized the world as we know it today. It allows us to learn from this mans message. Emotionally, this movie may not appeal to you. In fact, if you want to experience another romantic dicaprio movie this will not be another titanic. This is a movie about the struggles of business in order to achieve one's passion despite struggling with real life issues. This is not a romantic movie, nore should it be. There are plenty of other options. You could always watch titanic a fifty second time if that's what floats your boat. This is a movie about real life, but most importantly, a movie about no-limits. A movie that reminds us what could be achieved if we look to the stars.

2 January 2006,Mixed bag,"I watched this movie with a load of apprehension. I have always treated biopics with cautiousness, because I don't often get the point of making them. On one hand, the film could be a valuable lesson in history, an insight into the 'man behind the persona' etc... . On the other hand - what do I care? Of course a film like Gandhi breaks the mould once in a while due to its sheer watchability and accurateness, but mostly, Biopics fail to impress because there is nothing of substance in one man's life - no defining purpose or a linear storyline. Life is mostly a jumble of varied and vastly differing experiencing which may or may not be interesting when viewed as a 3 hour package. When the man is Howard Hughes, the risk increases, since even after watching the film I found myself asking the question - Who was this man? Aviator? Filmmaker? Spoilt kid of rich parents?

That said Aviator didn't disappoint me much. As a film it stands out due to a few aspects. First is the direction. Martin Scorcese is a director who has seen many of his creations run on the screen. And the confidence shows on screen, when he experiments with seemingly bizarre tools like painting the screen in colours of his choice, without an ounce of hesitation or explanation. He keeps the film going into places he wants and the viewer follows like a child following his father down the tunnels of New York. We don't see light at the end of the tunnel, but we follow it to the end. He pulls the hero into all the craziness of OCD and doesn't show him beating it to win the odds. That is a relief. Second, as I have mentioned before, the photography of the film is natural and authentic. Closeups of the lead characters, and the CGI generated airplanes rushing at the camera look splendid. Sharp cuts and flashes coupled with eerie sound effects combine to give us a peek into what really worried Hughes when he stepped into crowds and leery photographers. Third, the pace of the film is well maintained, and barring a few places, the story never grows boring or overdone.

But still, I'll have to say that this film is severely flawed in more places than one. The story of the film is feeble to the point of being non existent. There is no concrete purpose to this film - which I personally feel would have given it power and a reason to be. Barely being the child of a talented director cannot be the guarantee to a film's future. Once again I return to the question - What do I care for who Howard Hughes was? He may have been a great person or a mean one at that. But the film gives us no clue towards what we ought to feel for the main lead except pity. That combined with a host of other things, makes you feel as if you were watching a page of tabloid turned into celluloid, one that says 'Oh he wasn't responsible for his craziness, his mother was.' Also, Cate Blanchette puts in a performance which may suit the Oscar jury, but clearly irritated me. Is it the norm for academy to nominate actors who show a combination of insanity and self assurity no matter how averagely done? Cate's role was terribly predictable and I saw a bit of Dominique Francon showing through the chinks.

All in all, you may watch the movie, like it and forget it as one of those movies who have only a past, a present but no future.",5
18 December 2008,A fantastic film.,"This is a fantastic story of a man who had it all and quickly lost it. Scorsese presents us with a fascinating look at the world of showbusiness but in a completely three dimensional way. With some people thinking this film is just about the glitz and nothing else, they just need to take one look at Leonardo Dicaprios performance. Not only do i strongly disagree with the academy favouring Jamie Foxx's unremarkable depiction of Ray Charles but i also feel that this one of the most remarkable displays of acting in the history of cinema.

Scorsese uses his a-list cast to perfection. Alec Baldwin is used to perfection in a small role. Cate Blanchett shines and deservedly wins an Oscar for it. Alda shows us that actors do improve with age. And smaller roles from the likes of Beckinsale and Jude Law show us that there's a reason these actors wanted to be part of this movie. And its simply because, it's brilliant.

11 July 2005,Another Scorsese masterpiece!,"Martin Scorsese has been nominated five times for Best Director at the Academy Awards and not once received an Oscar. Raging Bull, The Last Temptation of Christ, Goodfellas, Gangs of New York, and most recently The Aviator. All of his films have been successes but he has never received credit where credit was due.

In The Aviator, Scorsese depicts the millionaire Howard Hughes; a man who is intelligent, rich as hell, and obsessive compulsive. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the director/aviation expert who wants nothing more than to make more money doing what he loves, not what his father got rich off of. Howard wants to make movies...good movies and to design and fly his own airplanes. In his first film Hell's Angels, he had his own air force built to shoot the realistic dog fights and amazing camera shots. This blockbuster hit took a lot out of him, mentally and financially, but he got it all back.

With the introduction of Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), he finds a person who is rich, famous, and just the person for someone like him. Cate does a phenomenal impersonation of Hepburn and rightly deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Everything seems to be going great for Hughes. He is becoming more of a celebrity and is having some difficulty handling it.

After the success of Hell's Angels, Hughes buys up the majority shares of TWA Airlines. He wants some of his ideas to be made into reality. After breaking the world record of flying speed in an airplane, Howard is ambitious. His ideas for new aircraft and commercial aircraft that are immense are looked at by other rival airlines, such as Pan Am. Everything Howard does is scrutinized by everyone and he starts to crack.

After wrecking his new plane and nearly killing himself, Howard must go on the long road to recovery. Howard was always cautious of germs due to his mother's teachings. His little black bar of soap he uses to wash his hands ""clean"" is of the same nature of Dr. Mannette's work bench in A Tale of Two Cities. Whenever he uses it, he slowly slips back into a bad mental state. Dealing with OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) is not an easy thing for him.

This movie is a brilliant biopic of a man once thought to be genius and insane at the same time. Howard Hughes is showcased as both in this movie. Scorsese shows how a man tormented in his mind deals with his problems while being in the public eye all the time. DiCaprio is absolutely mind blowing as the millionaire Hughes. His portrayal of the man won him an Oscar nomination. The movie took home five Oscars that night, only one in the major categories (Cate Blanchett).

The look of the movie gives it a vintage look from the roaring 20's right up to the 40's. Scorsese directs a gem with The Aviator. It is visually stunning! Scorsese sure can tell a story. This movie is flying high above the rest.",8
7 January 2006,a disappointment,"If the whole world tells you that you must see a certain movie, and this movie wins a lot of Oscar's as well, the disappointment will be big if the movie fails to please you. That's the case with this movie.

Surely a lot of good acting, surely a lot of nice costumes and locations, and the computer-freaks have done a great job with the animations, but this doesn't help if the story is thin and never goes into your heart. It doesn't. As an European, used to see movies from my own country and from Europe, I don't understand what part of the body the people behind the Oscar award committee is thinking with. Do they think with the wallet ? Or can't America offer anything better than this ? Really disappointing.

8 November 2005,Obsessive/Compulsive Disorder has it's positive side.,"""The Aviator"" (2004): I don't know a lot about Howard Hughes, and I truly hope that this film played it straight with historybecause it is a fascinating story, and I'd rather it be accurate. (Oliver Stone DIDN'T make it, Martin Scorcese did, so there IS a better chance it honors the truth!) We've ALL heard about Hughes' final, reclusive, CRAZY years, but ""The Aviator"" covers the majority of his years before he lost himself to what I'm sure would now be labeled ""Obsessive/Compulsive Disorder"". The story immediately takes a peek at his childhood, where an important issue is clarified, and we then dive right into his start with aviation. We see his mind working 1,000 miles per hour, flying in 4 directions at a time, and NEVER shooting down ideas. He gambles everything, often, and fights for what he gets. He's no namby-pamby rich boy. You have to admire him, even if you DON'T want to be in his hire. Leonardo DiCaprio does a fine job, as does Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, Alan Alda, Ian Holm, Gwen Stefani, and Alec Baldwin. The dirty business of politics & payoffs is covered, but so is the glorious, imaginative efforts of Hughes and his engineers. Special effects are excellent, photography is exciting, dialog always interesting, sets & costumes rich with era, scoring greatit's all-around solid character study, and recreation of an era that is worth another look. If you liked the film ""Tucker"", I can assure you ""The Aviator"" will do nothing but top it, which is quite a compliment.",
18 December 2004,"If 2004 has a must see film, this is it.","As an aviation buff (and historian) I went in to the theater today to see The Aviator with a mixed bag of reservations, mostly surrounding the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio as the legendary Howard Hughes. Was I every surprised and impressed at his portrayal of the famed aviator; he was in a word, mesmerizing.

I'm not sure what movie the people here who are complaining about Mr. DiCaprio or the movie's almost three hours running time, but he seemed to capture the essence of the Hughes character completely with his portrayal and while I could see where at least 10 minutes could have been cut, which would have resulted in an even better picture, not once did I think that The Aviator dragged in any way.

The transition in color, while something of a gimmick, worked for me. In watching the movie and now reviewing it in my mind as I write this, I compare it to two other epics, one obvious, one not; Tucker and Das Boat. The similarities between Tucker and The Aviator are obvious and I won't waste the space here as both tell the stories of misunderstood and eccentric industrialists with a sense of passion and compassion that is obvious. With Das Boat, one of my favorite movies, the comparison has more to do with the scope of the story and even a bit with the ballroom scenes. It's here where The Aviator falls a bit short in comparison. Maybe it's the substitution of CGI effects that leaves me a bit cold as it just seems less realistic than what Das Boat accomplished a generation ago with a proportionally smaller budget I'm sure.

I'm going to leave commentary on Mr. Scorcese's direction to others here far more qualified except to say that the movie was well-paced. Of his films I would have to say that this falls in behind Goodfellas and Raging Bull and ahead of Taxi Driver, but that's just one man's opinion.

Even with its flaws, this is a four stars out of four stars film, enjoyable and riveting at the same time, almost three hours of movie making magic. If 2004 has a must see film, this is it.",10
24 January 2005,"HH did amazing things, but why?","I was not very familiar with Howard Hughes. I knew he had made a few movies (never saw any of them, though) and built planes that never flew, but mainly I thought of him as the eccentric recluse of his later years. Now this film shows a totally different character, a man with a vision. And what a vision! HH could so easily have become another spoiled rich kid, bedding starlets, getting drunk and doped up and dying never having done anything besides spending millions seeking vain private pleasures. Instead, the film shows us a frantic movie maker, giving it all for his art, and an even more frantic aviator and airplane builder, to whom a few million dollars are insignificant when they are needed to make his dreams come true. Of course, it's easy to be a big spender when you are swimming in money, and I couldn't see any sign of HH having any social conscience in an era where so many of his countrymen were starving, but at least he used his fortune to create things he believed in. Grandiose things, crazy, fascinating things. But why did he do it? The film never tells us what made HH do all those things he did. First we see him as a kid being washed by his mother, which is probably supposed to explain his future phobia, but then we see him in the middle of shooting Hell's angels and next as a daredevil aviator. How did he get there? Why did he become such an obsessed movie maker (it made me think of Orson Welles, equally obsessed but without the money to follow through on his grand schemes)? And why did he want so much to build the perfect plane? The film could easily have addressed these questions. It certainly was long enough. Unnecessarily so in a number of scenes, I find (although I wouldn't have minded if some other, brilliantly shot scenes would have been longer). By cutting more rigorously, much more could have been covered in those 3 hours.

Enough has already been said about the very good acting. Still, I like to complement Leonardo DiCaprio on his transformation from the young jeune premier to the mature businessman appearing before the committee. He is much more convincing than James Dean attempting the same transformation (and also sporting a mustache when older) in Giant. Unfortunately, I was less thrilled by his naked lunatic scenes, which were mainly embarrassing to watch.",6
23 September 2005,Good but surprisingly uncompelling,"Much of this film didn't make sense until I watched some of the associated documentaries on the second features DVD. Now I see that many of the scenes are recreations of documented events in Hughes' life.

Visually the film is attractive and DiCaprio does a credible job of living the role, but there is little plot or story and overall it tends to drag. I'm fascinated by planes and the history of aviation, so halfway through the film I was surprised to find I was completely uninvolved with this narrative. The story wakes up a little during the congressional hearings, with DiCaprio sparring against Alda - just sufficiently to keep me hanging on to the end.

2 January 2005,Finally... Scorsese Back In Top Form!,"THE AVIATOR (4+ outta 5 stars) Wow... did I just see the best movie of the year? I can't think of anything better... but then again I haven't seen even a fraction of the 2004 releases that I want to. Lately I don't see the point of going to see a movie in the theatre when the DVD release 6 months later is going to be an ""extended director's cut"" with tons of extras and deleted scenes, etc. Plus you don't have to put up with lousy projection, rude audiences and sticky floors (well, okay, me floor isn't always perfect either). However, one of the few directors that I will still go out of my way to see on the big screen is Martin Scorsese. Even though his last few movies have not really been his best (""Bringing Out The Dead"", ""Gangs of New York"", ""Casino"")... even when his movies are merely *average* they are still better than most other directors at the top of their game. The movie's style starts off very low-key... almost like a plain old biopic that any competent director could have made... but, as the story progresses, more and more little Scorsese moments can be detected... and by the end you are totally swept up in complete movie magic. Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific as Howard Hughes. I really had my doubts when I first heard he was playing the role... and maybe he does seem a little too baby-faced early on... but by the end he has the role totally nailed. (One of my favorite movie accents, too... his voice comes out like a cross between Ron Howard and Jack Nicholson.) Cate Blanchett is almost guaranteed an Oscar nomination playing Katharine Hepburn. (You know, I was never aware that her and Hughes had that close a relationship.) Lots of other fine actors in bit parts: Alec Baldwin, Jude Law, Alan Alda, Brent Spiner, Kate Beckinsale and Gwen Stefani.",9
19 January 2022,An excellent movie with an unusual storyline,"The Aviator, probably one of Martin Scorsese's most unlikeable works, tells the story of Howard Hughes, a man whose enormous wealth defined his passions and who gradually succumbed to the ravages of mental illness. The film masterfully depicts Hughes' life and his endless ambitions, and Scorsese's authorial directing style is palpable. Leonardo DiCaprio spectacularly portrays Hughes, but the outstanding performance belongs to Cate Blanchett as the implacable and energetic Katharine Hepburn. The film is three hours long, perhaps longer than it needs to be (especially the last hour, which probably should have been shortened a bit), but it's a small price to pay for such a fascinating look at such a fascinating life.

29 December 2004,Amazing visuals and performances all around,"Leo blew me away in this movie. He definitely gives the best performance of his career. He is so good as Howard Hughes: the courtroom scene, all the scenes with him on the airplane and being the director. His accent and expressions are all great, and he portrayed the disease very well. It's certainly worthy of an Oscar nomination and possibly even the win.

The supporting cast is also great. Cate Blanchett performed Kate Hepturn beautifully. It's a very showy supporting role, and her first interaction with Leo on the golf course cries Oscar, while her last scene with Leo through the door showed her range. I like Baldwin a lot in this movie, and Alda played the senator very efficiently.

The production value and visual effects are also grand. The only minor complaint I have is that it was a little long in the middle and seems to lose its focus for a while before getting it back at the congressional hearing. 9 out of 10.",8
1 February 2005,"Great Story, Poor Casting","Fascinating story of Howard Hughes. Mr. Hughes life had many interesting stories it was clearly difficult to boil them down to a three hour movie. There are times in the movie when I felt a disjointed subplot was introduced without a true contribution to the film. The most disappointing aspect of the Aviator was the casting. Leo DiCaprio. was never convincing as Howard Hughes. His baby face never fit as a tough businessman, engineer, and film director. Perhaps the the only aspect of the film that was worse than Leo was Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn. It can only be described as annoying, unbelievable and annoying. Katharine Hepburn is a great actress. This performance by Cate was shameful. Martin Scorsese was successful in creating a BIG film. Many wonderful scenes.

26 April 2008,More boring than a nil-nil draw made out of cardboard.....,"I thought this film was a load of rubbish. The production values were very good, but that's about all.

I found the subject matter of the film was not interesting enough to make into a film. Howard Hughes was not interesting enough a person to base the film around.

I felt that most of the things in this film were unnecessary. By the time the film had ended, I was so glad that I would never have to watch it again.

DiCaprio is hit and miss, with me. He is not a great character actor, and so I felt he didn't fit the part. There was not enough depth to the character that was brought about by acting. I'm not saying that DiCaprio is a bad actor - just that he didn't fit the role at all.

This film is essentially one of the most boring things you'll ever watch. But trust me - it's nowhere near as bad as Gangs of New York. That has to be the worst film I have ever seen in my entire life. Think of this movie as Gangs of New York, but without the violence, and with Leo washing his hands every half-hour instead of trying to shag Cameron Diaz.",5
13 September 2021,Interesting biopic,"As always, Scorsese did a good imitation of reality. A bit too long, but it was interesting, though it had some boring scenes. Leo's acting was great as always, Cate's performance was good too, but a little short for an oscar, but i don't know the other contenders performances. Nevertheless, it's a decent biography movie, I liked a lot how the character exited the cave and faced the truth, with style. Kudos!

3 January 2005,Soars--at least most of the time,"It can't have been easy making an empathetic portrait of Howard Hughes. The man was abrasive, self-centered, and tragically burdened with obsessive-compulsive disorder--a person more likely to alienate than to attract. But that's exactly what director Martin Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio have done. They present Hughes in all his flawed glory, yet endear him to the audience so that we root for him in the end, and weep for the ignominious end we know will befall him.

""The Aviator,"" however, is not concerned with Hughes' final days (though it hints liberally at them), but at the prime of his life, beginning in Jazz Age Hollywood and taking us through to the post-WWII era. The plot isn't so much a linear story as it is a study of several key points in Howard Hughes' life: his love for film, planes, and beautiful women, his struggles to establish his TWA as a competitor to PanAm Airlines, the infamous ""Spruce Goose,"" and more. Though the film's three-hour running time is occasionally felt, it is never regretted--Scorsese knows he has a fascinating subject to work with, and his captivating style and sure hand keep things going admirably.

As Howard Hughes, DiCaprio gives one of the best lead performances of the year, ranking right up there with Jamie Foxx's tour-de-force turn as Ray Charles. Even in the film's somewhat slow opening, detailing the filming of Hughes' war-epic ""Hell's Angels,"" he establishes the character as an enthusiastic and determined individual, one for whom ""can't"" is the ultimate four-letter word and money is no object in the pursuit of his visions. Later, as Hughes' inner turmoil becomes more apparent, DiCaprio's furrowed brow and haunted eyes are both compelling and frightening. The sequence which foreshadows Hughes' reclusive final days is one of the most powerful I've seen in recent history.

The film picks up considerably once Cate Blanchett strides onto the screen as brassy, witty Katherine Hepburn; she and DiCaprio have good chemistry as two larger-than-life people who make a complex emotional connection. She is a standout in an ensemble that is strong throughout--Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, John C. Reily, and Kate Beckinsale are among those Scorsese brings in to fill the corners of the screen with vibrant, effective performances.

Though a bit turbulent at times, ""The Aviator"" is by an large a flight worth taking, an examination of a remarkable, unsettling man whose story stays with you long after the credits finish rolling.",
10 July 2023,A Leo 8,"Another Leo 8 - that could have been a 10, if Scorsese wasn't in love with him.

Though, admittedly - this by far one of Leo's best performances.

Blanchett absolutely deserved and got the Oscar for her role as Hepburn.

She is, without a doubt, the best actress in modern cinema.

The only woman I would put in league with the plethora of phenomenal male actors.

Kate Beckinsale is simply gorgeous.

I didn't even realize it was the same chick from Underworld, the first few times I watched it.

Everyone else is great. No small parts.

John C. Reilly would be the greatest costar alive - if it wasn't for the catalog of Samuel L. Jackson.

Special shot out to Ian Holm who is funny as hell as professor Fitz.",8
29 May 2005,Avaitor flies..!,"Stunning cinematography! The DVD also contains great inside info on the making of the film and the 'Hughes' character himself (i.e. interviews about his 'OCD' - obsessive-compulsive disorder). I've seen other films about Hughes, but nothing that offered this kind of insight. L DiCapprio and Martin Scorsese worked hard on this project. The casting and character-portrayal are flawless. AND...... (I'm not sure that there has been much comment on this): the soundtrack is well-choreographed to highlight the sounds of the emerging 'swing' era and the mood of the unfolding action (Artie Shaw's theme ""Nightmare"" was a great choice to underscore Hughes' periods of great angst).

9 July 2005,Well Done in all Aspects,"This is a very well done movie. Technically, the movie was exceptional. Leonardo DiCaprio is a phenomenal actor. It's a shame that he got temporarily slotted as a teen idol after ""Titanic"". His performance is very well done. It would have been easy to go over the top in portraying the mental illness that Howard Hughes suffered from. Instead it was played with humanity and compassion.

The direction was also well done, as one would expect from Scorsese. There are a couple of action scenes that appeared to be exceptionally difficult from a technical point-of-view that were absolutely stunning. The pace of the movie is perfect. At 2:50, one would expect some sags, but it kept my interest for the duration.

The plot was also quite interesting. I knew a considerable amount about Howard Hughes before watching this movie, but this filled in some gaps a details and placed these events in a historical context.

Howard Hughes led a complex and interesting life. This movie brings that to us in a very compelling way.",8
4 March 2005,"A Very good movie, but not a best picture of the year","Let's see...I liked the movie, I think it was s smart and captivating portrait of a great American personality. The cinematographic quality was, to me, stainless. The script was wonderful and the performances...astounding! Leonardo Di Caprio, although not my favorite actor, did an amazing job playing Howard Hughes. I did not really trust him to play a character like Howard Hughes, but he did it wonderfully. It has to be said that it must not be easy to play a paranoid and psychologically affected character such as Hughes and he really deserved the Oscar for his performance. Cate Blanchett was delightful to see as Katharine Hepburn, she manages to show in the screen the charms and tenacity of the legendary actress. She was amazing and I was glad to know that her performance was not ignored by the Academy. The movie was filled with the glamour and excitement of the 40's and 50's. Yet, I think there was definitely something missing, the picture was probably too long, slow and had a controversial ending that can be thought to be great by some and unsuitable by others. My overall comment is: A great picture that deserves to be taken into consideration, but not enough to be considered a masterpiece.",8
26 February 2005,Hollywood tradition preserved!,"The best film of 2004 is a throw back to old Hollywood and has the visuals to back it up. Martin Scorsese directs his most ambitious film to date that will rank as one of his best in the history of his career. Scorsese doesn't use his quintessential style that audiences are used to from his early days in the film industry. Instead, Scorsese's approach to the material here, while unsentimental as his films usually are, is totally majestic in style and matches the maverick personality of it's protagonist Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio). DiCaprio is brilliant as the aviation pioneer, industrialist and film maker who always did things while thinking big in typical American fashion and while he was deeply flawed as a person, he prevented a monopoly in the airline industry that perhaps prevented other monopolies from taking place and saved the true American spirit of competition from being destroyed. Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn and Alan Alda as a corrupt senator add to the support of this film that, along with DiCaprio's performance, make it the grand epic that it will be remembered for. A true classic!

8 September 2010,The Eccentric Aviator,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",6
1 January 2015,De Caprio.....Fails....Movie....Fails,"This should have been better.....I see this still scores 7.5 on IMDb.....Which is a little amazing. It is only an average flick with Scorsese not at his best ( He was only a very few times ""at his best"") Cate Blanchet over-acts so blatantly She had to win the Oscar.... De Caprio trys his best but he is a trillion miles from.....The guy he is supposed to be This is really not a 7.5 movie....It is a movie where the main character is played by a Non--Entity Who never GOT the character......And so the movie is so not 7.5 Lots of people see Scorsese movies Because they think they may see a Taxi Driver...or a Good Fellas ,,,,,

3 November 2021,An awful movie.,"This movie is not good story telling. First, the entire feel of it was like an overdone parody. Second, some of the performances were lacking in depth.

The two worst performances came from the sorely miscast DiCaprio (Hughes) and Blanchett (Hepburn). Both gave cringe-worthy performances - just caricatures that no one can possibly buy into - and those kind of performances carried throughout making this movie nearly unwatchable. The only reason I gave it a 2 is because some of the other supporting cast did an excellent job in their roles.

I'm not a big fan of DiCaprio. I actually find him unappealing to watch but wanted to give his work another try since Hughes' life story is an interesting one, but he yet again failed to impress me. I recommend watching Tommy Lee Jones' version of Hughes in the movie, ""The Amazing Howard Hughes"". He gave a much superior performance.

The over done production values, terrible script, and bizarre performances really don't make this movie watchable to the end. I finally shut it off about half-way through.",2
27 December 2004,Just wonderful,"I cannot say enough good things about this film. It is wonderfully acted and the direction is top notch. Dicaprio does an excellent job in his portrayal of Howard Hughes and Cate Blanchett is truly perfect casting as Catherine Hepburn. The photography is so reminiscent of the old techni-color films and lends so much to the time you almost get swept up in the film which is written so well. It is quite long but really truly worth it. If you love old Hollywood run out and see it you will LOVE it! The flight scenes as so beautiful and so well crafted that I want to see Scorsese do something else relating to flight to see what else he can do. This really should win him his first Best Director Oscar and achievement is well deserved.

27 December 2004,Best Movie I've Seen In A Long Time,"I've been very excited about seeing The Aviator for quite a while, and today I finally got the chance to do so! Its the best movie of 2004, no doubt about it! Its simply brilliant! Everything about it was great, the cast, costumes, sets, just everything.

Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance so far. He does a fabulous job as Howard Hughes, his performance is intense, and mature, proving that he has enormous talent. He has definitely proved that he is one of Amercias greatest actors. He really nails the role, and even puts thought into the smallest details. He deserves an Oscar for his wonderful performance.

Cate Blanchett gives a simply marvelous performance as the legendary Katharine Hepburn. Her performance is not an imitation, you really believe that she is Katharine Hepburn for 3 hours. When I first heard that Cate Blanchett was going to play Katharine (one of my favorite actress's) I was very skeptical, thinking that she looked nothing like Kate. I was wrong,very very wrong, she doesn't look that much like Katharine but she masters her mannerisms and voice, and is totally believable. She and Leo have great chemistry together as well. I have no doubt in my mind that she will win an Oscar, she is more than deserving.

Kate Beckinsale also does a great job playing the beautiful Ava Gardner, who has a very love/hate relationship with Hughes. She comes and goes in the film, but when she is there, she does a wonderful job. She does a wonderful job of portraying a woman who sometimes hates, but ultimately loves Howard.

Scorsese is one of the best directors today and he too deserves Oscar gold. Despite the films 3 hours, it never once drags, and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The movie should and hopefully will win the Best Picture Oscar. I went into the theater today hoping for a great movie, but the Aviator isn't just a great movie, its a masterpiece",10
2 February 2005,Underwhemled,"It is always easy to criticise, but after enduring sitting through 'The Aviator' I wasted 2.5 hours. What the hell was wrong with the colour balance which resulted with Cyan coloured grass etc. Rapid camera panning Etc.etc. Terrible!!!! I have read some of the other comments, so I cannot Wax Lyrical as they do, They have said it all. My only complements go the the composer Howard Shore for his fine score, and wonderfully played by the orchestra, EXCELLENT !!! The 'Film' a big Zero.

Best wishes

22 July 2011,"The Aviator is not a movie from 2004, but really the way movies at their best used to be.","The Aviator-****-A Masterpiece- Directed by: Martin Scorsese. Written by: John Logan, Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Ian Holm, Danny Huston, Gwen Stefani, Jude Law, Adam Scott, Matt Ross, Kelli Garner, Brent Spiner, Edward Herrmann, Willem Dafoe.

The life of Howard Hughes is vividly re-told in Scorsese's film adaptation, going through his life as a filmmaker and pilot, his marriage to Katherine Hepburn, and his battle with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. All of which take place between the years of 1927-1947.

When we call a film a masterpiece, we normally have symbolism, originality, and pure brilliance in the way that the director presents his action. This is a somewhat different case because though it has some of those qualities, it is mostly an excellent film because of how efficient Scorsese is as a director. The reason I call this a masterpiece is because I found it impossible to find flaws with it, not because of any symbolism or figurative storytelling.

The cinematography by Robert Richardson and the set design by Dante Ferretti are both shockingly creative in the fact that they make you feel like you are back in Howard Hughes's time period. Costume designs by Sandra Powell do not take away from the overall experience either. The real brilliance behind the film however is how Scorsese and DiCaprio make Hughes a more likable character than Katherine Hepburn or Spencer Tracy. Hughes is a connectible character despite the fact that he is a half-insane womanizer. Scorsese's direction is piercingly honest but beautifully touching much like Raging Bull.

The performances are powerful as well especially DiCaprio and Blanchett as Hughes and Hepburn. Beckinsale gets a good chance to show off her beauty as Ava Gardner and Alda gets a great role to work with as well. Yet the most prevailing thing about it is the flawless portrait of a man with psychological disorder and a brilliance in innovation that finds a way to beat his problems no matter how daunting they are.",10
5 August 2005,"A Jumble, just like its subject - Howierd Hughes","I would not have seen this film if my wife had not bought it on the sly. My prejudice is based on a personal bias against the Star, the person (Hughes) represented, the State where our man was born, and the Director. Armed with this sort of informed doubt, I am seldom burdened with a dud movie. We have a large collection of DVD releases, a small house, and limited storage space. Any addition to the collection has to be good enough to bump some earlier selection out to the Thrift Store shelves. In other words, to earn a place on our shelf, a film has to be a convincing WINNER and BETTER than something else already there. So, it was with misgivings that I agreed to sit through ""The Aviator"". So, I did. My wife loved it (or, the Kate Hepburn part). I hated it, all of it.

It would have been sufficient for the director to simply state that ""HH"" inherited much more money than he deserved and got on with the business of playing with it. And, with anything else that came his way. The ending could have come next but that was somewhere in the muddle (er, middle) just before ""HH"" leaped out of bed and raced to the Government Hearings to protect his good name. Our man was really upset when he divined somehow that he was not believed and that made him a liar! (""...I am not, nor I have been, A LIAR!..."") Hmm, reminds me of Nixon telling us he was not a crook. Onward.

(In fairness, ""HH"" was quoted as saying that other companies had signed contracts to deliver defensive weapons that became obsolete with the end of World War II. Furthermore, those companies had not delivered unwanted weapons. How short sighted he was - we still see some of those aircraft flying around to this day. We could use some more of them, too. Forest fires, don't you know?) Well, ""HH"" hocked the farm to get TWA (Teeny Weenie Airlines?) off the ground. This was interesting. It seems that there really was a bad guy after all. The U.S. Government. NO! That was Juan Trippe, president of Pan American Airways. All that fellow wanted was a monopoly of passenger business everywhere. Sheese! Another Henry Ford/John Rockefeller. ""HH"" resented that fellow.

I grew up about 3 miles from the Hughes Aircraft factory over near Loyola College; I heard about the ""Spruce Goose"" but never had a glimpse of it - did not see it moved by truck - did not see it taxi and do wind sprints out in the Harbor - Saw the huge hangar where it sat for decades. I never even got into the geodesic tomb built for it in later years. - Just heard a lot about it. I do remember that ""HH"" and a crew of dozens (3 to 5 per engine) drove it out into the Harbor and ran it back and forth and that he actually lifted it out of the water for a short run. Local press derided him for not getting it up further - we were all disappointed. Not in the movie, however. There he gooooooooeeeeesssssss!!!!!! Yay! I finally caught up with it in McMinnville, Oregon in 1995. It was sitting in a parking lot, not assembled yet. Phooey. (""HH"" also built a huge helicopter for some reason.) Where were we? Oh yes, ""The Aviator"". The special scenes showing the crash of the TurboProp showed the right wing slicing through the wall of a house that must have been a thousand feet long and all built from rice paper. Yes, ""HH"" was lucky. And obnoxious. The film did nothing to correct our impressions of him. As it turned out, ""HH"" was just another shark in the Hollywood Pool. At least his aircraft were interesting.",6
18 December 2004,One of the Best Hollywood Movies of the Year,"In all honesty, it must be said that this film is not traditional Scorsese film-making. In comparison to his classics Raging Bull and GoodFellas, The Aviator pales in comparison. However, it must also be said that Scorsese's latest does not feel like the typical over-the-top gore fest that his previous films have felt like (2002's Gangs of New York). The Aviator is far better than Scorsese's last

accomplishment but this is a step out of the ordinary for his usual work. Much like last years Seabiscuit, the era of the 1920s and 1930s is beautifully captured with stunning cinematography and impressive costume design. In technical

categories this film will garner multiple Oscar nominations (if not win the coveted prize). Seeing it at a private screening at Los Angeles Center Studios on

Thursday night, I was quite impressed at the overall feel of the film. This is one of the best Hollywood movies based on Hollywood's golden age I have ever

seen. And with a running time of over 2 and a half hours, I felt like I wanted to see more. Sad to see, but that is one aspect that could have been approved.

The film's ending (or lack thereof) does not exactly impress leaving the

audience at that certain point where you think the film is going to really take off. It doesn't. Perhaps it could be how engrossed I was with the first two and a half hours that ultimately left me wanting more. Aside from that, this is one of my top five favorite films of the year, and it is certainly worthy of all the nominations it can get. While it may not be a win that is far beyond due to mastermind

Scorsese, it certainly should give him a great chance up against such talents as Mike Nichols and Alexander Payne. With all technical aspects aside, the acting should certainly be equally commended. First off, Cate Blanchett instantly sold me as Katherine Hepburn, and in regards to her recent passing, I believe that the performance here is about as memorable as Katherine herself: a legend that will live forever in cinema. If Blanchett is ever again to be nominated for Best Actress, let this be the year. Equally impressive is the underrated Leonardo

DiCaprio, who like in Catch Me If You Can, delivers a powerful performance as Howard Hughes. I can not imagine anyone else playing this role as well as he

did. As to the cast, with the fine talents of Alec Baldwin, the great John C. Reily, Ian Holm, Scorsese favorite Willem Dafoe, Jude Law (who seems to be in every

movie I have seen this season) and Kate Beckinsale it is so hard to go wrong. A tremendous ensemble, a beautiful film, and a magnificent memory. One of the

best films of the year and a worthy Best Picture contendor. 8 out of 10.",8
2 July 2006,An Inspirational Film!,"When I watched ""The Aviator"" for the first time over a year ago, I have to say I really liked it. Leonardo Dicaprio does great playing Howard Hughes as does Cate Blanchett with Catherine Hepburn. The film is great all the way through. The filmmakers did an awesome job of making the 1930's-1940's style backgrounds. I have to say I didn't know anything about Howard Hughes until I saw this movie based on his life. I'm serious! Although, I have to point out that the language is rather a big disappointment. In addition to the unnecessary f-word used by Alec Baldwin's character. Leo's character as well as almost everyone else in the movie says ""godd--n"" nonstop, and more than half the time it's not necessary either. But, despite that ""the Aviator"" is a great film. I enjoyed watching it. I also have to says that this would have to be the film that's inspiring me to become a filmmaker myself possibly.

19 February 2006,Howard Hughes: Descent Into Madness,"Martin Scorcese directed Howard Hughes as a cross between Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas in ""Wall Street"") and Mr. Monk. Does he get away with it?

The movie makers can't seem to decide whether Howard Hughes was a germophobe, suffering from autism or from obsessive compulsive disorder. What they leave out is the addiction to amphetamines and morphine. Scorcese left out a lot of other things too, like the pervasive anti-Black racism and anti-Semitism of the time and the place, including Hughes', just as Scorcese left out the fact that ""Gangs Of New York"" was essentially about a Civil War era anti-Black race riot. Scorcese also left out Howard Hughes' role in the communist witch hunts of the 1950s, instead portraying him as being the victim of a vindictive and corrupt senator (Alan Alda). Like the racism of the time, the movie forgets to mention Hughes' rabid anti-communism, his firing of a blacklisted writer and his suppression of the pro-labor movie ""Salt Of The Earth"". The fact that one of Hughes' passenger planes crashes (undoubtedly killing all on board) is mentioned and forgotten, and almost seems to be justified by the fact that Hughes himself frequently crashes his own planes. Unlike in the movie, the real Howard was not born poor to a hygiene obsessed mother (in real life, he actually contracted syphillis, decades before there was a cure for it), but to a father who left him a fortune and an engineering business.

The truth is that Howard Hughes was a rich boy and elitist oligarch, and that the fortune his father made selling a unique oil drill bit in Houston was against the background of Black disenfranchisement, including land theft, in Texas. Hughes made ""Hells Angels"" during the early 1920s, a time when the klan was reaching its highpoint of popularity, was even finding a willing ear in the White House, and saw the burning down and mass murder of highly successful Black communities in Oklahoma City, Kansas City and other towns by resentful Whites. The only hints of racism come from the all White minstrels doing some kind of exhalted ""race music"" dance. Why only hint? Because giving us a picture of the real Howard Hughes would have left the movie without a sympathetic lead. Beside being a racist and anti-Semite, Hughes was also a rapist and a bisexual, the former only hinted at by Leonardo DiCaprio's sweet come-on to a surprisingly willing waitress in a restaurant. I guess those were the perks of wealth in the 1920s.

Scorcese's treatment of the Hepburn family, who were social reformers and socialists, also warrants mention. They are portrayed as stuck up champaign socialists, when in fact they were actively campaigning for women's right to vote, and were friends and supporters of Emma Goldman.

Perhaps someone as rich as Howard Hughes could afford not to notice The Great Depression, but that is no excuse for Martin Scorcese to do the same. The start of WWII is not dealt with. Hughes support for the overthrow of Fidel Castro and the Cuban Revolution, or his ties to the CIA are not mentioned either.

Now about the movie. Everyone seems to have wanted to be part of this production. Kate Blanchett, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Jude Law, Kate Beckinsale, Willem Dafoe, Gwen Stefani, with Martin Scorcese directing and Michael Mann producing. I'm sure they thought they were in for a rip-roaring tale of great wealth, Hollywood glamor and cutting edge airoplanes, and they were.

The flight scenes are exciting and spectacular (including the crashes).

I give this movie 8 stars out of 10, not for Howard Hughes, but for Leonardo DiCaprio and the movie, which although long, never fails to capture your attention and tells a rather sympathetic, though fictional, tale.",8
5 June 2005,Billion Dollar Baby,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",8
22 January 2005,A modern masterpiece,"I find this film to be the best of 2004, easily. The sets and lighting are rich and colorful. The film clearly has the visual style and technical prowess that it deserves and needs for its story. The story itself spans Hughes life for 20 yrs. From the filming of his first film ""Hells Angels"" to his flying of the spruce goose in 1947. The performances are also of note. Especially Leonardo Dicaprio, finally shedding his teeny boy image with his portrayal of Howard Hughes. Gritty and realistically playing a man of many demons and phobias. Also of note is Cate Blanchett as Kate Hepburn. She is magnificent while making Hepburn a real person instead of the impersonation she could have been. Also praise must be said about Alec Baldwin( with the best use of the f word in in modern movies), Alan Alda, Danny Houston, Matt Ross, John C.Reily(strongly playing Noah Deitrich), Adam Scott and Kate Beckinsale expertly playing Ava Gardner. This film is a treat for movie goers who loves films from all eras. The score, performances, lighting, camera-work, directing, script and the production itself sore as some of the best in recent years. A must see.",9
13 June 2005,Q-u-a-r-a-n-t-i-n-e meets Rosebud,"Enter with an open mind and you'll be richly rewarded with Scorsese's meticulous rendering of Howard Hughe's genius and its demise. But don't expect to fall into a comfortable narrative drama. THE AVIATOR is more like CITIZEN KANE, almost a newsreel that conveys the power of a brilliant man driven by his own vision against all odds.

Despite this stark and challenging frame, Scorsese and his wonderful team, including set designer Dante Feretti and a score of talented actors, still is able to convey Hughes' fragile humanity as he struggles to control the delusions and paranoia that eventually destroy his life. At the end of the movie, one mourns for Hughes as one mourned for Kane -- the loss of one man who labored a lifetime to overcome a childhood trauma and achieved great things.

Of course Scorsese's film is more than that. He coaxes a magnificently mature and nuanced performance out of Leonardo DiCaprio, and may even win him an Oscar. Cate Blanchette as Kate Hepburn at first seems excessive, until her veneer begins to peel away -- again a tribute to Scorsese's skill as a director, and Blanchette's bountiful acting abilities.

The three hours went quickly as one fabulous scene and set replaced another. The vintage clips of HELL'S ANGELS interspersed with new footage are, alone, worth the price of admission. Without giving away the ending, go see the old planes fly.

Don't miss seeing this wonderful film on the big screen. It's a masterpiece.",10
1 December 2006,Martin Hughes,"Its OK, its a good movie but Scorsese's days in film making as we knew him to be seem to be well over. What we feel now towards this director is a lot of nostalgia. I mean there was this whole thing going on in making this film about him having the same relationship with Di Caprio as the electricity he had with De Niro back in the seventies when making Taxi Driver which is all a load of you know what. I felt this way about De Niro as soon as he left the gangster genre as we knew it. I was not impressed with 'Bringing out the dead' or 'Gangs of New York' all his recent stuff like I was with Taxi driver, Meanstreets, Goodfellas and last but not least Casino which I believe was his last masterpiece, except Kundun which I must admit was really something. Look The Aviator is definitely worth a watch because Howard Hughs was definitely a character worth exploring.

25 April 2005,Impressive and engrossing Hollywood biopic,"An impressively carefully balanced Hollywood biopic view on Howard Hughes the millionaire, as well as the movie-maker, the lover, the aviator... and, most engrossing- the man battling his mental illness throughout his life. What I've only briefly read in book paragraphs about Hughes is compellingly elaborated by director Scorsese and scriptwriter John Logan. It's also solid, grand entertainment, not only for an aviationophile, which I feared at first. Lavish production of visuals (that crash scene is just stunning!) and time era feel, plus a great cast with Di Caprio in fine form, Blanchett a memorably cartoonish Hepburn, and finally a perfect Alda as senator Brewster. What I do miss is more background story of Hughes' fortune. 7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.

28 December 2004,"Parts of the ""Aviator"" should be grounded","Overall, a pretty good movie but dragged on way too long and then came to a somewhat abrupt ending.

Leonardo Dicapprio did an excellent job with the character and there were outstanding supporting performances by Alec Baldwin, Cate Blanchett and Alan Alda.

This movie seemed to waste too much time on some of his eccentricities and playing them out instead of giving us more info about Howard Hughes.

I thought this movie would be Oscar-caliber, the performances are, the movie itself isn't.

21 February 2005,"Interesting story, but too long and rather dull","A story about a rich guy, who invests all his money in flight, and fights his way among politicians and competitors. Interesting story, with full of animation and emotions, but too long and rather dull. It's not a love story, neither a drama, nor an adventure. It wants to be everything and comes to be nothing. I've been expecting a much more better movie from Scorsese, however I think the problem lies in the script. DiCaprio brings an excellent performance, but all the other talented and illustrious actors are just puppets on the stage. Recommendation: If you don't have anything else to do, you can watch it. Otherwise it's not worth giving money for it.

16 January 2005,A beautiful look at the life and times of...,"Martin Scorsese has done a magnificent job directing the life and story of an eccentric businessman/filmmaker. I think the production has told an intriguing and carefully thought story of the life of Howard Hughes. I recommend this movie to everyone who believe that truth is indeed more fascinating than fiction. The Aviator has dramatized (and, to a lesser degree, romanticized) real life, but the effect only betters the movie. After all, this is Hollywood we're dealing with.

It's 1930, and $4 million dollars later, Howard Hughes has created the most expensive movie yet. The flying Great War epic isn't enough for the young Texan as he plans on taking the aviation industry by storm.

I enjoyed the perspective of Hollywood in the 30s. There's a magnificent view placed in the movie that makes you wonder if you would be looking through the eyes of Howard Hughes if he was in your seat itself. I would not be surprised if Ms. Blanchett is nominated at the Academy Awards. If you're not into biographical movies, then her performance of Katharine Hepburn deserves some notice. Look for cameos by Gwen Stefani and Jude Law. I didn't recognize the latter. It was a good movie and I wouldn't mind watching it again. But nearly tipping the scales at just under three hours, make sure you get comfortable, with your toilet breaks done and over with.",9
23 March 2005,deCaprio and Blanchett are triumphant,"To all who are going to go and see this movie, please keep an open mind beforehand, as it is the story of only a part of Howard Hughes' life and cannot be expected to cover his entire life and career. However, what it does cover is done superbly, and for this, thanks must go to Leonardo de Caprio (absolutely brilliant as Hughes) and Cate Blanchett (who fully deserved her Oscar as Katharine Hepburn) in particular - they are brilliant, and once again de Caprio builds on his stunning performances in ""Gangs of New York"" and ""Catch Me If You Can"" - the very complex Hughes would have been a real challenge for anyone, but de Caprio nailed it. The supporting cast which includes Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Kate Beckinsale (as Ava Gardner) and Jude Law (he even looks like Errol Flynn) are all fascinating performances - do not let some critics deter you from Seeing ""The Aviator"" - it is long but intriguing, but, boy oh boy, what a place Hollywood must have been in the 30's.

23 May 2005,the aviator,"I loved the aviator. however, i've seen the actual people portrayed in this film and it's not horrible, but it isn't exactly great. Gwen Stafani's jean Harlow is the cat's pajamas but she's too happy. miss Harlow was a very sad person in public. not melancholic but you could tell she wasn't happy with her work. she was a tough critic on her work and just like Ava Gardner, she saw acting as a job not a career. As for Ava Gardner and Katherine Hepburn's characters, they did great as well, but the research done for each character in the movie but i really don't believe they got deep enough in the characters' lives. Ava Gardner was a poor southern girl with a big drawl to start off and she really wasn't movie star material in the sense that she didn't want or need servants. she grew up during the great depression so she knew how to take care of things in a poor environment. in the film they portray her as though she's some rich kid. it surprises me that Mr. DiCaprio portrayed his character so very well. i don't think anyone has ever achieved that.

23 March 2023,A Real Look At Part of the Flying High Industry - Howard Hughes!!,"The Aviator is the biopic of aviator giant Howard Hughes, and how he forever changed the aviation industry around World War II time. Played fabulously by Leonardo DiCaprio (The Great Gatsby) the movie chronicles the highs and lows of Hughes adult life including his bout with some mental illness in the movie. Also starring in the film is Cate Blanchett (Tar) who plays Katherine Hepburn, Hughe's girlfriend for a time in the movie. Blanchett plays the role very close to the mark. Another Hollywood diva and girlfriend of Hughes that is prominent in the film is Ava Gardner, played fantastically by British actress Kate Beckinsale. This is a Martin Scorsese film so you know that he brings the best out of his actors and actresses and this is the case in this movie. The film is gritty and realistic, and while I am by no means a historian of Mr Hughes I'm sure Scorsese gets right to the point of his life and tells it in the most accurate, truest way that he knows how. The film is done beautifully with great costuming taking you back to the World War II era, and is a great story to watch if you want to learn more about an American aviation titan!! Outstanding acting, fantastic directing, terrific soundtrack, great special effects, and a good sense of fun have me giving this move my rare 9 out of 10 stars!!",9
29 June 2007,Short version of Howard Hughes' remarkable life and times,"This review stems from a ""rewatch,"" the first viewing occurring on New Year's Eve. It's a fairly long movie and our group was there through the ending into the new year in a nearly empty theater. But this is worthwhile movie-making; the writers give us a true American hero who takes on the State and, at least for a while, wins.

Hughes was the son of a Texas oilman-inventor who set up a company and earned a fortune; the old man died when Howard was 18, leaving Howard as a multimillionaire engineering student. The Aviator follows Howard from 1930, when he produced the movie Hell's Angels, to 1947 when, at the age of 42, Howard flew the H4-Hercules aircraft he had designed and built (aka the Spruce Goose)...

6 January 2005,"Um, Martin?","First, let's talk about what's great about this film. First, there's the cinematography, which is nothing short of stunning. (The aerial scenes make ""Top Gun"" look like a student film.) Then, there's the no-more-Oscar-nominations-please-we-have-a-winner performance of Cate Blanchett, who absorbs the role of Katharine Hepburn. Cate manages to portray Kate as bold, self-assured, biting, and vulnerable all at once, and you may not believe this is the same woman who has played both Elizabeth and Galadriel.

Then, we need to talk about what's good about this movie, which is most of other actor/actress in this film. Leonardo DiCaprio manages to be both charming and frightening, and Alec Baldwin has mastered the art of playing the well-mannered sleaze-bag.

Finally, we need to talk about what's wrong with the movie: where and how it ends. Without giving too much away, let me just say that when the credits started rolling, they came at a very awkward point and left far too many questions unanswered. Scorsese should have either ended it sooner or gone ahead and let the other shoe drop.

This movie will get a lot of mention for Best Picture awards, but before those envelopes are opened, I'd like to see the rest of the picture first.",6

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",10
8 January 2005,"A great film, good for a wide variety of audiences","The Aviator tells the story of aviation pioneer and eventual nutbag Howard Hughes. Leonardo di Caprio plays the title character, the wonderful Cate Blanchett plays the wonderful Kate Hepburn, Alec Baldwin plays the CEO of a competing airline, and Alan Alda plays a sleazy U.S. Senator.

This is a very good film. I found it very entertaining, as did my 71 year old mother! This is the beauty of this film: it has plenty to appeal varying audiences. Are you riveted to E! Entertainment Television? You'll love Howard the Hollywood Playboy. Addicted to Discovery Channel? There are enough aerospace gewgaws here to satisfy any of you. Is the History Channel your thing? This is a beautifully-filmed period piece. Enjoy a weeper? The downfall of Howard into madness will set you off.

Above all, if you love well-made, well-written, well-acted films, you'll like The Aviator.

Don't be daunted by the fact it's a Martin Scorsese picture, it's not a violent picture. He has taken a turn from his standard fare and proved, at least to me, that he has great talent even outside his regular genre.

9 out of 10. It didn't quite have the full emotional impact on me that I like films to have, so I just shaved off a point for that.

3 January 2005,Leo Has Finally Grown Up,"For years I have been fond of saying that Leonardo DiCaprio will never win an Oscar. I will now have to revise that statement.

This movie is truly an astounding study in character. And Leo pulls it off fantastically. For the second time in his career, we forget that its Leo and are welcomed inside of the character portrayed. The first, of course, was his performance in Gilbert Grape.

Leo seems bigger than life, and believable when his Howard Hughes, as a young man, says early in the film, ""you tell those (expletives) that even though I'm 21 years old, its MY company and if they don't like it they can kiss my ass!"" (paraphrased) I truly believed at that point that we were in for quite a ride, and that this was Leo's triumphant entry into legend.

The movie brings us all kinds of great stars of the 30's and 40's. The best of these is Katherine Hepburn, played wondrously by Cate Blanchett. This is the first time in my memory that an actor portrayed another actor who wasn't in character. In an understated and completely believable manner, Cate really captured Hepburn's strength, humor and feminine wiles. Few actresses could have pulled this off better. And Cate really looks like a young Katherine.

The supporting cast turn in memorable performances, and there is no weak link among them. John C. Reilly continues to show a gentlemanly persona in every performance.

I loved ""The Aviator"" and am convinced that it will become a golden classic. A sincere 8 out of 10 stars.",8
17 February 2005,The Characters,"I found this movie very interesting because my family history has a lot to do with aviation. In fact, my Grandfather was good friends with Don Smith, who was the real Flight Engineer on the Spruce Gooses one and only flight.

I was surprised to hear from my mother who still speaks with Don that he was not contacted when they made this film. He sat in the seat where the movie showed Glen Odekirk sitting, who according to Don wasn't even on the flight that day. He would have been a good source of information, as he was assigned to the goose for more than 30 years after the flight and retired from Hughes Aircraft.

Instead they made things up as they saw fit to make the movie more appealing. According to Don, Howard didn't start going off the deep end until after the flight of the Goose. Which was also after the court battle he went through. Think about it, he was pretty far gone by this point in the movie to have bounced back so remarkably to stand up for himself the way he did.

They showed him involved with Icon Actresses that we all know and love today, but his true love during the time the movie was suppose to have taken place was an actress by the name of Jean Peters. That's not to say that he wasn't involved with Kate, Ava and others, but I guess making them the main woman in this movie made for a more successful movie, and the truth would have been too boring since most people wouldn't remember who Jean Peters was. I know I didn't!

When Hughes crashed the plane in real life he was knocked unconscious and was unable to get the cockpit open, but it was true that a uniformed man ran up to the burning plane and saved his life.

The only reason I gave this film an 8 was because of the personal interest I have. Otherwise, asside from some of the air scenes, the movie was boring and very out of sequence. A true blast to the Hughes legacy.",8
24 December 2004,Simply Amazing!,"I've seen this movie two times, and I loved it. There are few movies that can keep you on edge for 3hrs, but I think Scorsese pulled it off. I don't think the movie is as good as some of Scorsese's earlier works like Raging Bull or Goodfellas, but was still enjoyable and should definitely be an Oscar contender this year. The acting was spot on, especially Cate Blancet portrayal of Katherine Hepbure.The screenplay was also very good, and didn't really need anything added to it to make it more exciting, since Howard Hughe's life was so incredible. And everything in the movie is just the first 47 years of his life, fitted into 3hrs. It is one of my favorite movies ever.

1 July 2011,A Brilliant Failure,"Decades ago when I was at the Wolper Company in Los Angeles, my supervisor, David Seltzer, who wrote the Omen franchise, came into my office and put a book on my desk - a biography of Howard Hughes. ""Could you write a treatment of this?"" Dave asked. ""Sure,"" I said. I skimmed the book and yawned. Why would anyone be interested in Howard Hughes, I asked myself. The same applies to The Aviator. Who cares? And that is the core of the problem with the film. For all its brilliance in so many ways, from casting to photography to music to design, The Aviator is not only state of the art, it achieves a threshold that sets a new standard for motion pictures. But ultimately the film fails because we simply do not care about Howard Hughes, and there are so many reasons why we don't care. Sure, he was a genius, but he was also a bonified nut case and because of that fact alone it is impossible to relate to him much less have any feeling or emotion for him.

21 September 2006,Should be consider as Best Film in Hollywood.,"I Introduce my self as a young 25 years sounth Asian boy from a very less densly populated city called Rajkot in India. Thus, I can't say more about Hollywood movie, however I am very impressed by this work.

""Imagine life without limits"", I think Mr. Martin Scorsese have shown their one of his best imagination and creativeness through this film, which will be proved as a great film in future. In this film a great sense of activeness, positive-sense and fearless confidence shown, not in a battle field but within a piratical life on going.

This film will be very useful for those person who see dream and those who craves for motivation. Mr. Scorsese and Mr. John Logan, with both of their co-ordination and co-operation the people of world get a great film that ever made in past millions of year.

A MOTIVATIVE AND TOP OF MY FAVOURIT FILM, SINCE I BECAME MATURE ENOUGH.

Even I also wish to work with this both personality if given a chance.",10
19 September 2005,"Ho-hum bio-epic, stilted and self-aware.","Empty, shallow bio-pic that falls short. Scorcese should stay away from these type of epics- he does not do them well. He seems very self-conscious and stilted in this effort. The movie, with all its detail and budget, looks fake and its narrative cartoon like. Its a expensive TV movie that has little soul. Scorcese wants to be a director like David Lean, or even a John Sturgess, but doesn't have the range of talent these guys had. Stick to the gangsters and the isolated psychopaths- you do that well.

P.S. The scene with Kate Hepburn's family at the dinner table is the highlight of the film.

19 February 2005,"To steal a quote ""THERE IS NO THERE, THERE.""","This movie was a huge waste of talent. Having ""Leonardo"" play Howard Hughes is sending a boy to do a man's job. Martin Scorsese overwhelms us with spastic images and visual overload without ever telling us more than headlines. What a waste since the life of Hughes is clearly a story to be told. Every Oscar won by this movie for acting, directing and writing will be an affront to the movie going public. The Carpetbaggers was more fun.

Cate Blanchard is the major redeeming feature of this flic and has again turned in a performance that deserves the nod from the academy. Also Alan Alda deserves the nod.

27 October 2021,Fantastic movie and fantastic portrayal of OCD,"First of all, this movie is very beautifully shot (especially towards the end), very well plotted out and acted, and very entertaining. Cate Blanchette, for example, shines in her role as Katherine Hepburn, as does Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes. You can really see how Cate's character brought some sanity into Howard's spiraling mental state.

But far more important than that, to me, is this movie's depiction of ocd. It is probably the most accurate portrayal i have ever seen. As someone who has suffered with ocd for most of my life, seeing so many of the tics and eccentricities I've dealt with be shown onscreen in such a real way is incredibly refreshing. I'm sure the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio has ocd himself helped him bring realism to the role. I would honestly recommend this movie for the look on his face alone when his symptoms are triggered. I swear I've never felt so understood.

Many scenes showing his symptoms may come across as a bit humorous and outlandish to people who don't have this condition, but I can assure you that they are very real.",9

27 January 2005,Hughes released from his padded room,"For most of my adult life Howard Hughes was a cartoon figure: the endlessly lampooned, reclusive, phobic multi-millionaire. What little I knew of the back story only deepened the caricature -- the Spruce Goose, the Russell bra, the Hollywood romances. So it was a delightful surprise to find this blockbuster giving me a glimmer of a real human being, talented wunderkind, supremely creative, paranoid, loyal, mentally ill. DiCaprio as Hughes and Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn were both stunning -- sure Oscar nominees I think. The special effects were beyond what I needed, but I loved the sense of high-speed parallel lives of the pioneer aviator, the empire builder tackling movie production, aircraft design, and an international air line simultaneously, the relentless womanizer lost without a woman, the obsessive-compulsive matching egos with the mighty of Hollywood, Washington, and Wall Street, as he is drawn deeper into the vortex of his illness.

25 December 2004,"Historically inaccurate, cinematic ally very good","The Aviator is not meant to be a historically accurate representation of Hughes' life and isn't. That being said, it's an excellent film. The acting is top notch and the special effects work very well with the tone and spirit of the movie. Martin Scorcese is at his best in the directorial department. Leonardo's acting is worthy of an Oscar but I believe he will be denied one. This movie is worth watching for Di Caprio's performance alone. Cate Blanchett is a little unbelievable as Katherine Hepburn even though she gives it her all. The pacing was a little up and down as. Not the greatest movie you will see but definitely one of the best of the year. Watch it as a work of fiction and you won't be disappointed. Don't wait for the DVD.

8 January 2005,"Excellent Biopic, but Mediocre Scorsese","Don't get me wrong, I loved this film. And I would be delighted to see Martin Scorsese win Best Director and the film win Best Picture. But for Scorsese, this is (best case) his 5th best film (behind Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver and Mean Streets) and I will choke a bit if the Academy chooses to honour this after ignoring his masterpieces.

This is an epic film with an intimate feel, in which the director makes no wrong choices. By concentrating on Howard Hughes' life from 1927 to 1947, his glory years before his long and pathetic decent, we get to see the legend and myth of Hughes and not the cartoon character.

As The Aviator opens, Hughes has recently inherited his parents fortune and he seems bent on spending all of it to make Hell Angels, and World War I picture concentrating on spectacular flying scenes. We get to know the Hughes who was a mad risk-taker, a womanizer of Hollywood's most elite and a genius business man. (It is interesting to watch how he succeeds by a succession of near-bankruptcies).

Intertwined with this are brief flashes of the madness to come - his battle with OCD and his sickening obsession with germs. For a drink, he orders milk, in the bottle, seal on. And when he is enjoying his dinner, he is nearly ill when someone picks a single pea off of his plate.

If this film wins an Oscar, it will be Cate Blanchett for her stunning portrayal of Katherine Hepburn. Blanchett brings to life the accent, quirky tomboy behaviour and irreverence that made Hepburn a legend off the screen.

For all the CGI and special effects in this film, its greatest scenes are person to person, most notably the senate hearings. Alan Alda is perfect as Senator Brewster, a crooked politician who is trying to bring down Hughes to advance his own career. Their lunch meeting leading up to the hearings and the time they spend across the table on National TV are the movies best moments.

Martin Scorsese is one of the great directors for brining out performances and this film is no exception. Leonardo DiCaprio avoids many opportunities to overact in this film, and creates Hughes as a complex and puzzling man slowly slipping away from reality. Supporting roles from Alec Baldwin as the president of Pan Am and John C. Reilly as Hughes' hapless business manager, keep the film from dragging.

For fans of aviation scenes, you may never find a better picture. Much of the film's budget has been spent recreating some of Hughes more ambitious inventions and failures. The crashing of his prototype spy plane into a Hollywood residential neighbourhood may be the single greatest plane crash scene ever filmed, not because of the plane crashing, but because of the different perspectives that are shown.

This by no means Martin Scorsese's best film, but it is his best since Goodfellas and it is a great movie. ***1/2 out of ****.",9
13 July 2005,Great moments in miscasting,"Once again Leo is totally miscast in this disappointing movie which is all style and no substance. After two hours I was left no clearer about the man Howard Hughes although I did learn a lot about planes and TWA. But my real problem is Leo who is actually a great actor but he keeps on taking roles that do not allow his talent to shine ""Catch me if you can"" being another example when his physical presence just does not match the character. He just looks like a boy, and I suspect he always will, so why cast him in roles that demand men, sorry Leo I am not questioning your manhood, just how you look. No matter how much make up or prosthetics they apply watching him trying to play Howard Hughes was frankly just lame.

5 May 2012,So-So,"OK, well I had waited a long time to see this film and I didn't really have any expectations, apart from the fact that it's directed by Scorsese. The direction is good, a little prosaic but serviceable; what I find incredible is that Cate Blanchett won a best supporting actress Oscar for this - she's terrible. Hammy and not even proficient at ""doing"" Katharine Hepburn. I didn't know whether to laugh at her performance or to cry that this type of hack job is rewarded with an Oscar. Kate Beckinsale on the other hand as Ava Gardner is miles better, stunning to look at and with a genuine fire that made me think, Yes, this is a quality that made this woman tick. Leonardo DiCaprio is fine as Hughes, nothing special, just fine. He's a good but not a great actor, he lacks a certain magic, a certain uniqueness that would make him more than just average. I found myself wondering what Sean Penn would have been like in the role...

What a boring load of tosh, it was like watching paint dry. The flying scenes are pathetic. After a miserable 1 hour 10 Min's I could stand it no longer and left before the end. I would love to get my money back. Others around me were groaning and fidgeting in their seats, a sure sign that others felt the same. I'm sure that people left after we made our escape.

Sorry, no redeeming features at all, the worst film I have seen in a long time.

8 January 2005,American Originals,"It is hard to imagine there might be a film released in time for Oscar contention that will more perfectly fit the profile of a Best Picture candidate. In a time when Americans struggle to feel good about themselves and about what makes us distinctly who we are in the view of the world, we are offered ""The Aviator"".

Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) was a master juggler of interests; it is difficult to sort out whether passions, ingenuity, aggressiveness or private obsession drove him, and perhaps it was all those things. We have always viewed him from the later, more eccentric years, a recluse no longer able to deal with the world or even the smallest mote on a tie or milk bottle out of place. This is not fair, and director Martin Scorcese's decision to key on Hughes in his prime is brilliant.

The studio Internet site (http://www.miramax.com/aviator/) is a nice one and I encourage you to visit it for background on some of Scorcese's vision. There is no doubt he attempted to bring realism and truth to the screen. For a thumbnail on Hughes check out Wikipedia's bio (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes) and if you doubt the severity or facts about his crash in Beverly Hills try http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/XF-11_crash_site.htm for just how lucky and admittedly foolhardy Hughes was  throughout his life.

Scorcese has assembled a fine, if not near perfect cast for ""The Aviator"". Grading out the roles of key figures; Gwen Stefani doesn't come close to capturing Jean Harlow's look and not much is required of her otherwise; so too Jude Law's inclusion as Errol Flynn is a cameo and he just may be there because he was available during a hot year for him; Kate Beckinsale is quite captivating as the captivating Ava Gardner and shows us a nice moment in the latter part of the movie; Alec Baldwin (portraying Pan Am visionary Juan Trippe) and Alan Alda (as Senator Brewster) nail their parts, and both should be applauded for adding real value to the final effort; John C. Reilly (whom we all love but only gets one opportunity to say something of importance) plays a fine sidekick (Noah Dietrich) and Kelli Garner is equal to the task of depicting Faith Domergue.

But DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett really deliver the goods. In Leonardo's case we get the first opportunity of seeing him portray a real man. Flawed as Hughes may have been, he was an American original, the American dream, really, and we are never in doubt that we are really watching Howard Hughes. Leonardo will absolutely rivet you in his depiction of Hughes as he testifies (late in the film) before Senator Brewster's Committee; this is the best work DeCaprio has ever done.

There has never been an actress, or any other woman, for that matter, that looked like Katherine Hepburn. Again Scorcese made the right decision, knowing full well Hepburn's look couldn't be duplicated, to use a terrific actress that convincingly delivers what Hepburn herself always delivered  a class act with signature singularity. No mean task, that, and Blanchett really adds the extra required.

The only moments that did not ring true were fleeting, but the key unnecessary insertion was a childhood memory of Hughes revisited late in the film and is a little heavy handed; I immediately thought of ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Rosebud"" and did not appreciate the similarity. Secondarily, much ado is made of Hughes discovering the need for clouds to serve as a backdrop for air battles to emphasize speed, but William Wellman had actually discovered this (and is so credited in several books) a few years previously while filming the first Academy Award Best Picture (""Wings"").

Martin Scorcese's ""The Aviator"" is so captivating that it is difficult to figure how any other film of '04 can possibly be a better candidate for Best Picture. We have, in fact, an American original (Scorcese) weaving a story about an equally compelling figure in our history. And it is all here: the stars, the acting, and the period feel, the cinematography and Leonardo DiCaprio doing his best work ever. This is one that will be watched again and again by the next generation. That is as good as Scorcese could have hoped for.

Rating: Four Stars.",10
6 January 2005,a pleasant surprise,"With apparent effortlessness this film about Howard Hughes does the cleverest little trick. It becomes Howard Hughes - powerful, stylish, and bold beyond all fear of criticism. Complaints of the film's length abound. I find that astonishing. I can't believe Mr. Scorcese didn't need more of my time for what he did - I surely would have granted it. It takes a mere 166 minutes to paint a vast and somehow intimate portrait of one of the most enigmatic figures of the twentieth century. Not a simple task. To begin with, biopics are dangerous territory for any director. The charge: distill a man's life into a few cans of film. Oftentimes Biopics tend to be hollow and external linear narratives - the subject's life from birth to death. Often when this boring mistake is avoided today's directors tend to go in another equally erroneous direction. They'll hijack a man's life, boiling it down to an over-simplistic story arc to frame the film in a contrived but filmicly effective context. I point to Taylor Hackford's RAY in which Ray Charles' life is distilled to a battle with heroin brought on by guilt stemming from the death of his brother. I'm sure Ray was more than that. Or as in MONSTER the life is boiled down to what else but a love story. It is easy to recreate the events of a man's life on film, but is much harder and more interesting to recreate the man himself. Scorcese knows this and he goes after that most difficult target - the essence of the man, the core drive and spirit that made him noteworthy. In conveying this essence Scorcese does something that far too few filmmaker's will do this day. He trusts the audience, laying in almost no exposition, showing rather than telling. He lets his audience fill in the blanks, rather than boring us with information we already know too well, and for that i am grateful. Some hoped the film would dwell more heavily on the death and demise of Howard Hughes, the dirt, the rumors and the insanity. But these are the things for which the daring and irrepressible figure is now most often known, but none of us knew the man. Mr. Scorcese has done a thorough job with our introduction. Please to meet you, Mr. Hughes.",9
5 September 2008,"Brilliant, but LENGTHY","I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",9
5 January 2013,Great Tribute to An American Oddball,"I was thirteen when Titanic came out, so I will always have a soft spot for Leo. I admire him because he's a guy who could have coasted on his looks alone, but he always chooses his roles carefully. He's one of those actors whose films you can depend on to at least be interesting in some way. As Howard Hughes, you watch a man who has everything (looks, money, intelligence, creativity) but will lose it all to mental illness. I love how clear it is that Howard knows he is not normal, but is powerless to control himself. I can't think of another movie or television show that portrays OCD with as much respect.

While Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific as Howard, the person who really shines in this film is Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn, who won an Oscar for her performance. The film portrays Hepburn as the only woman who could bring out the tender side of Howard and the only person who could get him to relax enough to have some fun. Cate does a great job of channeling this icon, to the point where I think of this performance whenever I watch one of the real Hepburn's films.

26 August 2006,A cowardly pioneer,"Howard Hughes was a tiny man in a gigantic world of Fascism, Hitlerism, and Stalinism. My friend Kim, in Salt Lake City, was dressed in his underwear, outside, by his mother, a Mormon. This was some kind of strange ritual, to me a Roman Catholic. It was a non-secret/secret. Adults have secrets. Mormonism is a big honking secret. His underwear and his mother dressing him in underwear were BIG secrets. It was weird. We Catholics in Salt Lake City had our own secrets. Open secrets in a Mormon world/state. I believe Howard Hughes may have grown up in a Mormon situation. Howard Hughes lived a full life and a crippled life which cannot be portrayed in film or text or any medium. Leonardo di Caprio did a great job portraying this sick person Hughes who had a fantastic life. His phobias were great secrets which needed a little open air to deflate their mythic power and thus be dis-armed. It was a sad thing that Hughes's phobias were not thrown asunder as his fantastic ideas were advanced. He deserved better. He deserved the love of Kate Hepburn, I suppose. She was a stellar gal. This is in sum a spectacular movie, which is as good as you could get considering this weird guy Hughes. This is a gigantic movie. Full of ideas. A spectacular gift from director Martin Scorcese.",7
22 June 2005,"Quality movie, just don't operate heavy machinery after watching it.","I usually don't write too many reviews on Oscar caliber movie since I enjoy complaining more than anything else, but I had to cover a few points for some of the potential viewers that are contemplating whether or not to rent this movie or not. Although ""The Aviator"" is a good movie, but there are some serious long, dry, needless scenes that may make you forget the scenes you did like.

""Aviator"" stars Leonardo DiCaprio, who is still trying to get respect in Hollywood, as Howard Hughes, a rich oil tycoon that suddenly decides to invest an obscene amount of money and time into movies, planes, women and bottled milk. The film is also filled to the brim with tons of Hollywood's finest, especially Kate Blanchet who perfectly plays Katherine Hepburn about as well Jamie Foxx played Ray Charles. Later on through the film you find out there is something more behind his perfectionism, as his OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) is unrecognized by the American public.

The movie really starts off with a bang, capturing Hughes over budget movie ""Hell's Angels"", with some of the nicest cinematography I've seen in a long while. Without giving too much away, the film quickly takes a turn and levels off in the excitement section as you witness Hughes's OCD in full effect, practically driving him in to insanity. This is where the film gets long, and I mean long. Besides the fact the the film is close to 170 minutes, after about an hour into to the film the emotion and liveliness in the beginning is replaced by boring, frustrating dialog and context. Seriously, this film makes ""Gods and Generals"" look like ""Die Hard"", making me extremely sympathetic to the audiences that actually saw it in a theater who probably wished they went to an opera instead. In fact, the ending doesn't due Hughes or the film much justice either as it just closes with him going through one of his OCD fits.

With all the torturing boredom aside, ""Aviator"" is still a quality film film that was informative, contained remarkable acting on every part, exceptional cinematography that put's right in to the time frame of the movie. It's also once again another Oscar worthy performance by DiCaprio who still trying to get people to forgive for ""Titanic"" and his good looks. For the most part, I knew pretty much nothing about the Howard Hughes, and the film did it's job by reflecting Hughe's life. ""Aviator"" is not the best biography movies ever made, but it's pretty good and worth at least a rental.",7
24 January 2005,"Long, Drawn Out, and Boring.","I understand that Howard Hughs was a very important person in the history of film making. This ""movie"" however, was so incredibly long and does not keep you interested. Kate Blanchett did not portray Kathrine Hepburn in a realistic manner at all, It was offensive. You've shown that Howard went insane in your version, but not why. Why would be a good enough reason to possibly keep interest. The ""movie"" is not worth the Ten Dollars that it cost to see. You're better off waiting for it to come out on Network Television, even then you'd still be paying way too much money on your electric bill for this horrible ""movie."" The only redeeming part of the ""movie"" was Leo and Gwen and Kate Beckingsail's acting abilities. They deserve an Oscar just for pulling off the ridiculous script.

2 April 2005,"Scorsese does ""Citizen Kane""","Normally, Martin Scorsese and big-budget epics go together like oil and water. When Scorsese does low-budget, small-scale features like ""Who's That Knocking At My Door"", ""The King of Comedy"", ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"", or even the criminally underrated ""Bringing Out the Dead"", no one can touch him. But with over-slick & too-long fare such as ""New York, New York"", ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", ""Kundun"" & ""Gangs of New York"", he has always seemed out of his element.

Yet somehow, ""The Aviator"" works. There are those who say it is only because Scorsese took over from Michael Mann, who knows how to do long films well (i.e. ""Heat"") & who had experience with big budgets & large-scale productions during his time doing ""Miami Vice"" in the '80's. But I think the real reason for it is because at some point, either Scorsese or screenwriter John Logan realized that Howard Hughes was a real-life Citizen Kane, and that any movie of his life should be an homage to Orson Welles' masterpiece.

So the first thing they did was hire an actor (Leonardo DiCaprio playing an adult for the first time) who--like Welles in 1941--is only really old enough for the early scenes, and whose boyish face isn't quite suited for the mustache he wears through most of the film. Then they recreated some of the more famous set-pieces, such as the screening room, the party full of dancing girls and sycophants, the burning of his possessions, the use of split-screen for the more important conversations, and the monologue about losing millions of dollars a year. Then they grafted on much of the plot about a multi-millionaire who spends lavishly upon his passions instead of making sound investments, who drives away the women he sleeps with, who is more feared than loved amongst his inner circle, and who has a powerful rival who brings scandal upon our hero.

Of course the match isn't perfect. Hughes' Achilles heel is not hubris or egomania (of which he has plenty), but mental illness. And the last time I checked, there are no jaw-dropping aeronautical stunts in ""Kane"".

But like ""Kane"", the movie has only one real flaw. In ""Kane"", it was the that the ceilings in the newspaper office were too low. In ""The Aviator"", it's DiCaprio's God-awful attempt at a Texas accent, marring an otherwise brilliant performance.

Ultimately, ""The Aviator"" should be remembered as one of Scorsese's best movies. It is slightly better than ""Goodfellas"" (emphasis on *slightly*), but it doesn't reach the rarefied air of Scorsese's holy trinity of ""Mean Streets"", ""Taxi Driver"" & ""Raging Bull"". Nonetheless, it earns 10 stars out of 10.",10
5 August 2010,Impressive biopic of a stunning individual,"Martin Scorcese's biopic of the billionaire, movie mogul, aviator and playboy Howard Hughes is a riveting, enthralling epic that successfully examines both the lifestyle and psychology of one of the twentieth century's most intriguing individuals.

The Aviator details Howard Hughes' life in the twenty years between 1927-47, which includes his career as a movie producer/director, his achievements as an aeronautical designer and aviator, as well as the glamorous women he dated and the political problems he faced after World War Two. It also details his struggle with obsessive compulsive disorder and his fear of germs, which would greatly hinder him in his later life.

The Aviator is aided to a large extent by the brilliant performances of it's stellar cast. Leonardo Di Caprio successfully sheds off his Titanic heart-throb image, proving that he is one of today's most talented actors with his stunning portrayal of Hughes. Di Caprio perfectly captures the eccentricity, arrogance and passion that drove Hughes to fame. But the moments that most impress in this tour de force performance are the scenes in which Hughes starts to spiral into the obsessive compulsive madness that plagued him in his later life. It is in these scenes that Di Caprio displays some of his finest acting ever. The only faults with his performance is that Di Caprio never fully captures Hughes' voice, although he does nail his intonation. And he never really physically resembles Hughes until the final scenes. However, these criticisms are merely pedantic observations, and they do not detract at all from the brilliance of his performance.

But the credit can't all go to Di Caprio. Cate Blanchett is equally impressive as Katherine Hepburn. Blanchett perfectly captures the voice, mannerisms and attitude of Hepburn, and infuses her performance with such humanity and insecurity that it comes across as so much more than a simple impersonation. Blanchett rightfully won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar of 2004 for this film, and continued to prove that she is the most versatile actresses next to Meryl Streep.

Scorcese shows off his awesome directing talents again, providing a glamorous yet often disturbing portrait of a tortured genius. And he proves that he is capable with more than we expected of him with the perfectly executed flight sequences. The use of period colour photography is also intriguing. This is most evident in the scene where Hughes and Hepburn play golf, and the grass appears more turquoise than green.

However, the movie does fall short of perfection. One of it's main faults (in my opinion) is that it does not focus enough on the cast as an ensemble. Di Caprio and Blanchett are the only actors who are indulged enough, and I felt that more screen time should have been dedicated to the performances of Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Ian Holm, John C Reilly and Kate Beckinsale. To his credit, Alda makes the most of his screen time, and secured an Oscar nomination for his performance. But I would still have liked to have seen more development of the minor characters, particularly Baldwin's.

The film also skips over important details of Hughe's life, including his fascist politics, which are conveniently airbrushed out of the film to portray Hughes as an all-American hero, which I feel is wrong. His politics should have been acknowledged. It is these faults that prevent The Aviator from achieving the greatness of other Scorcese films such as Raging Bull and Taxi Driver.

However, if you forgive the film it's faults, and see it for what it is, you will find a brilliant, complex, heart-lifting and sometimes tragic film, which uncompromisingly examines an eccentric genius, which remains one of the best films of 2004 and one of my personal favourites. I hope it becomes one of your's too.",8
27 May 2005,Too much profanity,"I watched this movie on DVD. I would start out rating it an 8 overall, then bump it up to a nine for outstanding special effects and for beautiful costumes, especially ""Ava Gardner's"". But then I have to dock it two points for excessive foul language throughout the film. Perhaps this language was justified on how these characters really talked, but it drew my attention away from other qualities and spoiled my enjoyment of the film. IMDb rules prevent me from repeating any of it for this review.

I understand this film won five Acadamy Awards, but the only one I know as I write was for Best Supporting Actress, which was certainly well-deserved. I wouldn't be surprised if two others were for the aforementioned costumes and effects. (I'll have to check this out.) However, if you enjoy watching characters who can express themselves only through expletives, you might also like Ruthless People (1986).

9 June 2005,Sometimes Mr Scorses is just too in awe of other 'name' directors. A homage to Citizen Kane.,"I was a little disappointed by this very long film, although Mr Scorsese's more recent work isn't great.

Firstly I think Leo Dicaprio is miscast, terribly miscast as HH. He (HH) was well-known to be a tall dark-haired man and DiCaprios makes no effort to shed his 'boy band' looks here, which makes the film unbelievable from the start. DiCaprio is generally unconvincing and out of his depth here.

Some of the other casting is questionable, it takes a while to get used to Cate Blanchett doing Kate Hepburn, it's too hard to forget it's Cate Blanchett, but she does well enough in the role, after a while...it can easily descend into 'camp' this type of role, so it's a relief that she manages to avoid that. Generally the best dialogue is between these two characters.

I think Scorcese was too in awe and too conscious of ""Citizen Kane"" in making this film and it often seems like a weaker version or a homage to that picture.

The actually building of an aviation empire is interesting, as is the 'war' between rival moguls and their tame politicians but this is also the stuff that makes it a Citizen Kane clone-pic.

I think HH was a phenomenally interesting subject and the film doesn't do him justice.

It's just an 'ok' film.",6
27 March 2023,Leonardo DiCaprio soars in Martin Scorsese's lavish biopic 'The Aviator',"""The Aviator"": A Lavish Biopic With Spectacular Performances

Martin Scorsese's 2004 biographical film ""The Aviator"" is a lavish and enthralling tribute to the life of the aviation pioneer Howard Hughes. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role, who delivers one of the finest performances of his career. DiCaprio perfectly captures the charisma and eccentricity of Hughes, as well as the mental anguish that ultimately consumed him.

The film follows Hughes from his early days as a filmmaker and aviation enthusiast to his later years as a reclusive billionaire. Along the way, we see him pursuing a series of high-profile romances, battling powerful political figures, and struggling with his own mental health.

Scorsese directs the film with his trademark precision and attention to detail, recreating the glitz and glamour of Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s with stunning accuracy. The film's production design, costume design, and cinematography are all superb, transporting the viewer back in time to a bygone era.

But what truly sets ""The Aviator"" apart are the performances. In addition to DiCaprio's star turn, the film boasts a supporting cast that includes Cate Blanchett as the iconic actress Katharine Hepburn, Alan Alda as a corrupt senator, and John C. Reilly as Hughes' loyal assistant. Each actor brings their A-game to the film, creating a rich and captivating ensemble.

At its heart, ""The Aviator"" is a story about the pursuit of greatness and the toll it can take on a person's psyche. With its stunning visuals, impeccable craftsmanship, and outstanding performances, it is a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.",10
6 February 2007,Disappointing fictional treatment of an epic story.,"Anyone who has read any of the numerous biographies on the life of Howard Hughes, particularly Noah Dietrich's own best-seller, will do well to avoid this Hollywood pot-boiler because they will be mightily disappointed. The chutzpah of the makers in omitting huge chunks of the Hughes' story and the host of interesting and historical characters who impinged on Hughes' life, whilst embellishing relatively minor incidents is little short of breathtaking. The casting of the baby-faced DiCaprio as the central character is laughable - at no time does he even come close to close to capturing the essence of a man who was a giant of his times. About the only good thing that can be said about this film is that the few flying scenes are well done. But as an accurate portrayal of an American titan, forget about it - the earlier version starring Tommy Lee Jones is far superior.

4 March 2005,Di Caprio all the way,"This is just a movie that Scorsese made for DiCaprio. After the Oscar fiasco, I thought the Academy was a little harsh on Scorsese, especially for a man who has got 6 nominations in his career, but after watching both the movies 'Million Dollar Baby' and 'the Aviator' I have to say that the Academy was right in giving the former the best picture award.

Why would I disregard Scorsese's epic with such disregard???

Well just like Howard Hughes' epic Hell's Angels was ignored by critics in its early days as depicted in the movie many would agree with The Aviator as well........ The only difference is that Hell's Angels was an epic hit whereas the Aviator would just remain a sideway movie, which people will cease to remember a few days later......

Don't think I'm full of harsh words for the movie, because Leonardo DiCaprio was fabulous..... He tried his level best to pull the movie away, but with the genuine lack of a definite plot, his efforts were mostly to the drain..... Apart from the characters of Hepburn and Hughes all the other characters lacked a proper definition.. I mean Alan Alda was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for the movie.... After watching the movie all I can say is that he was a total BS, instead John Reilly was a better option.... The very essence of the movie, the eccentricity of the great Hughes is not very well depicted.... Like Beautiful Mind where the eccentricity stole the show, Scorsese fails to show us the reason for the eccentricity of Hughes.....

All in all the great epic of Scorsese remains as an actor's failed chance to fame. DiCaprio finally proved his acting talents but he put his name in a poor movie which lacks a proper direction.....

In the end a very scratchy 7/10 from me..........",7
28 February 2005,overblown rubbish!,"After choosing to go and see this film for my 18th birthday on it's UK release on January 7th, i thought that this would be a great film. Following the Hollywood hype for months I was relieved when it finally came out even viewing it on the deluxe screen for £8.60!!!(around 14 dollars) per person!!, to enrich the viewing experience and to cope with three hours worth of Hollywood overspending. I can't say that I regret it because it has made me realise what a completely monotonous film this is, just flying and crashing planes ,which seems to go on for an ridiculously unnecessary time span. The ending is probably the worst i have seen for ages, not in anyway rounding of the film to an acceptable standard, just leaving it where most of the film has been for three hours prior. How it has been nominated for so many undeserved Oscars is completely beyond me, with the nomination for best film a joke!! I am relieved that million dollar baby won, being far more poignant and proof itself that it isn't about special effects and how many stars you shove into one film that wins, it is the content and the story. Even though some may be enticed by the big explosions and computer graphics with the plot of the aviator in general, there is a popular British saying that springs to mind: you can't polish a turd!and this was a real piece of s**t",
2 February 2022,amirhoseinahg,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",7

22 December 2022,Scorcese's Glaring Lack of Knowledge,"This movie is great fun, but it fails audiences - abysmally. It is completely silent about the most dramatic scenes of Howard Hughes' love life. It would have been far more accurate and more interesting if it had left out Hepburn altogether. Nothing of importance occurred in Howard's romantic interlude with Hepburn and in fact he dumped her just as soon as his love interest became available. Yet this film doesn't just skim over the main point, it misses it entirely.

The actress that entranced Howard Hughes was immensely more powerful and far more renowned than Katharine Hepburn. Courteous, professional, polite, straight as an arrow, tremendously active and wildly fun-loving, she was Hepburn's polar opposite in personality and a far superior athlete. Where Hepburn lived on the family wealth that bought her a career, this scintillating actress was a fiercely hard working, self-made woman. For years, her films paid for Hepburn's endless stream of flops. Probably the greatest triple threat in history, she had by far the widest range of talent of any celebrity that lived during Howard Hughes' lifetime and he absolutely adored her.

There can only be one valid reason why Scorcese failed so flagrantly to tell this far more fascinating story and that is, that no actress could portray her. Certainly beyond Cate Blanchett.

Her home in the skies saw an endless stream of some of the most famous people in film, art, and sport. Hughes courted her with an Old Southern gallantry that was completely at odds with how he treated women like Harlow and Hepburn, Russell and Gardner. He called upon her mother for permission to see her, and that courtship is unquestionably the high point of Howard Hughes' love life.

The story of their relationship would have been perfect for 'The Aviator.' It touches the main point of the movie as it reveals Hughes' descent into what he became later; the spying and phone tapping and secretive plotting for which he became notorious first appeared during their affair. The scenes of romance and glittering fame, and the stupendous emerald engagement ring that was the talk of the entire country. The frantic desperation of Hughes' attempted suicide when she caught him in his philandering. The breakup in his hospital room. Howard's lifelong attorney recalled Howard's devastation when she made her final exit. It was the only time his attorney and closest friend ever saw the billionaire playboy in tears. Howard Hughes never recovered from the heartbreak he received from Ginger Rogers.

When he guts a story like he did with 'The Aviator,' Scorcese has a lot to answer for.",2
5 October 2005,Extremely well-done (though probably with a lot of artistic license),"I've never been attached to a Scorcese film, and I barely know Leonardo DiCaprio from Adam, so I had no real prejudices about this one. (I have always had a great interest in Howard Hughes, but that could just as easily make me prejudiced AGAINST this one as FOR it.) But I think it really worked, almost completely. One half-way small thing is the music. I've always had a real hang-up about ""period"" movies (and others) that have songs squeezed edgewise into them.For instance, there's Scorcese's own ""Goodfellas"". I like strange things worked into movies (to put it mildly), but even I couldn't enjoy the idea of a MAFIA movie that uses ""Atlantis"" as the music for a mob killing scene, or ""Layla"" as its closing music! But when I see the credits of a movie, and see a dozen songs that I don't remember hearing, that's a good thing, because it means they were worked into it in a half-way subtle way. And that's what happened in The Aviator - apart from the nightclub songs, and a few others, the ' 20s - ' 40s music was worked in pretty casually. I think about the only thing that went against DiCaprio physically was height (Howard Hughes was almost 6 ft. 4), but that's a small enough problem. As for that look that someone described as an ""I've got to get to a men's room"" look, I think it was just a properly ""intense"" one. And again, I have no axe to grind about him as an actor. And Kate Beckinsall (sp.), someone else I don't really know at all, was really great, in such an ""understated"" way, as Ava Garner, especially in that one big scene, where she more or less brings him out of his isolation (I couldn't really care less whether that episode is true or not). And Alec Baldwin as Trippe, and Alan Alda (someone I AM pretty prejudiced about) as Brewster. In that one line, where he asks if he's ""ON the committee, or CHAIRMAN of the committee?"", he sounds like a little kid hinting at a favor, instead of a slick politician, in other words, perfectly ""disingenuous."" And Cate Blanchette was great as Katherine Hepburn (though in some ways maybe less so than the actress Tovah Feldshuh in the TV movie with Tommy Lee Jones, though I don't think many people here would agree with that). Someone mentioned the overdone ""CGI"" effects, and I'm usually the first to be put off by that, but I think they WEREN'T overdone in this film, and were genuinely great in the filming-of-Hell's Angels scenes. Though I agree with one person here about that plane crash scene - I don't think it was unintentionally comical, but it was still overdone. Someone mentioned the movie unfairly blaming his mother for his phobias, and that might be true, but I know that Clifford Irving, in his infamous fake autobiography, mentions Mr. Hughes getting some of his ideas about hygiene from his mother, and I know that that fake autobiography used a lot of REAL facts (though I don't know whether that was one of them). I think The Aviator really worked, including the really unsettling last scene.",9
14 February 2005,Mind Numbingly Boring,"This may be the worst of any Oscar nominated film I can remember. The cinematography was adequate, personally I didn't find it terribly inspiring, the sets and costumes were fine but certainly not as breathtaking as they were made out to be. The editing was crap, quite frankly- there is about an hour and a half of interesting material here, and an hour and a half of pointless drivel. Large chunks of the story could easily have been dropped. Characters appear briefly then disappear without explanation. Di Caprio's portrayal of Hughes is incomprehensible, though I suppose when portraying a madman this shouldn't be shocking.

Seriously, I thought this movie had no redeeming features whatsoever. Even the much vaunted performance by Kate Blanchet I found hollow and forced. If there is one movie I would warn people away from this year, it would be this.

12 April 2023,The Aviator soars with DiCaprio's masterful performance and Scorsese's direction,"Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator,"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio, is a tour-de-force of filmmaking that tells the story of Howard Hughes, the eccentric and ambitious tycoon whose passion for aviation was matched only by his penchant for risk-taking and adventure. DiCaprio delivers a masterful performance as Hughes, capturing his intensity, his drive, and his descent into madness with incredible nuance and subtlety.

The film is a triumph of production design and visual effects, recreating the glamour and excess of the golden age of Hollywood with stunning authenticity. From the lavish parties and opulent hotels to the sleek airplanes and dazzling movie sets, ""The Aviator"" transports the viewer to another time and place, immersing them in the world of Hughes and the larger-than-life figures of the era.

Scorsese's direction is confident and assured, weaving together the complex narrative threads of Hughes' life with skill and precision. The film explores the many facets of Hughes' personality, from his visionary ideas about aviation to his struggles with OCD and his tumultuous relationships with women. The supporting cast is also exceptional, with standout performances from Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn, Alan Alda as a corrupt senator, and Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner.

What makes ""The Aviator"" such a compelling film, however, is not just its technical prowess or the strength of its performances, but its thematic depth. The film is ultimately a meditation on the dangers of unchecked ambition, as Hughes' relentless pursuit of his dreams leads him down a path of isolation and self-destruction. The film also touches on themes of power, control, and obsession, exploring the fine line between genius and madness.

While some viewers may find the film's pacing slow or its running time lengthy, these elements are necessary to fully convey the scope and complexity of Hughes' life and legacy. ""The Aviator"" is a true epic, a film that demands to be seen on the big screen and deserves to be celebrated as a triumph of American cinema.

Overall, ""The Aviator"" is a stunning achievement, a film that showcases the best of Scorsese's talents as a filmmaker and DiCaprio's abilities as an actor. It is a must-see for fans of historical dramas, biopics, and classic Hollywood cinema, and a testament to the power of cinema to transport us to another time and place.",9
15 June 2021,Rather engaging and captivating,"I've heard many mixed opinions about The Aviator, most not good. However, I found the cinematography to be rather breathtaking and DiCaprio's performance to be captivating. A great true story put on the screen.

17 July 2016,Great production but ultimately a bit too long.,"The Story of Aviator Howard Hughes.

Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale.

Written by John Logan.

Directed by Martin Scorsese.

I can see why this movie has won so many Oscars. It has all the right ingredients. Great acting, great cinematography, great photography and it is undeniably and unreservedly a Martin Scorsese movie with all of his trademark style and artistry. It's one hell of a production which I'm sure had the Oscar Nominations Board purring and salivating non-stop round the clock.

It is fascinating and it is an interesting watch but for me it's too long and a little bit boring. Just because a movie wins lots of Oscars doesn't necessarily mean it's an exciting movie and this fits into that category. It reminded me of Citizen Kane and I'd go as far as saying that it's basically the same kind of thing produced for a more modern audience. And that movie was pretty boring too.

This is a film I can appreciate on many levels but it's lacking a decent hook and a good dollop of excitement.

7.5/10 for the acting and production values.",7
9 June 2005,Surprisingly emotional and provocative,"Now, to be honest, I really didn't expect to like this movie that much. Sure, I knew it would be a good, well-directed movie, but I generally don't care much for biopics short of their educational value, but I couldn't help but become engrossed in the movie, and I feel that was largely due to Leo DiCaprio's acting. I can't say that I know much about Howard Hughes at all, short of what's in this movie, so I have no frame of reference for the material. Despite that, I really felt as though I was taking this journey with him, and could really relate to his turmoil. The whole cast was astounding, notably Kate Beckinsale and Cate Blanchett. About halfway through, it seemed to become a sort of emotional vacuum, as if it drew my feelings right out of mevery impressive.

VERDICT: A very wholesome movie that impressively succeeds in taking the audience on a journey with Howard Hughes. Recommended to anyone interested in true stories, aviation, or simply a good, wholesome drama with a twinge of action.

1 February 2005,Howard Hughes as a child and then through what appears to be adulthood. It is hard to tell because DeCaprio looks like a teenager trying to act like an adult.,"I was thoroughly disappointed by this very, very long exercise in Leonardo-watching. DeCaprio has never delivered on the promise that he made in the underrated What's Eating Gilbert Grape"". A terrific cast is wasted in this tedious and uneven film. How Allen Alda was somehow singled out for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar is completely beyond comprehension. The finest work is done by the always stunning Cate Blanchet. Director Scorsese has done some many great films previously, except of course the horribly miscast, Gangs of New York (perhaps a real brawling tough Irish actor like Colin Farrel might have done the trick as a tough brawling Irish immigrant rather than the rather feminine DeCaprio)so it is particularly unsatisfying to endure this non-epic. Eleven nominations for this laughable inconsistent mess is testimony to the ludicrous nature of the Academy Awards. Avoid this movie and go to The Very Long Engagement instead.

9 March 2005,"No blocks busted by this blockbuster, but PLENTY of blockages...on its path to cloud-nine stardom","So 5 out of ten...i.e. mediocrity at its best: the plot is neither unfolding apace, nor idiosyncratic enough to keep bums on seats--that's Leo's job and even he falters in reaching this his riveting on screen persona: his character is flat throughout, in terms of 'ounces of excitement and whispers of a thrill' (couldn't help quoting Anthony H.). At its most nail-biting moments (few and far between), the movie seems to choke, stopping short of white-knuckled gripping effusion. It all fizzles into that dreaded bottom line of any biopic: real-life drama translates into workaday cardboard in flea-pits. Success lies in that eluding hybrid: exaggeration + verisimilitude; and that's what slips through Scorsese's fingers--the sound reality check is flaccid when he fails to capitalize on it. His tunnel-vision seems to keep him oblivious to the Hollywood staple: the SPELL is crucial in 'spellbinding' and this means tension mounting towards a climax. The Aviator soars alright, but then it runs out of fuel and the viewer, suspended in full-blown animation, takes a nasty, anticlimactic nosedive. It doesn't hurt, though, especially if you've got Kate Beckinsale's plump...glamor to soften the blow.:)",5
6 January 2005,The best example of an all star cast performance,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",9
8 August 2005,Aviator is a crash scene,"After seeing the ratings and reading some comments on this movie, I find that I must be out of touch (be nice, now). I just couldn't get into this lightweight treatment of the subject...Howard Hughes.

I know that some think DeCaprio is a great actor...Please! He was totally unconvincing, that is if you are old enough to remember the real Hughes.

And Blanchett did an atrocious Hepburn. I at least expect to be drawn into the character, both by physical looks and actions. If you remember Hepburn in her early days, you know she was a striking beauty, not a broad-nosed, wide-faced plain looking gal. Her voice characterizations seemed strained to me.

I was never drawn into this movie, although it had some good special effects, not counting the obvious computer generations. IMO, Scorcese needs to get a new casting director or consider hanging up his track shoes. I have come to expect far better movies from him than this piece of polyester.",2

1 January 2005,"What was missed, however small, was significant","The movie was awesome, fast tracked with energy oozing from the pores of Howard Hughes, and Katherine Hepburn role was an Oscar performance. But, a grand opportunity failed to appear, that being any of the women of the 1929 Air Race. The only movie cameo was Roscoe Turner with his pet lion. But then...I have written ""Amelia's Voice"" about that race and it will blow the screen away soon. There is another chance to see Amelia Earhart, Pancho Barnes, and Howard Huges, not in the NOW, but in time travel into the past. What the movie did touch upon was the early years after WWI and how pilots traded in their military records for stunt flying and barnstorming. My only wish was that The Aviator had had more about the fliers of that age.

3 January 2005,"Well executed, but poorly told","I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",7

18 January 2017,Absolutely Horrible Zero Stars,"I really wish there was an option for zero stars because this garbage is that bad. It is so boring that at the end of the film you have to check your pulse to make sure you have not died of boredom. How the budget for this film was so high is beyond me since two hours of it takes place in a single room with barely any dialogue. The movie drags, drags, drags, and just when you think there is light at the end of the tunnel and that it is over it drags on long. It is almost three hours of absolutely painful torture. This is hands down the absolute worst film I have ever seen. The film is about Howard Hughs and his OCD, but even as someone with OCD myself I still could not appreciate any of this. (And his case was portrayed to be very extreme by the way.) There was absolutely no reason for this movie to drag on for three hours it could have been wrapped up in an hour and a half. It drags on since it is supposed to be a ""masterpiece"" but it is horrible. Hands down this is one of the absolute worst and torturous movies I have ever had to sit through. Terrible

8 March 2005,A movie of proportions befitting Howard Hughes,"This is one of the few movies of recent times that I came out of wanting to see again. While in no way a thorough docudrama of Howard Hughes' life (I recommend viewers at least read the IMDb biographic details of him before seeing the movie) we get a good insight into his complex nature, aspirations and mental problems. His two most most extravagant projects, the movie ""Hells Angels"" and the Hercules aircraft get the major attention as we would expect, but it is a pity that his role in producing ""Scarface"" receives only passing mention. Unfortunately I agree with those who say Leonardo di Caprio was the wrong person to cast as Hughes, but he does put in a good performance, while everyone else is superb; I particularly liked Alec Baldwin. Gorgeous sets, costumes and cinematography make it all a sumptuous visual delight which at no time becomes tedious. A must see.

28 May 2005,"I witnessed the Hughes crash, and the movie solved a family mystery","On July 7, 1946, I was at home with my parents at 618 N. Linden Drive, Beverly Hills. I can't recall the exact time of day but it seems to have been late morning in my memory. I was eleven years old. My father and I were having a game of badminton in the back yard. Suddenly, from the East, what we thought was a Lockheed P 38 at a very low altitude passed nearly directly over our house. Moments later, there was the sound of a crash and explosion, followed by a visible pall of smoke rising into the air from Whittier Drive. The editorial comment about this event said that Hughes had crashed into 805 Linden while attempting to reach the Wilshire Country Club. There is no Wilshire Country Club....the golf course he was attempting to reach was the Los Angeles Country Club, at the time the most exclusive and expensive private golf course in Southern California. In Beverly Hills, homes on the East side of the Streets have even numbers. Those on the West Side have odd numbers. Linden Drive splits off from Whittier at the 800 block. Hughes crashed at 820 Whittier, not 805 Linden. Because there are no homes on the West side of Whittier he could not have crashed into an odd number address. My father ran to the scene and witnessed the Marine just after he had pulled Hughes from the flaming wreckage.

My father mentioned to me sometime in the 1940's that his receptionist at his office one day buzzed him and said, ""there is a Mr. Howard Hughes here who wants to see you"". My dad was amazed that Hughes, who he had absolutely no previous contact with, would suddenly appear, alone, informally to see him. He said he was having problems in his campaign for The Outlaw, and wondered if my dad could help him. My dad had a long history in promoting Gilmore gas for Earl Gilmore, and had done a lot of successful promotions featuring lion mascots. In The Aviator, at the very end of the premiere for Hell's Angels, the narrator refers to a leather jacketed man, named Roscoe Turner holding a lion cub named Gilmore. When I saw that I realized the answer to why Howard Hughes had sought out my father for promotional assistance. Roscoe Turner was a top of the line competitive air racer in the 1930's, and his sponsor was Gilmore. That was the link that led Hughes to my dad, and I didn't know it until I saw The Aviator.

I found the movie interesting and somewhat difficult to become totally engrossed in. The way it was shot and edited made me constantly aware I was watching a movie production, as opposed to real cinema where you get totally captured and focused on the experience. They had to be selective with a very complex and varied individual and the outcome was a compromise, albeit to me a very entertaining one. Hepburn and Brewster were fantastic. Hughes became more believable as he aged, with the final 10 minutes a masterpiece.

All in all, a 9 for sure.",9
30 January 2005,boring,"as a documentary, it left so many gaps, that only those who had some knowledge of the true story could understand the leaps in the 'plot'. the computer animation is crude!! much below now days standard. the flying boat and the water spray look like films done in the seventies. de caprio is the wrong actor for this part and his appearance does not change in the span of two decades!! he stays young after crashes and madness period to win the hearing. bad films which are short have at least one thing positive - the end is close to the beginning. in this case even that does not apply!!!! the film is too long !!!! save your money.

10 July 2017,It's endless,"This movie is painful to sit through. It just drags and drags. Each time you think you are finally getting to the end it drags and drags again. There is no excuse for this movie to be this long as the events don't properly fill it. It is yet another di caprio movie that they feel they must drag on for almost three hours simply because he is in it. This is one of those movies that people pretend to like simply because it is a Martin Scorsese flick. I would give someone $100 if they were able to actually pay attention to this bore all the way through twice! Very unlikely.

10 August 2005,Just another Hollywood movie...,"Can't see why there's been such a fuss about this movie. Considering Scorsese directed such masterpieces as Taxi Driver, it is a real disappointment. I mean, you just have to have a look at the Wikipedia article to see what an exceptional character Hughes was, and Di Caprio certainly wasn't the guy to play the part. His acting is not particularly bad, it is just awfully boringly obvious. No depth, no complexity, no ambiguity. He looks angry when he has to be angry, sound megalomaniac when he has to be megalomaniac... nothing more. Besides, Hughes was certainly a ladies'man, but one can't say that the affairs with Kate Hepburn or Ava Gardner are really interesting (and, most of all, DiCaprio never seems really interested in any of them).

Admittedly, a biopic is a difficult exercise, and few of them are what you may call masterpieces. Certainly, this one won't change my opinion of the genre.

23 January 2005,Overrated,"I think Scorcese was too focused on making what would be perceived as an epic. In the process of doing so, he squandered a chance to make a great film about a fascinating man. The countless close ups and long scenes about very minuscule fact make this movie drag on, and on. My wife and I both found ourselves not rooting for Hughes, but rooting for the movie to come to a conclusion. We both felt a sigh of relief when the film mercifully ends. Yet, even then we have no idea what became of Hughes in his declining years. My recommendation would be to wait for the video. That way you can fast forward through the repetitive pieces of this film. This is not Scorcese at the top of his game.

24 March 2005,Great Special effects saves this one from a Razzie.,"If this movie would have stuck to the avionics and business/political intrigues of Howard Hughes, it would have been a smash. It's a fantastic movie cinematographically, and the special effects are unmatched. However, the director really fails in defining the Hughs character in a realistic way. Leo clearly doesn't have the depth or scope to portray this intriguing man. As an actor, it is a truism that you can't play a man more complicated and intelligent that you are. That holds true in this case and it might hold true for Scorsese as well- Martin didn't have the scope of vision broad enough to develop a convincing Howard Hughes.

Hughes was a man who grew up alone, fawned over by a couple of aunts. Then, almost overnight this lonely guy inherits a huge amount of money along with a cash cow business. Hughes leaves Houston never to return again. So now Hughes is in Hollywood and in his twenties, a good-looking, tall Texan with millions of dollars. He's making movies and bedding the most beautiful women of his time. Hey, I just don't see the joy and happiness there, and I've seen pictures of Hughes with babes during those times, and he was smiling. And not with the angst-ridden forced smile that Leo shows us. Hughes was happy, and he was enjoying himself. We never see that side of him in the movie.

On a similar note, the Hepburn-Hughes love affair was leaden and just didn't ring true. There was no on-screen chemistry. Blanchette had the accent down, but didn't remotely look like the WASPish Hepburn. Once again, the Scorsese ham-handed this aspect of Hughes' life and the movie suffers for it.

Martin's view that the OCP was the source for Hughes' inspired decisions in business and engineering was also off the mark. I have read that Hughes' problem was that he never could MAKE a decision- he would pester subordinates (who were brilliant) to come up with options and forced THEM to make the actual decision.

In fact, Hughes' downfall was precipitated by the crash of the test plane right after the war. Hughes lost his looks and a lot of his confidence. Plus, he suffered severe head injuries, and who knows how much that affected his persona and thought processes? With the Senate investigation and the actions of PAN AM, I have no doubt that Hughes' house was bugged, and spies were everywhere in his organization. Actress Jean Peters, his wife for a short time, even admitted that she worked for the CIA and reported on Hughes' activities to her superiors, so Hughes' paranoia was certainly justified. And the paranoia fed the OCP- a vicious cycle.

Edited down to two hours, eliminating the Hepburn angle, and drastically cutting down the ""Hughes-as-a-nut case"" scenes (overdone for that time of his life, and, besides, we GET IT, already) this movie would be light years better.",4
12 December 2005,Disappointing,"This film was distinctly disappointing. Not only was it considerably too long and slow, but Leonardo di Caprio was the wrong person to play Hughes - he lacked the gravitas of a serious industrialist, and looked far too boyish to play the part. He is too reminiscent of a pretty-boy Michael J Fox in his prime - unconvincing in anything other than a light-hearted, teenage movie.

Also, the flying scenes were poor - in fact the planes looked distinctly superimposed, not much more effective than the special effects of 20 years ago. In terms of the wow-factor of the flying scenes, it was leagues behind Top Gun, for example.

Finally, in terms of character development, it was weak. Hughes' development was inconsistent and he drifted from being savvy and charismatic to being compulsive and seemingly insane, with minimal transition. By comparison to 'A Beautiful Mind', for example, the development of the lead was unconvincing, and I was left neither moved nor bothered by his state. I saw this as a missed opportunity, because what would have been really fascinating about Hughes was that he teetered on the brink of brilliance and insanity, and it would have been interesting to see how the two states manifested themselves, instead of incoherently switching between the two.

This film was distinctly disappointing!",4
8 January 2005,"Doesn't feel the ""Scorsese"" factor but loving it!","Before I went to catch this movie, I had my reservations about it. Knowing that it was directed by Scorsese and most of his films are rather artistic. I mean the camera angles, the scenes transitions and things like that.

I was totally bored to sleep when I saw GANGS OF NEW YORK...I actually dozed off a few times in the theater and was thinking to myself when it is dragshow ever gonna finish.

But I was pretty satisfied (thought not completely cos it's still is Scorsese...gawd, I feel as if I'm biased against him). Anyway, this film is a pretty good biopic. Have heard but not know anything about Howard Hughes and certainly it does have the Oscars and Golden Globe rings to it.

Well, all in all, THE AVIATOR is a good film though.

3 January 2005,Probably the Best Hollywood Film of '04,"A true masterpiece of our time and an instant classic for Scorsese fans as well as lovers of all great cinema, The Aviator delivers on every level; from its incredibly convincing, yet not at all distracting, special effects to its engrossing story of triumph and insanity. This is a modern day Citizen Kane, with top notch acting from both leading actors, Cate Blanchett, with her inspired portrayal of Katharine Hepburn, as well as the incredibly talented and compelling DiCaprio who, with this role, graduates from mere movie star to bona-fide actor. And, of course, no Scorsese film would be without unforgettable visuals; you'll never look at milk the same way again.

17 January 2005,Obsessive Beauty,"Men with the most money get the most attention, especially when they're involved with Hollywood. One of these men was Howard Hughes, a man who faced barriers from without and within. The Aviator does a pretty good job of capturing this man on film, but the movie still has some barriers of its own.

The Aviator does not begin at the beginning of Hughes' life; rather it picks up in the midst of Hughes' production of Hell's Angels. And just like Hell's Angels, there's never a moment in the film that's boring. In fact, all 170 minutes are captivating. There are so many big-names behind this film that one can't help but be awed. Alec Baldwin, John C. Reilly, Willem Dafoe, Jude Law, Ian Holm. Standing out, though, was Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn, eccentric in her performance, but only as eccentric as Hepburn herself.

Furthermore, Scorsese's direction and Richardson's cinematography are both excellent and pleasing to the eye throughout the film. Also, Shore provides a score that captures the excitement of aviation alongside the tragedy of Hughes life. The screenplay, sets, and costumes also seem to fit the time period very well.

Now, on to DiCaprio's performance. Overall, I felt that he did a very good job in his very tough role as a deeply-troubled man whom no one ever understood. However, at the beginning of the film, he just seems to be Leonardo DiCaprio, not Howard Hughes. Maybe this is because the film delves right into the action and the viewer cannot even start to grasp Hughes' character until later in the film. Needless to say, though, as Hughes ages, DiCaprio seems to embrace the character fully and without restraint. One other complaint I have regards a certain transition in the film that I found hard to believe, and it has to do with the mental state of Mr. Hughes, but I cannot discuss it in full here because it may spoil the film for potential viewers.

Anyways, this is a must-see, in turns entertaining and disturbing. The ending is a beauty.

Final Grade: A-.",8
30 January 2005,"Dicaprio is finally in his prime, Scorsese remains in his prime","Even though Leonard Dicaprion still looks like a baby, Scorsese and his last two films have helped turn him into one of today's finest young actors. Dicaprio (30 years old, I believe) brings bright eyes and baby faced excitement to the young drill bit tycoon from Texas, Howard Hughes, trying to piece together his epic, grand scaled first film ""Hell's Angels."" Just when he's got it about wrapped up, he realizes that the public is no longer interested in silent films and wants to re-shoot his film for sound. Months and millions later he gets it done. This is just the opening act of Scorse's obligatory epic, and although this surely is not Marty's best picture or most personal piece, we can see a parallel character in Hughes to that of Scorsese. Like ""Gangs of New York,"" ""Kundun,"" ""The Age of Innocence,"" and ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" Scorsese has created a world from the past that he had never seen with his own eyes but had vision enough to imagine it and imagination enough to direct his actors to exist in it. Dicaprio as his lead man in the last two Scorsese pictures is not his new Deniro but a young actor with cooperation enough to create these worlds and the dark (and light) side of human nature that exist within them. It is time this year that Scorsese is finally given his Academy Award for Achievement in direction. This film is not just an excuse to give him an award, but rather a showcase of one of America's finest filmmakers still very much in his prime.",9
14 January 2005,A Wonderfully Acted Film!,"The Aviator was a great film! Leonardo DiCaprio did a great job but I really loved Cate Blanchett. She really did a phenomenal job! I thought she showed a good Katherine Hepburn.

Martin Scorsese has a good film that deserves awards. I think this is one of his best!

I thought the filming was well done and it was true story that kept me interested. At the end I kind of wanted to learn more about Howard Hughes.

I give the film a ~9/10~ because it really was one of the best pictures of the year. A great film about a Howard Hughes!

24 February 2005,An excellent film.,"Martin Scorsese's masterfully directed film ranks up with his best films such as GoodFellas, Taxi Driver, and Mean Streets. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a much better performance than he did in Gangs of New York, that film was all about Daniel Day-Lewis. Cate Blanchett gives her usual Oscar worthy performance as an excellent Katherine Hepburn. The film was also filled with smaller performances from such great as Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, John C. Reilly, Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, and Jude Law. Any true Scorsese fan will be blown away by this wonderful film. I can only hope the Academy looks past Jamie Foxx's very good performance in Ray and vote for Di Caprio's excellent performance in The Aviator.

11 May 2006,The Force of Imagination,"""The Aviator"" is a work of art, not a vain attempt to create a realistic biography on film. Scorsese paints his scenes with oblique brush strokes and his icons take their forms.

As the film opens, the audience is shown the young Howard Hughes being washed, tested and warned by his mother. They are sequestered in a large, quiet, clean parlour room. A fear of outside contamination is being inculcated into his psyche. John Logan, the film's scriptwriter, seems to be saying that Howard's formative years were spent in very protective custody. The safety of home, of being inside with one's parents, especially with one's mother. The oblique reference here is to ""Citizen Kane"" and his sheltered childhood. 'Rosebud' becomes 'Quarantine. Q-u-a-r-a-n-t-i-n-e. Quarantine', a semi-mystic recurrence.

You are conscious that you are watching film from the beginning to end of ""The Aviator"". Cinema itself becomes a kind of religious artifact for Scorsese as his choice, to use the more primitive colour technology of the 30s (film stock registering reds and blues, but not greens) to shoot the first half of the movie, demonstrates. His selection of quality period music is impeccable and exciting in itself. Hence, authenticity in ""The Aviator"" is reserved for art. Approximation will do for life. The realities of Hughes', Hepburn's, Domergue's and Gardener's lives, amongst others portrayed in the film, take a back seat to Scorsese's artistic license. And this is not really such a bad thing, although that observation occasionally goes unappreciated because of the proclivity of certain people go to the movies to vicariously experience the lives of real people. They feel cheated when that experience is denied, even when it is artistically, that is, consciously short circuited.

Thus, it is difficult for many audience members to get their heads around the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio is Howard Hughes. He's not supposed to be the real Hughes. He is an icon representing Hughes. Sure, that happens in other movies too. But, in this one, it is different. You can never suspend your disbelief as in the way you would in say, Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"". Neither can you suspend your disbelief that Cate Blanchett IS Katherine Hepburn. Even Cate's mastering of the Hepburn's signature accent is not on, in terms of getting you to believe that she is anybody but Cate Blanchett. Still, one does very much appreciate the acting abilities of everyone in this film, including Kate Beckinsale, but nobody who has actually seen Ava Gardener in movies like ""Night of the Iguana"" can find Beckinsale other than a finely sculpted representation of the voluptuous Ms. Gardener. And as for Alan 'the MASH' Alda, playing the corrupt, McCarthy era Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, please, it's just not possible. Still, they're all excellent when taken in the context of the totality which is ""The Aviator"". The actors remain engaging, even as the film itself moves with its own kind of surrealist animus.

As George Orwell accurately observed, ""All art is propaganda, but not all propaganda is art."" Fortunately, ""The Aviator"" is both. Its art can be found in its cinematographic beauty, the quality of the performances and direction and in its meaning. Hughes was an archetype of the entrepreneurial spirit of Christmases past; a time when one man could use his accumulated wealth to achieve the goals his imagination generated. In his own filmic way, Scorsese has replayed the American dream which swirls in so many minds today; the dream of capitalism and freedom; the dream of near, absolute power to change the world. Hughes had all of this, of course. At one paranoid point in the film, Hughes asks one of his confidants, ""Who is that man? Does he work for me?"" To which, one of his executive hirelings replies, ""Why Mr. Hughes, everyone works for you.""

The Hughes and Hepburn of ""The Aviator"" represent those dreamy icons. They are at their peak in the depths of the Great Depression. At a time when Woody Guthrie would be walking out on a well paid gig at the Coconut Grove to hop a freight and preserve his sense of integrity, Hughes would be thinking of buying the Grove as he obsessively planned his next Hollywood blockbuster. Meanwhile, the glam-dame Hepburn would be seeking solace in Howard's courage to challenge the petty-minded money changers of the sexist Hollywood Establishment. To be sure, Hughes backed up his daring with financial power and a proved ability to beat the odds while making money at creatively inspired projects. Hughes' qualities were not lost on the astute Hepburn. In ""The Aviator"", they enjoy a mutual affection which was driven by more than money. In ""The Aviator"", it's pure audacity which makes them ""cling"" together like two glasses of Veuve Clicquot while flying Howard's plane around the skies of Los Angeles.

This is a great artistic opus, from the consciously chosen uses of form: the primitive two-colour process during the first half of ""The Aviator"", to the content embedded in philosophical-political-psychological messages running through the whole of its 170 minute run-time. Martin Scorsese is the Orson Wells of our time.

""Nature builds no machines, no locomotives, railways, electric telegraphs, self-acting mules etc. These are products of human industry; natural material transformed into organs of the human will over nature, or of human participation in nature. They are organs of the human brain, created by the human hand; the power of knowledge, objectified. The development of fixed capital indicates to what degree general social knowledge has become a direct force of production, and to what degree, hence, the conditions of the process of social life itself have come under the control of the general intellect and been transformed in accordance with it. To what degree the powers of social production have been produced, not only in the form of knowledge, but also as immediate organs of social practice, of the real life process."" Karl Marx (1857) The GRUNDRISSE, chapter 14",8
31 January 2005,Excellent Epic Film,"This is a serious epic film, spanning a large chunk of Howard Hughes' life, and highlighting several grand Hollywood actors. I can easily see how it would be nominated for so many Oscars, because in some ways it is an homage to all the films of the 30s and 40s. I thoroughly enjoyed it and thought the acting was phenomenal but at times strange. With so many current actors playing such eccentrics, it's hard not to almost cringe at their characters. Example? Blanchett (nominated for best actress by The Academy), playing Katherine Hepburn, can be grating just as I think the original Hepburn was, and her raspy loud voice impersonation made me feel almost...uncomfortable. Of course DiCaprio is over the top, and he is excellent at impersonating all of Hughes' ticks, as well as landing a great Texas accent. He just seemed a bit young for the part, but considering the lack of acting talent today, I can get over it. He was great, and if he won for best actor I could accept that. The most underrated performance? Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner. She steals every seen she is in.

Should you see it on the big screen? YES! The movie IS called 'The Aviator' and there are amazing aerial shots that are better than even' Sky Captain & The World of Tomorrow'. I thought they were breathtaking and the best in-air shots I'd ever seen. The more I think about the film, the more I like it. Scorsese does a fantastic job.

BE PREPARED THOUGH! Like all Scorsese films, this one is LONG, and will FEEL LONG!",9
29 December 2004,a truly brilliant film!,"i have to admit that even though i was eager to see this film i was not as excited as i usually am when i go and see a new scorsese movie. even though i thought gangs of new york and bringing out the dead where good, they had not enthralled me like kundun, casino, or raging bull had. but boy was i wrong. the master is back and as good as he has always been. from the gorgeous, era inspired photography and scorsese's usual, intoxicating, bag of cinematic treats, to the incredible performances of leonardo and cate, this movie is perfect. every shot, every frame. very few times has a movie enveloped me and sustained my interest like this movie did. it's glad to know that scorsese still can create such a masterpiece. the only down side is that now the long, painful wait for his next film begins.

24 January 2005,Disappointing,"Martin Scorsese has never really let me down with his films. Also at times when I was thinking: how are you gonna find your way out of this massive disaster? it turns out to be a good film (like in 'Gangs of New York'). Leonardo DiCaprio has a way of surprising me. When I think: O my God - not another film ruined by this teen-idol! it actually comes out as a great movie. He sure is a talented actor.

But both prominent Hollywood figures did let me down this weekend. This weekend I saw The Aviator. It wasn't a bad film, not at all. The story is interesting and the acting is very well in some parts. Not to mention: John C. Reilly is playing (as always) a great role. But The Aviator never leaves a mediocre level - it's predictable, it babbles on never really being exciting in any way. The trailer makes us believe that it will be the epic we've always been waiting for. But it isn't at all. It is just a film about a tragic figure and a world that doesn't understand him. That intriguing fact is overlooked by the cinematographic violence and outdated visual effects, so the real tragedy never becomes really visible. For that reason I do not understand all the laudatory criticism - it could've been a brilliant movie if Scorsese had let this habit to overreact at home. The movie wants to be epic full of visual effects and a personal tragedy at the same time and it doesn't work out! So, I don't want to disappoint all the people who want to go and see this movie, but please take into account that it could just maybe turn out badly...",6

3 January 2005,The Aviator Flys High,"To make a film documenting the life of Howard Hughs is an ambitious task. Luckily Matin Scorsese is an ambitious man. However, there are dangers to having a big-name director. As is sometimes the case, they feel that their name alone can carry a film. In other cases, most notably Scorsese's Gangs of New York, the Oscar whoring by the studios make the actual art of film-making feel like an after thought. Now it is known that Harvey Weinstein, The Aviator's executive producer, has made it his personal mission to get Marty a Golden Guy. But, fortunately, this does not carry into the film itself.

Leonardo DiCaprio found fame by playing off his boyish good looks in movies like Romeo + Juliet and Titanic. In those pictures it did not matter that he looked ten years younger than he actually was. Actually, that worked to his advantage. In The Aviator, however, he is playing a man and not a boy. Despite having a mustache and beard in one part, he still looks twelve. Thankfully, though, this is the biggest flaw with his performance. I'm not going to say that his acting (which is career best) over comes this short falling. I will say, though, that this ""teenage boy"" did a convincing job playing a man.

The Aviator documents Hughes's life from Hell's Angels through his aviation days to the onset of his OCD over taking him completely. The script, although well written in terms of dialogue and character arcs, seemed to skip over the explanation OCD, how it affected Hughes and why more strongly at some times than others. It also playes with his hearing disability, using it only when it aides in a cinematic moment and causes a bigger reaction. When the script is on fire with quick dialogue, Hughes never seems to miss a beat. When he is nervous at a movie premier, he is completely deaf to the reporter's questions.

The difficult task with the film is that it contains many biographical stories. Hughes may be the main one that all the others revolve around, but due to some outstanding work by the supporting cast, the smaller parts are equally as relevant. From Gwen Stefani to Alan Alda, no one is what you expect of them. Kate Beckinsale takes a break form crap like Underworld to show that, if she tried, she could be an actress. Of course, where would this list be without Cate Blanchet, who will finally win her long deserved Oscar this year with a fabulous portrayal of Kate Hepburn; a performance against which all future Katherines will be measured. Once she gets out of the awkward caricature stage she starts out in, there is no stopping her.

Even if it falls sluggish from time to time, the actors hold this one above the water. The actors and the excellent techs, that is. Now if only the Academy would award Marty so that he can go back to making movies where the trophies are the after thoughts. ****/*****",8
16 January 2014,"No matter what, move towards what you want","The Aviator is another Martin Scorsese's movie confirming his genius and unique character in film industry. His movies always has an intricate plot, the cast always consists of great actors and the scenarios are also magnificent reflecting with all details the epoch where the story takes place. All this together makes his films be watched, remembered and talked about.

The Aviator is a story about Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio), American millionaire, inventor and director. Since his childhood he was passionate about movies and aviation. So, his first movie Hell's Angels was about planes. Its production lasted for several years. During these years Hughes spent a lot of money and efforts on finishing this film. Nevertheless, the final result was amazing, the movie was very successful. Then Hughes made some more films, but at the end decided to dedicate himself to aviation. He also had different love affairs that ended tragically. Howard Hughes is rich, successful, but he, like many other mortals, has his own skeletons. He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that gets worse and worse as Hughes grows and reaches new victories. And it's interesting to watch how he deals with this problem: being such a genius and paranoid at the same time and achieve his goals. I guess Leo's character totally proves that no matter what, but he will get what he really wants. By the way, I should point out DiCaprio's brilliant actor performance. He is really great and talented actor. I can't imagine any other person who could present his character how Leo did that! I just don't understand why he doesn't have any Oskar yet.

The Aviator is a movie I would recommend to those people who appreciate film craft and Martin Scorsese's production. I don't mean other audience can't watch it. Everybody is advised to see it. You will enjoy this movie, its story, actors' performance, decorations and the way it was made.",8
3 May 2009,Kids movie,"Sorry but i was very disappointed watching this movie. I know the story of this great man called Howard Hughes and this movie doesn't tell the right story of this very special and complex character. Di Caprio is not the right man to perform this movie. There are better actors out there who could do it much better... There is a big leak in fact about the real live of Howard Hughes. The movie doesn't tell absolutely nothing about whats happening after he was test flying the plane, that he went into the Helicopter business etc, etc. This movie likes a typical Hollywood action stuff for teenagers. Scorsese, you can do much better!! I am a fan of Skorsese but this thing is not worth to watch. I hope some day somebody will make a real biography of this great man with real fact! Why the movie does not show nothing about his flight to Europe and round the world?? Instead watching how he is cleaning his hands over and over again, pissing in milk bottles, stupid nude scenes etc.. I can't understand why so many Oscars??

6 February 2018,"Good Pic, But drag on OCD scenes","I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",8
16 December 2004,Accolades to DiCapprio and Blanchett,"Just saw this on the Big Screen at the Maui Arts and Cultural Center First Light Film Festival. Can't wait to tell my friends about it. I've always known Leonardo was more than a pretty face. This guy can really act. It's about time that he receives the accolades due to him. He has paid his dues with this one. Cate Blanchett was stunning as well as convincing in her role as Kathrine Hepburn. The costumes were breath taking, the sets were impeccable in detail. Scorcesse doesn't scrimp on the budget for these elements. I found the story a little confusing in the opening scenes. It did jump around a bit but Leonardo held it together with his talent for not skipping a beat in the dialogue. With a life story as massive as Howard Hughes, it is impossible to do much of anything except skim over the highlights. One of the things a movie does is generate interest in the subject matter. It definitely does that....or I wouldn't be on this site. I saw Ray, and Jamie Foxx did an impressive impersonation. The comparison of acting vs. impersonations is evident in these two roles. Based on that theory alone, I would vote DiCaprio over Foxx. Fine line yes, and both bios are good.....I'm just glad I'm not a member of the Academy. Finding Neverland shows Friday night. That will probably put me over the top.",10

20 February 2006,It just kept missing the mark -- especially in casting the lead -- though good acting and cinematography,"Oh gosh. What can I say about this film? Will try to list my comments in order of importance as they seem to me: First, I'm sorry, because I really like DiCaprio. I do. But he just isn't right for this part. Why did they cast him in this? This ruined the film for me because there is just something about DiCaprio -- especially with his baby-face-like physicality -- that just could never ever ""scream"" Howard Hughes to me. The best way to ruin a film for me is to cast someone so wrong for the part that I can never forget throughout the entire movie, that I am watching an ACTOR. In this case, that was 3 hours of noticing I was watching acting. I couldn't help it. He was just so NOT Howard Hughes. I think the very hardest thing to cast is a role for a biopic of a non-fictional and well-known person. It's tough. When it's good it's great, and when it's not, it's just plain aggravating for the viewer. Don't get me wrong. I think DiCaprio did a fine job of acting. He was just miscast in this role. I could have bought Willem Dafoe more than DiCaprio -- and that's just pulling a name out of the top of my hat! The cinematography was excellent. There were many good actors, and a number of my favorites, in this film. And sometimes the story is interesting despite the aggravations. I liked what I learned new about Hughes, and now I want to read more about him. I know I'll get a better sense from books though! And finally, I only want to watch a 3-hour movie when it is really great. This movie didn't warrant 3 hours to me. Ghandi, yes; The Aviator, no.",6
30 April 2005,"""So, what was the point of the story?""","The first response I got from a friend after coming out of the movie was ""so what was the point of the story?"" The Aviator is exactly that statement. There is so much going on in the story, but none of them built up to a satisfying ending.

The story is too broad and the conversations too long, leaving my eyes wandering off the screen every 15 minutes, and when I come back, guess what, the plot has taken a 90 degree sharp turn into a different direction. It's like, wait! I thought it's about his courtship with Hepburn and his love for aviation, but how come now it's about his sexual infatuation with 15-year-old girls and germ phobic? Next thing you know, it's about urine in milk bottles and corrupted post war senators...

For all I care, I enjoyed the character of Hepburn (unfortunately vanished without a trace 1/3 into the story), the awesome test flights and crashes (only great paced editing), the court hearing, and the super comic moments with Ian Holm.

Overall, this movie is an hour too long, and need to be more focused on a central theme.",5

19 June 2005,Flat as a Pancake,"This movie has no emotional resonance. It is one of the flattest movies I've ever seen. None of the actors or actresses are able to establish why their characters do what they do, or why you should care. Cate Blanchett was terrible as Kate Hepburn...it was painful to watch her. Leonardo Di Caprio was like a cardboard figure throughout the movie. However I think the real weakness was the writing. How is it possible to take the biographical story of a person who led a very interesting life and make it so boring? This movie may have had some acclaim last year because last year was a very weak year for good movies, as they go.

22 June 2019,Ambivalent feeling,"The first thing, which pushed me to watch ""Aviator"" was the magificent talent to act in the moivies of the leading actor Leo De Caprio. I was amazed by retro style and amusing those days' party, but honestly I wasn't impressed so much from the first review. Then I found some interesting articles about Hughes' biography and his unique obsessed life, devoted mostly to his Hercules. Then the meaning of the movie came to me finally. After I got the whole pazzle, I still think, the movie could have been done more dramatic and impressing if it had more historic, technological, social elements of those times. I just recommend to read Hughes biography before watching ""Aviator"". Thank you.

Tadeo 38 claims Scorcese's lost something since ""Goodfellow's"" not ""Goodfella's"" did this ""Fellow"" even see Casino?????...Sorry, Dicaprio is superb he steals the show as Howard Hughes and not once did i feel that he lost the character, or did not do the film script justice. A MUST-SEE film!!!!!!

6 April 2007,"Scorsese Illuminates Hughes' Enigma, Dicaprio Grows...","This 2004 Howard Hughes biopic stands out amongst the best biographical pictures of the last 10 years. Although not as gritty and intense as Scorsese's greatest film ""Raging Bull"" (1980), this picture is well-crafted and sleek. The life and times of the enigmatic Howard Hughes make for compelling subject matter and Socorsese's effort does not disappoint.

Those of us Scorsese fans that look upon his work as commercially defiant, and nuanced towards sophisticated viewers have witnessed a gradual, relentless modifying of his technique toward a wider demographic. This evolution of Scorcese's once radical film-making style towards a more commercial, big budget approach is natural and expected given the increasing commercial success of each successive Scorsese film, (not to mention major studio desire to release the next potential Scorsese classic i.e. ""GoodFellas""). These changes in style and presentation are also closely linked to the diverse screenplays and proliferation of new A-list talent (such as Mr. DiCaprio) headlining Scorsese's pictures. Given these considerations, ""The Aviator"" still manages to showcase quite a few original Scorsese sequences recalling his raw and intensely personal early films.

Howard Hughes was a filmmaker as well as an aviator and it's no surprise that the chaotic production of Hughes first film ,1930's ""Hell's Angels"" (which Scorsese clearly admires) is chronicled in detail at the outset of the movie. We witness the continuous nervous energy and persistent drive of Hughes to achieve his daring goals, all the while breaking new ground in aviation, film and big business. This film closely tracks Hughes' personal life as well, his well-publicized affairs with famous starlets of the day such as Katherine Hepburn (played well by Cate Blanchett) are illustrated in-depth with notable performances throughout.

Leonardo DiCaprio continues to grow and develop under Scorsese's direction, and the development is phenomenal to witness. Beginning with ""Gangs Of New York"" (2002) and continuing beyond this movie (2006's masterful ""The Departed""), DiCaprio's acting chops are sharpening with each performance, eclipsing his previous work and establishing his talent amongst Hollywood's A-List actors. As the Hughes character, DiCaprio is able to captivate and compel us with flashes of OCD symptoms and manic behavior to the extreme, all the while struggling to balance these chaotic forces with his public and managerial personas. A fascinating example of this balancing act occurs when Hughes is confronted with a ruthless public relations attack, designed to coerce him into selling his airline TWA to his commercial competitor, Pan Am (whose chief, Juan Trippe is played by Alec Baldwin). Hughes collects his faculties and battles back with impressive vigor, this after nearly dying in a spectacular crash of his XF-11 spy plane prototype. All of these events unfold beautifully and the rhythm of this film holds our attention despite the nearly 3 hour running time.

""The Aviator"" holds up well on repeat viewings despite the long running time, it covers the entire first half of Hughe's remarkable life and career, and a second feature could easily be written detailing Hughes' subsequent years in Las Vegas and his premature death. All in all, DiCaprio's growth as an actor cannot be understated, this is a must see performance.",7
22 December 2006,"""There too much Howard Hughes in Howard Hughes""","And thus with the most simplistic of statements Katherine Hepburn, an Oscar rewarded though arguably over-cooked Blanchet, illustrates the inner turmoil of the films protagonist, a man whose ambition and imagination are only surpassed by his inner struggles and mental instability.

In a melancholy scene involving Hughes's mother planting the seeds of obsession in her son, Scorsese, from the get go set the tone for the emotional roller-coaster and ultimately tragedy that was the life of Howard Hughes. A story such as Hughes would lend itself greatly to melodrama, but Scorsese brilliance shines through in his ability to deal with characters as they were, real. Through the film Hughes, portrayed admirably by DiCaprio, displays characteristics of both madman and genius. In the latter half his inner conflicts influence greatly his actions, which at times seem sadistic and crazy, yet we are gently reminded that behind the rumour and myth that grew over the years, lies a human being, as vulnerable and futile as the rest of us. Within the first half of the focus is mainly on that of the lesser known ""young Howard"" whose daredevil, heart throb antics seem a million miles away from the 'insane old man of Vegas.' And with this sets one of the main themes of the movie the price and pressure of fame on those inept to cope with it, one which I'm sure has personal affiliations for the director.

Hughes as a character is dynamic, resourceful and intelligent, demonstrated early in the successful competition of the over budget and overly ambitious Hells Angels. It appear that Howard's devotion in life divides, albeit unequally, into his three passions; film-making, aviation and woman. Never able to maintain a perfect balance his obsession with the production of 'the Hercules' causes him to loose the seemingly most important person in his life, Hepburn. And yet although most of his wounds are self-inflicted Scorsese touch is so compassionate that one cannot help but draw both sorrow and inspiration from the story. Although ultimately sub-due, the films tone cannot be said to be entirely depressing. In fact one of the most appealing qualities of Howard's character is his adversity in the face of defeat. He breaks several world records, overcomes the conniving Wuan Tripp and sustains his fortunes against all odds.

If nothing else The Aviator is great story of one of Americas greatest fallen hero's, who outlived his legend. Expect the usual master class in directing from Scorsese whose passion for the subject is conveyed on screen. The acting is also adequately executed, and for once DiCaprio I think lives up to his hype, it also must be mentioned that Ian Holm steals every scene he's in.",7
24 July 2005,Howard Hughes for Dummies,"****Excellent

***Good

**Fair

*Poor

Before watching ""The Aviator"" I knew nothing about Howard Hughes. I had heard about him a couple of times, but basically knew nothing about this man. So, in a way this film was very educational. I think director Martin Scorsese did an amazing job of showcasing Howard Hughes life as a Hollywood filmmaker and Aviation pioneer. Every once in a while during the viewing of this film I felt as if I hadn't really accomplished anything in life. Hughes lived such a fascinating life compared to that of an average Joe. It is really kind of sad that his phobias got the best of him and he spend the final two decades of his life in isolation. Who knows what he could have accomplished.

As for the performances, they were all amazing. I have never really been a fan of Leo, but I was really impressed with his performance. It was amazing. And the technical team was as impressive. The production design, costumes, cinematography, editing, etc, were all at top level. And I especially loved how Scorsese played around with the color filter to resemble the colorized pictures of the time.

RATING: 4 STARS (****)",10
28 December 2004,Another Excellent Movie From Scorsese,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",10
29 January 2005,Simply Excellent !,"cant say more cant say less, this movie is excellent.

Leonardo's performance was fantastic and I think he deserves an Oscar for his performance..

there are some bits in the movie where you just want to sleep, but as a whole this movie is worth the 10 bucks you're going to spend on.

The Aviator also deserves the academy award for best picture. This is not a movie you watch at home, the picture is great, and the video capturing was wonderful.

It's about the story of Howard Hughs, a very interesting guy, who was a businessman + movie maker + aviator.

29 December 2004,The Aviator Soars,"Wondered if DiCaprio could pull off a dark, complex role ? Wondered if Scorcese would pull back from the excess and cant which almost ruined ""Gangs of New York"" ? Wondered if Howard Hughes-rake,megalomaniac and robber baron-could be made to be interesting or compelling ? Well I wondered on all 3 counts before seeing the Aviator, and am pleased to report the answer is yes on all 3 counts. It's not a perfect picture, partly because Scorcese wants to provide a big sweep: huge sets with hundreds of extras, huge ""production values"". They're fun, provide lots of useful clips for the trailer but don't add much the story. There are a few characters who make an appearance for no particular purpose such as Jude Law playing Errol Flynn. The film is at its best when it hews to its main character. At the end of the day the movie is about the inner demons of Howard Hughes, and everything else is just (very watchable) froth.

6 January 2005,As grand an entertainment as we've come to expect from Scorsese.,"Scorsese knows how to mine the neuroses of his characters and in The Aviator he has one of his richest subjects for this purpose. DiCaprio's evolving characterization from the young to the older, moustached Hughes who some of us older folks remember especially well, rightfully deserves high praise. Like so many biographies, this was not intended to be a documentary, I'm sure, but a reflection of the idiosyncrasies that made Hughes stand out like the battleships of the sky he conceived and built. Some of the other reviewers here have suggested a comparison between Scorsese's Hughes and Welles's Kane, reflecting the same kind of explicit arrogance and power, and I agree. To those comments, I would like to add that the real Hearst wrote an enduring chapter in American journalism, just as Hughes's accomplishments in the fields of aviation and, particularly notable at his death, medical research, endures for us far beyond the public image of the mentally ill reclusive. We love cinema characters overflowing with competing flaws and ideas of genius, and Scorsese has provided us with an enjoyable time in the theater and a period of long reflection afterward.

Bravo Marty, again. I don't care if The Aviator doesn't match or beat his cinematic prowess in Raging Bull or Goodfellas; I only know that in an era of such motion picture mediocrity, it's a pleasure to see the Scorsese Team delight us with great direction, superlative editing as usual from Schoonmaker, and matchless cinematography by Richardson. No other director today knows how to make such a ""complete"" film.",10
3 June 2023,The Carpetbaggers was better,"There is not one single acting performance, with the possible exception of Alan Alda's that is worth watching. The writing is an abomination and Scorsese as the director appears to have absolutely nothing left to offer us. Maybe if he had chronicled Hughes' escapades at the Desert Inn before he decided to buy as much of Las Vegas as he could we might have gotten some insight into the tycoon's behavior. Watching his mommy give him a bath while she harps on the danger he was in did not explain anything to me. There is no continuity, the actual chronology is not accurate, no explanation for the source of Hughes' genius and absolutely nothing to explain why anyone would want to work for the man. Do not waste your time unless you are doing a study of Scorsese's work. This is the place to start if you want to see talent going to waste for a big payday.

24 June 2005,One of my favourite films of 2004,"I enjoyed The Aviator and found that it provided a sympathetic perspective on a great man. Howard Hughes' obsessive-compulsive personality seemed to be both the source of his greatness as an aviation tycoon as well as somewhat of a personal liability later on. (I will never forget the repetitive hand-washing scenes.)

The movie is a rich tapestry of an excellent script, fine actors and superb photography woven together by a master director -- as a good film should be. Any further analysis seems superfluous.

The movie started off particularly strongly but dragged a little towards the end. Perhaps it was a fraction too long?

19 March 2005,Oscar for Eck,"A very good film full of technical history and mostly accurate details. Highly recommended.

If Leonardo wants an Oscar he better realize that he will never win it playing a born-rich white guy, especially when pitted against a born-dirt-poor, blind, black man. Not to deny Jamie's brilliance - he deserved that Oscar. Leonardo - if you want that Oscar, go through with the plans to do Johnny Eck. I will be the first in line at the theater and if you are nominated, I promise to actually force myself to sit through the 'Academy Awards' TV show. Good luck. To me, Eck is as heroic as Ray and Howard.

8 May 2005,sheer brilliant,"this film was just brilliant!!! I thought it was going to be horrible Leo as Howard Hughes?? thats ridiculous....but after seeing the film twice I came to the conclusion I was terribly wrong. I will own this film as soon as it comes out. the set,Scorsese was amazing, acting etc.. was just top notch..However, I do wish that they would go further into his life such as the madness near the end which i'm not quite sure if it ever happened after watching ""F For Fake."" but still in all and the las vegas casinos.But I thought that the road Scorsese took was just great aviation was a great start in fact it made me read more about aviation, and howard hughes. thanks for hearing me reading me rather...

19 February 2005,He did it his way,"Hughes did it all HIS way and look where it got him. Leo, in his best performance since Gilbert Grape, does a great job of recreating one of America's great whack jobs when he was in his prime. In Martin Scorcese's best film in more than 2 decades the fast times and tragedy are recreated amazingly well. A sure fire choice for best picture. And another note--Cate Blanchet is amazing as Kate Hepburn, under Marty's steady eye she never steals the movie but more than shows her worth. Right in the center of the film is a moment in film I will never forget. That epic one-man plane crash is one of the most stunning sights I've ever seen on film.

9 January 2005,"Just a very, very good movie","Because Scorsese is among our most acclaimed and studied directors, his work always causes people to think too much. Just relax - this is a truly good biographical film in a world of terrible biographical films. Anyone who finds it dull is a compulsive channel surfer who's probably just a few steps away from saving their urine in bottles. The picture crackles with energy and doesn't seem anywhere near as long as it is.

And you pilots and airplane geeks out there are going to totally bliss out when you see this. The five flying sequences are among the greatest ever conceived...only the most committed and experienced wingnuts among you will be able to detect any seams between the real and the digital airplanes. The aviation content is better than 95% accurate, which probably makes this a definitive airplane film, considering how wretchedly ignorant Hollywood is about anything involving technology. Oh, they've pretty much figured out the broadsword by now, but you can count on them to get anything with moving parts wrong pretty much all the time.",9

8 June 2014,Almost a masterpiece!!!,"This film by Martin Scorsese is a biopic about Howard Hughes, a man well known for his passion about movies and aviation. He is portrayed by Leonardo Di Caprio.

This is a classic theme for Scorsese, the rise and fall of the man. This one begins showing the story behind Hughes' germ phobia. After that, a grown Hughes tries to surpass all the obstacles, in order to finish an epic project. When this happens, he becomes immediately a celebrity. After that, he turns to his big love, aviation. Now famous and wealthy, he tries to innovate in this section. While this happens, his personal life becomes a mess and he makes powerful enemies. This is when he starts losing his mind.

First of all, the cast and the acting were superb. Each one of the actors was perfect for his role, Jude Law made a great appearance, Cate Blanchett was really good (she won an Oscar for this performance) and of course Di Caprio, even though I felt like he exaggerated sometimes. There were great performances by other supporting actors too, like John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin and Adam Scott.

I loved the soundtrack as well, this calming and happy music which brought me into the mood of the movie.

The direction was perfect. I've seen lots of Scorsese's movies, but this one was something else. Maybe it was the incredible visual effects and the wonderful colors that made it so good watching.

Some personal thoughts are that I don't know if Cate Blanchett and Jude Law portrayed their characters well, because I haven't seen any of their movies (yet). Also, I am tired of Di Caprio always playing the leading man in almost every movie of his (catch me if you can, inception, wolf of wall street and others).

To sum up, it was a great movie, an epic film and very close to be a masterpiece. I give it 9/10.",9
23 November 2005,"terrible film, tedious, unsympathetic, silly style, poor cgi.","felt moved to comment due the high rating that this film has.

This film is too long and seemed to be repeating the same points, in other words its directionless.

Characters are caricatured and so were hard/impossible to have an empathy for.

The styling felt forced and simplistic, adding to the films overall comic book look and after 3 hours ended up being very irritating.

The cgi, mostly the planes, seemed very obvious, even with the overall comic book styling, used apparently to hide these poor effects.

Howard Hughes' place in history was constantly being bolstered, as some sort of justification for the film as an historical document, it finished leaving me with the taste of some inept wartime propaganda film.",1
28 February 2005,Love it...,"In my opinion, The Aviator is one of the greatest films I've ever seen, comparable to The Taxi Driver, Martin Scorsese has really outdone himself. It looks as if the movie was put together of little pieces, like different news stories... It's up to audience to put together the big picture. Which I liked the best was the unpredictability of the script. It is impossible to know even what happens in 10 minutes, everything the cast says or does is a surprise. Leo does a fantastic job in the leading role, giving the perfect impression of a complex character. Also, Cate Blanchett is absolutely terrific. She shows Katherine Hepburn realistically, adding a little bit of humor. Special effects are incredible, they spice up the film but don't draw the attention from the script. The Aviator would have been perfect Oscar material, sad that the Academy felt the other way. Hopefully Scorsese makes other films and finally gets the long deserved Oscar.

12 January 2005,A very nice experience,"I tentatively went to see ""The Aviator."" I'm not really a Leonardo Di Caprio fan, not a big fan of 3-hour movies. I'm very glad I made the effort, and not because I turned around right after and sneaked into ""Meet the Fockers."" The film was shot very nice, although some suspension of belief was necessary for some shots that were very obviously ""fake-looking."" Generally, it was nothing fancy, and only a few things (like flashbulbs popping) were overdone a bit.

The performances were very enjoyable, even to the point where Kate Blanchett was every bit as annoying as Katherine Hepburn as Katherine Hepburn seemed to be in real life. Possibly a bit of overacting there. Di Caprio did an outstanding job as a younger Howard Hughes, and the scene amid the Senate testimony does not disappoint.

The story is an interesting one, and like Hughes or not, it makes me long for days when there were truly ""heroic"" men of vision like Hughes or Chuck Yeager who always sought the next dragon to slay.

You are, however, very aware of how long the movie is. It doesn't really click along. But that time is filled with entertaining material and it's difficult to really point to any one thing and say ""that should have been cut"" to shorten the flick.

I'll be buying this one the night the DVD comes out.",8
5 April 2005,All that money and so many errors,"I loved itI hated it! It was truly epic in the classic sense of film-making; no expense was spared to recreate the grandeur and lushness of the world in which Howard Hughes lived. Huge amounts of money were spent to insure historical accurateness. So what went wrong???

Anachronisms: Why would anyone in 1927 have wished for a date with Theda Bara? (Bara was at her prime between 1915 and 1919, and by 1927 she was a has-been in her early 40s!) Why would a posh nightclub feature a five year old song like ""I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise""? Why was there no washroom attendant in either lavatory scene? Did you catch the RED stop sign in the 1947 ""newsreel""? Hughes and Hepburn evidently meet in 1935, and Kate mentions that she is ""box office poison""; but this didn't come till after the making of ""Holiday"" in 1938, when she took a two-year break from making films. When Kate and Howard are dining at the Cocoanut Grove, circa 1935-36, the band plays & sings the 1930 Paul Whiteman arrangement of ""Happy Feet""! Again, after the success of the Hercules flight in 1947, the soundtrack features Glenn Miller's 1939 recording of ""Moonlight Serenade."" And did people in 1927 actually do the ""good news/bad news"" routine? (I think this originated in the 1970s.) There's more

Editing: I was totally distracted by the dish of ice cream in the ""ice cream"" scene. First Miss Domergue's hands are in her lap, and flash, there's a spoon in her hand, and flash again, it's the first view, and then back to the spoon. And when Hughes takes the dish away from her, the cherry is on top, then it's on the side, and now it's on the top again! After the Hercules flight, Hughes has one of his ""episodes,"" and assistants rush him outside. There's a great flourish as the tent door flap is drawn closed, but we look again and it's wide open. Again, there's more

Acting: A friend commented that Alec Baldwin can play no one other than Alec Baldwin. And DiCaprio is totally unconvincing as a captain of industry! He hardly ages, even though there's a 20 year time span, While the mustache adds a little age, he still has the voice and look of a boy, even though by now Hughes is in his 40s!!

By the way, what was with the blue grass and trees on the golf course?",5
12 June 2005,"A long length, but well worth it","This movie was quite long, but I was able to endure it. It was a great movie that shows the highs and lows of life. The scarlets were amazing, including: the sets, costumes, music, and flying stunts. Not your typical long bad movie. Gwen Stafani from No Doubt, looked great and didn't have a big enough role, but in any event she looked great. I thought the casting was really good from Alan Alda to Leonardo. Usually I try to avoid Leonardo DiCaprio movies like the plague, but he actually acted rather well. I hope a lot of Leo haters get to enjoy this movie, I really did. The casting of Hepburn with Cate Blanchett was right on the money. Her accent got more thick as she aged which was very realistic.

If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",10
2 January 2006,Highway Robbery at the Oscars,"The past is prologue. Leonardo DiCaprio gave a tour-de-force performance as Howard Hughes. Martin Scorcese did his best direction since Goodfellas or Casino. Yet AMPAS again refused to reward the best and the brightest. One wonders how these voters could overlook such marvelous work by a leading actor and one of our two greatest living directors. Seems like a waste of good money for the Academy to send out screeners when it is apparent that their members are not watching them. Once again we see voting based on who knows who and not who knew how. No wonder Billy Crystal and Chris Rock don't want to do the Oscars again. No wonder I don't watch them anymore.

30 December 2013,"Visually stunning, great drama, a timeless movie masterpiece.","This film has so much in it to enjoy. Scorsese is truly one of the great directors of our or any time and the way he captures the force that was Howard Hughes is truly impressive to watch. Howard Hughes was the rock star of his day and his genius and downfall are the things of legend. He soared the skies in the fastest planes, he dated the hottest starlets in Hollywood and fought against the most powerful men in the country...and won! The film focuses mostly on his earlier days when he was truly in his prime and before mental illness took away his ability to do what he was once world famous for. This is the Howard Hughes we should really remember and admire, a true visionary and a man willing to lose everything in order to accomplish feats that were thought impossible by everyone but himself. That takes guts and a pretty big pair of...well u know. Lol.

Di Caprio shines and impresses again this time as Hughes and I found myself rooting him on to fly higher and go bolder in his magnificent creations, laughing at some of the predicaments he put his right hand men in to get things done the way he needed them to be and admiring this American icon for not settling (even when it came to the steering wheel or even a rivet on one of his planes) and sticking to his vision. The movie itself is visually stunning, the acting is superb throughout and I think it captures the time where the sky was the limit and anything was possible in America. Scorsese will be remembered for many classics but this is one of his finest in my opinion and one of my favorite movies of all.",10
10 March 2006,Overrated...though that doesn't mean it's bad,"I personally clapped when Million Dollar Baby (a masterpiece) defeated the favorite (this movie) at the 77th Oscars. First of all, Scorsese's film is extremely long. After the first two hours you start to become bored and tired and lose interest in the movie. The film tries to cover too many aspects of the life of Howard Hughes.

Definitely the best thing about The Aviator are the performances. DiCaprio has been equally loved and hated with this performance. Yes, he overacts in 70% of the film, but he is playing Howard Hughes, an overacting man himself. Alda also gives us a magnificent and sober performance as the Sentaor that tries to ""defeat"" Hughes. But definitely Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn steals the movie. She is simply MAGNIFICENT in her role as one of the greatest actress ever.

Something else that truly saves the movie is the whole production design. It is simply perfect. The cinematography and art direction are very good.

Now, on to the disapproving bit. The screenplay makes us enter Hughes's mind so deeply that not even in the three hours of film you are able to exit it throughly and close the doors that the film opens. This doesn't have anything to do with the ""open ending"" the film has which is not entirely accurate.

This film reminds me of ""A Beautiful Mind"", not only because it is a biopic of an schizophrenic genius but because they are both highly overrated. This doesn't mean any of the two films are bad, just that they didn't fulfill the expectations both critics and audience had.",6
26 February 2005,"A Technical Genius, on a Technical Genius","I have been a fan of Martin Scorcese since I have been serious about film. His films are intelligent, technically brilliant, and artful. He causes us to meditate on characters we'd rather forget, or shuffle to the back of society and our minds. His movies are often tough, meaty films that take a great deal to work through. His films have never been as popular as contemporaries like Spielberg or Lucas. But he doesn't seem to mind, nor do his fans. While these other filmmakers soar to the heavens and look for the good in people, Scorcese seems to dig into the trenches, and inhabit the rough sticky worlds that inhabit the low lives of troubled men. He seems interested in why people live violent, hurtful lives. He is...well many other people have praised his work far better than I can.

I have seen every Scorcese picture in the theatre since Kundun. Each time I venture into his films I come with high expectations. I know an excellent Scorcese picture is a true treasure, something to behold and love. I was well pleased to see that the Aviator was playing here in France in version originale, or with an English language track.

Scorcese pictures are always a technical marvel. And the aviator does not disappoint in this category. In post production, he manipulated the colors of the film to mirror production scales of the time period being represented. In early scenes the colors are ""two-tone Technicolor"" then evolve into ""three-tone Technicolor"" and on to full scale color by the films end. The flight sequences are spectacularly shot. Scorcese is such a master of the technical aspects of film making that he makes even the most difficult shots look easy.

I have been a closet Leonardo DiCaprio fan for many years. It is difficult to admit this in mixed company because of the general distaste for the actor. Since Titanic drove a million adolescents wild, it seems no serious fan of the cinema can admit admiration of the actor (except for people like Steven Spielberg and Scorcese who keep putting him into their pictures). Yet, I continue to find him to be an actor of excellence. He does a marvelous job here, portraying a complex, fascinating human.

Cate Blanchett does a pitch perfect job as Katherine Hepburn, one of the many Hollywood romances of Howard Hughes. Ms Hepburn was such a caricature herself, portraying her must have taken plenty of guts. It is a fine, outstanding performance.

Many people carry only a vague notion of Howard Hughes. We know that he was quite rich, lived a glamorous, flashy life as a young man and became a maniacal hermit in his old age. Pictures of a hunched, old man with long, white hair; an unkempt beard; unclipped, yellow toenails and boxes on his feet come to mind instantly whenever Hughes' name is mentioned. This is the Howard Hughes we have become fascinated by. Yet this aspect of Hughes' life is barely dealt with in Scorcese's picture. Yes, we catch many glimpses of the demons inside him, and we even capture a few weeks of isolation, but mostly Scorcese dwells on the younger man, full of life.

Though Scorcese is often fascinated with eccentric, crazed lives, it is rare for him to give any reason for the lives of his characters. We can tell that loneliness helps to bring Travis Bickel, in Taxi Driver, over the bring. We see greed and violence begetting more violence in films such as Goodfellas and Raging Bull. But these things are only the beginnings of why they behave in such reprehensible ways. Preferring to allow his films to be questions, Scorcese never fully gives us answers. The Aviator, also, give us hints to what may have driven Howard Hughes to such madness, but it never fully explains his actions. We see hints of a protective mother, and surely his drive to control every aspect of his life helped him become obsessive compulsive. Yet these things are not answers, more symptoms to the overall problem. Scorcese is more interested in the behavior of his characters. The nuances of their actions, and the subsequent damage it causes. You won't find cookie cutters to make you feel better about life in this film, but you'll find a meditation on a brilliant, troubled man. If you care to dig a little deeper, you might be moved.",8
25 February 2007,Worst movie I've ever seen,"I am blown away by people's fascination with this movie. I have tried several times to watch it. It is boring boring boring...I just can't keep watching it. It's like watching paint dry. I don't know what it is...I like the actors and enjoy watching a few parts,(like Hepburn scenes), but I could care less about the story and never become involved in it. Besides they left out so much and never really showed what a seedy character and womanizer he was. When I first heard they made this movie I wondered why anyone would want to watch a story about a nutcase billionaire and his escapades. I mean like, I hate movies where I already know the ending. So I guess I was prejudiced from the start. Hughes was brilliant in many ways , but he was also a self indulgent bore who racist and paranoid of communism and ruined a good many people's lives in Hollywood because of it. I hate the way Hollywood romanticizes these real life characters and makes them something they are not. I also don't see where Decaprio did such an ""awesome"" job. He was too young for one thing.

6 May 2007,glamorous Bio of Texas tycoon and his lady loves,"i was only interested in 'the aviator' because of Cate Blanchett. that woman could plug her nose and read the phone book and i'd listen with total undivided attention.

but besides her uncanny Kate Hepburn, i've grown to love Kate Beckinsale's Ava Gardner. she's not as ripe as the real deal but she manages to work up some steam in a lot of her scenes. and although there is still something about Howard Hughes that makes me think George Clooney, i can handle Di Caprio in the lead. but, Blanchett just wipes him off the screen with her performance.

i wish that the screenwriter hadn't played so fast and loose with facts because a lot of the film doesn't really make historical sense. but as long as Cate is on the screen, i'll watch it--really i will!

12 February 2005,Scorsese doesn't disappoint,"The tagline proudly exclaims, ""Some men dream of the future. He built it."" It is not a lie. The name Howard Hughes is one probably known best by older generations, but the new biopic from Martin Scorsese (Taxi Driver, Goodfellas) may change all that. Clocking in at nearly three hours, not a minute is wasted as the admittedly quite amazing and very vivid life of Hughes is explored, both in the most public of his accomplishments and the most personal of his demons. Reminiscent of another famous biopic, Citizen Kane, it begins with Hughes as a boy, being warned of germs by his mother. His obsessive-compulsive disorder and phobia of germs would later take a much more central role in his life as he would grow.

Then, the story jumps right into the production of Hell's Angels. Only 21, the already rich Hughes (his father was an inventor) is directing his first film, a World War I epic. At one point, in order to get the camera shots he wants, dozens of fighter planes are whisked off into the air, with Hughes in one. It is the first aerial sequence of the film, and as Hughes stands up with his portable camera in hand in his flying vintage plane, a love for both aviation and film-making is evident, and it is a great ode to not only Howard Hughes but to all those who will risk everything for what they love to do. It is also Scorsese winking at his own heroes, and perhaps his own generation, too.

The film spans from the roaring 20s to the war torn 40s, and each age is recounted in vivid detail. The 20s in are particularly amazing, as singers croon to vast crowds of bygone partiers and Hollywood elite. It is almost as if the film were an actual time-capsule, capturing images that are not only recreated but authentic. Still, the story never becomes bogged down by the huge budget or grand visuals, and Hughes life only becomes more complex as the film continues. It is only in the last hour, really, that the film stumbles at all, as The Aviator ventures into the already much traveled territory of a biopic: the court battle. Here, lead by an appropriately repulsive Alan Alda as Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, Hughes is attacked by a corrupt system for, ironically, charges of corruption.

That's not to say any interest is lost, though, and if the greatest complaint of a film is that it is only the best at something that has been done before rather than good at something startling new, then it is not too severe of a complaint at all. In fact, some of what transpires within these hearings is enough to inspire an urge to find the actual old news reels of the genuine Howard Hughes hearings and to see every last detail of what was actually said. That is a great strength of the film overall, as everything it shows is just enough to give depth to the human character of Hughes while also enough to beckon one to seek out more long after the film is over. Hughes is a fascinating person, really, framed by a fascinating movie.",8
23 July 2023,Classic showdown between a corrupt Senator and an American Icon,"This epic had a lot of ground to cover raising issues about Howard Hughes sanity and grounding as an Aviator and as an entrepreneur. The Senate hearing in which Howard Hughes takes the Senator Brewster to task is worth the price of admission and makes one want to know what happened at that hearing.

I was compelled to look at the actual history. DiCaprio did such a great job, as far as I was concerned, he should have earned an Oscar for that confrontation. It was, for me, the most memorable thing about the entire movie. I enjoyed it immensely.

The other portrayals were proper vehicles for the actors involved.

I liked both ""K(C)ates"" (Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn and Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardener). Both Alan Alda as Senator Brewster and Alec Baldwin as Juan Tripp did yeoman's work.

Director Scorsese deserved an Oscar for making Howard Hughes understandable as a person. Again, the congressional hearing was the centerpiece for me.",9
8 January 2005,The good news is Martin Scorsese's 3 hour film is visually spectacular and completely engrossing from start (almost) to finish.,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",6
17 June 2023,"Another Scorsese classic, a must must see","Scorsese is a master filmmaker, once again however this never got the awards it clearly deserved, story, really a bio of Howard Hughes, the billionaire excentric ,tells his obsession with flying and possibly dementia, how much is true, who knows before my time, director created a real step back in time he is a genius film maker, two stand out performances, the ridiculously talented Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn, just fantastic, but its one mans movie, that's Leo, take a bow, absolute joke he didn't win the Oscar, great acting all round, only strange casting is the choice to play Jean Harlow, Gwen staffani is an odd one, thankfully she has a small part, but even if you don't know who Hughes is, this is a must see.

26 December 2004,It worked for me,"This movie was more than I expected, particularly from Lenonardo DiCaprio. It's taken me a while to warm to him as a serious actor in adult roles but I think he's grown a lot in the past few years. I thought he inhabited Hughes' character quite well but that may be because I don't expect actors in biopics to do impersonations. Impersonation is what some people do if they can't act. An even better example is Cate Blanchett's Katharine Hepburn. I think she nailed the character squarely but perhaps some people might disagree because they've been numbed by Martin Short's palsy voiced rendition.

Interesting to note that this is Martin Scorsese's first FX heavy movie so I'll gladly overlook a few technical gaffes (sorry, but I'm an aviation buff) but I'm glad to see that the effects didn't overwhelm the characters.

I was impress Dicaprio was at his best one of the great one of the year, I thought nobody could clime next to Jamie Fox for the movie ray, but Dicaprio is a sure contentment for Oscar this year, this film has a great flow it keep's your interest through out and don't disappoint, the story is well pace, very well filmed, the play of actors is excellent and Kate Blanchette play'a very convincing Kathrine Hepperne, Matin Scorsese pull off an other great film a must see, for fan of well made and strong performance film it's a must see movie.

7 March 2005,Soars on Psychosis but Fails Elsewhere,"The dichotomy of Howard Hughes' spectacular rise and epic fall has fueled sermons, books, plays and even an opera. Artists, academics and theologians have found all manner of signs and omens in his story. The Aviator chucks most of this in favor of a glamorous psychiatric case study. You could say The Aviator is A Beautiful Mind gone Hollywood without Mind's inspirational spine. In fact the greatest strength of The Aviator is the tale of Hughes epic struggle for his sanity. When the movie meanders to other concerns, such as his Hollywood dalliances or his business struggles, it loses focus.

The Aviator assumes the audience has a familiarity with Hughes and his world. If you don't know he died a wizened gargoyle after years of madness and seclusion much of the impact of the movie will be lost to you. The Aviator follows Hughes' life from the late 1920's to the 1940's from the start of his production career and ending with the first and only flight of the Spruce Goose. Director Martin Scorsese stops short of showing us the wreckage of Hughes' final years to let our collective knowledge add the requisite shadow over the glamorous proceedings of the film.

The Aviator is hampered by bad casting choices starting with Leonardo DiCaprio as Hughes. DiCaprio is a gifted actor and he does a splendid job suggesting Hughes' genius and creeping madness. However DiCaprio cannot summon the weight or authority needed to play the ruthless tycoon Hughes becomes. His scenes in front of a Senate sub-committee are particularly bad. He comes across like a sophomore sassing the dean. Cate Blanchett, as Katharine Hepburn, fares worse. Her resemblance to Hepburn is minimal at best and she does not begin to approximate Hepburn's vocal rhythms. While Blanchett gets better towards the end when she all but drops Hepburn's mannerisms, in total her performance was distracting. The actors in less recognizable roles fare better. Particular standouts were John C. Reilly as Hughes' long suffering factotum and Ian Holm as a beleaguered meteorology professor.

Hughes' business rivals are portrayed as outright villains, which is indicative of the curious take the film has on Hughes' career. The Aviator posits the incredibly rich and autocratic Hughes as a proletarian rebel who takes on ""The System"" and beats it by being brilliant, brave and handsome. We even have a scene where Hughes, after spending millions like water, lectures Hepburn's eccentrically aristocratic family on the value of money to those who have none. While it strains credulity to hear the future darling of the Nixon administration wax Marxist, the shocked look on the horrible Hepburns is undeniably satisfying.

The Aviator is one of those films best appreciated on the big screen. It is an absolutely gorgeous movie. The flying scenes in particular are spectacular and the crashes horrific enough to make us understand their effect on the already unstable Hughes. While The Aviator may not be on par with the best of Scorsese, the power of Hughes' tragedy is exceptionally well delivered and serves to drive the movie through its occasional doldrums.",8

9 January 2005,In a virtual drought of good movies for 2004---this is the best I've seen this year!,"It is always a difficult thing to film a biography without beatifying the subject. In this movie, Scorcese shows us the Howard Hughes, the charmer, the Hollywood maverick, the Aviator. He also shows the demons that haunted and eventually possessed this great maverick! What Hughes accomplished was only overshadowed by what he could have been if he were able to control his neurosis that eventually overwhelmed him. I thought Leonardo gave one of his finest performances of his young career. The Aviator is a case study of one of the 20th Centuries most influential and most powerful men in this country. It also provides a snapshot into his personal life that shows him as a Hollywood playboy and publicity hound, but only to eventually promote his beloved Hughes Air/TWA. But, it truly conveys his real passion for flying and aviation. I strongly recommend this film as one of the better films of the year...if not the best, that I have personally seen! Its a little longish so don't drink too much soda.

Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",10
21 December 2004,a masterpiece,"I had the luck of look the movie in New York previous Friday, and I will say to them what i see: the work cinematographic summit of Scorsese, on her all the cinematographic techniques are based that we know the

power: depth of field high, slow motion, travelings, itched, filters,great angle, all combined it to cast efficient, but one cinematographer magnificent, jointly with a design of exemplary production.The movie deals with on the fall imminent ascent and a tycoon, but not one anyone: Howard Hughes, but is not left the thing, the film there, gives indications us, it shows to us with

because and as an ambition can or it cannot get to be fulfilled, but that this life is worth to live it to obtain it, more still if these objectives are difficult or almost impossible, it is this small detail that the tape deserves to be appreciated and by it his admired director.

12 February 2005,Scorsese homages Old Hollywood and DiCaprio is recognized at last,"OK,this movie is not a masterpiece,but i can't see the reasons many people give to dislike this movie.Its length??The usual length of all Scorsese's movies.The character identification with the audience??I've never was identified with Travis Bickle or Jake Lamotta.The movie is perfect in every single shot.The editing,the scenes design,all is really perfect.Howard Hughes was a spoiled rich man that defied the great American power(Scorsese criticizes again the American corruption beyond the eyes of an outsider and extravagant rich man).Cate Blanchett is perfect as Katharine Hepburn.At the beginning of the movie i was terrified (i thought his performance was going to be caricaturesque) but at the end i understood the kindness and the nerve of the greatest of all the Hollywood stars in Blanchet's face.Leonardo DiCaprio was a child phenomenon;an underrated actor because people ignores his first movies(This Boy's Life ,What's Eating Gilbert Grape? ,or his Rimbaud portrayal in Total Ecplise) in which he did everything (drug addict, revolutionary and evil poet, mentally retarded ,etc...).With the fame of this movie and his second Oscar nomination,the Titanic stigma disappear at last.No one could deny that his the great actor of his generation.(and better than Pitt ,Cruise and the rest of the pretty boys(except,may be,Johnny Depp or Ewan McGregor whom are great actors).I'm glad for Leo.Scorsese homages Old Hollywood style with nerve and precision:Citizen Kane,The Philadelphia Story(Hepburn's family), Bringing up Baby or his own Raging Bull are revisited in this film. This movie is entertaining and original.It tells the story of a man and his own demons inside of him.May it's a very long movie (a few minutes less and it would be a masterpiece) ,but is a movie that will achieve greatness with the passage of time.I'm sure of that.",8
24 July 2009,modern day classic written all over it,"Can a biographic keep you entertained for 2 hrs and 45 minutes? Can Leonardo Di Caprio make a convincing performance of Howard Hughes? Yes to both of those questions. I'm sure most people know the story of Howard Hughes- I didn't know much about it at all, but no knowledge is needed to know about him. The scenes are amazing, using the most of its budget to give you the biggest bang ever. The acting is spot- on, especially with Cate Blancett as Katherine Hepburn. The accents, surprisingly, are not annoying and spot on. All I can say is see it- because you won't be disappointed. The soundtrack is fabulous, with brilliant costumes and giving you a brilliant film that feels like a classic, and will make you satisfied. 2 hrs and 45 minutes has never been more entertaining.

16 December 2004,answers the answers not the questions,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle.

9 June 2005,Feels just like a biography...,"Dull, flat and long ! What's the point of having a 3 hours movie on this guy if there's nothing new or fun that you can bring on the screen... any curiosity, thoughts, philosophy of life, memories, quotes? No.. scorcese an't got such of those things. Is the strict story of this guy's life enough to make you stick on the couch or that cinema chair ? Is the good but cold and frigid performances of Dicaprio and other's enough to make you rent this never ending film ? NO really, believe me! And well, i'd say dOn't waste your time on watching this, go play outdoors, play scrabble or cook something good! Really, maybe it's pure subjectivity here but for me this film was a pain in the...

4 January 2005,Very Worthwhile Movie,"I mostly disagree with Peter-991's review of this movie. The Aviator was very good and well-acted and I do not think Leonardo DiCaprio was miscast at all; on the contrary, I thought he gave one of his best performances and may very well be on his way to an Academy Award for Best Actor. Howard Hughes is a complex and enigmatic character who must have been exceedingly difficult to portray. And one must remember that this film covers the early years of his life, so if the resemblance to Hughes doesn't kick in until the Senate hearings (with the mustache, etc...) then perhaps that's why. Also, the scene at the beginning with is mother was gross but very necessary to the plot. This shows the very foundation for his mental illness and the way she warped his mind against illness and germs through her dialog with him. I agree that Cate Blanchett was very effective as Katharine Hepburn and probably also deserves a Best Supporting Actress nod. However, I felt that Alan Alda, while good in the role, was simply being Hawkeye as an old man. I would recommend this movie as a very compelling look at a man who was brilliant yet also had some very heavy issues in his life.",8
11 September 2005,look at the Oscars...,"The best summary for this film can be provided by the prizes it won: lots and lots (editing, cinematography, costumes, even acting), but not for the best picture. Really, looking at it I continuously had the impression of grandeur, greatness, and that the director, the actors, the crew had made a terrific work... but for what? To narrate the life of a movie producer, billionaire, hypochondriac aviator, whom we have no reason to like. Surely Di Caprio is a great guy, and mesmerising probably for many, and so we end up liking the figure of Howard Hughes; but I think that the emptiness of this character *is* Di Caprio's ability to make us like him.

Perhaps this film is just like Hughes' life: a great effort, put down with enormous ability, to build nothing. So, 7 out of 10 for me.

A little curiosity: it seems to me the second role for Di Caprio dealing with Pan Am, the first being ""Catch me if you can"".",7
11 February 2005,Just Grand!,"This is movie-making the old-fashioned way. Characters are really fleshed out and every moment is eventful and meaningful. I don't know where a fellow IMDb commentator is coming from when he describes the movie as boring (too long) and Howard Hughes as psychopathic. That is just rubbish! The movie is only boring for people with no imagination and high attention deficit. If Hughes was psychopathic so also were many of the great figures in history. They paid for their greatness with their sufferings and eventual self destruction. We do not understand the source of genius, so we conveniently attribute it to being driven by ""demons"" or ""psychopathy"". I recommend that we take a different approach. Simply see the movie and marvel at some piece of wonderful acting and story-telling that is involving and just pure delight. At the same time, get to know a great American, Howard Hughes.

12 February 2005,This one flies high,"Howard Hughes was an enigmatic almost mystical flying genius and tycoon, and Scorcese's film gives us a sweeping portrait of the man in all his various sides. This is truly one of the best films I've seen this year. I have always thought that Leonardo DiCapprio, despite his popularity and plethora of unusual roles, has always been underestimated as an actor, and here he portrays Hughes' complex personality with all its intrigue and intensity. The Oscar nominations (final vote not decided at this writing) are all well deserved. The movie is episodic, and my girlfriend would have liked to see more historical context in some of the scenarios. We left wondering at what Hughes, despite his serious mental illness, was able to accomplish, and how much more he might have done had modern treatment been available.

22 February 2005,"Good, but not great, and certainly not Oscar material","I went to see this movie Saturday, and while it's good, it's not great and certainly not worth all the fuss being made over it. Ebert & Roeper oooohhhed and aaaaaahed over the crash scene, which certainly gave you a good perspective, however it was not at all realistic: a plane would not simply fly along straight while a wing on one side slices through a house. It might slice for a little bit, but only until the drag pulled the fuselage into the house demolishing both the plane and the house.

The special effects, while outstanding for say, 5-10 years ago, are mediocre at best these days, particularly golfing: the ball looked like the golf ball in the game in the movie Outland, floating along rather than a realistic arc. The water was done better in Titanic, and while it was probably done as a ""stylistic"" choice, at times the movie looks like a B&W film badly colorized. No thanks.

As far as the acting goes, it was pretty good, save that I don't understand the Oscar nomination for Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Katherine Hepburn, who must be rolling in her grave at the caricature here.

Leonardo does do a good job playing Howard Hughes, but the script is a little disjointed and the movie, albeit long already, ends before it really shows just how far Howard fell before the end.

In the end, I recommend seeing it, but only at economy hour.",7
13 December 2011,The Aviator Review.,"The Aviator is a true story based on the life of billionaire aviator and film producer, Howard Hughes. In my opinion, Leonardo DiCaprio was perfect for the role are Hughes because DiCaprio not only had experience in playing 'real life' people before as he played Frank Abagnale Jr in 'Catch Me If You Can' but because he clearly understands what type of character the director Martin Scorsese wanted. DiCaprio really demonstrated a perfect example of someone Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, so well in fact that it earned him his second Oscar Nomination in 2004. Also stellar performances by Cate Blanchette who won the Oscar that year as the beautiful actress Katharine Hepburn. I was very impressed with her in this movie as she was so flawlessly realistic with her characters personality. I was also very impressed with Alan Alda's honest performance; he also received an Oscar nomination. Over all, this film leaves you with a sighing wow. It's a love story as much as it is dramatic and painful. It has great make up, costumes and special effects. It really makes you feel like you are experiencing life in the 1930's.

16 July 2005,So close...,"Scorsese for me has always been one of those directors capable of bringing together actors of all different backgrounds and character and working them into a story effortlessly. His grasp of direction is usually flawless, artistic but always controlled. Yet he has never, again for me, produced a single piece of work I would call complete despite some fantastic performances from various actors.

This is yet another in the long list of 'so close'.

The film is good, great by many standards. But the story is weak, even if the central character is engrossing (and Di Caprio - who hasn't had a good role since Gilbert Grape - shows at last some of his talent by giving a great performance) and the supporting cast so strong. It just isn't carried anywhere (few biopics ever are though, ""Chaplin"" really is the only one that springs to mind).

I do recommend it, I rate it highly enough to give it a 7 and the closing half an hour is great - but there's no ending to speak of.",7
5 January 2005,"Howard Hughes, from reckless to recluse","When I heard that Leonardo Di Caprio had been chosen to play Howard Hughes, I couldn't see him in the role. But now, having seen ""The Aviator"", I understand why the baby-faced, perennially young actor got the nod. ""The Aviator"" illustrates the time-worn maxim that the child is father to the man, and Leonardo's looks help to convey this. One particular shot shows just how vulnerable and in need of protection a grown man can be. Apart from his facial features, Di Caprio's acting communicates Hughes' childlike sense of wonder and excitement, and his equally childlike dependency on the maternal figures in his life.

Cate Blanchett plays one of these pivotal women, the late great Kate Hepburn. Once again, I was skeptical that Blanchett could capture Ms. Hepburn's speech, looks, and mannerisms. I am delighted to report that, by and large, she succeeds marvelously, and without being a caricature of the immortal actress. Most of the time, with few lapses, Blanchett echoes the lilt of Kate's speech and the tilt of her chin. The mouth and chin are Kate's all right, the nose somewhat less so, the eyes not at all. (Note to makeup department: Blanchett's hair is all wrong. When it is short, it does not mirror the butch haircut Hepburn sported in ""Sylvia Scarlett"". When it is worn longer, it seems rather too long.) Di Caprio and Blanchett are the luminaries among the cast, but the rest of the firmament is star-studded as well. Kate Beckinsale portrays Ava Gardner as a brisk and capable woman, able to bring Hughes back from the brink of his spiral downward into madness. (I must admit, however, that until I saw her name in the credits, I was positive the actress was Eva Longoria from ""Desperate Housewives""). Alan Alda is equally commendable as a senator from Maine, although I have trouble believing Hughes could have cowed a Senate hearing as Di Caprio does.

But there is another bright star in this film: the script. There is no denying that the cast performs with energy and verve, but it is clear that the script of ""The Aviator"" gives them wings. The script makes it clear, for instance, that Hughes was a math whiz as well as a technical genius. The opening sequence speaks volumes about the relationship Hughes had with his mother, which colors and sets the tone for the rest of the story. And the scene where Hughes meets Hepburn's family -- a formidable collection of intellectual snobs and parlor pinks -- provides a telling counterpoint to Hughes' success as a self-taught, self-made man.

Howard Hughes may have ended his life as a wing nut with a screw loose, but ""The Aviator"" is as sleek and streamlined as his Constellation aircraft, soaring high into the stratosphere, with nary a crash and burn.",8

I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",9
28 December 2004,Great Movie,"Despite other reviews on this website, I found The Aviator to be quite enjoyable. This is definitely a new style for Scorsese, at least it seemed so to me, and I thought he was very successful. DiCaprio's performance is really spot on and I really thought I saw Howard Hughes in all his eccentricities shine through. Cate Blanchett as Ms. O'Hara gave an incredible performance as well (surprise, surprise). She's quite stunning as the famous actress and explodes off the screen. Throughout the film we really get an inside look into the life, lunacy, and megalomania that is Howard Hughes, and I found Scorsese to be very successful. Two thumbs up.

27 February 2005,"Good, but a little too long","I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence.

30 December 2004,Best film of 2004,"I was definitely no fan of Leo, but he played Howard Hughes SO well in ""The aviator"" that he made me really rethink my opinion of him. He really captured the way Hughes lived and the way his personality changed over time. I am an aviation enthusiast as well and I can attest to the accuracy of the aviation aspects of the film. Each actor played the real life character they were acting as to a tee. They all deserve Oscars in my opinion. I think this is the film Martan will finally get the Oscar for. A great film and a must see for everyone who reads this. Get to the movies to see this, you won't regret it. The more of you that go to this film, the more money it makes and the better chance it stands of getting the awards it deserves.

5 March 2005,Psychogram of American society fails to offer the correct diagnosis,"The Aviator is an impressive piece of cinema, and shows Scorcese pulling out all the stops in terms of cinematic technique. The film is lush, glossy, glamorous, but beneath this shiny carapace lies a completely different inner reality. Scorcese's earlier work anatomised the darker side of the American metropolis through the broken lives the individuals obliged to live in the belly of the beast. In The Aviator, he takes the life of Howard Hughes in all its technicolour pain and glamour, and offers it up as an iconic portrait of those twin-born wraiths, the American dream and the American nightmare.

Hughes suffered from an extreme form of OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder), a condition which expressed itself in various forms, such as repeatedly washing his hands, being terrified of dirt, and being haunted by horrific thoughts which would occupy his mind for days and weeks at a time. Equally, he was a man of incredible energy, who got what he wanted, and succeeded where better-adjusted individuals would have failed to make headway. It seems to me that the film therefore suggests that the boundless drive to succeed and to win are themselves akin to other forms of mental illness. What surprised me was that the nature of Hughes' illness was not mentioned in the credits. I am sure that there will have been people in the audience who also suffer from OCD, whether they know it or not; explaining that the condition is now better understood and treatable would have been a thoughtful gesture on the part of the director.

Despite this reservation I would say that the film is a fine one, in large part thanks to the excellent performances by Cate Blanchett and Alec Baldwin, though Leo di C. also turns in a respectable effort.",8
7 January 2005,Pretty darn good...,"The movie in general was awesome. As a whole it comes together very well. As far as individual aspects of the film things could of been done better.

The parts played by Mr Leo and Ms. Kate could of been more convincing. Ms. Kate's performance seemed like a caricature of Ms Hepburn while Mr Leo's performance seemed a bit shallow, hallow, or mellodramatic. Towards the middle of the film those aspects of their performance seems to melt away to let the story take hold.

The musical score did not reflect upon the film very well. One could almost not have music in the film and not notice there wan not any music. All in all though the film was worth seeing and when it makes it to DVD would be worth buying or renting.

19 November 2022,This movie is boring like watching paint drying.,"Watching this movie is boring torture, directed by Martin Scorsese (2004). Maybe the worst performance of Leonardo Di Caprio also, and i love Leo. Movie premieres in 2004. In same year was premiered much better movies. The film shows Hughes' life from the end of the 1920s to the 1940s. Hughes is acting by Leonardo DiCaprio. I have gave 3 changes to this boring movie and every time this movie failed to deliver. First time i fell asleep in movie theater in 2004. 2nd time i rented this movie and bored after 45 minutes and fell asleep. 3rd time i saw it on cable tv and had to change channel after 50 minutes because movie was boring as watching paint drying. Maybe just Hughes lived so boring life or movie script writers did not fully understand what they were doing. The end result is just boring and time wasting. I give this movie: D-

7 February 2005,"A sad, but true story of a great genius","Great idea, this, and fairly well executed, but the movie can't seem to make up it's mind about which way to go. Action, drama, psychological drama, storytelling or whatever... di Caprio performs OK, but he is not credible when he's supposed to depict the then 40-tears old Hughes, and no matter what the make-up dept. did to him, he still looks 23. Kate Blanchett and Alan Alda deliver outstanding performances, as does Matt Ross, and also Alec Baldwin does a better-than-average job. Plane crash sequences doesn't work well (most air scenes do, however), and the movie stops just as things get interesting. Many weird camera angles and abrupt cuts, and also quite a few tricks borrowed from Orson Welles (who performed them infinitely better). Not all computer animation works properly, and somehow, this movie is thoroughly clean. True, clean Hollywood scenery, sunsets, beaches, houses, etc. Even the blood and dirt in crash scene looks clean, and everything looks like a cake with too much icing. It just doesn't feel right.

Not quite a complete waste of time, but close.",2

27 February 2005,waste of time,"It's such an awful movie.

Shame on Martin Scorcesse. Too long. Too boring. No interesting. As I said a waste of time. I could't stand staying in front of the screen. Well its a really good movie to proactive sitting positions, as you have nothing to see on the screen. Don't see it, save yourself. I didn't like it at all. I don't know how could it be so popular in USA. Here in Argentina the movie is not a great thing at all. No friend o' mine liked it. Not even my girlfriend who loves Knightstale and Leonardo Di Caprio. Please vote wisely. Vote 1. Don't spill your vote. You know what you have to do.

7 April 2020,Ridiculous,"What an absolutely terrible movie. I now know why I never had a desire to watch this. Leos acting is something of an autistic moron with the best luck in the damn world. Why does hollywood let this senile Scorsese direct movies. Watching this entire film is most certainly an exercise in mental endurance. I seen an inmate hurl a cup of his own feces at his cell wall and found that more captivating than this film. Just awful.

13 June 2005,"An imperfect movie, but genuinely touching nonetheless","Prior to seeing this film, I noticed that general opinion was generally, but certainly not unanimously positive, so that put me on the skeptical side of things as I think a lot of biopic films seem to have a tendency to get the benefit of the doubt from critics. Add to that big name directors and stars, and I felt the makings of a drippy period piece set to abuse its poetic license.

But my skepticism, I feel, was misplaced. Most negative reviews focus of flaws in the narrative or deviations from the traditional plot arcs we've come to expect and appreciate in films. It's also been said that a familiarity with Howard Hughes' life is necessary to get any depth from the film. I think these criticisms distract from what the movie seems to be trying to achieve. While I do agree that the plot can seem disjointed, the running time of 170 minutes is quite a temporal investment, and yes: the brief scene of Hughes' childhood that opens the film before a dizzying fast forward to him as a young adult feels gratuitous and tacked on, there really was something in DiCaprio's performance and Scorsese's attitude towards his protagonist was genuinely touching in a way that lacked sappy, typical (and dare I say, Spielbergesque) manipulative feel of other films.

Here's the place from which I'm approaching the film: I am a pilot, for personal recreation only, who can relate to Howard Hughes' passion for the sky. Yet, I didn't see this film until recently because frankly, I couldn't have cared less about his biography. I simply knew he was crazy, built and flew the Spruce Goose, and was a partial inspiration for Mr. Burns on the Simpsons. But after watching The Aviator, I had a new appreciation for Mr. Hughes that really grew later on in the film, as I felt it more and more difficult to watch. Scorsese clearly feels a respect and pity for the man, which we -- the audience -- feel too. I went from a disinterested movie buff to someone who felt a lump in his throat over the real-life tragedy that was Howard Hughes.

Hughes was suffering from what we all know today to be Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). As the scenes of his successes become progressively more inter-cut with scenes of the very real symptoms of this disease, I found my heart breaking for Howard as a condition beyond his control and medical understanding (at the time) destroyed all that his genius and charisma had built. At one point later on in the film, Hughes is close to rock bottom in the darkness of his illness and at a very problematic time: He is to confront the senate on allegations fabricated by his competition attempting to wipe him out. An old flame, long disheartened by his descent into madness, arrives to help make him presentable to the public. Afterwards, the woman is hopelessly asked by Howard, having long been in a relationship with another man, to marry Hughes. Of course she refuses, and it doesn't come across that Hughes had high hopes for such a prospect anyway, but I think I understood the essence of who this Aviator was, and what Scorsese was trying to tell us about him. Perhaps what Hughes simply needed, perhaps what he lacked, was just someone to take care of him. Being afflicted with syphilis early in his life (which has neurological consequences later on) and possibly suffering head trauma from a plane crash he barely survived, Hughes was a genius with a severe handicap, and maybe his demise wouldn't have been as it was if he had just had help.

Unfortunately, the true story is that psychiatry didn't know how to treat such conditions at the time, and people were naturally too weirded out by the manifestations of his disease to be of any true help to him. Hughes is a tragic character, and I commend Scorsese for drawing me into the history of the man to appreciate his genius and mourn his circumstances.

Artistically, cinematic ally, and narratively, this movie is no knock-out. But what a journey it was, and a genuinely heart-felt one at that, into the world of a great American at the mercy of his demons. It's not Raging Bull, it's not a classic for the ages, but I believe it accomplishes precisely what it set out to do: Reveal the humanity of a man that the late stages of disease had previously reduced to a caricature.",9
6 March 2005,Very good but it's not that type of movies I like,"OK, I like Martin Scorsese's movies and I very much respect his work at all. I saw 'The Aviator' last night. Here is the place where I must admit that I don't like history and I am totally unaware of Howard Hughes's biography or any facts about him. In fact (it could sound like a joke to someone but...) I first heard and found out about that name (Howard Hughes) from this movie. So I can't tell whether this is close to the history or not.

I liked the directing and especially the acting. I don't like DiCaprio very much but I must admit that he is an awful good actor. Scorsese did a great job. I'm a big aviation lover and I enjoyed the flight scenes.

However it's not the type of movies I like. That's why I've seen it only once.

24 January 2005,Should have been called The Sh*tiator,"This was a terrible film, probably one of the worst to come out this year (although that's not saying a whole lot). I thought DiCaprio looked like a scared 10 year old boy pretending to be an obsessive compulsive retarded chimpanzee. I don't know what Scorcese was thinking...why did it have to be 3 f**king hours long!!! I wanted to vomit all over myself. The fact that he had to rely on cheap computer graphics made the whole film seem cheesy and fake. This only confirms my theory that Scorcese has outlived his glory days, and will spend the rest of his film-making days trying to make epic over-inflated, under inspired pictures that fall horribly short. Even as a fan of aviation I was not very interested in watching the movie because I was so disgusted. I thought the urine in the milk bottles was a bit funny though.

22 January 2005,An excellent movie that is well worth seeing,"A brief opening scene of his childhood offers a somewhat implausible explanation of why the brilliant Howard Hughes became the broken wreck he is likely to be better known as by todays generation.

DeCaprio does a first class job of portraying Hughes both as the aggressive tycoon and as the pathetic recluse he eventually became.This film is a cameo of the years when Hughes was at his peak and for me at least made me want to know much more about this complex man.

Kate Blanchett's performance as Kathleen Hepburn is one of her best recently, and although there have been some adverse comments about the length of the film I have to agree with one patron who said to me as I was leaving:- ""I could have watched it all night"".

21 June 2016,Falls short on realism,"The acting and music were impeccable. DiCaprio made a convincing Hughes despite his differing stature/figure to the tall lanky gentleman. DiCaprio's stellar acting ability was repeated as well by the other players, including Alan Alda and Brent Spiner.

Historical facts may or may not bear out the movie. It was said in many books Hughes hated Black People because of a Houston riot when he was a boy. Whether he hated Houston, as alleged in the script, was very questionable also, referring to Houston as a ""disease infested swamp"" (or words to effect). Besides, if he hated Houston as much as inferred in this film, why would he have returned to Houston in 1976 having a renal failure which killed him? Why not return to LA? After all he was in Mexico during the emergency. True, the climate of Southern California is a popular preference to most places in the world, but it is unnecessary to do a put down on the desirability of anyplace by Hollywood, because of seemingly contemporary politics or whatever, of this day. I have doubts this same script would have appeared during the administration of Ann Richards as the Texas Governor in the 1990s.

I have a complaint about over-dependence on CGI, something other reviewers on many films of late are making ""cartoon"" references to, telling complaints about directors who sacrifice the real thing for CGI. The whole drift toward dependency on CGI is fine for Star Wars, but is is utterly silly to substitute CGI for real props (pardon the pun) when the real things are available. It ruined what could have been a stellar ""Aviator"", IMHO. Case in point: Director Scorsese's film enlisted the appearance of a genuine living, airworthy, Lockheed 1049G Constellation wearing, of all things, TWA livery. This airplane was flown all the way from Kansas City to Burbank, restored to perfect flying order, only to be replicated a half dozen times on a tarmac as the big plane for the budding TWA. Isn't CGI great? No flying scenes were taken with that rare living airplane at all...NONE. I was pretty shocked This was a TERRIBLE loss indeed.",
19 June 2005,DiCaprio's performance makes the movie!,"Director Martin Scorsese's latest film, ""The Aviator,"" is a biopic on billionaire Howard Hughes. In this film, Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Howard Hughes, filmmaker and aviator, obviously. ""The Aviator"" only shows Hughes' life from about 1920s to the 1940s and stops before his death in the '60s. They show his life with actress Katherine Hepburn (played perfectly by Cate Blanchett), Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), Pan Am president (Alec Baldwin), Senator Owen Brewster (Alan Alda), and even a run in with famous actor Errol Flynn (Jude Law). The movie follows Hughes on his journey through film-making, insanity, different types of disorders, relationships, and his genius of imagination and pushing of the envelope.

DiCaprio's performance in this film is one of the best I have seen in a while. Cate Blanchett does so well that I thought I was actually watching Katherine Hepburn on screen for a while. Director Martin Scorsese takes on a different challenge from going to his usual violent, dark, and disturbing movies to ones like this. He does everything so perfect that it's hard to resist, his cinematography, his set pieces, and especially the quality he gets out of his actors. ""The Aviator"" is a great film, possibly one of the best that have come out of a true story. It has drama, wonderful acting, has one of the best, most intense and realistic airplane crashes that I have ever seen. Not to mention that the film is a spectacle to look at the whole two hours and forty-six minutes.",9
8 January 2005,Spectacular story of a complex man's life.,"I did not expect to enjoy or admire this movie. Instead I found myself entranced, as Howard Hughes' life unfolded on the screen. Visually, the movie is unforgettable. The colors that are filmed add to the emotion of the actions and sometimes seem like a painting. For that reason, some of the movie may seem slow--my friend thought it was too long. But I thought that the complexity of HH's character demanded length if you want to understand him and the ambitions and obsession for perfection that drove him. I would not shorten the movie. For example, although I hate to fly, I loved the flying scenes. The scene where you are(the camera is) sitting behind Howard as he whizzes up and then down to the runway makes you feel something of the thrill that made him love flying. I will say that I had to find out more about HH, just to see how much in the movie was accurate. Good job.

25 January 2005,Best Film of 2004,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons.

I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature.

Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence.

29 December 2004,Hopefully Marty Will Finally Get His Oscar,"There may be no person on earth ever more deserving of an Oscar than Martin Scorsese. This man has helped a ridiculous number of actors earn theirs and yet he goes unrewarded by the Academy.

The biggest problem is that Scorsese's movies tend to be working on such an amazing level, that most people don't even like them on their the first viewing... (see Paul Sorvino's comments about the first time he saw Goodfellas). Upon reflection many of these people also realize the films to be a tremendous achievement. This is often too late for Oscar but at least makes a showing on the IMDb top 250 and AFI top 100.

The Aviator may change all of this. This film was fantastic. No doubt about it, this film is a masterpiece. It also has a Forrest Gump quality working for it that will hopefully draw in the masses.

My fingers are crossed... again. I hope this time the Academy won't let me down. Good luck Marty.",10
22 December 2019,The Aviator,"This was a lot more entertaining and a lot crazier than what I was expecting. The editing was not doing it for me in a lot of cases which I suppose is the point, it makes things feel pretty claustrophobic, but it just felt sloppy at a certain point. This is such a 2004 movie....

13 February 2005,A new standard,"Very much wow! Yes, it may have been fairly long, but this movie was very worth seeing. Stylistically, this was clearly a Scorsese film. It was edgy, interesting, and had a good flow to it.

The casting was above par for a film of this magnitude, and all the characters were very believable, especially Leo's character of Howard Hughes. I hate to say it because I don't like him much as an actor, but I think this is bound to be the real pinnacle of his career. Titanic started the downhill slide, and this movie put him back on the charts.

As for accuracy, this movie did it right in all regards, especially with regards to Hughes and how completely insane he was.

Definitely worth ""best of the year"" at the Oscars.

10 January 2005,"Blissfully, wonderfully, beautifully perfect","The Aviator Review by Joshua Morrall

Rating: 5/5

There is nothing, absolutely nothing, no matter how hard I scratch with my unkempt nails to find something, there remains not a single element of The Aviator that is not blissfully, wonderfully, beautifully perfect.

Martin Scorsese has helmed forty projects, and his lack of an Oscar has been chuckled about in the film world for some years now. It is a credit to him, the five foot film school graduate, that he has remained fully focused on producing motion pictures that captivate the audience, and offer a purity of cinematic excellence rarely seen on screens today.

Scorsese's most recent production, The Aviator, is the life story of the legendary Howard Hughes, huge budget movie director, playboy, pioneer and what many would call a psychopath. Hughes broke boundaries when he directed and produced the war epic Hell's Angels. His addiction to aviation was funded by his mammoth inheritance and profit margin, although he almost lost it all as he became obsessed with producing the most mammoth and modern aeroplanes the world had ever seen.

In the role of Hughes is Leonardo DiCaprio. Any of you who consider him a talentless heart throb should be ashamed of their pitiful ignorance and analyse his almost faultless performances in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Catch Me If You Can, The Basketball Diaries, This Boy's Life (to name but a few). Here, DiCaprio takes his method to an entirely new level, believable and arresting as both the playboy and the manic. DiCaprio's nervous ticks are a joy to behold, from his nervous cough at the sight of germs to his utter uncontrollable terror as a disabled man approaches him after using the bathroom. Best Actor? Very much deserved.

Cate Blanchett, apparently Scorsese's first choice for the role of Katherine Hepburn, is transformed completely into the reincarnation of the four time Oscar winner. The New England accent is faultless, as are the mannerisms and the classy Hepburn swagger. Truly a fantastic performance. Best Actress? Certainly.

Even the usually irritating but constantly alluring Kate Beckinsale turns in a great performance, definitely worthy of Academy notification. She is alleged to have put on twenty pounds for the role and she comes out looking fresh faced and mouth watering. Her chemistry with DiCaprio is very playful, contrasting the mother son undercurrent that pervades between DiCaprio and Blanchett.

Performances from John C. Reilly and the reborn Alec Baldwin are of a very high standard also. It seems unfair to name just two actors when all gave award winning performances, yet somehow, despite the quality of the supporting cast, the leads still manage to have an extra spark that makes the tense moments in the film even more exhilarating to watch.

Scorsese's direction is clearly painstaking. As the years past, the quality of the film changes also, the colour tones reflecting how films would have looked at the time. The beautifully painted shots are matched by the costumes, set design and even special effects, something quite rare for Scorsese. His old school approach to action is phenomenal to behold, Hughes' crash into the houses in Beverly Hills is an incredible five minutes, the breath taking pace of the machine gun editing (which rips through the screen and tears you up inside) is bettered only by the vibrant sharpness of the real flames, something rarely seen in big budget movies now, who settle instead for the dull, flat fires produced using CGI.

From beginning to end, with stunning sequences throughout (especially the Senate hearing), The Aviator is a beautiful picture with flawless performances, wonderful cinematography and extravagant mise-en-scene. There is no doubt about it: The Aviator soars high above all of the competition.",10

30 April 2005,GREAT acting!,"ONE of the things that impressed me about the acting is that Kate Hepburn actually looked and acted like Kate Hepburn, Jude Law was a great Errol Flynn, and I've never seen Leonardo do so well -- I've never seen Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin play such convincing villains -- The best scene of the movie was the confrontation between Alan Alda and Leonardo -- My heart just went out to see how he was harassed and hounded by government at the behest of his sworn enemy -- From the beginning of the movie, you could see what a genius he was in the area of aviation! The sets were great -- I loved all that old art deco, and using Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor scored for orchestra by Leopold Stokowski was a WONDERFUL touch -- I was impressed with the movie in every way -- a true joy to behold!

9 January 2005,The amazing life of Howard Hughes brilliantly portrayed by Scorsese & DiCaprio,"I saw this movie last night and I can't stop thinking about it. The more I think about ""The Aviator,"" the more I realize what a brilliant movie this is because it succeeds so well at depicting the life of a man, Howard Hughes, who was highly complex -- full of conflicts and contradictions, a ""super human"" and a human just like the rest of us.

I didn't know much about Howard Hughes before seeing this film but almost immediately I found myself truly liking him, hoping he would succeed at whatever he tried and deeply sympathetic when he encountered setbacks. In a way, Howard Hughes was very different from me but there were enough common threads to allow me to truly relate to him.

Leonardo DiCaprio once again delivers a remarkable performance. He captures the essence of Hughes and is highly successful at bringing Hughes to life on the big screen (an extraordinary accomplishment).

This film is also an affirmation that Martin Scorsese, the film's director, is one of the best directors of all time. I think the team of DiCaprio and Scorsese is perfect. They also worked together on the ""Gangs of New York"" (2002), which like ""The Aviator"" (2004), reminded me of what great film making is all about.

""The Aviator"" also features terrific performances by Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda and others. Everyone involved in this project shines brightly!",10
31 January 2005,Deserves the Oscar,"I didn't know there were already two movies titled ""The Aviator"", one with Christopher Reeve in 1985.

This is a great movie. It really deserves the award for ""Best Picture"". The special effects were spectacular, the soundtrack flawless, and the acting surprisingly great. Everything about this movie flowed so nicely. Howard Hughes himself was so over-the-top, so the movie could glide smoothly through the story of his life without having to over-dramatize anything. Classy film-making here; kind of a like a new version of Citizen Kane... It'd be awfully lame if someone made a new version of Citizen Kane, so this is the closest you can get to having a new epic story like that. Also kudos to DiCaprio on his acting job. I do however, think Jamie Foxx deserves the Oscar for ""Best Actor"" but Clint Eastwood will most likely get it.

20 February 2005,Boring,"Several Oscar nominees for that film? Scorses or Di Caprio must have good connections in the jury... To be honest, it's one the most boring and most dull films I've ever seen. After seeing it I questioned myself: what was it all about? Was this about a pscyhopatic man or a good businessman or what? O yeah I understand, it was about a man who we know nothing about, and it's a story of a man that leaves only questions behind. But the problem is: who the hell does care about who this man was? Scorsese didn't even touch my attention. The storyline can be described like this: Hughes has done this, Hughes has done that, Hughes was here and went there and he had famous girlfriends There was a time when he was a totally freak but after that period everything's fine again. At the end you see no real story, there is no real drama, there isn't anything. And this took 170 minutes. Di Caprios acting is absolutely middle-class. I really can't feel the madness of Hughes, there is no depth in the character. And besides that, I had the impression that this is a 16 year old boy and not a 40 year old man. Di Caprio looks like a 16 year old child...oh excuse me, his voice is just 14 years old. They shouldn't let him play old characters, it's too funny:)",3
27 February 2005,What were they thinking?,"After winning the first few Oscars, I began to think finally Martin Scorsese would win his long awaited best director award. It seemed like the perfect ending, after going 0 for 10 with Gangs of New York 2 years ago. wrong!! What were the Academy voters thinking??? I was only happy enough not to see Clint win an acting award. Clint has had his day, time for another legend to have the honor, especially after getting shut out 6 other times, I guess this makes lucky number 7. For the talent he has, and the amazing movies he has made, I shall ask: When will he get his due? How many more classics does he need to make? How many more multiple mediocre winners must there be before he gets his first? Let me know what you think of this outrageous robbery!!!

28 September 2005,DiCaprio is one of the best actor's in the world at this moment.,"I saw yesterday this film and I was very surprised by the acting by the lead role, DiCaprio. I've seen all of his movies and I think he is one of the best actor's in this world for this moment. He can play really everything. I like him the most in his role in ""What's eating Gilbert Grape?"". I think that role was stunning. He deserved an Oscar for it, but didn't. And even this film gets five Oscars, none of them were for Leo. I think he deserved it. Although he is a bit childish to look at, I think he is very believable in this role. But then again, the film is not one of Scorcese's best, so maybe he's too good for this film.... Anyhow... I liked this film. It claimed me for over two hours en I really enjoyed watching this movie.

19 December 2004,Pretty good overall,"The title really was great for the story line.

Dicaprio played an excellent Hughes. His obsessive compulsive disorder was evident through the whole movie and did a good job of progressing it to its final stages. Some of the bad times Hughes went through were depicted very well in the movie, yet we got the point and didn't need to drag every part of it out.

If you want an education on Huges then this is a great movie to see. There was a lot of action and the end was amazing.

The only thing bad about the movie is some parts were too long. At 2 and half hours into the movie I was checking my watch. A three hour movie could have been cut down. It was too long.

26 December 2004,The best bio-epic since Patton!,"Let me start off by saying that coming into this movie, I knew absolutely nothing about Hughes except that he was paranoid about germs. That said, I loved it. Conceptually, it reminded very much of ""Patton"": a long grand biography of a grand man. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the performance of his life in this one. I'd say he's the odds-on favorite to win the Oscar. Cate Blanchett is awesome, she truly becomes Katherine Hepburn. The script is top-notch, and there is just enough experimentation with camera angles and lighting to keep the viewer interested in what they are seeing (take note of flashbulbs). That being said, there is one flaw I found in the picture, which is that we see what Hughes did, but not why. Why/when did he become interested in aiplanes? Of this, I cannot say. 9/10

28 December 2004,The Aviator Flies!,"I saw The Aviator last night and was amazed at how well it was done. I've seen (and have on DVD) quite a number of Leonardo DiCaprio movies but would have to say this was his best (to date). As well, Cate Blanchett as Kathrine Hepburn...if she doesn't win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress I'll be disappointed. Cate was excellent as Kate!

This was a very well done movie. The cinematography was fantastic as were the costumes and sets. I can't wait for this to be released on DVD and will be first in line to buy it!

A lot of period movies, fact or fiction, always throw in a new song by a present-day artist. This one didn't and I think that's what made it even better. They stuck with the music of the era and that's what added to it even better!

10 July 2007,Marty is BACK!,"""The Aviator"" is Martin Scorsese's best work in years. From the visual storytelling to the flamboyant acting. Marty proves that there is something left to stir inside the genius mind.

The Aviator tells the story of Howard Hughes: The main who literally believed in one thing and one thing only: Flight. Air. The control of machines, flying through the wind. And he did. His playboy life is executed perfectly, but not without cameo's by Jude Law! The obsessed playboy himself.

They're many things so perfect about the Aviator. Marty's perfect directing. The ensemble cast, Or even the incredible acting of Leonardo Dicaprio. But something else shines through in the film: Something beyond the director, producers, and actors. The life of this man.

No one film can do his life justice. He was a genius one night, a play-boy the next. A germ-freak on Sundays, an obsessed sex-addicted on Monday.

No one really knew this man for what he did and how he did it.

16 March 2005,Life from the 1930's brought to 2004.,"Characters were very reminiscent of the real life personalities. The character of Katherine Hepburn was play to near perfection. I can't help but think Howard Hughes in real life was a bit of a cad, and hard to deal with. He pursued women on a constant basis with a single mindedness for sex. How women put up with him could only be attributed to his wealth. Little else was attractive from him. His wealth and his preoccupation with cleanliness isolated him in a world of his own making which had little to do with ordinary life patterns. This was part of his genius and his devastating spiral into a lonely worthless existence.

25 December 2004,"Worth the $10 bucks, a bag of popcorn, and large coke.","The Aviator by Martin Scorsese took his films to new heights on this one. His tribute to life of the eccentric millionaire, Howard Hughes, was profoundly moving. Growing up in Los Angeles, I've been reminded of the Howard Hughes legacy from time to time. The Spruce Goose has a whole new meaning to me. Scorcese brought Howard alive on the screen and I walked away actually wanting to fly TWA on my next flight.

Leonardo DiCaprio was amazing. For three hours, he was no longer Leo but was Howard Hughes himself. A definite contender for an Oscar. The supporting cast complemented Leo's work in bringing out the the complexities of a genius on the verge of madness. The Kates, Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale touched the softer side of Hughes' personal life. While John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda defined his business savvy. But Leo was something else- someone else for that matter. He took on this role like a true actor to trade. Leo earned his wings on this one.

Watch it. It's definitely worth the $10 bucks, a bag of popcorn, and large coke.",10
29 January 2005,it was disappointing,"While the Aviator had its good points it also had its been. Leo DiCaprio deserves all the recognition he gets the man definitely deserves that Oscar nomination.

But what I don't see is why Cate Blanchett has been getting so much praise sure she had the accent down but I really didn't enjoy her performance as Katherine Hepburn at all personally I think she was miscast.Kate Beckinsale on the other hand an amazing performance as per usual she looked ever stunning. and John C Reily superb a god in his own right in the many roles he has played I think he deserved some recognition for his role as well but thats me.

9 January 2005,Wonderful Film,"In a year of very poor movies, all I can say is thank goodness for Martin Scorsese and Leonardo Di Caprio. The Aviator is fantastic. Leonardo Di Caprio's performance as Howard Hughes is amazing...I am a fan of his but this is definitely his best ever work. The Oscar Nom is an absolute certainty. I also predict that it will win Oscars for Picture, Director, Supporting Actress, Cinematography, Special Visual Effects, Make-Up and Sound.

The film magnificently captures Hughes' tortured mental state...his germophobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder is so acute that even a door knob presents a major threat. Once again, I could not imagine that Di Caprio had such a performance in him. The final 15 minutes was for me worth the price of admission alone. Other performances deserve a mention as well...Cate Blanchett is a shoo-in for an Oscar for her spot-on rendition of Katharine Hepburn. John C. Reilly gives his usual excellent performance, Alec Baldwin is great as Juan Trippe and Alan Alda is on great form as the slimy Brewster. And although her performance has been criticised in some quarters, I thought that Kate Beckinsale was a convincing Ava Gardner. I am not a Jude Law fan, but his small part as Errol Flynn was highly amusing.

The Aviator is long and is not for those with a short attention span. But it is the kind of intelligent film-making that is seen very little these days. The cinema I saw it in was packed and hardly anyone moved throughout the course of the film, so there is obviously an appetite for this kind of film. I highly recommend The Aviator.",
21 June 2005,interesting,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",9

5 January 2005,Great Performances...Great Movie,"'Aviator' was a wonderful film that did a great job of giving the people an inside look at Howard Hughes life. Although the film was not completely accurate it sure was close.

Cate Blanchett was magnetic. Her portrayal of Kate Hepburn was very well done. Her accent and personality were right on target.

Leonardo did a great job also. I've never been a big fan of his but this movie made me respect him more as an actor.

Kate Beckinsale also did a nice job. Her performance was not as great as Cate Blanchett's but Beckinsale definitely held her own.

All in all this was an extraordinary film with superb performances.

28 March 2005,View it with an open mind to what the filmmakers intended.,"""The Aviator"" is director Martin Scorsese's ambitious biographical account of Howard Hughes' life as a wealthy director-cum-aviator in the late 1920's through the 40's, with Leonardo DiCaprio as Hughes.

The film begins with Hughes already embroiled in his first motion picture, ""Hell's Angel's"", a war-drama that took four years to produce and was re-shot due to the discovery of audio! For its time it was the most expensive film ever produced. Hughes, after making a few more features, mainly focused his attentions on his airline corporation.

DiCaprio skillfully portrays a young wealthy man brimming with confidence and inspiration. His acting goes to new heights as he depicts Hughes' struggle with his Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. The supporting cast is outstanding, particularly Alan Alda as a corrupt Senator (on the payroll of Hughes' detractors) and Cate Blanchett as the late Katharine Hepburn, who was one among many of Hughes's love interests. Blanchett gave a performance that was Hepburn in every way. What was more exceptional about Blanchett's performance was that she went beyond what we saw of Hepburn. Blanchett brings emotions and humanity to a person who led quite a secluded life for a star of such status.

This lengthy biopic, abounding with vibrant characters and embracing a massive scope, loses sight of its goal or any overall vision and begins to wander about aimlessly. What we have left is a skeleton of what was first presented to us. I'm not criticizing Scorsese for sparing us emotional crying scenes. For this I admire him since his pictures tend to be darker and more insightful towards the lives of those who hold power and then lose it in a downward spiral because of their own faults (similar to classic Shakespearian tragedies). Once Hughes hits rock-bottom Scorsese lets us linger in his insane private world for too long. The acting suffers from this since DiCaprio repeats himself during these sequences. All that is left is the beautiful cinematography and score. Scorsese does finally attempt to rekindle the excitement at the end when Hughes successfully flies a mammoth plane (which took years to build) and is also brought to Senate hearings for allegedly wasting government aeronautics funds during World War II. All of which comes too late to salvage our interest. After it's all over the story is wrapped up with Hughes descending further into paranoia and seclusion. He ultimately became a recluse until his death in 1976 from a kidney failure.

What is ""The Aviator's"" goal? We initially think it's to accurately portray the life of Howard Hughes, who was a very powerful and mysterious figure in society. This can't be so since Hughes is said not to have been so affected by his disorder during the period which the film is set. Also, the attention given to Katharine Hepburn is strange considering her relationship with Hughes was brief and he was also involved with countless leading ladies. Is it because Hepburn died recently? All of it suggests that the film is less fact oriented and is actually motivated by its message's significance, which in the end is left to each viewer's interpretation.

View it with an open mind to what the filmmaker's intended. Only then will ""The Aviator"" be truly appreciated, despite the irregularities.

6 August 2006,A recluse whose thoughts were ahead of his time.,"An excellent story depicting the life of a multi-millionaire whose thoughts were well ahead of his time. The cast which included luminaries such as Leonardo Dicaprio told us in a most fascinating way the tycoon's love of cleanliness, his achievements in film making, his romance with some of the world's most beautiful women, his passion for aviation and his dreams which while others just dreamed, this man actually built! I found the film captivating from the point of story-line and special effects used. Needless to say,the ending was most dramatic. Cheers to all in the directing and production of this outstanding film!

3 July 2007,Decent Movie but could have been better,"A friend of mine once told me that if a movie is made by Scorsese it has to good , I would agree with that because this movie was good but if he said that ""The Aviator was his best"" then I am sorry mate I would disagree because I have seen better movies by Scorsese than this.

The movie had its moments , it started off well I was enjoying it and I taught it was the best film of the year but later on I had to change my mind because it started to get boring but I continued watching because that happens in every biographical movie. Slowly its started to get interesting again and it ended beautifully It's a decent movie with some beautifully shot scenes and a great performance by all the Actors

12 June 2015,The Aviator,"Aviator is a piece of artwork that took just as long to make as it took Howard Hughes to build a proper flying airplane; it takes a very penetrating look at the life of an overwhelmingly wealthy person with an idea that required more than attention but attention. The interpretation of his life as depicted by Leonardo DiCaprio needed the advice of Martin Scorsese to fully show the personality but it worked well. Leonardo, the innocent soft faced, I thought would find it difficult to play the role but with definite manipulation from Scorsese, made it through as direct, indirect, attentive, withdrawn, there, not there, berserk, ridiculous, smart, witty, charming, quirky and quiet. This actor I felt gave up a thing that I would call ""baby"" or ""young"" for an actor and reached into adulthood but back to self. Very long - over 3 hours

5 July 2005,Best Movie About Someone Unimportant,"If I wrote the tagline for this movie, it would read something like ""The Best Movie This Year about Someone Insignificant!"" You may argue that Howard Hughes was some sort of pioneer in the histories of both the movie and aviation, but I would reply that if Howard Hughes was not around to accomplish those things, someone else equally unimportant would have. I give credit that this movie accurately portrays Hughes as both a risk-taker and downright weirdo, was beautifully filmed, and very well acted. But I can't get past the fact that Howard Hughes was likely only well known because he was very wealthy, and a person whose quirks only make him an irritating nut who treated other people poorly, and recklessly threw millions of dollars away chasing white rabbits (or rather Spruce Gooses). From the movie, I didn't see that he was all that noble, not enough for us to sympathize with him and regard him as some sort of hero. This was certainly a very well-made film, deserving of accolades for its technical aspects, but ultimately whose subject really doesn't matter.

7 January 2005,"Genius, vision and madness","I really enjoyed this one. There were several times during the film where I was just transfixed and enrapt by what I was watching on screen.

This is the second biopic I've seen this year, the other was ""Ray."" Picking and choosing what part of a life you want to present in order to make a statement was done far more artfully in this than in ""Ray"". Howard Hughes's life was depicted from the time he started his first film until just after his Senate hearing and Scorsese used it to show how genius, vision and madness can all spring from the same source.

I left the theater surprised that the movie hadn't received better reviews than the one I glanced at, because not only is this Scorsese's best direction, but De Caprio, Kate Blanchett and Alan Alda all turned in Oscar worthy performances. This is, finally, my best film pick of 2004.

If you're on the fence about seeing this one due to it's 3 hour length, the only time I thought about looking at my watch was to assure myself that it wasn't ending too soon. . .",10
30 December 2004,a great entertaining adventure,"One of the best movies I have seen, the acting was absolutely outstanding. Despite its length, the movie moved quickly. DeCaprio played the part exactly as one would picture Hughes. He was exceptional with the psychotic episodes, from his youth to later in life. My husband and I truly enjoyed the film, which doesn't happen often enough! The only change I would suggest is to edit out a couple of minutes near the end-it started to get drawn out-but then it was over anyway. His personal life was fascinating, also loved the part when he faced the senate committee and turned it around to them-that was great part! The flight scenes took your breath away, felt like you were flying too. And the crash in Hollywood, felt like you were there when it happened. I had no idea he had been through something like that-no wonder he had so many health problems.

6 January 2005,Too Big,"I am a huge fan of Martin Scorsese. Raging Bull and Goodfellas are two of my favorite movies of all time. They were so good because of the smaller scope of their stories. They were more personal and thus I felt I could get closer to the characters. In Scorcese's two latest films however(Gangs of New York and now The Aviator) he has abandoned the small story for epic biopics. By tackling the grand scale of the life of Howard Hughs in The Aviator, I did not feel the intimacy that made his earlier films so excellent. That is not to say that The Aviator is a poor picture by any means. DiCaprio as Hughs is great and Blanchett is astounding as Hepburn. Her performance should receive recognition by both the foreign press and the academy. Moreover the cinematography (especially in the scenes where Hughs films Hells Angels) is excellent. Nonetheless to me, The Aviator for its lack of intimacy was not an enjoyable film. Because of the hugeness of the film, it drags. I fear that The Aviator will be the big winner this year as it has all the characteristics of recent winners: a famous director, big name actors and an epic plot. I know it would be a crime for Scorsese to never receive an Oscar, but really he is not as deserving for this film as others. What really saved the movie for me was Blanchett's performance. I would not mind seeing her win big this year.",6
3 February 2005,Excellente!,"I recently saw the Aviator and was riveted by the attention to detail in this film. Leonardo DiCaprio WAS Howard Hughes. He brought an unbelievable amount of reality to this character and rightfully so because he was portraying a legend. You can feel with him as he suffers through hardships, this is so hard to do when you are portraying someone in history. Cate Blanchett, *sigh*. Excellent work. Katherine Hepburn was almost a caricature herself so being her is probably one of the most challenging roles that will ever be attempted. I also loved the minor and supporting actors/actresses in this movie. The only thing that really didn't sink with me was Alec Baldwin's performance, maybe cause he was a villain I have yet to figure out why I didn't get his character in this... Alan Alda, I don't even have to say anything... I love the man! Please see this movie but go to the bathroom before cause it's a long one!

29 January 2005,"great, but...where's the end?","Every performance was absolutely great...and this coming from a person who thinks Leonardo is a little above average and still looks like a fourteen year old. All the sets, cinematography, and directing was again, great... BUT,amazingly for a movie that 170 minutes, they forgot to actually end the movie, thus setting up an Aviator II. OK,just kidding, but really, they should have closed the movie a bit stronger, and if it wins the Oscar for screenplay, I'm gonna have to object...But of all Cate Blanchett= spot on as Hepburn and made me look at the actress in a totally different light. Could do without the closeup shots of all the musical stage performers aw well...too much of an average thing...

Martin Scorsese is not the nice Oscar material guy you immature movie watchers think he is, he is beyond all that Oscar bullshit, this is Art, just looking at the ending of the movie brought chills down my spine!

GREAT movie!! those who disagree need to GROW UP!!

27 May 2005,"Brilliant Film Making, Unsympathetic Storytelling.","The Aviator.

A somewhat hard picture to judge. Overall I would say I enjoyed it. But then again, most Scorcese stuff will never be garbage, or never really be uninteresting. To be honest I thought The Aviator was a more interesting story than Raging Bull. Maybe because stories about boxers never interested me. Maybe that's why I think The Aviator was a far better film than Million Dollar Baby.

So the Aviator is a sub-par epic, by an incredible filmmaker and storyteller. The production values, acting, etc etc are excellent. The story of Hughes is just too sad and screwed up to be as memorable as something like Goodfellas or Taxi Driver. The movie isn't just well done because its a Martin Scorcese movie and people automatically give it props, it is definitely worth seeing. He's mastered elegant, original storytelling, I just think the angle to take on someone like Howard Hughes was the only misstep in the film.

Maybe I have a weird lust for long epic movies, but the ending just felt so unsatisfying. Because the movie makes his character seem to interesting, and the film just ends when he's what? 40. If you become engaged in the story (as I did), You end up thinking..."" do I have to read a Howard Hughes biography to know what madness, and ridiculously admirable ambition and...more madness came to this guy for the rest of his life??!?"" I guess so.

I think the ultimate annoyance people had with the movie is...its ability to showcase Howard Hughes massive weirdness, but nobody really feels empathetic to it. It's like watching some ranting homeless guy downtown rant on about the government and society. You know that he might actually be making some sense, and he might be right, but you still want to beat him until he shuts up and stops acting so ridiculously strange. There's a very minute audience that kind find empathy for germaphobes. The empathy for his struggle against pretty obvious government misconduct in his business, is diminished by our lack of empathy for his eccentricity.

DiCaprio was fantastic though. Probably the strongest performance of his career. Scorcese not winning the Oscar seems...unfair but almost just. The academy has a very stubborn manner of reflecting its honors on those who are making their best work, not work of brilliance, but declining brilliance. Clint Eastwood was making his best work as a director, and Scorcese well...his work in Goodfellas was worth two Oscar's...but his work on Aviator wasn't quite worth one.",7
19 December 2004,sneak preview,"Saw this film last night at Loews, Cherry Hill, NJ. Up to the scene in which Howard and Kate go to visit her parents, the color of film was appalling. Everything was blue and rust, no green. In the scene with Errol Flynn and the peas lined up on the plate, they were little blue balls, why? Didn't Howard Hughes have dark eyes? Why, oh why wasn't the color of Leo's eyes changed to reflect this and make the portrayal more realistic? I found these little things very distracting, did I hear some say, ""obessive compulsive? Thought his performance was outstanding but the film as a whole with all advance hep, the let me down, big time. Although a long film, time went fast.

20 April 2005,"Very good movie, a surprise!","I saw this movie a long time ago(is three months a long time?Yes, if you want to remember all the details of a movie...), so I can't remember all the scenes, but I'll do my best. ""The Aviator"", it's a shame that this movie didn't win more Oscars, like Achieving in Directing, or something like that. Leonardo DiCaprio was THE big surprise. An excellent acting gave us the perfect view of Howard Hughes' world and it makes us understand his trauma. Of course that the astunig direction also plays a big role in the authenticity of the characters, because Martin Scorsese really knows how to visually tell a story. I think that, though this movie didn't win the best Oscars, it's an excellent movie and everybody should see it!!

26 June 2005,A beautiful film that will not be forgotten...,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",10
18 March 2020,Fine but flawed...,"A fine, assured film in so many ways but with, for me, two significant flaws... DiCaprio and it should have been in black and white.

DiCaprio doesn't have the lankiness and his voice is too high pitched. Physically, he looks better in the role with the moustache in the latter half of the film.

Visually, the black and white would have elevated the picture to another stratosphere and perhaps hidden some of DiCaprio's shortcomings.

Anyway... the rest of the picture is mostly first class. Scorsese's direction, the production, etc. I'm an avid fan of both the film and Charles Higham's book and have my own copy.

27 June 2005,A deeply compelling movie but...,"Dicaprio is at best, the most convincing in this award winning epic, during the earlier years. For me he just fell short of the mark, as he matured, there seemed to still be a petulance about his character portrayal, that I just couldn't buy into. I imagine after reading about the real Howard Hughes, that he would have been a tad different, possibly a little more macho. Cate, well she is a hard act to follow, and she really had me convinced that she was actually Kate Hepburn, except in that one last scene where she was at the door pleading with Hughes. I saw that mellow side emerge that is Cate, not Kate!! Overall a magnificent portrayal, no one could of done the job better.

Alec Baldwin, of course as Juan did not disappoint, he plays the part of a stinker so well, and Alan Alda certainly has come into his own as well, a far cry from the days of MASH, as I saw no conniving clown, with a big heart in the performance.

Gwen Sefani, hmmmm the less said the better there, I think the smoke lady was more interesting. It did disappoint me to learn that Hughes was a playboy, who like to playboy with boys, Errol Flynn and Cary Grant, that took away quite a deep respect for the overall movie, and I found it hard to see it as an epic with distinction. Leonardo I personally feel, needs to find the more mature side to his character now, and tune into that, his days of whining school boy are not becoming, to a man who could be not just a good actor, but a top of his class actor...Time will tell.

Overall, a fascinating flick, the planes, the corporate wrangling, made for interesting scenario's, but I am not much into blatant playboy stuff. But then again DiCaprio will find it hard to top his performance in Titanic, and that could be half the problem. Enjoyable, but my head is still stuck on the HMS Surprise :)",8
26 December 2004,A wonderful movie..very impressionable,"I found this movie to be absolutely captivating. It provided me with so much information about a man whom I had only heard of. If a movie prompts me to do research about a particular topic when I come home, it has opened my mind and my world up to something new. I found there to be so much very interesting information on Howard Hughes. What a strangely deep man he was. This movie took me for a ride that has made a lasting impression on me. Houston, TX is a very short drive from where I live and I will be sure to visit his grave sight the next time I am there. As for Leonardo DiCaprio, this performance has proved his talent as a very engaging and maturing actor. He has come a long way and I hope he will finally be recognized by the Academy for his work on this film. Both in front of and behind the camera. I will definitely purchase the DVD as it becomes available to add to my personal collection.

26 January 2005,Don't miss it!,"This is a fabulous movie! The story of the rise and fall of the mega-rich Howard Hughes is told with a sure touch, and can be enjoyed even if you know nothing about him (and despite any alleged artistic licence with 'the facts').

The acting is superb throughout. Leonardo Di Caprio turns in an accomplished and mature performance, possibly his best yet. His depiction of Hughes' gradual physical and mental decline is deftly handled, neither lurid nor sentimental. Other notable performances come from Cate Blanchett, playing the peppery Katharine Hepburn, Kate Beckinsale, stunning as Ava Gardner, Alan Alda, as the wily Senator, and Al Dubois (?) as the smoothly mannered but ruthless chief of PanAm Airways.

The period settings are wonderfully evocative (the cars, the clothes, the interiors, the street scenes) and the aircraft (WW1 biplanes, an experimental spy plane, the Spruce Goose) are fantastic (if suspiciously lacking in noise and vibration for the interior shots).The scenes of Hughes' crash-landing are both terrifying and spectacular without being an SFX-fest.

To cap all this, the music is tremendous - pre-war ballads, jazz, big-band numbers and, if you stay until the final credits, a blues performance by Leadbelly.

My partner approached this movie with no interest in Howard Hughes nor aviation. But, like me, she was knocked out by the quality and entertainment value of this film. So don't miss it!",9
12 September 2007,"Awful, what more can I say?","The Aviator was possibly the biggest waste of my life. It was a really long film in which nothing memorable or even vaguely interesting happened. If I had paid for the movie I would have left the cinema half way through, however as it was a friend's money I stayed and had to watch a man trying to open a door after his little black stone fell in a trash can. Frankly that is where the film should have been instead of on the screen. If there is anything more that I can say to you to dissuade you from seeing this abomination of a film I wish that I'd said it. This is the biggest waste of money since McDonald's salad menu.

1 January 2005,"Howard, Leo and Oscar","This biopic about an eccentric and influential mogul, Howard Hughes, was more artistic than historically accurate, even though the symbolism was so obvious, it took away from the artistic license. Was Scorsese trying to dumb it down for the general public? I thought I caught a glimpse of a bright, blue Ked's label on Howard's sneakers when he was dancing the Samba with Faith. Did Ked's exist 70 years ago? Was DiCaprio really the right match to play Hughes? I'll get to that later.

The over zealous portrayal of Kate Hepburn by Cate Blanchett was saccharin, i.e. sickly sweet. Cate almost pulled off the great face that Kate was famous for, but I thought she could have gone the extra mile and shed a few more pounds to look more the part. By Contrast, Kate Beckinsdale could have gained a few pounds to play bombshell Ava Garner, (Beckinsdale was all shell and no bomb).

Gwen Stephani, on the other hand, was the perfect face for the era which brings me to what I did like - the music, the costumes (minus the Ked's), the cinematography, the colours, the textures - visually it gets a thumbs up. If you like the 20's, 30's and 40's on film, GO SEE THIS MOVIE. If you're over 50, chances are you will really enjoy it.

I read other comments saying that DiCaprio's performance was infantile and that he didn't have enough talent for mature, deep roles. I disagree. He did a good acting job in ""The Aviator"" because he went beyond himself, especially in the scene where Hughes cages himself inside his personal cinema. Although his accent was inconsistent, a personal pet peeve, DiCaprio's ability to play a character with penetrating quirks was reminiscent of Academy Award winner Jack Nicholson in ""As Good As It Gets"", Russell Crowe in ""A Beautiful Mind"" and even himself in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"". His acting was better than Robert Downey Jr. in ""Chaplin"", to make a comparison. Leo was on screen so much, all but about two scenes, it won't be surprising if he's matched up with another mogul - Oscar.",7
12 February 2005,Bored to death,"I am giving just 3 for this movie. I watched it 45 minutes and it was in one word..boring. Leonardo is acting quite well, but I could not get off the feeling that characters are not authentic - they do not touch your soul really. To be honest I expected more , when I have heard how many nominations for Oscar it has. Anyway I am glad that I did not sponsor this movie by buying cinema ticket. I have seen much better biographies, but I cannot help myself this is simply average movie. I think will be soon forgotten in the history like many other movies of this type. Ony good think in the movie is music from twenties and thirties, old airplanes.

24 January 2005,Very Exciting!,"This is an extremely watchable movie. A very exciting movie. What this movie is not, is a biography. Myabe it's Mr. Scorsese' opinion of Hughes but I think other biographies and historical documents would find it wanting on truth. But I guess it's his truth.

There's a reasonable amount of action along with the drama, there's even some funny dialog. I was not prepared to be impressed with someone as young as Mr. DiCaprio doing a person from history like Howard Hughes. Hughes is a larger than life character, but the youth of DiCaprio started to disappear as the Hughes character began his decline into madness. Mr. DiCaprio even atarts to look like a young Howard Hughes.

Ms. Blanchett is the best part of this movie though. She captures Katherine Hepburn precisely. I have seen most of the late Ms.Hepburn's movies and interviews and Ms. Blanchett's portrayal deserves an Oscar. If her performance were not as good as it is, she would deserve one for such a great effort playing someone as equally larger than life like Ms. Katherine Hepburn.",8
26 December 2004,DiCaprio was excellent,"I am a 44 year old male movie buff and not necessarily a Leo fan--I liked ""Titanic"" and ""Catch me if you can"" but not much else. I have been a Howard Hughes fan for years and I liked a previous TV movie on his life. The Movie trailers were what sold me to see the movie.

I thought DiCaprio was credible as Hughes and he did a good job keeping me interested in the three hour epic. That is what I go to see movies for and He did his job in making me believe he was Hughes. I also think he should get an Oscar nod and hope to see more of this kind of acting from him in the future.

So, IMHO it was a very credible movie from a talented actor that made me want to see more of his work. I am not a female, nor gay and I am way too old to be a groupie. See this movie if you like to be entertained.

16 January 2005,Now do you see how good Leo is??,"Titanic was such a disaster for Leonardo DiCaprio's credibility, but I think he's finally won it back with this one. I think this an exceptional performance from Leonardo and I agree with comparisons to DeNiro in Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. Go on all you Leo critics: watch The Basketball Diaries and What's Eating Gilbert Grape, etc etc. the boy can act!! I was critical of his performances in The Beach and Gangs Of New York (which I don't really like as a film), but this performance in the Aviator has won over a lot of Leo-haters, so intense, you can just see how hard he's working! My only criticism of The Aviator is it's too long. I don't know why everyone is making 3hr films nowadays, but I think Scorsese could have cut 30 to 60 minutes off this one, and still told us the story, it drags on and on. other than that it's excellent, it tells the story of genius Howard Hughs who I knew nothing about before. Well done Mr DiCaprio - keep it up! I'm a bit worried about Baz Luhrmann's Alexander, but it could be excellent.

20 January 2007,The Deepth of Hollywood Dream,"Let's begin by the major flaws of this biopic : it's much too long, and some of the actors are totally miss-casted. What did Martin Scorsese thought about when he hired Kate Beckinsale to play Ava Gardner ? Hello, aren't there some great actresses out here ??? Not to mention Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow. The problem with Beckinsale is that she appears on screen only after a magnificent hour spent with Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn. Well, that's a performance ! Blanchett is great, even better than great, she IS Hepburn, funny, moving, strong, exuberant, she's a joy to watch, whereas Beckinsale is absolutely transparent ... Well i'm now going to talk about the rest of The Aviator, about the directing for example, so greater than in Gangs of New York (which was already great), inspired, glamorous and filled with self-confidence. DiCaprio is also better than in GONY, much much better, subtle, tormented and wild : mesmerizing. Just like the movie itself, and just like his lovable co-stars Cate Blanchett and Alan Alda.

16 January 2005,Love in times of fear,"Howard Hughes obtains every girl he can desire easily (if he has any time left amid lathering, aeronautic designing and movie producing), but he discovers a surprising affinity with Katherine Hepburn.

For Hepburn this man is not ""too much mad for me"" as Ava Gardner will tell him later- because Katherine suffers also from some kind of disorder. Both little conventional young of slim elegance, an innate ambition and highest professional achievements, find in each other a companion with features that are not abundant in their respective environments. The similarity between these two protagonists is one of the keys for this film, but few have found it. The main personality resemblance being the predominance of a neurotic tendency. Is attraction or necessity what unites them? A nature dominated by anxiety seems to adapt defectively to other neurotic, although the expression of the anxiety are quite different; he suffers a phobic and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and in Kate although resulting in a less handicapping way- we can guess she is an eccentric person, in constant need for control and easily stressed when feeling that she is not as much loved as she aspires to. Both reach that point in which one interferes with another (""fame is my territory"" tells him, when some of the photographers turn their cameras away from her and aim them to him), but this would not be enough reason for breaking up as she will leave him for another notorious star that could also overshadow her (Spencer Tracy, her definitive love). The true reason is Hughes was not able to satisfy her necessity for security as Tracy would do (anyone that has seen Tracy's movies knows he is the kind of man that was born to give confidence). Neither Kate can render any aid to Hugh (when he is attacked by her family with wounding remarks she does not assist him: who is asking for help is not ready to hear others when asking the same).

Two very similar people rarely could complement each other, but living together is impossible when their main feature is an under-laying fear, that arises constantly from childhood time. The need for a mate in this kind of people derives from the necessity of a truce in the sense of fear, and both will look for that relief in each other at the same time.

I intended to deal only about one of the many aspects of the story.",8
7 March 2015,"DiCaprio and Scorsese did it again, a real Master Piece! Must-Watch.","It is undeniable that Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese are THE dynamic duo. I cannot understand why this movie did not win the Oscar for best motion picture in 2005, and even less why Leonardo DiCaprio didn't win the Oscar for best actor. His acting was outstanding!! It is not secret that Howard Hughes was a bit troubled, Leo conveyed the complexity of his emotions perfectly. The cast was incredibly well done, Cate Blanchett did an amazing job as Katherine Hepburn. I honestly believe everything was perfect. Cast, costumes, directing, music, editing, special effects... everything was on point. I recommend this movie to everyone! It is a long movie, but I was entertained the whole time, I doubt I ever even blinked (YEAH it's that good). This is truly a must-see. I've read some bad reviews about this movie (VERY few) and I could not disagree more. This movie made me wish that I could rate more than 10 stars. It became one of my personal favorites.

For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",10
2 January 2011,"In all seriousness, the WORST movie I have ever watched","I know many people say this following the viewing of a terrible film, but I can honestly say that this is the worst film i have ever seen in my life. It would be pointless to go into the entire story of how I saw the film, the only important information is I viewed the film in theaters when it was released.

There has always been an incredible amount of hype about this film which obviously remains as indicated by the over 8 rating here on IMDb. So as to be expected, there were pretty serious expectations leading to the viewing of the film. Needless to say, these expectations were not even close to being met. While viewing the film, I waited and waited for the movie to have something eventful occur. Howard Hughes has an incredibly interesting life, yet even some of the most interesting and exciting events that occurred in this man's life were made so anti-climactic that made the entire movie very disappointing. When you walk out a theater being one of five people shaking your heads why you refused to leave a movie simply out of principal and the hope that the film would actually get better at some point, then that is when it occurs to you that this movie was in fact that terrible.

I feel bad writing about a movie that I think is the worst I've ever seen, but all I can hope is someone interested in this film reads this review and chooses literally anything else to watch. And I of course only have one question for those who actually liked/love this film: You sure you were watching the film where Leonardo DiCaprio is Howard Hughes? Seriously, just do your self a favor, spend 170 minutes of your life doing something more enjoyable than a mouthful of aluminum foil.",1
19 October 2021,Masterpiece with an all-time level performance of Leonardo DiCaprio.,"Terrific piece of filmmaking.

Half character study, half biopic, The Aviator is a darkly funny and unusually entertaining epic biopic with an unorthodox narrative structure, and groundbreaking cinematography and color grading.

And all of this is carried by Leonardo DiCaprio's magnificent portrayal of the recluse, obsessive-compulsive billionaire pioneer Howard Hughes.

It's the greatest performance ever of his entire career until now.

A must-see that is destined to become a classic in the years and decades to come.

12 March 2021,Martin's Best film,"Scorsese gives us a lot more than the Charles Foster Kane of the clouds. He keeps focus on Hughes, the dreamer, who continually reached out, grabbed the future and pulled it toward him. Bringing Hughes' life to the big screen was a task for giants. The film doesn't feel like an Scorsese movie, it has an audacious editing, homaging the Hollywood era it takes place on. DiCaprio and Blanchett are simply spectacular.

16 August 2010,An incredible film,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941.

7 February 2005,a masterpiece,"Before I went to see this I had no idea what to expect in terms of the story but was hoping to see the usual joy that Scorcese delivers. Within the first ten minutes I was still uncertain as to what I was about to watch but by the half way mark I was convinced it was something that would have an impression upon me.

By the time I left i had been astonished the film is a modern masterpiece of which every bit i loved and never found my attention once straying from the happenings upon the screen. Although I have no idea how close this is to the true life of Howrad Hughes so cannot comment upon it in a sense of accuracy but i can vouch for the amazing piece of art/entertainment which I saw and i recommend it to everyone.

30 December 2004,Remarkable / A Film to Cherish,"""The Aviator"" is a remarkable film. All involved acquit themselves well, but special kudos go to Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, and director Martin Scorsese. At first blush, Leo would not seem to be an obvious choice to portray the eccentric Howard Hughes. However, he gets it just right and accomplishes his best character development since his early role in ""Gilbert Grape."" Cate Blanchett gives what must be an Oscar-winning supporting role in her virtual reincarnation of Katherine Hepburn; the portrayal is dead on and never borders on caricature. Scorsese's steady hand is evident throughout; especially noteworthy is the evocation of the atmosphere of the 1930's and 1940's. Truly a film to cherish. 10/10.

9 January 2005,"Scorsese & Di Caprio fly in ""The Aviator.""","Martin Scorsese's latest work, ""The Aviator"" is a stunning masterpiece. It gives a brilliant depiction of eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes as he was in his prime. This film is a complete joyride from start to finish. It is a well rounded character study of one of the most interesting Americans of the 20th century. The script gives us very fine avenues to observe Howard Hughes for the man he was without trying to show us as viewers the morality of his character. The movie is a very strict observation of what it was to be Howard Hughes. Leonardo DiCaprio has outdone himself as an actor. As great as he was in Steven Spielberg's ""Catch me if you Can,"" DiCaprio gives a performance in ""The Aviator"" that is ten times more powerful & fulfilling. Dicaprio delicately captures every one of Howard Hughes quirks and patterns of odd behavior, without making it obvious. It is in the opinion of your's truly that this performance by Leonardo DiCaprio has officially solidified him as one of the finest actors of this and probably more generations to come. Other notable performances were Cate Blanchett, who was near-perfect as screen legend Katherine Hepburn, and the ever reliable John C. Reilly as Howard Hughes business manager. Jude Law was prominent in a brief scene as Errol Flynn. But it is Scorsese's direction that deserves much of the attention. This film at over 2 1/2 hours never has a dull moment. It never drags on. Every scene segues perfectly from one to the next. Hopefully the Oscars will finally honor one of our true film-making giants at this year's Academy Awards. ""The Aviator"" soars to perfection.",10
7 June 2005,Aviator /the best Scorcese Film...really,"it is the best.... let us look at the film in all its areas of excellence

out of 10

1.acting 10 an unbelievable cast, with great supporting roles and cameos, and with ""the"" most underrated leading role in quite a while, leo would and should have won best actor, if not for the enthusiasm generated by the popular breeze of another film that will be forgotten in due time when the man that it was about will never be...but when someone dies the sentimental stamp his ticket.

2.cinematography 10 the scenes of flight are my favorites and some excellent cinema moments of creation

3.direction 10 no swearing here and the drama is still at the peak of his achievements despite his excellence in the field of good swearing

4.costume 10 5.prod. design 10 6.Music 9 the only reason not a ten is cause the soundtrack made by the composer himself is limited to a few beats and most of the music is classical or timely, a fact that the golden globes missed but the academ y picked up on

7.story 9 so many people say it lacked heart, but i think it still had a lot of compassion and sadness for genius and insanity and his affliction killing his greatness..

overall it is one of the best films in the past 15 years without a doubt.",10
17 January 2005,"Really Great Movie, but needs an intermission","I found this movie, extremely enjoyable. It was exciting and very realistic. The movie did a great job of showing how much Howard had to fight to maintain control over all the projects he had going on, in spite of his mental illness. But when the chips were down, he always seemed to pull himself together to get the job done. The scenes of his testimony before Congress were especially well done. I also very much enjoyed the interaction between Howard and some of the women in his life, like Kathern Hepburn. This movie is good viewing for any history buff, who would find the life and times of Howard Hughs interesting. Only thing, a movie this long, needs an intermission for us older folks. Just a few minutes would have been fine.

27 December 2005,Need to read some of Hughes' biography to better understand movie,"Unless the viewer hasn't read up on Howard Hughes' life, they might not understand what is going on. For instance when he burned all his clothes after Hepburn broke up with him, I read that he did burn all his clothes but after finding that one of his girl friends had venereal disease. This might insinuate that Hepburn had venereal disease. Looking up if Hepburn had a disease, I found that her dad was a doctor who advanced venereal disease prevention which Kathryn later took up. One might assume from this that perhaps her father's connection with venereal disease was because his daughter may have had it. In the movie it appears as though Howard burned his clothes in reaction to Hepburn breaking off with him which doesn't make any sense only in the context of his life where at some point he burned all his clothes upon learning that one his girlfriends had venereal disease.

26 January 2005,Worst Scorsese movie,"When I watched this film I knew it would be the Oscars film of the year. It has all the ingredients but I don't think it's a good film. Any Scorses film made before this one have more personality. The aviator is well made, Scorses doesn't make any mistake (maybe too long) but it's such a very cold film. The character of Howard Hugues is great to make a film but in the end I didn't mind what happened to this man. The Academy must pay the debt with Socrses and it seems Scorses made the film just to win the Oscar. As for the actors, they are not bad even if I can't stand Cate Blanchett's affectation playing Katharine Hepburn. Leonardo Di Caprio is not bad even if he doesn't look like Howard Hugues and he seems young during the whole film. Consequently I think it's a well made boring film.

29 January 2005,Leonardo DiCaprio Was Excellent- Movie leaves little,"WAY to long. The ONLY good thing about the movie was DeCaprio's outstanding performance. He captured Hughes excellently. One thing the movie will be remembered for is DeCaprio's acting and his ability to assume a major role and run with it.

Considering Hughes was an unfortunate American tragedy, the movie lacked a lot considering its length. It was too redundant- flash bulbs- flashy '20 Hollywood. It would have been more interesting to have some element of focus on more of what exactly contributed/inspired Hughes as an aeronautical genius and movie mogul. One aspect largely ignored was his family, education, and what exactly it was that motivated him to produce movies, fly and build planes.

6 December 2005,More on the Howard Hughes we never knew...,"Aviator was one of my favorite films of 04. A brilliant script, cast, and director to boot, without knowing anything of who this man was, I was deeply impressed.

This movie tells the tale of the billionaire dreamer before he became the obsessive recluse we've all heard about. Leonardo DiCaprio completely captures the essence of a man consumed by all things in life. High strung and driven, we are really shown the soul of a man who wasn't afraid to make his dreams his first priority, even ahead of his own health and well-being. We are introduced to a man who didn't allow himself the time to deal with the hurt and sorrow that come along with the loss of love. He was just to busy being a visionary.

I truly believe that if there had been no Jamie Foxx and ""Ray,"" Dicaprio would have easily walked away with Oscar gold. A truly remarkable film, Aviator is one for the ages.

26 January 2005,"A Great, Complex, Challenging Film","This is beautiful, old-school Hollywood film-making infused with life and energy. I think it's hysterical that people are complaining that the film ""has no soul"" -- that was the same criticism leveled at Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"" back in '80 (later named the Best Film of the Decade by several critics orgs).

""The Aviator"" isn't a touchy-feely biopic. You want that, go see ""Ray"" or ""Finding Neverland"". Scorsese's films don't work that way. They don't spoon-feed easy sentiment and they don't reduce people to anecdotes. They're complex, challenging and infinitely more rewarding that either of the other two biopics nominated for Best Picture this year.

Not at the top of my ""Best Of"" list this year, but certainly my favorite of the Best Picture nominees.

23 March 2007,Just really boring..........,"I was shocked at how long & drawn out this movie was. After 1 and a half hours in, both my daughter and myself had had enough. I was hoping for a glimpse of Hollywood's ""Golden Years"" and characterizations of famous stars. Other than Cait Blanchett as Kate Hepburn - who literally made the movie for me, she was so amazing - the rest of the movie fell very flat. Leo's scowl throughout most of the movie became very annoying and the constant references to airplanes - I know, the movie was about aviation - just wasn't interesting enough to sustain a movie of that length. I felt that Leo was a thin caricature of Howard Hughes - and his descent into madness was not a convincing portrayal.

22 October 2009,Drama at its best,"This is an epic movie staging the biography of the famous Aviator Howard Hughes. It was a bizarre yet scintillating description of this character. It puts you ti thought and allows you to dream; which exactly is wanted of a movie. The movie takes you to a world a few decades back, and amicably inspires you to love this person who is a multi-talented genius. You would be drawn into the movie slowly and the experience is just indescribable. You really need to see it to believe it. This movie will make your attachment towards Leonardo-Di-caprio more deep and you will be amazed what a refined actor Hollywood has produced. Along with Departed,Titanic, Catch me if you can this movie is one of the greatest films done by the actor

27 February 2005,Scorcese Deserved the Best Director Award,"This film was an excellent portrayal of the life of Howard Hughes. Scorcese was able to pull the best out of all of his cast. The cinematography was unrivaled in this year's Oscar lineup and unfortunately the Oscar voters didn't realize this. Dicaprio is excellent beyond words in capturing the essence of Hughes as a driven man reaching for the best he could achieve. Alda was also unrecognized for his portrayal as Senator Brewster. Some of the best scenes in this movie are between Dicaprio and Alda and every time Alda brings the very nuances of Senator Brewster to life!!!!! Thank God Cate Blanchett was recognized for her interpretation of ""The Great Kate"" !!

6 January 2005,Scorsese is a master at directing.,"The Aviator starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn, Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, John C. Reilly as Noah Dietrich, Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, and Alan Alda as Sen. Ralph Owen Brewster, directed by Martin Scorsese, is a dramatic retelling of the life of filmmaker and Aviator, Howard Hughes.

The movie begins with Howard filming the 1930 hit ""Hell's Angles"", and goes onto show Howard's career designing airplanes. It also tells how Howard had to deal with OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) and how the disorder almost ruined his life. Leonardo's performance as this disordered aviator was very well acted, and he could be up for an Oscar nomination. Cate Blanchett on the other hand will most likely get an Oscar nomination, for portraying actress Katharine Hepburn, and might win it too.

Like most Scorsese films, such as ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"", The Aviator is beautifully directed, filmed, and acted. Scorsese is a master at directing grade A films, and this film proves it. (I won't be surprised if he wins the best director award) Final Grade, A-",10
24 February 2005,The Aviator Flies High,"Martin Scorsese's biopic ""The Aviator"" does a powerful job portraying the eccentric life of Howard Hughes and his love of aviation, his obsession with women and film and his ability to take risks.

Leonardo Di Caprio is believable as Hughes. We have watched DiCaprio mature before our eyes from ""Titanic"" to ""Gangs of New York"" to ""Catch Me if You Can"" to the young Hughes. He is so good that sooner or later he will win the Oscar. Hopefully it will be this time!

One of the best things about seeing a historical figure on the big screen is we learn things we never knew. Katharine Hepburn falls for the dashing, powerful, handsome and rich Hughes. If bored at a party, Hughes would take his date for a late night plane ride over Hollywood. We can understand Hepburn better after seeing her tumultuous life with Hughes and then falling for Spencer Tracy who was calm and steadying. You must find out what Hughes does to protect his old flame.

Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn is worth the price of your ticket. She recreates Hepburn from the staccato voice to her aristocratic walk.

The film accurately shows Hughes's struggle with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder that manifested in his incessant washing of hands, his fear of germs and his withdraw from life in his later years. Today, those suffering can receive treatment, unlike Hughes who did not.

Not all moviegoers will appreciate the details of building his planes and some will be bored with too much time spent on the scenes of his early film, Hell's Angels. As the owner of TWA, Hughes took on Congress and the powerful Pan Am to hone in on the overseas monopoly. Who knows where aviation would be if not for the vision and daring of Hughes, including a fiery plane crash. This Must See film is at the top of my list for Best Picture and Best Actor.

7 July 2014,Top notch,"I first saw this on its release and enjoyed it immensely. I came back to because I've been reviewing the movies of Cate Blanchett. When I watched this one on DVD, I was impressed with the overall excellence of this film, not just her performance (which was superb). Every aspect of this production is excellent. Disc 2 in particular provides details about the depth of rigour and preparation behind the scenes. The historical accuracy of Howard Hughes biographical is deep, especially DiCaprio's preparation for the portrayal of the downward spiral of OCD. I'm of the age that followed Hugh's news events from the 1940s until his death. I appreciate how this film puts it into a human perspective. Movie making at its finest with great authenticity!

7 January 2005,A career best performance from DiCaprio,"The one thing to say about this film above all else that DiCaprio's performance is quite simply sensational. He displays new hidden depths that we had not seen before from this undoubtedly talented actor. One has to say that it was a brave move by Scorsese casting him in this film after he was totally and utterly miscast in Gangs and completely overshadowed by Day Lewis. In The Aviator the opposite was true as I can hardly think of an actor who could have pulled this role off so well. The performances generally are very very strong, with the talented Cate Blanchett worthy of mention. Jude Law as Errol Flynn was also very entertaining and right on the money.

As to the film itself the sheer degree of work and thought that had clearly gone into this production was extraordinary. Time and again Scorsese seems to pull it off with one of the most versatile catalogues of work behind him of all directors. As always the camera-work was spot on from one of the best in the business at this element of a film, as was the choice soundtrack which is certainly another one of Scorsese's directorial fortes. This film must surely be in the running for at several Oscar nominations.

If one had to be critical it was a rather long movie perhaps too long, but this should not detract from its status as an instant classic.

28 February 2005,Sad for Marty on Oscar night...,"Scorsese's best film. Ever. Tour de force and bravura film-making that stays true to the subject and milieu of late 1920s-1940s Hollywood. Keep watching the film and realize the faithfulness Scorsese pays to Hughes' vision, as if it were one of the mogul's pictures. It's not as though Scorsese is like Howard Hughes (like some critics have stated), but one can still be memorized by his genius-- and seems as though it caught Scorsese to make the picture. I wish things worked out better for Hughes, but he left us with paving the ""way of the future."" Hats off to DiCaprio (as I also thought was under-appreciated in This Boys Life; Canton-Jones, 1993), who assiduously perfects Hughes unusual behavior. I admire that Scorsese left us with as a positive, albeit complex portrayal of a 20th Century wonder. Way to go Marty. Total highway robbery at the Oscars; without saying, it deserved best directing and best picture.

I'm still trying to understand Hollywood politics; what do they have against Marty? Could be that he's so independent like Hepburn, yet she won 4 awards? Or maybe because he sympathized with Hughes? Or maybe because it was the evening commemorating Lumet, and that would be insulting to him? Wrong, that's all I could say. I just don't know! Very wrong the film was not acknowledged. But you know what, neither was Apocalypse Now! In 50 years, we'll still be talking about The Aviator. 10 Stars; not Million Dollar Baby.",10
22 January 2005,Too much swearing,"I did not enjoy this movie, and in fact walked out part way through due to the large amount of swearing and the use of God's names. This was unnecessary and spoiled the picture. There was also too much time spent on Hughes' social life and not enough on Aviation( the main reason for going to the movie was an interest in the aviation aspects of Howard Hughes) Others who left at the same time commented that they were leaving for the same reasons. The movie left much to be desired. Thank you. Please note that it is too hard to write a minimum of 10 lines, surely a pithy comment of 4-5 lines should give a reasonable picture of my feelings about a movie.

28 June 2005,"It's not 'Taxi Driver' - but then again, why would it be? This is 'The Aviator'. Well done Mr Scorsese!","I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",8
6 January 2005,Finally something good from one of the Masters,"Marty S. is easily one of the greatest living filmmakers, whose influence is beyond reproach among young filmmakers. For example: no raging bull or goodfellas and you have no David Russell, no PT Anderson, no Quentin, etc. But for over 10 years, he just couldn't do it.

Casino and Brining out the Dead had elements of cinematic touches that were creative, but the films on the whole stunk up the theaters.

Finally, he's back. Maybe not as flashy and perhaps not with as much rage and verve as before. But this is a worthy effort. In fact, considering his enduring influence and innovations over the years, this would be a good opportunity to finally give him the little gold statue he deserves.

11 February 2005,"An OK movie, but not as great as the critics make us believe","I went to see this movie after the Oscar nominations, but before the actual Oscars were awarded. The Aviator got a lot of nominations and got good critics in many papers, so of course I went to the cinema with high expectations. The high expectations didn't help, but this movie was a let down to me. The filmography is nice. The music is OK, but not impressive. The story is quite nice to hear as I didn't know much about Howard Hughes. However the much appraised performance of Leonardo di Caprio is definitely not worth an Oscar in my view. Never in the movie did I feel any connection to the character of Howard Hughes. Halfway the movie I got the feeling that I was watching quite a mediocre movie. It did get better to the end, but still it left the feeling that I had watched a nice documentary of which I didn't really learn anything.

24 March 2019,Cinematographically Beautiful,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature.

23 April 2005,Good film that could have been great,"Aviator is another Scorsese film that carries on a bit too long. Great performances turned in by Leonardo and a great supporting cast make this film thoroughly enjoyable. I just wish it could have been a little shorter as I found myself nodding off from time to time. Even if it meant cutting some of the great supporting performances, it would have helped the tempo. Creating a biographical film about such an enigmatic public figure is by no means an easy task to undertake, and the length doesn't overly detract from a very nice film.

I definitely recommend any and all to see this film if you haven't already as it is a great study of one of this country's pioneers and the disease that ultimately cut his career short.

9 June 2005,Stick to your Italian mafia related films Martin,"The Aviator was a movie i went to see because it is directed by Martin Scorses, and i think there may have been a little mafia influence on Howard Hughes, But to my disappointment there was not. Martin Scorsese, I think you've done 2 of the best film ever made in ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" and I'm sure there would be millions of people worldwide who would agree. I wish i had contact with you Mr Scorsese because i think you are the best film director that has ever lived. I would love to see 1 more Sicilian or Italian-American related Mafia movie before the end of your career. Now how good would that be for a fairytale someone who showed us what life is really like in the Mob !!

23 March 2023,Good film,"Good film - The presentation of the film, in an evolving color (from two-tone Technicolor, as Martin explained it to us, to three-tone, to modern by the later sequences) is absolutely stunning, and the cinematography by renowned Robert Richardson, ASC, is some of the best I've seen (and, in my opinion, deserving of an Oscar).

Cate Blanchett was impeccable as Katharine Hepburn, though, at times, I felt that the complexity of her character was never really deeper than a surface analysis.

She did her role flawlessly, but this is not to say that it really Alec Baldwin portrayed one of the flattest villains I've seen in a major motion picture, but, again, this is about Howard Hughes, and DiCaprio's performance is worthy of an Oscar nod at least, and perhaps an Oscar Win (certainly the best performance I've seen all year).

One of my few complaints, though, is the lengthy sequences featuring Howard Hughes as a solo aviator. Though interesting, entertaining even, the film was long enough already, and did not require such an exhaustive analysis of individual flight procedures.",6
6 June 2005,Not a classic,"I gave this film a five - OK the camera shots move a lot and the nervy way that they portray Hughes is sometimes a bit to much to take in without a break in concentration, but the film generally is good, although at times slow. If you read a short write up first of Howard Hughes then it will help you to better understanding the film and why it was made in this way, simply because that is how he was and to work with him must have been a nightmare. But he is one of histories greats and if not for any over reason a insight to this man and his achievements cannot due you any harm. Definitely not one for the collection but worth giving a go.

12 January 2005,A Compelling Story,"It is very difficult to tell the story of someone as dynamic as Howard Hughes. I applaud the director for his efforts and especially appreciated the choice to deliver a movie that did not overstate the obvious (Hughes was wealthy, his father invented the drill bit that allowed drillers to plunge deeper for oil, his eccentric OCD behavioral defects, his contempt for affable conjecture...). In place of all of that the film makers chose to reveal the origin of the man's zeal. His intent to DO things by the force of his own will and by using his money to do it. His failures were not something that could be laid to blame on someone else as often the case in today's business environ'. Mr. Hughes took chances because he had the access and availability to do so which by itself sets him apart from most people. The film took you inside the man himself not his mere accomplishments. I got a sense that Howard Hughes was a man of fortitude. A man who said little to boast his successes but acted on what was up to his challenge and in that I mean the challenge he put to himself each day-to be the best at what he did and if not the best then he would certainly run the course to the end. Is it any wonder he was OCD? I think this film spoke to those who have not lost sight of their dreams and while not all of us will have the great fortune Howard Hughes enjoyed at least the race will never cease to be an exciting if not capricious ride.",8
2 January 2005,"Not his best, but the best of 2004","There have been few movies that have really ""moved"" me enough to really want to go. However, I have still gone to see many. This one intrigued me, but mostly because it was Scorsese, rather than the subject of Howard Hughes.

I left the theater feeling enlightened, not by moral or plot or any such nonsense. Instead, Scorsese had created an almost perfect visual experience. Through pseudo-colorization, well-integrated computer sequences, and a perfect balance between fast- and slower-paced scenes, he had achieved what many movies attempted at this year, but had still failed to create - style. Instead of a simple retelling of a story, which is what many directors do to ""true story"" movies, Scorsese creates out of it a work of art. Instead of simply creating a platform for a story to spring from, the director conveys the art, the sound, and the story all simultaneously. This is something I greatly appreciate from movies. A story can be told through a book, but a truly good movie should be able to portray itself through beauty of sights and sounds in addition to the story itself.

The acting was superb on all accounts. There was no actor that I would have replaced. It was nice that when I was watching the movie, I was able to make DiCaprio not be ""DiCaprio playing Hughes."" In other words, actors were not themselves, but really did seem to become the characters themselves. It was easy to get lost in the who's who of secondary characters, and though he tried to overcome this drawback to the subject itself, Scorsese could not completely remedy the situation. So if you have trouble remembering someone's name in the film, just try to remember at least what their purpose is.

The movie was long, and I realize that will turn away many people. A lot of reviewers and critics have complained that the movie feels even longer than it is. But to me, it passed by quite briskly. Nothing felt dragged out, and it seemed to end as soon as it began.

Overall, I feel like The Aviator deserves more credit than it seems to be deserving. I would definitely go see it again, just to immerse myself in the sense-exciting experience once- again",8
11 October 2005,Mastery,"There's no such thing as the perfect movie, but I consider myself a harsh critic and The Aviator was immediately one of my favorites. It's one of the only movies I've ever seen twice in the theater. If it had been performed live, I would have been on my feet at the curtain drop. I have heard some people say they didn't like it, mainly because it was either too dark or too slow. In my opinion, it was right on target as far as the mood created by the film in relation to Howard Hughes' life. The balance, especially, was appropriate. It would be hard to respect a biographical movie about a real person (with a life much darker than was depicted by the movie, I might add) if that movie ignored one of the most important characteristics of its star. Hughes led a tragic life. I'm a fan of creative artistry in film, as opposed to disliking a movie if it doesn't have a fast pace or lots of emotional evocation from the audience. That being said, I found the Aviator to be a fantastic display of cinematic mastery (and I'm not even a huge Scorsese fan). It is one of the most inspiring movies I have ever seen (especially for young people), and the thrill of dramatic events in history being made by Hughes are portrayed in a way that really captivated my own thrill and even caused me to forget about the movie theater I was sitting in at times (a rare thing). The best part about it is its historic accuracy - excellent for Hollywood, especially in a movie that was made to astound the audience. It's true, the tone is dark for a lot of the movie, but it's rightfully so. Howard Hughes led an astounding but privately tragic life, and I see that translated on screen in an appropriate-for-a-movie manner. Not too depressing, but not to flippant. And there's plenty of breathtaking action if that's what you're looking for. On a side note, I have never liked Leonardo DiCaprio. I take credit for some of his not-so-romantic nicknames. But in The Aviator, I find, he has finally come into his won as an actor. Until now I've seen his acting as immature and green, but he has finally become a man. Not only that, but I applaud Scorsese for casting Leo because there are times when the physical similarity between him and Hughes is amazing. I never would have guessed.

My recommendation: read a quick online biography or two about Howard Hughes before you see the film. I did, and I found his life story fascinating, not to mention that it complements the movie and makes it much more enjoyable to watch - being well informed about what's going on.",9
31 January 2005,a American film!,"this film is a American film! oh, i must be shitting! am i crazy? what i mean is that if you want to know what the film tells us, you have to be a American or you have to read so something to help you to understand this film, to get who the guy is, what he had done, why he had to done all these things! but we the audiences would not go to the library first and then go to the cinema for a film, though it is directed by martin Scorsese. but about this film, i love its actors, they all acted wonderfully. of course the leading actor is extremity good! his second girlfriend whose name i don't remember is very good either, especially the talking way,nice!

The supporting cast was nothing short of excellent.The awards should be there for this movie...Scorese is up to speed on this film. The length of the movie was needed to get everything in, any shorter and it would have left the audience wanting more.For me it lived up to its billing, the music was great and the sets and locations. Not much was missed on this movie, I can't think of anything I didn't like about it. It captured the essence of the man.The Aviator is a winner, from start to finish. 4 Stars.. E X C E L L E N T.

11 January 2005,Great Movie!,"Although I thought I knew a great deal about the life of Howard Hughes, this movie brought me back to reality. I found that I knew only small bits of his public life. What an outstanding biographical sketch of someone who could truly be called a ""mad genius."" Experiencing this film allows you to peek into the private, and sometimes all to public, life of one of the great pioneers of modern aviation. His brilliance as a genius in the world of aviation is shown in balance with his personal battle with mental disease. It as an unforgettable experience and left me wanting more. It is long, but I didn't mind and wished that it had given me more. When you see it, you will understand why I say this. Leonardo DiCaprio is very good as Hughes, but Cate Blanchet steals the movie as the only woman who really understands and accepts him as a person who has value outside of his exploits in the air and his great wealth. It's a don't miss movie!!!!

12 January 2005,Scorsese Soars . . . Oscar Rewards?,"The Aviator ****

Despite all round disappointment at the performance of 'Gangs of New York', both at the box office and the major award ceremonies, Harvey Weinstein was still prepared to put his money where his mouth was and trust Scorsese with another mammoth project. And for this we should all be grateful, for 'The Aviator' is a magnificent achievement. Some would argue that it is Scorsese's best effort since 'Goodfellas', and it is without question the most mainstream. Praise is dually deserved all round;

Leonardo DiCaprio gives the performance of his career and without doubt deserves an Oscar nomination (even though he has no chance going up against Jamie Foxx). His brings both charm and arrogance to Hughes' earlier years, and his portrayal of the main protagonist's slide into insanity is breathtaking. Scorsese certainly brings the best out an actor I once thought of as little more than mediocre.








However, there are a few niggling complaints that stop 'The Aviator' from soaring to the realm of the classics;







Yet these are minor quibbles for such a fantastic film, which will surely outstrip 'Gangs of New York' both commercially and critically. This is an absolute must see film which, despite being three hours in length, hurtles along like one of Hughes' many incredible creations. A brilliant film about a truly brilliant, if flawed, man. And as for Scorsese winning 'Best Director'? Go on Oscar, you know you want to . . .

Adam Cox gives 'The Aviator' 4/5.",9
12 January 2005,"Overall, a good introductory biography to a great man","I saw a TV spot with the director Martin Scorcese a few months ago and the idea of the film grabbed me. I went into the cinema knowing nothing about Howard Hughes but came out knowing a lot more. The story documents the main part of his career as a film director and aviator and the transition into mental illness. The film does well in portraying Hughes as the underdog against the big boys, desperate to share his pioneering dreams with the world and succeeding.

The film also shows the 'playboy' side of his lifestyle as he woos some of the biggest names in showbiz at the time, including his big love Catherine Hepburn, well played by Blanchett.

Effects-wise the big plane scene was well executed and used CGI to aid rather than substitute the action which looked great.

The only negative thing I'd have to comment on, is the length of the film. Personally, I start losing interest around the 2 and a quarter hour mark and this film came in another half an hour longer. If you're prepared for the length though, there's no reason not to go and see this great film. Others have said it doesn't go into the depth of Hughes' life as much as they'd like which is fair enough but to the average cinema-goer who has no previous knowledge of Hughes and his life's-work, it will definitely leave you thirsty for more!",8
11 January 2005,Impressed,"To be honest, I've carried a negative impression of DiCaprio since ""Titanic,"" and especially the disastrous ""Man in the Iron Mask,"" so I went into the movie with low expectations.

I measure a movie by how it affects me in the days after. There are two things that really worked for me. First was the depiction of his torture and descent into his madness. Haunting. I'll never wash my hands and not think about it. Second was the way Scorsese put you in the cockpit, and captured the feel of being the Aviator.

The Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale roles as Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner were incredible. Beckinsale in particular nearly knocks you off your seat with her Hollywood beauty.

30 December 2004,"Re: Amateurish, fictional account of part of Howard Hughes life","The prior account referenced by this comment was written by someone who obviously felt that expressing his opinions without any basis in fact was better than keeping his typing fingers busy in other endeavors.

While the screen-writers certainly took liberties with some aspects of Howard Hughes life, there is no denying that most of the important facts are public record as they were recorded in the press and broadcast on live television. The way in which his craziness was manifested is also public knowledge and has been written about extensively by many biographers. The fact that they chose to show that craziness a decade before it began to rule his life is why this movie is a biopic instead of a biography. It is a story about an enigma, and they tried to crack the nut of the enigma by taking minor liberties with his personal, tortured times in order to help us see how his insanity both informed his work and destroyed his life. That's the nature of movies. Exact movie biographies DO NOT exist. They are unfilmable and unwritable. All movies are about perspective, and this one is no different.

The acting was, by and large, superb. Leonardo DiCaprio finally made a major movie alongside major stars and demonstrated how versatile and subtle his characterizations can be. Cate B.'s performance was more of a characterization. She didn't need to mimic Ms. Hepburn as strongly as she did. She came off as more of a cartoon than a human being.

The script was also surprisingly superb. John Logan's previous scripts for Star Trek, Gladiator, and The Time Machine were pretentious and meandering. This was tight, smart, and powerful.

The direction, especially during the Hell's Angels sequences, was also superb. There are few like Martin Scorsese who can paint on such a big palette and still keep things delicate and intimate. It is also gratifying to see him return to telling stories about complex, passionate people without relying on overcooked scripts or overcooked actors.

This was a very fine movie. In my mother's words, ""I can't believe he made me cry for a man like Howard Hughes.""",
8 October 2006,An unusual film,"Howard Hughes makes an interesting choice of subject for Martin Scorsese. This is, as you would expect, beautifully filmed- the colouration process used throughout being of perhaps particular interest. Unfortunately for me, I just didn't buy it. It might just be that I am not a big fan of Leonardo Di Caprio- although he puts in (what I personally consider) a career-best performance in this film; or maybe it was an inability to engage fully with the subject- Howard Hughes is probably a somewhat obscure figure to most people nowadays, besides it is possibly difficult for most people to identify with a reclusive billionaire. Another point that can be made is that there are several continuity and factual errors throughout the film. Although this is not immediately obvious on first viewing, it leaves the impression that perhaps the film crew's attention was not as focused as it might have been during shooting, and this is certainly the impression that I was left with. In short, it's a good film, but certainly not one of Scorsese's best.

its a great story about a weird man who tried to change the world of film, aviation and so much more, and I think Scorsese made the perfect film about Howard Hughes...

23 January 2005,fabulous darling.,"I took a huge risk and saw the film with a man who is far more into Fellini and Bergmann than in mainstream Hollywood. However we both enjoyed it and the time just flew, unlike the Spruce Goose. Leo has matured so much as an actor and considering he was in almost every scene it was a big job for him but he embraced it from start to finish. Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn was greatly believable and really showed her conflicts and insecurities. Leo, Cate and Martin Scorsese all deserve top prize for this compelling film that just gave us a glimpse into the character of Hughes.

I got on the internet and read up on the wildly eccentric and quite mentally ill recluse. His connections with the Republican party, the CIA and so much more could only be done in a biography of 3 days or at least a trilogy. A definite ""must see again"" film.

10 January 2005,Capturing the Essence of Hughes,"Martin Scorsese has just made another great film. Although some scenes in this film might have been shortened (Hughes solo flights, his relationship with Katherine Hepburn, building the planes), I felt that the overall effect of the film was to convey the essence of what made Hughes tick.

We didn't need to know everything about his childhood or his latter years in this film, it's not a documentary and we can always go to the library to find out more. What we got was a character study of a man who everyone thinks they know about and whose fatal flaws of obsessional behaviours/phobias starting in childhood were the emotional engine that drove him to see things through to completion. His weaknesses were his strengths and then ultimately his downfall.

Hughes seemed to inspire loyalty in those closest to him and although the film is on a grand scale, it seems a very personal story. Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Howard Hughes is first rate and sympathetic. Expect Oscars to be directed thick and fast at this movie for direction, cinematography and best male lead. A visual feast that leaves you with more food for thought.",9
15 January 2005,Casting was terrible in this film,"I thought the only actor that was cast right was Leonard. Kate was NOT cast right, nor was anyone else. It distracted me from the film because they did not look the least bit like the people they were to portray. Give me a break, the people he cast must have been his friends, because no one wants to see actors that don't look like who they are portraying. I like the actors in the film, but they should not be in this film, in these parts. Get actors that look like the real people. There are thousands, yes, thousands of SAG actors that can act, that actually look like these people. Why in the world would Marty ruin this film with not one look-a-like? I am so unhappy about these great actors being put in a film that they should not be in. Come on now, they don't need the work. Marty, please think next time and do the casting right.

6 February 2012,Cate Blanchett shines,"Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator"" is grand spectacle with a reverence for the nostalgic, set in simpler times. As a snapshot of Howard Hughes's life from 1927 to 1947, ""The Aviator"" is a portrait of a man of genius and unmatched innovation, and also a man debilitated by severe obsessive compulsive disorder and extreme depression. ""The Aviator"" has an amazing performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, and a mesmerizing performance by Cate Blanchett, who seems to inhabit the role of Katherine Hepburn-- the love of Hughes's life. However, the one indelible image I have of the film is the scene in which Hughes is frozen in the men's restroom, because he can't make himself touch the door knob for fear of germs and contamination. Granted this was a time before obsessive compulsive disorder existed as a diagnosis. The scene is intended as a dramatic arc, distinguishing a tragic flaw in Hughes. However, for me it seemed overly indulgent, and was curious regarding the scene length. Much like most of the nearly 3 hour movie, this is an exercise in indulgence, and attention to detail that is only that. Scorsese's balance between Hughes's genius and his great suffering is good melodrama, but not very inspiring. I have a particular affinity for Howard Hughes the man. Had John Lone's (and Michael Mann's) story followed Hughes through the 1950's and beyond, the story would be even sadder. ""The Aviator"" illustrates the highs of genius, and the abyss of near insanity. This is an accurate depiction of an amazing man's life, but it is skewed toward the broken aspect. So just personally for me, it was frustrating to watch. To Scorsese's credit, one gets that he has immense compassion for Howard Hughes.

Hughes' life sentence is established in the opening scene. Hughes's mother while bathing the young Hughes, tells him something that perhaps leads to his obsessive compulsive nature. Apparently he is incomplete in his relationship with his mother, and the story surrounding what she said.",7
12 March 2005,Incoherent beautiful film lines,"film tries to follow two different lines, Howard Hughes, The talented young successful man and the man beneath. viewer follows this two lines, difficult to know which one is the main purpose of film, and this is towards the end that film tries to complete the balance by dedicating few minutes, showing locked Howard, in the editing room without giving you any reason why such scene should last for so long? and the meaningless visit of Katharine Hepburn. Divide was also obvious in the way film was going forth. it became theatrical in the last 45 minutes being so different to initial part. yet beautifully directed. this is an example that how you can make a different film with not an untold story by attaching a different line of events to it.

8 January 2005,Film presents lots of wonderful visuals,"This is the first film I've seen starring Leonardo DiCaprio, so I had no preconceived notions of what he'd be like in the role. This was an exciting film from beginning to end, and because it covers many milestones in aviation history, it was very worthwhile to spend the time and the money to see it. I have ordered the soundtrack CDs and look forward to listening to them. I am not a fan of Katherine Hepburn, but I certainly remember the ruckus over Jane Russell. The posts here at IMDb provide lots of supporting info, such as the one previous which mentioned that the Hughes Tool company made money from a drill bit. Of course, there are probably biogs in print in which we could learn more about Howard Hughes. BTW, his medical research institutes are another important legacy, and worth a visit to their website.

30 January 2005,Scorsese solidifies his legacy as a genius,"Martin Scorsese is one of the most ingenious filmmakers of all time. The way in which he handled a subject he knew little about was remarkable. DiCaprio's best performance to date. I was one of those who thought of DiCaprio as a prettyboy actor, but he sheds that image rather quickly. He was the heart and soul behind the entire operation. DiCaprio lobbied hard for this film to come to fruition and it shows by way of his performance. He deserves nothing less than the Best Actor statue. Giamatti and Fox were excellent, but DiCaprio takes it to another level with his depiction of Howard Hughes.

Scorsese and DiCaprio bring the story of a true American hero to life. Several scenes which were breathtaking were the dialog between Leonardo and Alan Alda, Hells Angel filming, and Hughes record flying attempts. The film is easily the top 3 films of 2004. GO OUT AND SEE IT!!

6 June 2005,wow a 7.6 rating,"I thought the movie was all right. It was to long, they could have cut out most of the scenes about Hughes losing his mind, personally a I knew he was crazy before I went to see it so I didn't think they had to waste an hour and a half on it. But it was just a movie so it doesn't really matter, the thing that bothers me is that IMDb gives it a 7.6 and the the people that voted for it gave it a 7.6 this is one of the few movies on here that gets the rating people vote for. I just got done looking at a movie that got a 3.6 rating by IMDb and the people voted a 7.6 WOW thats not right. I guess Warner must have paid them off, I would really like to know who pays there bills.

13 February 2005,disappointing + not interesting (sorry...),"Howard Hughes was 1m93 tall but just why does DiCaprio look like 1m68 max? Besides, he has such an irritating squeaky voice... The movie is technically perfect, the cinematography is outstandingly beautiful, every scene is like a Rembrandt, but there is just nothing happening. The movie has no interest to anybody, it is not entertaining, the dialogs are irrelevant and boring... I'm sure it was unbelievably expensive, but money alone doesn't make a good picture. There is a lot of ""rumors"" that this would be ""finally Mr.Scorcese's year"". Mr. Scorcese has made some of the finest movies of all time, the first to name is ""Raging Bull"". He doesn't need credits for this.

31 December 2004,I Liked it!,"First of all, I'm an aviation and history buff so the very nature of the film held interest to me. On the other hand, I'm also quick to note historical inaccuracies in films - darn it anyway (I hate it when I do that). But they were few and far between.

The film was great and I look forward to seeing it again. The best part for me though was finally seeing Leonardo Di Caprio giving a terrific performance. Other than ""Titanic"" he always seems a little out of character until now.

Also as an employee for Boeing, it was especially interesting to learn more about the commercial airline business and the politics being played. Some really good acting.

4 February 2005,Excerpt of the Life of Howard Hughes,"The Aviator was a fascinating biopic on Howard Hughes, the great aviator, filmmaker and industrialist of the mid-20th century. The name doesn't symbolize so much to today's culture, but for those of us over 40, he was the Donald Trump of his day - but with more genuine wealth and success.

The approach that Scorcese takes is fascinating in that he touches on Hughes' womanizing ways without, perhaps, elevating them to the same level that they really were; and we don't see his failed marriages (shallow as they were in reality). Instead Scorcese focuses mostly on what was, in reality, a short-lived romance with Katherine Hepburn and a shallow relationship with Ava Gardner. Hughes dated virtually every starlet that went through Hollywood between the 1930's and 1950's.

Scorcese also chronicles the many bizarre idiosyncrasies of Hughes. The portrait takes Adrian Monk to the extreme! Much of this was rumor when it was actually happening - and, who know what the truth is? No doubt, however, the weight of the evidence is that Hughes had serious obsessive-compulsive issues, especially as they related to illness, and other damaging psychological problems that seemed to deteriorate over time. I appreciated Scorcese's empathetic portrayal of the man, though there was much, indeed, to dislike in him. Yet, we are left with a touch of sadness for his circumstance.

Leonardo DeCaprio certainly deserves his Oscar nomination (though it is very unlikely he'll win). DeCaprio is a much better actor than he is given credit for - as he has had to fight against the ""teen-idol"" image. His youth is a bit of a detriment as Hughes ages - some of his statements when he is hold up in his film room sound a bit too youthful. Aside from that brief moment, however, he pulls the role off exceptionally well.

One of the best features of this movie is the subtlety with which Scorces - while focusing on the person of Howard Hughes - genuinely captures the era of the 30's, 40's and 50's with set design and period music. This is one of the main features of the film that can leave the viewer feeling good walking out of such a movie. I rate it an 8 + out of 10.",8
25 January 2005,Glamour in air,"Beautiful cars, awesome planes, glamorous people - with a good story. Bery entertaining!

Scorsese has always really good eye for time - music and clothes and even people behavior match really good to the feeling of the era. Or at least how it feels now seventy years after.

diCaprio is a really good actor - it seems that all he needs is a good director. And obviously a matching role. once again when he acts an unstable person, he is in his best.

Women for the movie were picked very well - Blanchett as a high class twit and Bekingsale being just so beautiful and glamorous. Beautiful.

25 January 2005,In my mind.. a comeback for Leonardo..!,"Well i've never been much into Leonardo Di Caprio (spelled right?), but well he was good in ""catch me if you can"", but in other movies he just kind of looks like me.. goofy and misplaced in the roles he is playing! Just think he was better when he did Basketball diaries and Streets of New York... But in my mind he actually revitalized himself in ""The Aviator""..! Possibly one of his best performances ever..! I actually didn't think he had this much talent, but i think he really set the tone for further roles in the future.. cause boy, Leonardo much have some one teaching him how to pose with the face with the different expressions..! He really is very convincing in the role of Howard Hughes and i believe he deserves a lot of recognition and pads on the shoulder for this one...!

Great plot and a fat Baldwin makes this movie so true..! Just love Baldwin in that bad ass role, wheres he's not a complete jerk off, but almost.. :-) You cant help to like him anyhow..!

And then last but not least Leonardo..! Forever to come, i will see his movies, for he has truly put me down on my knees begging for mercy on this one.. i cant have a nag against a guy doing a movie so true and inspiring..!

Great cast, great monologues and a serious messed Leo..! :-D

Downsides in the movie aren't worth to be mentioned..! If u feel somethings didn't fit.. they probably didn't, but i ain't gonna tell u what..! :-)

GREAT MOVIE ! Not a 10'er, but still a great movie !",9
6 February 2005,"""The Aviator"" was an excellent biopic. DiCaprio and Scorsese are Masters of their craft.","Leonardo DiCaprio could have been SpiderMan. He could have been Anakin Skywalker. But instead he chose to be Howard Hughes. I suspect because he enjoys a challenge. Now, after seeing the film, I believe he not only rose to the occasion, but encapsulated every facet of the complex mind of Hughes; the sad and tormented man who became a legend.

The movie opens on the set of Howard Hughes' first film ""Hell's Angels"" and continues to follow him into the mid-forties. We see his womanizing, his staggering aeronautical ingenuity, his debilitated mental state, and eventually his U.S. government hearings.

A biopic is always harder for an actor than a regular picture because they cannot make any part of the character up; they can't fill in the gaps with fiction because whoever they are portraying is or was real.

Yet DiCaprio pulls off the performance like he knew Hughes, his wild eyes and accent show a smart businessman and at the same time allow a glimpse at the compulsive personality underneath.

The performance shows unrelenting honesty and depth of character (which is at least partly due to the real Hughes) in the deft changes throughout the film. You are allowed to see all sides of the mogul.

For instance, you may see him joy flying with Katherine Hepburn, sliding jokes into the character's witty banter like a normal person, but conversely the airplane's steering wheel is covered in cellophane because ""you'd be surprised what's on other peoples' hands."" Cate Blanchett, Gwen Stefani, and Kate Beckinsale also provide wonderful performances as the era's starlets.

Martin Scorsese, who has never won an Oscar, is being adorned with a nomination for Best Direction. Hopefully, the Academy will sift through the other movie makers and focus on the great direction of this film.

The dogfight sequences in the filming of ""Hell's Angels"" are broad in scope and move swiftly, but still manage to focus on Hughes in the cockpit of the camera plane complete with his own roll of film. Scorsese also uses light to illuminate certain important images and detach the audience from others. Darkness becomes synonymous with Hughes' insanity. These techniques blend well with the feel of the twenties, being a time piece.

This movie depicts an American icon completely, relying on the real Howard Hughes' external image and internal conflict; and the actors' and the director's eye for both bluntness and subtlety. The combination is explosive, exciting, saddening, and inspirational. ""The Aviator"" soars high above the rest!",9
7 February 2005,It's entertaining yet something is missing,"Although this movie was very entertaining I felt that it was choppy, plodding in places and talky, talky, talky. Further, I feel that a more masculine and rugged actor should have been chosen to play Howard Hughes. Not that DiCaprios acting was bad, it wasn't, in fact it was very good. My opinion is that DiCaprio just isn't manly enough to realistically play Hughes. I thought that DiCaprio was miscast in Gangs of New York as well, but perfectly cast in Catch Me If You Can. Cate Blanchett is very clever as Kate Hepburn and Kate Beckinsale is wonderful as Ava Gardner. Alan Alda is a convincing arch rival and villain as Sen. Owen Brewster and although the flight scenes were fabulous it just wasn't enough. The movie is unquestionably good and cannot and should not be dismissed, but it left me feeling unfulfilled. It was close but just not quite good enough. I was entertained but disappointed. Scorsese has done better.

27 February 2005,Scorsese robbed again,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",8
11 March 2005,Should have won,"I thought Cate Blanchett rocked, and DiCaprio totally impressed me. I had just watched him (on video) in 'Catch Me if You Can' (another good movie, also, strangely, involving TWA - strange for me, at least, to see the two films within one week of each other), and had begun changing my opinion on him (for the better) and then saw this, and now it's confirmed. I was very surprised that Aviator didn't win best picture. I didn't see the other films, but I thought this film was utterly perfect, certainly by classic Hollywood film standards - it gave no more, nor held anything back than it should have. It was cohesive, beautiful, seamless.

Best line in the film: ""love what you've done with the place..."" Also: I found myself watching DiCaprio's face at times and seeing Tom Cruise there. Then I wondered - wow, I would love to see Tom Cruise play this role, just for kicks, or comparison, if there is any. It was like DiCaprio playing Tom Cruise playing Howard Hughes. Anyone else see this?

30 July 2005,A job very well done,"I'll be short.

The plane's flying are photographed more beautifully than any other film ever. It shows a thrill just as Top Gun.

The music while flying happens to be my favorite classical pieces. Fuga in d of Bach and the Requiem of Mozart, but played like I've never heard it.

This is a story that had to be told. I knew the man (Huges) from NGC documentaries, but he deserved a movie.

The drama is strong. It 's been a while since I saw such a tormented soul as Huges.

Wonderful directing, very good acting.",8
24 November 2006,"The life story of Howard Hughes, an eccentric but incredibly talented and dedicated man.","Before I saw this movie I had never heard of Howard Hughes. I am now completely fascinated by the man. Unfortunately, the movie itself was not particularly impressive.

Acting: DiCaprio's character was good and I think deeper and more developed than most roles he chooses (a certain Shakespearean movie comes to mind,) but a bit too reminiscent of Johnny Depp's Ed Wood for my personal tastes. However as I am strongly convinced that originality is much dead, so it didn't bother me too much. I thought Blanchett's character was brilliant in the beginning, but she dropped a lot of mannerisms she brought out of her character in one of her first scenes as the movie progressed, which was disappointing. Most of the other acting was passable if not well done. However (harsh, I know) TV actors with quasi-permanent roles should never switch to movies, because they have associated themselves with a certain person and their face no longer has the needed anonymity for any role. *coEdwardHerrmannugh*

Visually: Vastly disappointing. Some of the blame can be placed on actors who refuse to do the exact same performance and gestures in every take from every angle, but a good editor should be able to work around that. Also, there was way too much camera movement. There was an overkill of shots, oftentimes when it didn't even make sense for the camera to be moving. Artsy shots were overly abundant and oftentimes unnecessary. The Aviator was not written to be an artsy movie, and many interesting shots and camera movements drew attention to themselves rather than intensifying the action. Normally I'm all for trying to film in new ways, but it didn't fit.

Story: A very interesting story, but it's so chaotic (possibly the point) that it makes it almost impossible to follow. Many stories get dropped after their introduction only to be randomly alluded to later. Hughes life was chaotic, but I don't think is a good enough reason to try to make every aspect of the man's life into a main point in the film. All that we, as viewers, get from that is a series of confused, sudden snapshots of a man's life. None of which ever actually make complete sense.

I suggest: If there's a documentary out about the man, that would probably be a better route.",4
8 September 2005,A Contemporary Masterpiece,"We've all seen one movie that simply moved us in an extraordinary way. For me, it would have to be The Aviator. I'm not going to argue about how great the movie was or how high it ranks on my ""personal movie list"" simply because every single person is different. I loved the movie, but I can totally relate, in one way or another, to a person that hated this movie. The fact of the matter is that even the person who thought the movie was lackluster probably acknowledges (somewhere in their consciousness) the fact that the movie was much different than any other they've seen in a while. The movie's best quality, in my opinion, is its originality. The airplane sequences, the lavish Hollywood parties and the way the movie was shot (not with a standard camera but with another type) definitely contributed to its originality. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was how ""heavy"" it really was at times. From a critics' point of view, this movie ranks among the best of the year, but then again, Fight Club was harshly criticized and it turned out to be what our ""lost generation"" was lusting for.

16 June 2023,Awesome Picture!,"The Aviator is a 2004 biographical drama film directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes. The film chronicles Hughes' life from the early 1920s to the late 1940s, focusing on his career as a film producer, aviator, and industrialist. The film also stars Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, Alec Baldwin, Gwen Stefani, and John C. Reilly.

The Aviator was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $373 million worldwide. It was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for DiCaprio. The film won five awards, including Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Supporting Actress for Blanchett.

DiCaprio's performance in The Aviator is widely considered to be one of the best of his career. He captures Hughes' eccentricity, brilliance, and paranoia with uncanny accuracy. Blanchett is also excellent as Katharine Hepburn, giving a performance that is both charming and heartbreaking.

The Aviator is a visually stunning film, with Scorsese's trademark style on full display. The film's recreation of the Golden Age of Hollywood is particularly impressive. The film is also well-acted, with strong performances from DiCaprio, Blanchett, and the rest of the cast.

Overall, The Aviator is a masterful film that is both entertaining and educational. It is a must-see for fans of Martin Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio, and the Golden Age of Hollywood.

Here are some of the pros and cons of The Aviator:

Pros:

Excellent performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett Visually stunning Well-written and directed Informative about Howard Hughes Cons:

Can be slow-paced at times Some historical inaccuracies Not for everyone Overall, The Aviator is a well-made film that is worth watching for its performances, direction, and cinematography. However, it is important to be aware of its slow pacing and historical inaccuracies before watching.",10
20 June 2005,An Acquired Taste,"After seeing this movie and discussing it with friends, I felt in a rather sorry minority. I thought this film was REALLY good. I came away from it thinking ""Wow. I've just seen an amazing film."" Just at that moment, however, my friend exclaimed - ""That was rubbish!"" A mixed response, then.

So what was it about this film that I liked so much? Maybe it was my extreme dislike of Leonardo DiCaprio being overpowered by his amazingly affecting portrayal of Howard Hughes. Maybe it was my extreme admiration of Cate Blanchett achieving new heights as I witnessed an intricacy of character rarely seen by any actress. Maybe it was the complexity of storyline that seemed to hang together effortlessly, despite going in a plethora of directions. Maybe it was the direction, the writing or the cinematography. Maybe it was all these things. But whatever it was, it did the trick.

Some bad points... My dislike of 'star-studdedness' was something that did not change from watching this film. Scorcese really needs to do something about his obsession for getting at least five major names in every film. It's just annoying. Watching the film, whenever anyone famous came on, my thoughts were simply, ""Big wow."" Great acting, but that's just not the point. It just seems like he's trying to say, ""Look, everybody wants to be in my film."" Why have Jude Law and Ian Holm playing such small parts? Also, it just seemed at times like a spoof of an old school Hollywood movie, with everyone famous playing everyone famous.

Also, I have to agree with those who say that the film did not really 'go anywhere'. It was a shame that although there was great acting, great character study, great effects on the whole, great direction and cinematography, the story was let down a bit through lack of direction and focus. But I don't feel this is a major enough problem to write the film off. For me, everything else in this film made this issue fade away into near obscurity.

My dislike of Kate Beckinsale's acting in this movie was made up for by the likes of Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda and John C. Reilly (plus of course the two leads) who were all excellent. A bit of a surprise to see Gwen Stefani, but she held her own pretty well. And fans of the Wainwright family will enjoy the music...

Altogether I thought it was a great film. Lots to see and think about, and simply amazing portrayals of the characters. DiCaprio really makes the movie - which I never thought I'd hear myself saying - as the obsession, insanity, determination, genius, and simply unbelievable balls of Howard Hughes just came out of him as if he were designed for this film.

In conclusion then... I think this film is probably an acquired taste. You won't like it if you just like a good story. You won't like it if you don't like famous actors. You won't like it if you're an obsessive nitpicker. If you like good cinematography, good direction, good acting, and the '30s, you will really like this film. I would say it's worth watching even if you think you won't like it. You may just be surprised...",8
1 January 2005,"Amazing performances, incredible cast, and fantastic visuals","I was a little iffy about going to see an almost-three-hour movie about a man that I knew very little about, but I really like Leo and Cate, so I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad that I did. I didn't look at my watch once through the course of the movie, and I was disappointed when it was over. I actually left the theater and went to Borders to find a biography about Hughes, so I could learn more about the man and his life. The casting for this movie was truly inspired. Leonardo DiCaprio will win an Oscar for this performance, and I won't be surprised if Cate Blanchett does, too. Her performance of Katharine Hepburn was amazing. At first I was a little worried that she was going to overact the part, but once the character had a chance to develop, I was captivated. She really channels the famous actress, complete with the clenched-jawed speech, imperious posture, and even the slight tremble. I can't believe that this is the same woman who played Elizabeth I, Galadriel, Veronica Guerin, and Lucinda Leplastrier. The other casting decisions where perfect, as well. John C. Reilly once again shines as a solid supporting actor. I really hope that he gets to be a lead actor some day. Alec Baldwin is a fantastic villain, and Alan Alda is convincing as the oily, corrupt Maine senator. The movie is also full of fun cameos from people such as Willem Dafoe, Brent Spiner, Jude Law, and Gwen Stefani. The story of Howard Hughes' life is shown with amazing directing and cinematography decisions. His early years are very clear, and shown with the look of colorized black-and-white film. As Hughes begins his slow decline towards insanity, the movie follows, blurring the lines more and more between the real and imagined. By the end of the film, it isn't entirely clear what's really happening and what's only in Howard's head. DiCaprio does a stellar job of portraying this downward spiral. I can't put into words all of my feelings about this movie. It is definitely on my Top Five list for 2004, and I will be rooting very strongly for it come February 27th.",10

When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",10
6 February 2005,Hughes is Guilty,"He is Guilty. But, What is guilty? Cannot believe that all American is guilty? No, anything else. All Being is guilty. Being is not innocent. Movements always make a violence. Which being can survive their Whole Entity inside the struggle of Joys and Passions and Grieves? Nothing can survive.

Lexus is not in Christianity. Lexus which is being to live Persons or substances in their own life is not in absolutely empty echoes of the particular persons or particular substances wisdom.

Guilty is not a problem. Real problem is the dirty power the constitutions likely refer the charming sense of life to a Guilty! Real problem is the objection that the guilty is a transcendent guilty that punishment must be their own belong.

Not sufficiently we can tell this :inocence twists with guilty. So, nobody can get the ability of what is supposed to be true absoluteness and emptiness. This manifestation is not also sufficient.

Also we could tell that thing is that thing in the imperfect ways of conceiving, though imperfect ways of expressions.",10
10 January 2005,Truly worth seeing on the big screen,"This movie is an amazing experience -- see it in a theater, don't wait for it on DVD! DiCaprio turns in a stellar performance, fully inhabiting the character. Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckingsale are equally magnificent, and John C. Reilly is great as well. But more than being a collection of many fine performances, it is a truly great film. The film fully immerses you in the periods it covers, and although the movie is longer than average, there is not a scene I would cut. The final delight is the score -- unlike so many films today, this one is expertly scored, in a way that enhances but doesn't overpower what is happening on screen. Go see it!

12 June 2011,Execellent Film.,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature.

1 January 2005,A Brilliant American Tragedy,"From the first frame of the film, I knew I was in for an amazing film. Every scene, every word, every shot is completely perfect. This is one of the few flawless films I have ever seen (others would include Goodfellas, Million Dollar Baby, and Citizen Kane.) This film reminded me of Citizen Kane in the way the story unfolded, first beginning with a childhood memory that would stay with the man throughout his downfall. The story is about a man who came into a great sum of money, and enjoyed it very much while constantly seeking something greater. The other side of the story deals with how this man is being destroyed mentally to the point where he cannot function well. Leonardo DiCaprio gives an astonishing performance ( his best since What's Eating Gilbert Grape ). A message for those of you unfamiliar with Howard Hughes and his amazing life: IT DOESN'T MATTER. This film is not so much a biopic as it is a great tragedy. You don't need to know anything about Mr. Hughes, just go see the film, I guarantee you it will not disappoint. **********

9 January 2005,A Great Documentary About a Great American,"Howard Hughes was the greatest aviator in the world. This film fairly depicts his contributions to aviation - and the mental illness that overtook him. Is that illness called ""Compulsive/Obsessive Disorder?"" It doesn't really matter. Great people are (or should be) judged by their contributions to society and not by their illnesses or their sex lives.

The whole film was very carefully assembled to accurately represent the period and the attitudes of persons living during those years. The Acting and Direction were excellent. The sets and photography were near perfect. The music was always appropriate.

For me, this was a 3 hour look backward to the time of my childhood. Perhaps it will not appeal to the young, but ""The Aviator (2004)"" should be seen by all adult Americans and Europeans. It is a film showing the truth about America's part in the technological developments of air travel. Stating the truth about Mr. Hughes private life (and mental health problems) underscores the honesty of the production.

I would only wish that the film had also shown the death of Mr.Hughes. Yes, his end was especially sad, but I think it should have been a part of the film. The end credits might even have mentioned that at the time of Mr. Hughes' death, there did not exist the medications now being used successfully to combat mental illness.",10
14 February 2005,Outstanding,"What I thought was going to be an overwrought effort marred by a self-conscious pursuit of greatness and clumsy casting turned out to be one of the best movies I have seen in years. I have been thinking about it constantly over the past several days, which is as clear of a sign as any that the film affected me. When I saw the previews, I groaned at the selection of Leonardo di Caprio for the lead. It seemed like an incongruous choice, and one driven more by cloying studio bean-counters than by Scorcese, who has always built his films around iconic leading men. Leo shut me up in a hurry. He was brilliant.

As much as I wanted to anoint him after Gilbert Grape, his work since then has been solid but not extraordinary (Titanic, Iron Mask, the Beach, Gangs of New York). He never quite convinced me that he had the gravitas to carry a film. He started to win me over in Catch Me If You Can. In the Aviator, he simply blew me away.

This is a movie that has everything you would expect from Scorcese, and there are several terrific performances, but clearly this is Leo's film. It is a three-hour showcase of an actor who is finally exploring the limits of his talent. I can now say without qualification that Leonardo di Carprio is a great actor. And the Aviator is a great film.",10
9 January 2005,brilliant aviator,"This is from Ron in Aberdeen,Scotland,where The Aviator opened yesterday (Friday, January 8). I thought the film was brilliant - and so did my wife - and if it doesn't get Oscars galore there is no justice in modern film-making. I'm not a DiCaprio fan but I thought he was sensational as Howard Hughes and also Alan Alda, Cate Blanchet ... and all of the cast. The real reason I'm writing this is because of the review by Rathko. Movies should be about something, such as love he said! What about Hughes'love of Katherine Hepburn and of breaking the barriers of air flight? The emotional evolution of his characters? Lost me there ... his characters? What was the drive of The Aviator? It's the whole point of the film surely?! There's no theme to underpin them and drive them? Eh? What movie were you watching ... and do you know anything about the real life HH? Much as enjoyed most of your review I think you've lost the plot on this one. Regards to all, and good movie going. it's all down to individual taste, after all.

1 January 2005,Dicaprio/Scorsesse blow you away with this one!,"The Aviator is an impressive cinematic experience to say the least! Leonardo DiCaprio continues to get better with each film, and this time, behind the legendary direction of Martin Scorsesse, he might just be handed a statue come Oscar night. For this viewer the early years of Billionaire Industialist Howard Hughes (as depicted in the film) could not have been more captivating, Dicaprio nails it! An outstanding supporting cast, including brilliant performances from Alec Baldwin, Ian Holm, Kate Blanchett and John C. Reilly. I recommend this film for anyone who would like to be swept away to the early-mid 1900's, for a look into the genius of Howard Huges' life.

1 June 2005,Scorsese is a genius.,"What a great biopic. And although I've never been a big DiCaprio fan, he was fantastic in this movie. I always thought Howard Hughes was a lunatic and maybe he was but this movie depicts him as not only a genius but a man way ahead of his time. Well, they say there is a thin line between genius and insanity. I truly felt for the guy. DiCaprio really brings him to life. And Scorsese takes you back to that era and really made me feel like I wanted to live during that time. Although the actresses didn't really look like the stars they were portraying, Cate Blanchett had Hepburn's talk and mannerisms. Bravo to Scorsese and DiCaprio. I totally recommend this movie.

8 January 2005,One of The Best,"Although a tad too long, still can't think of any scenes I would cut. One of the best movies of the past year. Didn't think Leo DiCaprio would be right for the part, but he was perfect. Scorcese's handling of mental illness, his subtle aging of DiCaprio as Hughes and the accurate content of the 1930's and 1940's was superbly done. Thought it took Cate Blanchett a while to settle into the role of Kate Hepburn, but once she did, she was superb. Only one I thought was miscast was Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, but then WHO could possibly have portrayed this wonderful, beautiful and earthy actress successfully. All in all I would still have to give this movie a 10 out of 10 rating, despite these minor flaws.

15 February 2005,absorbing entertainment,"Its rare nowadays, that one can go to the cinema nowadays and be genuinely entertained in an intelligent way, but the AVIATOR is an exceptional movie. It has the ingredients of a fine story line, a strong script and fine performances, especially in the lead role by De Caprio. I thought that later on the movie he had a striking resemblance to Orson Welles- a la Kane! The sets especially, the aircraft are stunning-perhaps the true stars of the movie are the aircraft! It has been said that parts are glossed over, maybe, but this isn't a documentary but a work of fiction based on fact, and interpreted by a master of the cinema. It didn't seem a long film at all at nearly three hours I guess it should have been, but there you go--absorbed into a truly cinematic experience! Recommended

7 August 2014,Painful to watch!,"Terrible movie. The director is obviously narcissistic and self-indulgent. Badly written. Too many quick cuts back and forth--- obviously, Michael Mann's trademark from his Miami Vice days---but it doesn't work here! DiCaprio's performance was leaden. All the secondary performers were GREAT: Blanchett, Beckinsdale, Ross, the guy who ran Hughes' drill-bit business, even very small parts--like the guy who played L.B. Mayer. (Although Gwen Stefani did not look AT ALL like Jean Harlow). The scene at Hepburn's parents' home was, however, brilliant---probably shot by an assistant director. Too bad so much talent, money, and special effects was wasted on a bloated, incoherent, seemingly-endless ego trip for Scorceze/DiCaprio.

3 January 2005,Academy Award?,"This movie is great, capturing the genius & intelligence of Howard Hughes that we have read about his life & times, also his history in Hollywood. The way the Senate hearings scene with Alan Alda stuck to the historical truth, well documented in real life newsreal footage..further proves & shows Hughes' genius in dealing with mere politicians and others out of their league. Nice comic touch when Hughes tells Ava Gardner in earnest,..""I only read those transcripts"" when confronted by her on his wiretapping of her. Too bad it ends in 1947, but maybe a sequel will happen someday addressing the topic of those final years of his life? Excellent book to read on that topic until then is ""Citizen Hughes"" by M. Drosnin. Aviator deserved an Oscar for DeCapprio, Best Picture, etc! Great Movie!

9 January 2005,Superb acting,"My husband and I saw this film last night and we both loved it. It was long but we didn't realize it until we came out of the theater so you know it wasn't boring. Leonardo DiCaprio did a wonderful job of acting, he was very believable as Howard Hughes. And Kate Blanchet did a great job as Hepburn. The movie gave me the urge to do some research to find out more about Howard Hughes. The only reason I didn't give this movies a ten is because it really had no ending. I had to find out what happened to Hughes and there are plenty of websites where you can find out more. He was definitely a strange man and it was fascinating to find out that the movie really depicted him the way he really was.

10 January 2005,best film i have seen in a long while,"just been to see this film. I was brought up with the mystery of Hughes. my husband and I went to see the film with an open mind, could not believe when we came out it had been nearly 3 hours. where had the time gone, and worse still did not want the film to end. will be buying the DVD. not often we can agree on a film but this time we both came out thinking, money well spent. if you don't know who Howard Hughes was it makes no difference the story is there. i can remember some of it being in the papers, alright a bit of jazzing up but hope they bring out the sound track, go and see it. Leonardo is as good as ever, in fact the only one of the cast i could not believe was the actress who play Kathrine Hepburn, Kate was a real beauty i am afraid she was not, did the voice a bit, afraid she was not up to it , good try. but then Kate was a one off.

25 January 2005,Quite a delight,"DiCaprio was awesome... He truly impressed me with his acting!!! and the 3-hour movie itself was quite a delight :) . The movement of the cameras and the quality of the picture takes you right away to the 1930s and what makes this movie more enjoyable is the fact that it is a true story. It am not surprised at all that it has been nominated for 11 Oscars and i am sure the movie will great some of these. One Zero is for the ending, it was quite a surprise for me. I expected to see where did Howard's obsession with aviation take him. As i knew later, he was forced to sell TWA in 1966 and was approached by CIA to recover a soviet submarine in 1972. 10/10 for DiCaprio and 7/10 for the movie.

18 January 2005,The Aviator - best Scorsese since Casino (which I have seen over 50 times),"Before you read the rest of the review please note that I thought that Di Caprio was a poor actor before seeing this film and that he was made to look totally inept opposite Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs of New York which dragged the film down as a whole -

I have to say it certainly is a career best for Di Caprio. It was quite refreshing to see him not doing a heartthrob role or the hard man (as I don't think he's convincing) as in Gangs but simply a really juicy character with plenty of eccentricity to work with.

A highlight was the Senate hearing, where clearly the scene is designed as a platform for the Hughes character to show his natural intellect and the brashness of his ambition juxtaposed to the inevitability of his slide into madness and he delivered the performance with just the right weight so that it wasn't over-acted but he could still display the characters' commanding force.

As for the work as a whole it was superb, Scorsese's best work since Casino a portrayal of a quite fascinating character who's main adversary to achieving everything he wanted was himself (a similar avenue explored with Scorsese's portrayal of Jake La Motta in Raging Bull). All of the set-piece scenes were sumptuous and impeccably shot, the soundtrack as with all Scorsese films seems as if it was tailored exactly to fit. The supporting cast were very good and indeed Law's take on Errol Flynn was right on the money (would have liked to have seen a bit more of him in fact) and most of all, the flight scenes were genuinely exhilarating.

I see that DiCaprio won the Golden Globe the other night but that Scorsese lost out to Eastwood and I would expect there to be a 50:50 split at the bookies between Scorsese and Eastwood in the run up to the Oscars.",9
25 January 2005,Too Long Not Enough Info......,"I thought the movie was too long and only covered a short period of what I'm sure was an interesting life. I was hoping they'd go further into the time leading up to his death and maybe even include some insight to how he may have died. I had to watch a special on the History Channel that was less than an hour in length and had a lot more information and was much more interesting. Anyway the ""special effects"" were great and I though Dicaprio was good, but I think it would have worked even if it wasn't a ""biopic"" of Hughes. I went hoping to learn something about the man I didn't already know. I give this movie 7/10 stars for a great cast and a pretty good pace for such a long movie.

28 January 2005,One man's show,"The Aviator is one man's show;Di Caprio's!I never liked him or his work but his performance now is so mature... He must be very proud about this film! I think he achieved to become an actor finally instead of just a poster on a girl's wall.Leonardo's Howard reminds me Vivian's Scarlett! And the passion this film has! Passion about cinema,about creation,about love,about LIFE!Scorseze's passion, Leonardo's passion,Howard's,Cathreen's,Ava's and of course the viewer's passion.Because we also have dreams and fears and that is why we go to cinema;cinema is the biography of our lives!And our movie heroes are on the screen to make our thoughts acts!And this is why a film makes our heart beat!

10 February 2005,Better than Citizen Kane,"If you liked Citizen Kane, you will love The Aviator - a biopic telling the amazing story of Howard Hughes.

Leonardo Di Caprio brilliantly plays the famously daring filmmaker, aviator and business tycoon. One of Hughes' earlier films was at the time the most expensive ever made - he'd purchased his own private airforce (70+ aircraft), and had a record 20+ cameras filming the simulated dogfights. Hughes later went to form his own aircraft manufacturing company (as a pilot he broke numerous world records in his self-designed airplanes - famously crash-landing one of them in Beverly Hills), purchase and revitalise Trans World Airlines, and eventually pilot the sole flight of the famous 1940s aircraft 'Spruce Goose' - to this day the largest aircraft ever made.

All the while Hughes was renowned for the glamorous Hollywood blondes he inevitably had on his arms, and within an intimate circle of trusted associates, his struggle with mental illnesses - a germ phobia and obsessive compulsive disorder.

An amazing person captured in an amazing film. The Aviator is nearly three hours long, yet still makes the famous (and brilliant) life of Citizen Kane look positively uninspired by comparison.",10
13 February 2005,Moving portrayal of Hughes tormented intra psychic world,"I was very moved by DiCaprio's portrayal of Howard Hughes - and the character study of such a tormented, but tenacious man. I am a psychoanalyst, so the manifestations of Hughes' internal world was of great interest to me. When the movie was over, I felt wiped out. How tragic and sad that a man of his brilliance and courage was so psychically disturbed. The movie suggests that his early interactions with his mother were critical in his later compulsions and delusions. In all, the acting and the script were very believable. Hughes' condition was represented convincingly and sensitively. I strongly recommend The Aviator to anyone interested in such a powerfully emotional experience.

13 February 2005,See it. Now.,"This is the greatest movie of the year, and anyone who disagrees with me is wrong. Anyone who owns the LOTR box set and thinks this movie is too long should be shot. Anyone who thinks this is the ""Katherine Hepburn Show"" should be transplanted back to Munich in 1933. Anyone who thinks Scorcese doesn't know how to edit film should be forced to watch ""Freddy Got Fingered"" continuously for three days.

I'm right. You're not. Welcome to my world.

And seeing as that I need more lines in order for IMDb to process this junk, um...Leo DiCaprio really sucked in the Beach, and then he turned to acting...Cate Blanchet=Cathy Moriarty with a greater namesake...if Marty doesn't win the Oscar this year the ceremony needs to be moved to New York...that's about it.

17 February 2005,Scorsese scores....again.,"OK, how good is this film? It's brilliant. Gorgeous to look at, beautifully shot, great character work and totally compelling. Scorses shows here that he is, along with Spielberg, THE greatest director around. The guy was just born to make movies. He also manages to get DiCaprio's best performance since ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"". He shows the full range here, and anyone doubting this guy's talent should get a load of this. Blanchett is superb also and Beckinsale looks like she's having a ball here.

I saw the Baftas, Scorsese should have won but they want to give it to the British directors. However, the Academy awards should be a different story. We all know Jamie Foxx is gonna win. He's a brilliant actor, but he's nominated in another category and DiCaprio was completely robbed of an Oscar by Tommy Lee Jones for....The Fugitive for goodness sake! I just hope the Academy get their acts together and give DiCaprio and especially Scorsese, the Oscars they both deserve.

PS. Kate Winslet for best actress. She should have won about three times already. Flying the flag for Britain and doing it WELL.",9
12 March 2005,DiCaprio Won Me Over,"No, it's not the greatest film ever and both Ray and MDBaby both outdid it...but I came away with a greater respect for DiCaprio than I expected. After he seemed so wrong for the part in Gangs I wondered about his suitability for Howard Hughes. Between makeup and his hard work I came to believe he really WAS the reclusive Hughes. I'd be interested to know how many of the aircraft were real and how much was CGI. If you can find a more realistic special effects gig than the neighborhood crash of his spy plane I'd like to see it. Thought the switching from outdoor to indoor perspectives was convincing. There was something about the continuity of the film that left me wondering if Hughes just fell in and out of these paranoid fugues. One minute he's the Naked Unshaved Beast and then Ava has him spiffied up jousting with Congress. Jude Law and Alec Baldwin were useless high-priced additions that could have been used elsewhere.

24 February 2005,Best Picture of the year,"I am not a big fan of Leo, but I decided to see this movie anyway. This movie was excellent, and I think that everyone should see this one. Martin should also get director of the year. I don't like to give anything away when I write a review and I can't think of anything about the movie that I didn't like.

Prepare yourself for a long movie though. The movie ran for a little over three hours. Trust me when I say that you won't get bored watching it. It kept me interested the whole time. If you don't go out and see this one, you will regret it later. This movie is best at the theatre on the huge screen. Renting it on DVD just won't be the same.

6 March 2005,A very good film,"I believe that Leonardo Dicaprio(specially) and in general all the cast were really great(except Kate Beckinsale who was really AWFUL). I ENJOY THE MOVIE a lot and there were some particular SCENES which REALLY MOVES ME. It is incredible that a man who was blessed with so many gifts had at the same time the curse of such rare disease. The movie at the beginning it is a bit slow but it is introducing Howard Hughes personality and identity. i must say that this film filled all my expectations and i have to confess that at first time i was not very optimistic of the results of this film cause i thought that the character was not interesting enough. I was Wrong.

7 March 2005,What a great movie,"I saw this movie about a month ago with some friends from school. As I sat through it I got completely into it. I thought Leonardo DiCaprio did a great job portraying Howard Hughes, he was very convincing. I also was amazed by the sets, costumes, cinematography, editing, and even the visual effects. And despite my admiration for the movie, my friends said it was the most boring movie they had ever seen. I don't blame them, since they thought ""White Chicks"" was a great movie. I am 15 years old and I like movies like this, that make you think. I think Martin Scorcese deserved an Oscar for this movie although it went to Clint Eastwood, whose ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a great movie also. Overall, I'm giving it a 9 out of 10 because i thought it was just a little too long because of too many scenes where there is a party.

26 May 2005,Made me a touch sad,"Oh, there is so much promise is this movie. A ripe subject matter, an esteemed director and a wonderful cast should be the formula for success, but the finished product, like Hughes' movies themselves, leaves a little to be desired.

It is unfair, but inevitable, in my mind to compare a directors early works with his current ones. If The Aviator proves anything, it is that people change, grow, adapt, and try to keep doing what is most passionate to them. For me, I would have loved to see 1980 Scorcese tackle this project and do what he does best which is draw out the raw, gritty human emotion of the story. It's there in this story, but Scorcese chooses not to mine it, instead focusing on a personal love affair of the movies and movie system of his youth.

It's hard to complain about a Scorcese film. He adeptly shows what he wants to show. The production is first rate and he gets fine performances from his actors, but the story he chooses to tell is not up to his best efforts.",6
28 May 2005,In the beginning....,"Am I correct in assuming his mother was sexually abusing him as a child when she was washing him up and down, making him spell quarantine...and when Howard gets to the middle of the word...he gasps...as if something happened to his body..and then continues to spell the word. Also, when she says...'you know what THEY can do to you, don't you?'...did she mean the various diseases..or 'the coloreds down the street'...she had just mentioned to him? If she was not abusing him, it was too much of an intimately charged scene to open the movie with...I liked the movie but the beginning threw me off a little. I did feel a little empty at the end of the movie having nothing to do with the 2 bowls of popcorn I had just consumed. What would America have done without Howard Hughes...his contributions to aviation were amazing. I enjoyed Leonard di Caprio's acting...especially when he was alone in his room with all the red lighting around him...he looked an awful lot like the real Howard Hughes himself. Any comments about the opening scene that I mention above? Curious if I've seen so much soft porn on TV and movies that I am beginning to see it everywhere...or becoming immune to it. Thanks.",4
12 March 2021,Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow ???,"Have seen this film many times since it's release and one thing that always throws me every time is how anyone ever thought Gwen Stefani could be a Jean Harlow. I enjoyed the film up to that point and then in bits and pieces afterwards mostly thru the other interesting performances. We can't always be the best at whatever but it pays to be interesting and this director never fails.

7 July 2005,Fantastic!,"I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.

The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.

The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929.

I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.

Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.

The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",8
12 August 2015,"Simply amazing - for Visionaries, Innovators and People who bends reality","I can relate to this movie often. This is an awesome movie to be inspired by any Statup, Visionary, and Innovative folks.

Being great at many things in a shorter, yet joyous life can bring a different meaning to life.

Loved Leo in his part; Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) as Pan Am top boss was a great casting decision,... All about the movie was just AMAZING.

The entire Cast and Crew were amazing. Again I say - for adventurous, courageous, often- overconfient people must lost watch this over and over.

I especially watch several inspirational movies like this - before initiating any project/ product development.

Often gets me in the wrong way, but being courageous, being SURE about what you are doing really matters. Mr. Howard Hughes has proved it - DeCaprio completed his work.",10
10 September 2005,Not your usual all-American hero,"Not your usual American hero, and not your normal Hollywood one either. The cinematography itself is probably the biggest star of the movie, second place going to Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn, and third to Leonardo DiCaprio for Hughes the Aviator himself. Touching, funny, and often spectacular. The film catches the 1930 is by pastiche as much as realism. Most memorable line for me is Hepburn's 'people like us are different' summing up the double-edged sword that is celebrity based on eccentric genius. Scorsese's description of Hughes' battle to save his reputation in the face of big business backed politicians makes him a sympathetic hero, and perhaps most wonderful of all is how the director would have us judge Howard Hughes by his great achievements, rather than his notorious image. He may not be a conventional hero in the Hollywood style, but this story of genius oppressed by disability and judged by a media more interested in a story than the facts can only do credit to the memory of the much maligned millionaire.

29 September 2005,One of the best movies for 2004,"This movie put Howard Hughes a Multi-millionaire businessman, film producer, film director, and aviator into perspective, and his life experiences. Starting from when he directed the ""Hell's Angel"" movie to the engineering of the Hercules ""Spruce Goose."" Giving you a look into his OCD, bipolar disorder, paranoid-schizophrenia, and the airplane accident in Beverly Hills that almost killed him. Leonardo DiCaprio out did himself in this part. You felt like you knew Howard Hughes. Cate Blanchett did a amazing job of sounding like Katharine Hepburn, and catching her essence in the 1930's on. The movie gave you a look into the starlet's like Jean Harlow, Katharine Hepburn, Olivia de Havilland, and Ava Gardner. One of the best movies for 2004. The film puts you right into the life of the famous Howard Hughes.

5 December 2005,Simply one of the best movies I've ever seen.,"I maybe not very objective on this one, cause I truly love Scorsese's vision of cinema. Nobody finds the golden midst of mainstream- and art-cinema like Scorsese does. There maybe no perfection but Scorsese comes very close! Music, pictures and acting at its very best. Leonardo Dicaprio, being the best actor of his decade, gives his best performance so far! Incredible! All other actors and actresses are great none the less. Scorsese always finds the way of getting just the best out of his actors: Alec Baldwin, who would've thought that?! The soundtrack is to fall in love with, as are all of Scorsese's movies. The movie itself is hard to describe, it's a weird ride. Scorseses and his teams (Schoonmaker, Ferretti etc.) passion for movies shows in every detail. This movie is not to miss. If it weren't for ""Million Dollar Baby"" (also fantastic, no question) Scorsese would've gotten his Oscar, which is long over due, but what is an Oscar anyhow?! Appreciation, and he's got that for eternity. The Oscar is just a question of time... the departed!? Can't wait to see it.
