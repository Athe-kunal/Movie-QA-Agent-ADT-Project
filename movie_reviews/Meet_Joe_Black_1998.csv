12 July 1999,A powerful movie about not taking life for granted,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",9

25 April 2005,A Minimalist Masterpiece,"Somewhere in the netherworld between being a ""remake"" and merely ""inspired by"" Mitchell Leisen's 1934 film Death Takes a Holiday, Meet Joe Black is the story of Death personified. Death takes over the body of Brad Pitt's unnamed character, later donned ""Joe Black"" by William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins). Although the motivation isn't specified but implied in this film, Death wishes to experience the life he normally takes away--he wants to see what it's like to be human. He chooses Parrish to be his guide because Parrish is a hugely successful media mogul who has conviction, strong ""moral fiber"" and insight on life. Compounding the situation, Parrish's daughter, Susan (Claire Forlani), is a woman whom Brad Pitt's unnamed character met in a coffee shop that morning and had an instant mutual attraction with. Black sticks close by William's side through much of the film, creating difficult situations at a time when Parrish's company is trying to deal with a financially attractive but ethically unsavory takeover bid, and he also puts the boil to somewhat strained familial relationships.

First, a word of warning. This is a very long film (3 hours), and it tends to be very slowly paced. If you are averse to either, or if you do not like any of the three principalsPitt, Hopkins and Forlani--I'd advise you to avoid the film.

For me, I never think that a film's length is a problem in itself. As long as the film works, I'd be happy with it lasting 4, 5, even 12 hours or more--heck, I even gladly sat through Gettysburg (1993) in the theater. There have been films I've thought were too long (such as Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, 1962), but it's contextual, not related to actual running time.

Helmer Martin Brest directs with a lot of deliberation. Lines of dialogue and responses are stretched out to ""infinity and taken to the depth of forever"". The camera gives us lots of lingering gazes. There is little to no ""action"" in the film. Much of it is similar to David Lynch's famed pregnant pauses. Some people hate that style. I love it (although I love other styles, too--I like variety), and for me, the pacing makes this film seem much shorter than its actual running time. It's the complete opposite of the pacing of, say, Medallion (2003), which is interesting given that both films feature Forlani. It's also interesting to note that Brest's career seems to match the pacing of Meet Joe Black. He's taken 2, 4, 5 and 6 years between films. Obviously, Brest is not in a rush.

If you watch Meet Joe Black immediately after watching Death Takes a Holiday, as I did this time around, a few things might strike you as odd and slightly negative at first. The principal difference that had this initial effect on me was the change in the primary romantic relationship--between Joe and Susan (and between Prince Sirki (Frederic March) and Grazia (Evelyn Venable) in the original). In the original, it's ambiguous whether Grazia doesn't recognize Sirki for what he really is all along. She at least never meets him as Sirki rather than Death-as-Sirki. It creates interesting philosophical scenarios about humankind's conception and fear of death; Grazia, who is a bit aloof all along, may be embracing death rather than fearing it, not as something negative, but more metaphysically, as inherent in the idea of life.

In Meet Joe Black, Susan falls for Pitt as another character first. It removes all of the philosophical points about one's attitude towards death (with the exception of William, who is the only one who knows the truth, even in the end, and who implicitly goes through vacillating feelings about death). However, despite my initial hesitation on the change, I tried to remember my commitment to judge each film on its own terms rather than its relation to other works, and I realized that the relationship set up here is interesting for another reason--it explores public identity in relationships and the tensions that arise through dynamicism of that public identity. That's a theme throughout the film, not just in its romantic relationships.

Pitt has often been criticized for his performance here, but in my opinion, it's perfect for the character(s)--just as good in its own way as March's turn as Sirki in the original. Once Pitt as Death takes over ""Joe Black's"" body, he _must_ change his persona in the way he does. He's supposed to be a supernatural being who normally relates to the world in a completely different way, but now he's suddenly made corporeal. He doesn't know what to do as a human. As an entity, he's not daft, lacking power or unknowledgeable about many things, but he's incredibly naïve and awkward as a thing of flesh. He's not used to relating to the world in that way. He's not used to making facial expressions. He's never tasted food, and so on. The change he undergoes in the beginning and end of the film is amazing and shows just how skilled Pitt is.

Hopkins and Forlani are of course no slouches, either. Hopkins' ability to go from understated and elegant to manic is put to good use; the role seems tailor-made for him. Forlani, who has a very unusual but intriguingly beautiful face that always looks a bit pouty, gets to pout even more, creating a bizarrely complex but effective character. The rest of the primary cast is just as good. The end result is a strangely dysfunctional family with a lot of depth.

While I can see people preferring Death Takes a Holiday to this film, for me, Meet Joe Black is slightly better. It's much more epic, of course, and that scope, plus the incredible score by Thomas Newman, pushes its emotional effectiveness up a notch. But make sure you do not miss either film. Both are excellent and unusual.",10
19 January 2020,22 years later. And it still knocks you out.,"Film reviews are irrelevant. Perception is key. Meet Joe Black is a meet on its own. If you are not into romantic tear jerkers, watch this film and find out that your human and have the ability to change your mind. I speak from experience. The story: Simple and easy to understand. The director made a simple life event into a magical experience. Love and death go hand in hand in a mixture of sublime acting, awesome sceneries, superb dialogues, nerve touching details and result in a romantic drama where the happy ending does not cover the sadness and emotions and leaves you choked till the last over the rainbow tune ends. After 40 years of watching thousands of films, this film still is my number 1 film in my top 100 films where all one hundred share the first place. Brad Pitt, Sir Anthony Hopkins (brilliant classical composer btw) and the gorgeous Claire Forlany showed of their qualities. Same for all the other participants in thisepic story about how life will go on. Perception. ... but from my pov their best acting ever. I have seen it at least once every 2 years. If it will be your first time, settle for it. If you are still young, and think you become a film addict, be aware! You will get drawn in this film for decades to come. Enjoy this experience. And let it knock you out as well ☺",10
28 May 2008,The Grim Reaper On Sabbatical,"The old Paramount classic Death Takes A Holiday gets a stylish turn of the 21st century remake, Meet Joe Black with Brad Pitt as the grim reaper himself taking a sabbatical to experience what he deprives everyone of, ultimately. The story has been updated from Italy during World War I to America in the new age of information.

The guy who benefits for a short while is multimillionaire media tycoon Anthony Hopkins who is approaching his 65th birthday. He's a widower with two daughters, Marcia Gay Harden who is married to Jeffrey Tambor and Clare Forlani who's in love with love. In fact at the beginning of the film Clare who is a doctor has a chance meeting with Brad Pitt just before he's rundown in a busy New York street and the pale horseman takes over his body.

It's a good thing Hopkins got this reprieve because there's some real nasty double-dealing taking place in his firm. His young right hand man, Jake Weber, is looking to affect a merger with another conglomerate that would ruin all that Hopkins has built in his life. But Weber of course hasn't the slightest idea who Hopkins's new ally is. Let alone the resources he can bring to bear.

Meet Joe Black is a fine film which has a lot to say about the meaning of life and how important it is to use that time on earth in mortal form to become the best you can be. Pitt and Hopkins have very good chemistry and Webber is one of the slimier villains ever put on film.

And see how it all works out for everyone in the end. In fact that's the real message of Meet Joe Black, it all does work out in the end.",8
16 January 2005,Reflective And Philosophical,"For a long time I put off watching this, because I have no interest in superficial, teen comedy flicks, as implied by the film's pedestrian title and by the casting of a youthful Brad Pitt. But ""Meet Joe Black"" is anything but ""superficial"", and ""teen comedy"" does not describe this movie at all.

Set in contemporary New York, the film follows a wealthy family whose patriarchal sixty-five year old head, played by Anthony Hopkins, is nearing the end of his life. Enter ""Joe Black"" (Brad Pitt), a handsome, but enigmatic, young man with an unusual agenda.

This is a thought-provoking movie about mortality and emotional separation. It will appeal to viewers with a reflective and philosophical nature. But the film also has humor, which keeps it from being grim. The pace is slow. There's lots of silence and stillness, entirely appropriate, given the subject matter. Among other things, the film presents the novel idea that a supernatural being can be subject to human emotions, and can make mistakes in judgment resulting from those emotions.

The film is not perfect. The plot is a tad egocentric. There's no reference to the universality and ongoing occurrence of death outside the confines of this family. Also, why now? Why does death choose to engage life in our present world, why not five hundred years ago? Minor script changes could have addressed these issues. The initial meeting between Susan (Claire Forlani) and Joe Black seems a little too convenient, but forms the basis for a plot twist that strengthens the overall story.

The acting is excellent. Anthony Hopkins is, as usual, outstanding. I would not have cast Brad Pitt in the role he plays, but he does a good job. Appropriate for this movie, the acting style for both Pitt and Forlani is one wherein they communicate their characters to viewers largely by means of their eyes, which, as taught by ancient philosophers, are the windows of the soul.

For viewers who liked ""The Sixth Sense"", another serious film with depth of meaning, I recommend ""Meet Joe Black"" most highly.",8
16 June 2016,Carries Itself Well,"Death, who takes the form of a young man (Brad Pitt), asks a media mogul (Anthony Hopkins) to act as a guide to teach him about life on Earth and in the process he falls in love with his guide's daughter (Claire Forlani).

So this is a remake of a movie that was adapted from a play. Typically that could be concerning, as a remake is not often as good as the original. In this case, though, it may even be better... the cast is solid (with Forlani in one of her rare decent roles), and Brad Pitt making a name for himself (as if he has not already).

Really, this is a great display of Pitt's acting. He has solid range here, possibly more than anything else he has done. The character is very complex, and there is the odd twist that Forlani is attracted to him because he looks like someone he is not, and not for any deeper reason. Amazingly, even at three hours, this film never drags.

24 October 2019,A true benchmark in film making,"In protest to all the remade junk Hollywood is producing these days, I'm watching a movie that's as good to watch the 10th time as it was the first (and I speak from experience). This movie is a tribute to all who came together in it's making. It's Claire Forlani's finest hour, Brad Pitt is superb and Anthony Hopkins is brilliant to name a few. If you've never watched it, I challenge you: It will melt your heart, and it will become a standard. Hats off to the screenwriters who adapted the story so well, to the actors who plainly put their hearts into this, to wardrobe, lighting, scenery who put everything in place, and most of all to the Director who had a passionate and clear vision of what he wanted from every scene.

11 January 2000,The stuff that legends are made from,"This film caught me off-guard. I wasn't prepared for the impact it had on me. A wonderful sensation permeates this story in which Death takes a body to wear (I would like to choose too...) to discover what its like to be a human being. Hopkins and Pitt act like they've never done anything else - they are brilliant. If you doubt my words, watch the first 15 minutes and tell me: don't you get goose bumps when Hopkins hears Death whisper in his ear? I sure did. I hail this film as one of the best - ever.

3 October 2019,"Very engaging, compelling, and thought-provoking!","One of the the most philosophically intriguing experiences I've found. Quite awkward at times but so genuine and normal feeling. Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins are riveting! Rebirth, romance, death, business, activities, and perplexity all astonishing parts of this unique art piece in this cinema. Also the director Martin Brest is great especially for films like Midnight Run and Beverly Hills Cop, I highly recommend Meet Joe Black to anyone!!

26 June 2016,seductive,"first, for the interesting idea who, far to be original, has the chance to be used in wise manner. than , for the romanticism and the great chemistry between Forlani and Pitt. not the least, and that is far to represent a surprise, the performance of Anthony Hopkins is admirable. the Death and the price of each new day of life. the media industry as the best set. the discoveries of significance of small, fundamental things who defines the existence. and the price of happiness. its virtue - to be a provocation for viewer in each scene. sure, the old romantic story is the same, but its nuances transform the sense of old clichés and lovely sweet images. a new Faust. only the roles are for different interpreters. the essence is the same. but the answer seems be different.

11 December 2002,A Truly Enchanting Movie!,"Meet Joe Black is a beautiful film with a talented cast. Because it is unique, the plot enables humor to be weaved within the dramatic and romantic elements. The music, composed by Thomas Newman (Shawshank Redemption, Erin Brokovich) truly enhances the movie. The many string and piano melodies are beautiful, and fit smoothly. There are so many memorable moments, like father-daughter conversations, and the scene in the coffee shop. Brad Pitt, in his portrayal of Death,displays naive and vulnerable feelings, skillfully in sharp contrast his behavior at the beginning of the film. While some criticize its length and unrealistic aspects of the plot, I found it to be so captivating and quite well-made. Meet Joe Black has an indescribable effect on me whenever I watch it. The story of Death being apprentice to a respected, accomplished man makes one realize the simple beauties of life-- passion, family, love... and peanut butter.

14 February 2005,The perfect movie when you are alone on Valentine's Day,"This is a really great movie , that you have to watch glimpses of first. You have to see parts , you have to be non-interested, ""oh this is just another bad brad Pitt movie"", but you watch parts over and over , because Anthony Hopkins is one of the greatest actors of all time. I can't believe watching this movie on Valentine's day how empathetic Anthony Hopkins is , how terrible he is as Hannibal Lechter. This is a great movie, you must come to love. You must watch it and think nothing of it. Then watch it again some time later, you will begin to understand it. You will begin to understand how wonderful this movie, How true it is. How absolutely real and caring the movie is. It combines life, death, love, and greed for all things. To love someone and what love is , truly is defined in the movie. It is a wonderful movie to watch on Valentine's Day when you are alone, when nothing is clear, when you are in the dumps have no one, when pain is all you feel and all your loved ones are separated by time and space. When I was alone today Feb 14th 2005, I enjoyed this movie, I suggest you watch so you too can not be alone.

4 June 2021,I only finished because so many of you think it's great,"Let's be clear. I am an old boring married guy. I watched all three films of The Human Condition with rapt attention. I can do long, slow, subtle. I am not to the best of my knowledge bereft of spirit as many reviews accuse others of.

But this? Maudlin. Boring. Hamhanded. Too long by a factor of ten. I mean, so badly paced I was bored after 20 minutes, then noticed it's Three Hours Long.

Once I was about 45 minutes in and started getting the gist of the characters, I could figure out a better way to write about half the lines. The ""death and taxes"" callback in a movie that respected our intelligence should have been ""only two things in life are inevitable, Drew.""

Oh, except for Death. He was... conveniently written. Unaware AND all knowing. Sometimes in the same sentence. Things this contrived do not work to make me get absorbed into a film.

Well acted by pretty much everyone (Brad Pitt was... not well characterized so I didn't like him one bit in either role, but that's probably not his fault). Even the supporting characters did a great job. But terrible script, terribly edited, and I don't care what anyone says: quite pedestrian cinematography.",5
13 October 2004,"In short, an excellent and not too long film","Whenever this film is aired, I'm drawn to watch it. The pace, like life, is slow. Some people find this to be a problem. I feel sorry for those people; maybe they've been so saturated by ""fast food"" films and reality TV that they think that's the way life is supposed to be. Unlike life, the film has no ""wasted space"". So, while it may seem too long for theatre viewing, it's plenty short for sitting back in an easy chair for three hours and just letting it draw you in--with the excellent dialogue (including the Patois), excellent performances by truly talented actors, and above all the [again] excellent score by Mr. Newman. If you're a romantic not just about love, but also about life, then treat yourself and watch it.

9 January 2000,"One of the best films of 1998, I can't praise this film enough!","I must admit to have been slightly hesistant when I first heard about Meet Joe Black because of the subject matter and its length, however I found this film to be superb.

The acting was believable, the cinematography of the film was well thought out and extremely picturesque. The soundtrack by Thomas Newman (the Shawshank Redemption) went from chilling to the most beautiful melodies that I have ever heard (giving, in my humble opinion, any classical composer a run for their money), adding an extra depth to this film.

There are no in-betweens in this film: you WILL either love or hate this film. However, I can say that this film is one of the most uplifting and life affirming movies that I have ever seen. It left me both moved and confident that the world was not such a bad place after all. Just like the Shawshank Redemption told us that hope is not a bad thing, so Meet Joe Black tells us that indeed love can conquer all better than Titanic ever could.",9
23 March 2017,Beautiful,"This movie had no luck with critics, but it is near the top of my all-time favorites. One of the most beautiful love stories, with deep thoughts about life, and with Pitt and Hopkins in leading roles you can't ask for much more.

15 April 2006,Absolutely Spectacular Movie that leaves you Pondering for Days Afterward,"I thought this movie was quite clearly spectacular. I mean, from the trailer it looked like some teen, low-production-cost flick that I'd stay as far away as possible, but in truth, the movie was deep, meaningful and left you thinking about it for ages and ages afterward.

The actors were brilliant. I thought Brad Pitt, against a lot of people's expectations, performed very convincingly, and Anthony Hopkins, as always, stunned me and transported me. Claire Forlani was the only main actress who suffered slightly but still pulled off a reasonable performance. I personally thought the Jamaican Woman, played by Lois Kelly-Miller was very touching, and the conversations between most of the characters were all interesting and well, some of the advice you could put into use in your own daily lives.

The story line is edgy and dwells on sensitive subjects such as Death, Love and Happiness, I suppose. The wisdom behind it is unmistakable. I think this movie is underrated. Despite the disappointing Trailer, the movie will blow you away. I watched it on VCD, something that has low-ish quality on a computer, yet I managed to sit through all 170 minutes, completely stunned and unable to budge from concentration.

Overall, this movie is definitely recommended. A bit deep for your kids, I guess- I tried watching it with my niece but she ruined it slightly by everlasting flow of questions.

I'm giving it a 10/10 for it being emotional and funny at times. Overall a serious movie, and one that will truly make you think. It is quite complex and will definitely leave some strings untied, but I guess a bit of room for imagination never hurt anyone.",10
6 February 2020,"For the Romance, For the Romance, For the Romance !!!","I am a guy. I dont like sentimental romantic movies. This movie is full blown romance though from the very start, but I was still smitten with it. Not only was I smitten with it, I was dumbfounded, touched and mesmerised as well by it. Why? How could I be so touched by a romantic movie? BECAUSE ANTHONY HOPKINS IS BRILLIANT. And so are all the other actors, and so is the music, and so is the photography and so is the story, simply MAGNIFICENT.

The story sounds silly at first. Really silly. But it is executed/directed with such credibility that I can assure you that you must watch it before you disregard this movie simply by its story or trailer. Especially the acting performance by Anthony Hopkins is sheer brilliance. And the ROMANCE is as well.

I wont tell you the exact story, but simply hear me out: Anthony Hopkins fears he is near the end of his life. That's one side of the story. The other side of the story is a sheer brilliant romance between Brad Pitt and the daughter of Anthony Hopkins. Ah what the heck, I simply cant find the words to describe this wonderful romantic feeling I am left with after having watched it. I am all teary eyed. Cant think straight... Simply watch it for the romance, FOR THE ROMANCE... !!!",9
22 June 2021,Meet Joe Black,"Meet Joe Black is a remake of Death Takes a Holiday.

When this film was released it was apparently the most expensive non action movie ever made.

Martin Brest has certainly made a very long romantic fantasy that is a bit of a misfire.

Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) is a media mogul that is contemplating a merger with a brash rival. He is also about to celebrate his 65th birthday.

His older daughter Allison (Marcia Gay Harden) is planning a lavish party where even the President might drop in.

His younger daughter Susan (Claire Forlani) is training to be a doctor and is his favourite. She is in a sparkless relationship with duplicitous Drew, an arrogant executive in Bill's company.

Susan encounters a charming stranger one morning in a diner. A flirt played by Brad Pitt who is suddenly run over when he later crosses the road. His dead body is taken over by Death and he later comes to visit Bill and hangs around with him for a few days. In that time Death meets Susan once more and falls in love with her.

The best bit about Meet Joe Black is the big expensive party that Allison is planning. The kind of glitzy and kitschy party disgraced tycoons such as Jeffrey Skilling and Bernie Madoff used to throw with other people's money.

There are no hints that Bill is a cynical manipulative power hungry media tycoon. So that part is certainly a fantasy. In fact this is one of the movie's problems. The boardroom backstabbing is boring and obvious. Bill is so passive, you wonder how he made it big in the corporate jungle.

Then there is the character of Death in human form. At times knowing very little of life on Earth and at other times he is all knowing. It is bizarre storytelling.

It is a muddled film with a funereal pace. Pitt struggles and even more with that Haitian accent. Hopkins does his best with little characterisation, Forlani looks pretty but failed to convince me that she was a doctor.",4

4 February 2002,"Could have been charming and light  instead it's mostly tiresome, overlong and occasionally terrible","Media magnate William Parrish is approaching his 65th birthday. While dealing with his business problems he advises his youngest daughter Susan that she must find true love. She meets a young man in a coffee shop and falls for his charms but leaves without him. When the young man is hit by a bus and killed, Death decides to use his body to visit earth. He postpones the death of Parrish in return for experiencing life. However his influence causes an impact on Parrish's business and on his daughter.

This is a rework of 1934's `Death Takes a Holiday' - four writers worked tirelessly to take that short charmer and spin it into a ponderous three hour slog. The story is simple enough - Death comes to earth, falls in love, makes friends, is a fish out of water but must eventually go back' - however it's seriously stretched and delivered in very slow chunks. The various strands (the business confrontation, the romance etc) don't sit well together and it's like the writers all took turns rather than working together. At the start it is quite charming, but the longer it goes on, the less you care and the less charming it becomes.

Why did it have to be so long? There are so many elements of the story that could have been trimmed down. So many scenes could have been told in a shorter time or removed totally. It feels like nothing they shot ended up on the cutting room floor. For example, Pitt shares several scenes (total about 10 minutes) with an elderly Jamaican woman, these scenes don't add anything to the film: more than that they are terrible - Pitt does a horrible, horrible patwa accent. Surely the editor should have removed these on quality alone!

If this had been good then it wouldn't matter if it was so long - but there's only enough to last for 2 hours at most. That's 60 minutes worth of filler that could have been lost. The performances are mixed, but are mainly as heavy and unwieldy as the film itself. Pitt starts well - his human' role is really charming and I thought that he was already Death and thought he'd be that way for the whole film. However when he becomes death he is totally flat and lifeless - obviously that's how Death would be, but it makes him really dull and wastes the charm that has made him a star. His Jamaican accent is absolutely terrible and just shows he has no judgement. Forlani holds her own well beside an experienced cast but the romance between her and death is unbelievable due to Pitt's stony performance. Hopkins is good throughout and shows Pitt up to be a star rather than an actor. The support is mostly good - but that old Jamaican lady has got to go!

The film is far too long - at one point I thought it was winding up and that the end must be 10 minutes away - it was winding up (and did what I thought it would) but instead of 10 minutes it took 45! Such luxurious running times should only be permitted to films that can sustain them.

Overall this could have been a charming little film. Instead it buries that charm in a three hour running time that it can't sustain. I liked it but I wished it would end after the first 120 minutes. Somewhere out there - it is still going!",
15 February 2000,"Long, boring at parts, but when it picked up it was great","I was a little hesitant to watch this movie, seeing as how it was 3 hours long, but I decided to give it a try. As I sort of expected, much of the first part was fairly slow moving and a bit boring. But if you stick with MEET JOE BLACK, it gets a little more exciting and you'll find the story a bit more interesting.

William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) is a very successful businessman who has raised a good family, had a good career and has lead a good life. Then one day, Death (Brad Pitt) comes to William and offers him more time to be alive in exchange for Parrish showing him around life. Death, using the name Joe Black, really starts to enjoy life and fall in love with Parrish's daughter Susan (Claire Forlani). When this happens, he considers changing the rules of life & death.

The plot is very original and fairly interesting. I think it would have been a little less boring if there wasn't a dramatic pause between every sentence. The beginning of this movie is actually pretty good, but the rest of the first half tends to drag a bit. The second half still has similar flaws, but because the characters have been set and the plot really starts to threaten, it is a lot more interesting. I had mixed feelings for the ending. I thought it was OK, but it could have been a little better. The ending was kind of predictable, but not especially since it was hard to tell where they were going with it. Half of the movie is predictable and half of it wasn't.

The acting was superb in this movie, as expected with a veteran like Anthony Hopkins and a newer, but talented, face like Brad Pitt. Hopkins, in my humble opinion, stole the show right out from under Pitt, who I think was meant to be the showcase. Claire Forlani did pretty well as the adorable girlfriend of Pitt, and I thought the Jamaican Lady, played by Lois Kelly-Miller, and was both funny and noble. I loved the scenes between her and Pitt, and I thought Pitt was very funny speaking a Jamaican accent.

The character development in this movie was pretty good. It was pretty cool to see the Grim Reaper himself (Joe Black/Death) have feelings and curiosity about life, let alone fall in love with someone. You can relate to Parrish, even though he plays an old fart, because he knows that his death is coming and he is, naturally, trying to tie up loose knots. You would do this too if Death came to you and said ""Hey, you're gonna die in a week. So, how 'bout them Yankees?"" Both of Parrish's daughters represent two stereotype daughters. One was the older, favorite daughter who is struggling with her feelings about love. The other is the younger daughter who is jealous of her older sister, but is married. Again, I loved the Jamaican Lady, but I don't think I would have if it weren't for Pitt's excellent dialogue with her.

If you don't like long movies, you'd better stay away from this one. If you're a Pitt fan, you'll love it because he is everywhere on this film. I'd still say this is one great film and that you should check it out, but not if you have a bad attention span.",8
2 July 2017,You'll be begging for death at the end of this travesty,"In Meet Joe Black Brad Pitt plays Death who has decided, after eons of existing, to experience the human existence through an unhappy car crash victim. As his guide he chooses a filthy rich media mogul played by Anthony Hopkins. Because that's a fine sample of humanity right there. But, it just so happens that the mogul has a feisty daughter played by the lovely Claire Forlani. Hijinks do indeed ensue.

This film has problems. The actors themselves are fine, yes. The technical aspects are fine, yes. Even the story is not half bad and would normally allow for an hour or two of lighthearted entertainment. Once again it's the execution that trumps all that.

Because this film is ghastly boring, unimaginative, unbearable to watch and just an all-around mess. And almost all of that stems from the fact that it's Three! Hours! Long! At most it should be two, and even that would be tedious with the amount of story on display here. I mean, a firework is fun right? The shooting, the buildup of the climb and then the main thing, the explosion. Imagine all that taking ten minutes instead of seconds. That's how this movie felt to me. And why is it so long? Because apparently the director doesn't know the word ""cut"", leading most scenes to go on a minute or two too long. Including fifteen minutes dedicated to peanut butter and a sex scene that has us staring at Brad Pitt's bulging eyes for another fifteen minutes. Oh I'm sure the scene lasted for a couple of minutes at best, but it sure felt like an eternity.

It also doesn't help that the film is positively diabetic. Especially the ending, which tries so hard to be emotional and heartfelt that I feel sorry for it. Because it isn't. It's manipulative, forced and banal. I'm sorry, ending, that's the truth.

Meet Joe Black has its fans and in some sick manner I can even see why. Its actors are capable, the story has that sugary quality to it that appeals to some and it is professionally made, aside from the length of it. Personally I died a little watching it. As in I'm three hours closer to death and I have nothing to show for it.",3
23 September 2020,"When You Meet Joe, Ask Him For My Three Hours Back","I don't know what I was expecting from this, I'd never seen it and knew nothing about it but wow...

I'm going to echo what a lot of people said, no hot takes here. This is a three hour slog of meandering plot lines, overly pretentious fluff cinematography and very forced relationships.

That said, the acting is solid given what everyone has to do and the concept is intriguing enough, even though the delivery fails. Oh, and it's wildly predictable, save for one surprise the entire movie plays out as you'd expect.

Pretty disappointing for something that seemed desperately striving to be Oscar bait to end up being so tedious and underwhelming. Hopkins is good here, because he's Anthony Hopkins and that's what he does. Side from that this isn't really worth watching. That said, if you have a few hours to kill and need background noise then this is a good candidate. Watch the first twenty minutes of setup and after that this thing is basically on autopilot anyways.",4
4 December 2020,Death is in Love,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",1

2 June 2016,Far too long and overly serious,"Death takes the body of a dead man (Brad Pitt) and calls himself Joe Black. He gets a rich older man (Anthony Hopkins) to teach him about life (for what reason I've forgotten). He also falls in love the man's beautiful daughter (Claire Forlani).

I'm not gloating when I say I saw this up a theatre in 1998. The reviews were negative and the totally ridiculous 3 hour length gave me pause but I liked the cast and it SOUNDED interesting. What I got was an overly serious, slow-moving and frankly boring movie. There are a few (VERY few) good moments her and there but they're totally lost in this boring, sleep-inducing mess. The main problem is the length. This did not need to run three solid hours. I remember at the two hour mark quite a few people walked out of the theatre I saw it in. I can't blame them. I was thinking of joining them but decided to stick it out because I was mildly interested in how it would end. The problem is it had THREE different endings--all were bad and dull. It's a real shame because there's a really good two hour movie here screaming to get out. A pointless waste of celluloid.",1
15 January 2022,When death comes to dinner,"An aging businessman chances death and has to define his legacy. Don't be tricked Anthony Hopkins is the protagonist like a Christmas carol has look death in the face. While his daughter confronts the death of love. Pretty good writing throughout and jokes thrown in intelligently and strangely. The problem with this movie is that it's long drawn out, during the long dialogues my brain switches off and thinks about something else, this movie is over 2 and half hours. Also the sound mixing needs tweaking in a lot of the scenes the characters are mumbling meaning you have to really concentrate to understand them over the rather really good soundtrack. If you can stand strange comedy and a looong build this ones for you.

13 September 2020,Brilliant.,"A powerhouse masterpiece. Nothing is out of place in this story. It's brilliant. The emotions build up relentlessly towards the finale. We the viewers know a secret that most of the characters in the film don't. That fact contributes to a head on collision between the film and us relating to the concept of knowing who we are and promotes the notion that we shouldn't lie to ourselves or others. This 'known' secret also causes some mighty emotion to orbit and tug us away. So well done.

21 November 2004,Purely Captivating!,"I first saw this film many years after its first release and let me tell you I have never since or will I ever see such a moving and purely captivating movie.

Anthony Hopkins is already my idol and I have admired him for many years. There's something about the unique persona he brings upon any character he plays in a movie, as if he leaves part of himself behind on the film reel each time. From psychological thrillers like The Silence of the Lambs to emotional dramas, he also strikes me as a modest man and is, in my eyes a true genius!

Meet Joe Black is a strange tale that challenges our preconceptions of death. You come out of the film not so much enlightened but convinced that Bill Parrish is happy with the fate that comes upon him and that everyone else is too. It's immensely sad yet happy at the same time and thought-provoking. It is also a very long movie, which I believe strengthens it as you feel you have a bond with the main characters having known them for a long time and thus share the highs and the lows emotionally throughout the plot.

Providing you can stick to the 3hour film length it will truly be one of the most memorable films you'll ever watch. Excellent!",10
4 February 2007,"Engrossing story and one majestic performance, both compromised by puppy love subplot","Anthony Hopkins is resplendent and regal as a 65-year old communications tycoon who wakes one morning with pains and is hearing voices; turns out his time has come to check out, but the personification of Death (""a kid in a suit"", Hopkins says) has decided to take a vacation and allow Hopkins a chance to say goodbye. The 1934 movie ""Death Takes a Holiday"", which was based on a hit play from the 1920's, was certainly ripe for a re-imagining, and that job has been accomplished here very well. Brad Pitt's Grim Reaper is a bit like Peter Sellers in ""Being There"", a wide-eyed innocent and fish-out-of-water; to his credit however, Pitt doesn't rely on coy shtick and has a few excellent moments (particularly with an ill Jamaican woman in the hospital). A romantic subplot between Pitt and Hopkins' youngest daughter is handled with exasperating taste, prolonging the proceedings to an inordinate length (and capping the movie with a ridiculous final ten minutes), but Anthony's glorious performance remains the centerpiece of the film and it's worth watching just to see the master at work. **1/2 from ****",6

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",7
2 June 2000,Don't meet him,"This could have been a really good film if there had been some consistency with the character of Death. He is powerful and all-knowing when need be, and totally clueless the rest of the time. Death's work is to end every human life at their appointed time, but he has no idea what he's ending. So, for reasons unknown he has the time and ability to find out. Pitt is handsome and charming as a doomed young man in a coffee shop, and handsome, boring and charmless as Death. Hopkins can do great work even in a flawed film. Forlani is believable and beautiful, despite looking as though she is about to fall asleep every five to ten minutes. Not a good quality for a character in a nearly three hour movie. Harden and Tambor (both wonderful talents long before Larry Sanders existed) do some top-quality film work. The message seems to be that family is most important, lots and lots of money is really good, and that death and taxes are still inevitable. I think they also ask the cinematic question, ""Just how long can we get away with keeping the camera focused on a well-groomed Brad Pitt in total silence?""

9 March 2002,In Another Body,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",
4 April 2010,A Wonderful Film,"It is rare to see a film that is as quiet as it is forceful. It's like standing before a breathtaking view alone with only the sounds of life and nature. Such a view inspires awe, reverence and silence. This comes close to the unusual feeling I get whenever I watch ""Meet Joe Black"".

I had the occasion to watch it again on HBO, and I was caught up in its magic one more time.

Yes, it is of ungainly length (3 hours), and it is slow by modern film standards, but it engrosses me, because it is unique. Director Martin Brest and acting heavyweights Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt make each scene so weighty and powerful that the hidden drama of Death, literally personified by Mr. Pitt's character Joe Black, presence with good man William Parrish, Anthony Hopkins, never leaves the viewers attention.

Mr. Pitt acts with a gentleness and power that he has rarely demonstrated in any other character. Mr. Hopkins portrayal leaps off the screen like a force of nature equaling death, itself -- how many actors can do that?

The final corporate war confrontation between the character of Drew, portrayed by gifted actor Jake Weber (from TV's ""Medium""), versus Black and Parrish is a true delight - Mr. Weber would have to be gifted to hold his own in a scene with Mr. Pitt and Mr. Hopkins (and he does so on three separate occasions in the film).

Of special note is the performance by Claire Forlani, portraying the daughter of William Parrish, who falls in love with Joe Black. She has a special gentleness in her performance which makes it completely believable that if something like ""Death"" physically walked the Earth, he would fall in love with her.

I wish that a film like ""Meet Joe Black"" could have reached its audience at 3 hours, like ""Titanic"", but life and the world does not work that way.

I do hope anyone who reads this review, gives this film a chance, and lets its quiet passion sweep them up.",9
15 November 2001,"Not for Shallow, Thoughtless or Insensitive Individuals...","This is a movie only for individuals who possess layers below their skins where the eyes cannot discern or the hand cannot feel, for individuals who possess layers below their hearts where the soul only reaches and the mind cannot fathom.

I wallowed in the gentle and peaceful pace of this movie. I entered into it's even breath, into it's solemn hope and I came away with more life than I had before.

I can only pity those individuals who cannot sit back for just three hours of their lives and slow down to take in every nuance that this movie has to offer.

We are becoming accustomed to movies which move faster than the clip of a music video. It is remarkable that when offered a movie faster and wilder than a music video, most of the public could not take it. That movie was ""Moulin Rouge"". It was too fast, they said. Balderdash! It was glorious fast and deliriously wonderful.

Well folks, how fast is too fast and how slow is too slow? Have our minds become so hard as to not embrace the widest range of human experiences and appreciate them all for their own individual worth and their particular message?

Their is room in my psyche to enjoy Meet Joe Black and Moulin Rouge as equal partners in new territories of entertainment.

If you want your entertainment in a bottle and your life in a can, then this will not be your movie. And I regret that, truly.

Pitt, Hopkins, Forlani, Harden, Tambor, Howard and that exquisite Jamaican woman, Lois Kelly-Miller were engaging and brought us a memorable experience. The Brest direction, cinematography, writing and music were equally as absorbing and a pleasure to the senses.

Thank you all for a movie I won't soon forget....and there haven't been many new ones who can take that trophy home.",10
21 June 2021,First one to blink loses,"I can't quite believe how bad this film was. Or how many individual people reviews rate highly this film. I guess there is always divided opinions.

You have a great director. First class actors. Super sets and moving music.

But the film is utter rubbish.

Joe Black comes across as a 10 year old possessing the body of a grown man.

So much staring, stalking and general creepy. But with that face guaranteed to get the billionaress.

14 December 2022,One of the Most Enjoyable Movies I've Seen,"This is one of those movies where you can unironically say ""they don't make them like they used to"" and ""you could not make this movie today"". Because it's a 3-hour-long movie with long scenes of dialogue for the whole runtime, and that's what's so great about it. The director isn't worried about time constraints and we have long scenes that linger and actually add to the enjoyment of the scene rather than making them boring. Not one scene made me think that it doesn't belong in the movie and I would've rather if it was cut, I enjoyed the 3 hours through and through. So some people might find it extremely boring and long, and I totally understand that, but not me, I didn't find it boring or long at all.

This is also one of those movies where I don't care about the plot holes and love the movie regardless. And trust me, you can nitpick the ish out of this movie, but I don't care and enjoyed this movie thoroughly. The great acting and dialogue and the mesmerizing music must've hypnotized me because this movie is total bonkers and not realistic at all, but I loved every second of it. Not to mention one of the genre tags of the movie is fantasy, so I don't know why people expect total realism from it.

Also also, this is one of those movies where I can see the problems and still enjoy it nonetheless. So I agree and totally understand if most people don't like this and at least 90% of their complaints are valid and I get why some won't like this ridiculous premise and plot or don't like character decisions, especially the younger daughter's. So I respect if someone didn't like it for valid reasons and not hating just for the sake of hating it, but like I said, I can see and agree with the problems and still enjoy the movie.

Another reason that I liked this movie so much and that I enjoy this type of romantic movies is that there is fantasy and fiction integrated into the romance and it's not a generic romantic movie. I'm not really a romantic movie type of guy, but these seem to work for me. Another romantic movie that I loved was About Time and for the same reason, it uses the fantasy element to elevate the story and make it more interesting, and I take About Time and Meet Joe Black over other cookie-cutter ""realistic"" romantic movies that are just straight romance. Atonement is another great example of a great romantic movie for my taste, though it's not a fantasy like About Time or this movie, but it's another example of a unique and different romantic movie.

Also don't get me wrong, the movies are still grounded in reality and that's what I mean when I say that the fantasy and supernatural elements serve the story, not the other way around.

The acting by everyone in this movie is great and Anthony Hopkins once again shines and I get reminded of how great of an actor he is. It is actually shocking that he didn't even get nominated for this movie. Brad Pitt is amazing as always and Claire Forlani is great too. I don't think the movie and the romance would've worked if these two people weren't this attractive and beautiful and didn't have such great chemistry together for us to watch and never get bored of.

Speaking of shocking Oscar snubs, the fact that they didn't even consider Thomas Newman for the masterpiece he created for this movie is just sad. The music is just one of the best things I've heard in movies and immediately became of my favorite movie themes. I quickly looked up and downloaded Whisper Of A Thrill after watching the movie. The movie wouldn't've been half as good without this amazing soundtrack.

Like I said, the movie has tons of plot holes and problems and unrealistic stuff if you think about it, but the direction, the cinematography, the actors, the music, they all just did something that I can't really explain what, but they all came together to make a movie that I don't care about the nitpicks and the plot holes and just enjoy the ish out of it and I can look past the problems and still give it an 8/10 because I think it's that good and even more.

Even if you're not into romantic movies or long 3-hour movies bore you, I recommend watching it because in my opinion, it is definitely worth watching at least one time in your lifetime. Don't deny yourself a movie with amazing scenes, amazing acting from Hopkins, mesmerizing music, and the beauty and chemistry of Pitt and Forlani.",8
17 April 2014,A very nice and charming romance tale.,"This is a very nice and charming romance movie, a story about media tycoon William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) who is visited by Death itself, in the form of Joe Black (Brad Pitt). His intention was to take William with him, but William's daughter Susan (Claire Forlani) has met the man that Joe Black resembles and she falls in love with Joe, changing the life and death course of events.

More than a romance and love story, this film delves into the mystery of death, creating a suspenseful plot that I've found made the movie intriguing. While Joe's visit was to take William with him, it is interesting to see what he chooses to do throughout the course of the movie when he establishes a love connection with Susan.

The acting is pretty good for the most part, albeit wooden at times, and there are some slow, filler scenes, but not enough for me to think the movie was boring. The set of the film, particularly the Parrish mansion, is beautiful.

I am not a huge fan of romance movies, but I give this one an exception as it has a mysterious and suspenseful twist to the story about love, life and death.

Grade B",8
11 March 2006,You don't have to worry about taxes once you are dead.,"I really like this movie. Brad Pitt was perfectly cast. His boyish charm is a winner. And his robotic acting fits the role.

Claire Forlani is perfect as the fall in love, bashful beauty. Man, check out the pool scene for a steamy romp. Claire goes all out to deliver the most vampish look, and she carries it off very well.

But of course Anthony Hopkins carries the movie. The scenes with him and Brad are priceless. Hopkins is able like none other, to evoke emotions that are integral to the movie's purpose.

There are some sci-fi boundaries that are crossed in this story, which are concepts you just need to accept if you want to enjoy the movie.

16 May 2021,Meet Joe Black For Three Long Hours,"With rare ex exceptions, no movie should be over 2 hours long. This one is three and should have been cut way down. Bad editing. The film itself is pretty good, but slow moving at times. There were points when I was losing interest. Anthony Hopkins steals the show as he usually does. However, it could have been so much better if it's length was properly cut.

3 January 2002,Try not to insult other people's opinions!,"Please, enough with the ridiculous assumption (for this and other films) that if one didn't like it, one must be somehow intellectual or spiritually inferior to those who did. Surely you can express your opinion about a film without maligning the intelligence of those who don't share it.

I saw Meet Joe Black in the theater when it came out, which was a grave error. By the last third of the movie I was literally banging my head on the back of the chair in frustration. I came close to walking out, but damn me, I had to see how it all turned out. At this point, that wasn't even worth the time really, because I can look back and say with certainty ""who cares!"". If I were Anthony Hopkins, I would have told Death to kill me now rather than living the rest of my life, if it was going to be so excruciatingly dull!

Please note that when I say that the best part is when Brad Pitt gets run over with the car and thrown through the air, it's not because I want more action in a film. Action films are by far not my favorite genre. I'll take character development over explosions any day. It's simply because the ridiculousness of that moment sums up the whole futile effort that is this film! That moment actually made me *laugh*, and not because I'm cold hearted - I've cried at many a film - but simply because like everything else in this film, it was badly done and elicited the opposite effect that it was attempting to achieve.

My dislike of the movie had nothing to do with my ability to grasp it's ""subtlety"". It was about as subtle as a sledgehammer. Actors staring at each other with cow eyes and waiting a minute between ever line of dialogue doesn't make that dialogue any more meaningful, just spectacularly boring.

As other reviewers have noted, excising these excruciating pregnant pauses from many of the scenes might have made the film more tolerable. I definitely wish I had a fast forward button. If I had it to do all over again I would have just walked out and rented it later to watch the end and not wasted another second of my life. One other reviewer asked what else could we have been doing with our time. It's not what one does with one's time, it's whether one enjoys it or not, or actually does something productive. The three hours I wasted on Meet Joe Black were neither enjoyable nor productive. Maybe your time isn't precious to you, but mine is to me, and at the very least I could have been watching a better movie!",1
25 July 2022,"""If we lucky, maybe, we got some nice pictures to take with us...""","Brad Pitt going Jamaican isn't something I expected to see but I loved it. The premise of the movie is amazing, if you'd imagine death manifesting itself as a man, the last thing you'd think of is it becoming a love story and I'm a sucker for a love story. I love how immature to it the character was; it's someone who's been around for a long time but it's his first time in love, so he acts and feels the same way you felt about your first love in high school, makes the same assumptions and mistakes. It makes you relate to him as if he were human. I loved the conversations with the dying lady in hospital, it was insightful but what made it more is death still had a thing or two to learn about loneliness.

It is an exceptionally long as far as most movies go; I thought it was going to end after the board meeting call at the party but was sad the love story was ended abruptly, fortunately there was still half an hour to go. The ending is a bit wonky, borderline of what I'd call sensible to say the least, I think it felt rushed. I don't think it could have been changed much, if Susan did go as far as to realize he was death and here for her father, it would have then made sense if she could tell the man who returned was the one from the coffee shop and that joe black was gone, along with the father... but that would mean she accepted this whole situation implausibility quickly. I don't want to think about it too much because it didn't really ruin the movie experience for me. Another movie that makes me feel like movies used to be so much better 'in the old days'.

It does have a typical message you'd expect in a movie concerning death: realizing the things that really matter when you're finally at deaths door, a little cheasy but it's not enforced and I was a little more intrigued by the love story. It is extra cheesy and a little trite when thought of as either a romance or fantasy on it's own; entities like death manifesting itself as man on the fantasy side is something that's been explored, or a man falling in love with a woman on false pretense+name and it getting complicated in the end has been explored too. The acting is decent but nothing spectacular, I don't think the movie called for it though as it was minimalist. You'll find flaws if youre looking for them but I love this movie because it brings together two genres I like, fantasy and romance.",8
10 November 2019,Eternal Life for good Scripts,"When death is personified there are sociological, theological and linguistic traps of every manner waiting and yet this piece of writing, coupled with one of the most beautiful musical scores ever, works through and through.

The very late plot twists keep us hanging and individual scenes are full of witty dialogue.

What this film does well is bring us face to face with human nature on a variety of levels. It's a story of love, greed, death, ambition and family with cinematic visuals that inspire a classic that is able to re watched over and over with the other great motion pictures.

Casting is rather perfect for the well defined characters, little is wasted and every scene works on it's on.

16 December 2000,One of the Worst Films OF All Time,"I had a bad feeling about this film, but never did i imagine a film this bad. Its too long, it drags on with endless boring scenes and it has a soppy pathetic eending that i could laugh at. Brad Pitt is terrible in it so is Clare Florani and even Anthony Hopkin's couldnt save this film. This film will put you to sleep and should be avoided at all costs!

7 October 1999,In a word...Bad,"Well, they finally did it. They made a movie that actually, officially has no plot what-so-ever. Congratulations fellas. Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt star in this historic film. Yes, both of them are fine actors with alot of on screen charisma, but here is just doesn't seep through. I mean come on Brad, would a facial expression kill ya? Anyways, my advice is to stay away from this unless you got a bad case of insomnia.

2 July 2007,Pitt & Hopkins Make This Confusing Movie Enjoyable,"Meet Joe Black is confusing. If you are the kind of person who enjoys a movie where you have to try to determine what you believe the meaning of the story is, then you will like this film. If you would rather watch a movie that has a straightforward story, then avoid this completely.

I am personally not a huge fan of films like this. Generally, I see them as a gimmick to lovers of old literature who enjoy acting like a sleuth in figuring out what the story means. I used to enjoy doing that in my literature classes in college, but don't enjoy that with films.

Brad Pitt plays Death, who comes to visit Anthony Hopkins for a week or so before Hopkins is to die. Somewhere along the way, Hopkins is supposed to have a revelation about what life means, and I suppose the audience is supposed to as well. It is all rather confusing as to what we are supposed to learn. This film is definitely trying to convey a message, but you have to decipher what it is and quite frankly, it is not that awe inspiring of a message.

With this said, Pitt really is incredible in this film. It is one of his best all-time performances and he has great chemistry on screen with Hopkins. Hopkins, as usual, is also excellent. If it wasn't for the great acting and chemistry of these to performers, I would have stopped watching the movie. As it turned out, I enjoyed watching the film in its entirety just to see these two work. Rating 7 of 10 stars.",7
30 March 1999,Don't meet Joe Black,"Why this film should run for three hours is a complete mystery to me. The screenplay is unbelievably poor (and it's credited to four writers!), the pace is anemic, the plots twists are utterly predictable, the characters are cardboard and reduced to stereotypes. Brad Pitt doesn't have the necessary range as an actor to play this role. At best, he looks wooden, at worst, just plain silly. The glossy production values only underline the futility of the whole enterprise.

10 March 2014,"Captivating commentary on love, life and death","The Grim Reaper (i.e. the Angel of Death) comes to take billionaire industrialist Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) but instead decides to take a holiday in the corporeal universe by possessing the body of a young man (Brad Pitt). Death's deal with Parrish is that, as long as he's entertained, he'll delay Bill's death. Mr. Death materializes as a mysterious stranger with child-like qualities known as 'Joe Black.' His ""holiday"" is complicated when he falls for Parrish's daughter (Claire Forlani).

""Meet Joe Black"" (1998) is a re-imagining of the 1934 film ""Death Takes a Holiday"" (which I've never seen). It has the confidence to take its time at almost 3 hours, but is so captivating that it feels shorter than most 90-minute mindless flicks. The plot is reminiscent of other good ""fish out of water"" stories like Spock in Star Trek, ""Starman"" (1984), etc.

Yes, it's outlandish but the film expertly presents the bizarre situation in a totally believable manner. In other words, this is indeed a serious drama, which nicely balances out the heavy moments with lighter touches. I would compare it to ""The Green Mile"" (1999), another long drama with supernatural touches and wholly captivating.

Despite its fantastical premise, ""Meet Joe Black"" consistently offers profound insights to the most vital topics of the human experience - love, life, death and numerous others, e.g. betrayal, rivalry, hostility, comeuppance and the mysterious beyond. One good example is when Parrish's son-in-law (Jeffrey Tambor) offers a definition of love to Joe Black: To know the worst thing about someone and it's okay, presuming they're penitent. This is just one example; the film is filled with such insights.

""Meet Joe Black"" cost $90 million to make and only made half of it back at the USA box office. Fortunately it has gone on to garner an enthusiastic following and rightly so 'cause this is a near-masterpiece of filmmaking and genuinely moving. I consider myself a masculine man, but tears flowed through approximately 1/3 of the runtime. This is a sign of a potent and affecting picture.

It's a travesty that dreck like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" makes gazillions of dollars and garbage like ""American Beauty"" are hailed as masterpieces while true gems like ""Joe Black"" are often overlooked. The good thing is that time was on Joe Black's side. The word got out.

The film runs 2 hours, 58 minutes, and was shot in Warwick, Rhode Island (Aldrich Mansion); Manhattan; and Teaneck, New Jersey.

GRADE: A/A-",9
12 June 2009,One of the best movies i've ever seen!,"This is shameful.Meet Joe Black is not on IMDb's 250 list,you have got to be kidding me.This is one of the best movie ever an it's rated with 6.8.I can't believe this.It wasn't even nominated by the Academy.This movie is a proof that Oscar's mean nothing!Just as IMDb's ratings.Does anyone actually believes that Batman Begins or Kill Bill are better movies than this one?!I mean those are good movies,great movies but they're not even close to this one.

Meet Joe Black is a well directed,brilliantly acted and perfectly well adapted movie which is just one more movie in the row that deserves to be called a classic but isn't.

If you think i overreacted with bragging this movie,that may be true,but i just can't see why someone wouldn't like this movie.

Meet Joe Black is most definitely my recommendation to everyone who did not see it and to everyone who did see it.At my opinion,this movie is a masterpiece!!!",10
3 May 2006,MJB - sooner or later everyone does,"In my case, it was ""later"". In my harried work-every-day years - so many of them ! - I had never heard of this movie. Had I not been discussing movies I had recently purchased with a postal clerk, in an office I had used for thirty-five of those years,I would never have discovered it: she told me about it, without giving one hint of its content. I am one of those persons who can be told the entire plot without it becoming a spoiler for me. It was the look on her face when she told me, ""I really liked it,"" that gave me the intuition it was something special. She had seen it on cable-TV; I bought it on eBay, without hesitation. A movie-a-night is my passion, so I watched it the very day it came to me. I wasn't fifteen minutes into it when I became aware it WAS something special. I'm not certain I understood too much about it after my first viewing: I may have seen ""Death Takes a Holiday"", but I don't remember having seen it. I'm certainly old enough to have seen the original release.

I have viewed it several times, the last half of it only minutes ago. I have read approximately half of the fifty-five pages of commentaries posted here. I read so few unfavorable ones, which I dismissed without a second thought. I agree with every favorable comment - as varied as they are, each expressing differently their passion for the film - and have learned so much I wasn't sure I understood about the story, from those comments. I totally agree it was made with extreme dedication by everyone who took part in bringing it to an audience starved for classic movie-making.

The combination of Hopkins, Pitt and Forlani - who give their entire souls to this script - is dynamite, plus sumptuous scenery full of very talented people who make this film the masterpiece it is. How gratifying it is to read the glowing comments written by people who know, or recognize, what classic movies are about. Many of the piano-sketches are of a diabolic nature, but played with sweetness.

It needs the full three hours of its length to let love-impossible-love flower. We can only soulfully hope its message is trumpeted around the world, that even The Angel of Death cannot overcome the ultimately consuming power of true love. I am so happy to share the mesmerizing splendor of this unforgettable film. Our love for it will keep it alive.",10
25 July 2002,One word :BAD,"If you are going to watch this movie, make sure you arent in arms reach of a loaded gun or knife......... I have seen a lot of really bad movies in my life, if i spent 2 hours writing about how boring and stupid, and utterly pointless this movie is, it still wouldent do it justice. If i had a million dollars I would pay for MST3K to come back and do one more show and make fun of this movie. ""I want to hurt this movie, but i can never hurt it the way that it hurt me""

19 June 2002,Surprisingly FANTASTIC!,"I didn't think I'd like this movie, but once i watched it I was hooked! Brad Pitt really made it feel like he was death - not acting as death. And this film also for the time being made me not afraid of dying. I love the acting, the storyline, everything!

My rating 10/10 just excellent!

22 February 2020,Good movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.

I liked ""Meet Joe Black"" (1998) when i first saw it back in 1999 - i was 15 at the time. Today i watched it for a second time - i'm 34 now, so its been almost 20 years - and i still liked it the way i did first time. ""Meet Joe Black"" is by any mean a great movie - it is not. Nor its a classic, but what it is a superbly looking 3 hours movie escapism. It has great premise, great story, very solid acting by my all time favorite Sir Anthony Hopkins and very good performance by always reliable Brad Pitt. Claire Forlani on the other hand did not create very memorable character in my opinion, although she looked absolutely stunning in this movie - you can't take your eyes of her. Production values of this movie were stunning - cinematography by a future 2 times Oscar winner Emmanuel Lubezki, production design by a legendary Dante Ferretti - this movie looks absolutely stunning - no wonder it cost almost 100 mil. to create.

Overall, ""Meet Joe Black"" isn't a great movie, because it has some issues with screenplay (no a great premise), some corny dialog and situations and some scenes that do drag. But other then that - here is fantasy / romance movie that is marvelous to look at. Good movie.",8
24 July 2005,It's A Wonderful Life If You're Extremely Rich,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",4
5 July 2020,Top pick on so many of my lists,"I wore out my VHS copy of this movie and lent out my DVD copy so many times, it's amazing it found its way home. It is on my Favourite Movies of the 1990s list, my Movies Watched Multiple Times list and my Movies to Watch Again list. Now, it is one Netflix, where I just watched it for some uncountable time. This movie plays romance beautifully. It takes its time. Anthony Hopkins performance is stately and rich. I truly believe that this movie would have fallen short if it had not had Claire Forlani's performance of vulnerability and soulful longing. And, then, there is a young Brad Pitt, a strikingly handsome, beautiful man. He was criticized for his wooden portrayal but they missed the point. His acting was on point as he moved seamlessly from an idealistic young man facing a new life that was full of possibilities, to the embodiment of a dangerous and isolated entity seeing life for the first time through its beautiful vulnerabilities. The supporting cast is excellent. The music is perfect. This film is always a straight up 10 out of 10, for me. {Drama, Fantasy, Romance}

22 November 1998,Your Thanksgiving Turkey Has Arrived!,"I was not at all surprised to see four writers on the credits for this film, as it is such an inconstant mish-mash of one ill-defined character after another. There was no way only one thinking person wrote this film. The film moves ponderously from one glacially paced scene after another. I saw this movie at 8:00 in the evening and by 9:00 my son had to shake me because I was snoring in the theater. I don't recall ever falling asleep during a movie before, but ""Meet Joe Black"" did it to me. It is hard to say how long I was ""out"" for. The same scene I was watching when I lost consciousness was still on when I was awakened. In this film that could mean I was out for a second or two or for 10 minutes. The scenes just go on and on and on with not much of anything being said.

My wife was crying through the whole picture and was deeply moved by the whole affair. When I asked her why she said the truths of the movie touched her. To save you from three hours of trite tediousness I present those truths to you now: 1). Families should love one another, 2) don't marry unless you are in love, and 3) good people don't have to fear death. I would add to this list: 1) You can fall in love with someone if he looks like Brad Pitt even though his personality changes repeatedly and you have no idea who he is, 2) death does not know what peanut butter is, but can slip in and out of a Jamaican riff at the drop of a hat, and 3) overly contrived plotting is not the dead art we all hoped it would be by now.

Now before I start hearing the obvious `This guy just hates Brad Pitt' remarks, you should know that I am the Brad Pitt fan in my house. I think Brad is a wonderful actor, but he is so wasted in this drivel. Likewise, Anthony Hopkins has nowhere to go with this script. Is he the hard-driven businessman with a lust for life so great that he attracts the attention of death itself, or is he the guy wasting away his few remaining hours on this planet playing solitaire? Is he the shrewd businessman who is in constant control of every situation, fast thinking and powerful, or is he a guy who stands there with a dumb, dull look on his face when questioned about the mysterious Joe Black, letting his company slip through his fingers? One minute he is calm and collected in his dealings with death, the next he explodes, saying he's fed up, the next he's calm again, and back and forth. Hopkins is a wonderful actor; unfortunately this script asked him to play three or four different roles as the same character.

My son is a good boy and a wonderful son. however, if he were a great son he would have let me sleep through the rest of this film. I can tell it's getting close to Thanksgiving, the turkey just arrived.",1
4 April 2010,""" Take it easy, else, you'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation ""","In 1934, the late great Fredrick March completed a film called ' Death Takes a Holliday.' Splendid and innovative for it's day, it gave one pause on the briefness of life and it's singular, ultimate end. In 1998, a remake of the earlier Classic was made and called "" Meet Joe Black. "" Having seen 'Holiday' I was prepared for it's film resurrection. The gist of the story as written by Ron Osborn is that Death witnesses a sudden and tragic street accident which takes the life of a young man exiting a coffee shop. Assuming his body, Death visits William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) a successful tel-la-communication executive near his 65th birthday and strikes a deal. In exchange for Parrish educating him on the profound sensory delicacies of life, Death will allow him to live until his 65th birthday. The deal is set, until Death discovers he has fallen in love with Susan Perrish (Claire Forlani); William's younger daughter. Another obstacle for William is Drew (Jake Weber) an ambitious, devious and ruthless executive board member who is trying to undermined and destroy all he has built. Unwittingly William's close friend and confident Quince (Jeffrey Tambor) believes Drew and helps to remove and retire Mr. Parrish. The dark plot of this film fills three full hours, but if one follows the fluid direction of Martin Brest, it evolves into a sincere, sympathetic and romantic love story within an innocent, often humorous awakening for the Lord of the Underworld. Despite this being a re-make, it's final result will be seen as a superb recreation and both Hopkins and Pitt are experienced Thespians at their very best. Recommended. ****",8
6 March 2004,Profoundly Moving...,"The concepts of the Ether, the Muses, Life, Death and God are at the cornerstone of my life, my interests and, of this movie.

As others have said, you will either completely love this movie or not.

I number among those fortunate enough who have been endowed with the gift of loving it. Perhaps to an extreme, some might say. Yes, I feel privileged and I am proud of it. MEET JOE BLACK is a sensitive drama about the Great Questions.

I feel a sense of peaceful longing for certain things which MEET JOE BLACK depicts and embodies.

The gentle and kind pace of the acting is a wonder to savor. Something which few movies ever dare to attempt. Eternity, grace, love and curiosity are well represented here. Pitt, Hopkins and Forlani are a gentle spectacle to behold. Weber, Harden and Tambor were on target in every scene. Special mention should be made about the lovely Jamaican lady in the hospital, Lois Kelly Miller. Her interchange with Pitt was unforgettable.

Enough cannot be said about the gentle direction, the insightful writing, the luscious cinematography, the tasteful art direction and the marvelous music by Thomas Newman. What a talented group, these Newmans! One wonders if they will ever rival the extensive genealogy of the venerated families of Johann Sebastian Bach. I certainly wonder how long this legacy will continue. Let's hope for a long time.

So, if you are looking for a movie which just might change you, elevate you, and grasp you at the heart without tearing it out, MEET JOE BLACK is your movie.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I have. And will continue to enjoy it.

Thanks.",10

8 July 2018,Meet Joe Black,"In the recent thriller The Edge, Anthony Hopkins played a wealthy businessman who is transformed by a harrowing encounter with death. In Meet Joe Black, Anthony Hopkins plays Bill, a similar character confronting similar themes, but with a very different twist. Here he meets Death as played by Brad Pitt. Death informs Bill that he wants to see what life is like and he wants Bill to teach him. So long as Death is interested and learning, Bill gets more time. When Bill has to introduce Death to his family at dinner, he fumbles around for a name, eventually coming up with Joe Black.

This is hardly the first film to depict bargains with Death. In Ingmar Bergman's Seventh Seal the allegorical figure of death (complete with shroud) is challenged to a game of chess. His intended victim hopes to forestall the inevitable. Bergman's Death character is reprised in Woody Allen's Love and Death, The Last Action Hero, and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. In Meet Joe Black we are spared the shroud since Death decided to borrow a body from one of his victims. (If you gotta' have one, might as well borrow one that looks like Brad Pitt, I guess.)

The real twist in this film comes in what could be taken as the sub-plot. Death falls in love with Bill's daughter Susan. Susan is involved with Drew, her father's right-hand man in the business world. Drew meanwhile is conniving at some underhanded business deals of his own. The plot takes more than a few twists and turns along the way, but in the end it is neither the plot nor the grand theme (if there is one) that makes the film engaging. Sometimes its the ride itself that makes the journey worthwhile.

Frankly, there are more than a few problems of plausibility here (even after we grant willing suspension of disbelief to the central premise). As one small example, Joe Black is fluent in Jamaican patois, but doesn't know how to tie a tie. The cinematography is good, but not outstanding, and the performances are no more that what we would expect under the circumstances.

Still in all, there were more than a few moments along the way where the audience laughed pretty hard. At one point the audience applauded (in the middle of the movie no less), and I'm sure there were more than a few smiles on more than a few occasions. By the end of the film, director Martin Brest (Scent of a Woman) has given us quite a few simple pleasures along the way. If there is a grand theme to the film, perhaps that is it . . . . it's the simple pleasures that make life good, and in the end, caring is everything.",8
23 May 2020,"Prefer to, at a Much Later Time!","""This is crazy,"" says Anthony Hopkins's character Bill Parrish, a billionaire media mogul to titular character Joe Black, at a fairly early stage of this extraordinarily long remake of the clever, 1934 relatively short film, Death Takes a Holiday. He already knew something many viewers probably didn't. They were in for a very extended, lengthy, muddled ride watching a hugely tedious, undramatic and unromantic film, whereby Death (Joe Black - Brad Pitt) drops into the Land of the Free, to be tutored in ways human, by Bill Parrish and later, his lovely daughter Susan.

Producer/director Martin Brest had a relatively brief ride amongst the Hollywood elites. He made 2 very good action comedies, Beverly Hills Cop and Midnight Run and an OK drama, in Scent of a Woman, all consecutively. From there, starting from this film it was all downhill, ending terminally with the catastrophic Gigli. He hasn't really been heard from since. All the signs pointing to a decline are on show here in this ponderous, pretentious affair.

For a start considering it was made in 1998 for a then, pretty staggering $90 million, it's one of those productions where you just can't see where the money has gone. It does have some opulent sets and locations in a Rhode Island mansion, but so do other films with much smaller budgets. Salaries? Reshoots? I don't know, but unsurprisingly it was a troubled shoot.

It has 2 extremely bankable stars in Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt. Hopkins is as serviceable as ever and undoubtedly would entertain reading a telephone directory. Pitt is not miscast, but I feel hopelessly misdirected. He is asked to play Death as this naive, virginal, neophyte, when the opposite, most certainly could have applied. The eternal Grim Reaper should have been seen as being the epitome of intelligence, charm and attractive menace, especially after his early library introduction with Parrish, when he is invisible. This results in a couple of hours of ""awkward"" between Pitt and co-star Claire Forlani (who really tries her hardest) as Susan, instead of rebirthing the sexy chemistry, we'd been led to believe had been established by the earlier cafe scenes. And speaking of ""awkward"", how about that absurd road accident? Junkies, drunks, fugitives from the law maybe, but sane individuals don't stand in the middle of a busy road, completely love-struck and wait patiently to be run over.

There are sub-plots; which have all the repetition and dramatic heft of your regular daytime TV soaps. I'd like a dollar for every time we saw Pitt and Hopkins standing/sitting bemusedly in a board room meeting in Meet Joe Black. And Marcia Gay Harden's character of Allison, Susan's sister, is (for a 3 hour film), ironically underwritten and generally ill-used.

Laughably Martin Brest apparently took offence at some of the airlines and TV stations who tried to do him a favour and did their own 2 hour edits of the movie. Seems he was incapable of picking up the message that there may have been a few decent ideas in Meet Joe Black that should have been delivered in a more simple and lean package.",4

Character development is off the charts, the top three actors (Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt, Claire Forlani), are perfect. The innocence, the messaging, the dialogue, the movie is perfect. This is storytelling that makes one go to movies. These performances are exceptional, this acting is incredible, this story is compelling from start to finish. The interaction with the island lady is incredible. The dialogue is brilliant, this is special. Watch it. Think on it. This is so deep. This is movie making. This is so thought provoking. Martin Brest has delivered a masterpiece. Your life will not be the same after watching this exceptional movie. Brad Pitt got robbed at the Oscar's. Incredible performances. Incredible movie. Watch it, you will not be disappointed...

14 October 2001,Is Your Time Really That Valuable?,"So many people have complained about the length of this movie. What were all these people going to do with the `offending' 45 minutes? Save the world? Find a cure for cancer--or even bunions?

This movie doesn't have the pacing of Moesha (whom I admire) but why should it? To use a sports analogy, it's more like a baseball than football or basketball. It unravels at its own pace. It provides respite, not competition, to our chaotic environs.

I have had the opportunity to observe a few of the Robert Parishes of the world. They are much more complicated men than how they are portrayed in Hollywood projects. This movie daringly casts a wealthy man as a deeply moral rather than corrupt.

Anthony Hopkins trumpets why life is to be treasured and death despised. Why the person for you might NOT be the one right under your nose, but rather the person you have yet to really meet. That it's worth it to wait for the special somebody who makes your life more vibrant and you a better person to boot. In a world fascinated with the macabre and marketed to the ordinary, such messages are sorely needed.

Being a member of the `Y' chromosome sex, I cannot truly be a Brad Pitt fan. But I must say he did a fine job and had great chemistry with the rest of the cast, all of whom were first-rate. And that death chose to experience life through the body of a morally conscious businessman (instead of a rock star) shows where this movie's values reside.

Meet Joe Black was a brave and inspired movie. I hope at least some give it another shot.",10

Well it is, but that's Life.","As full stops are necessary for ending sentences, brakes are necessary to put stoppage to the acceleration, night to end a day, so is death. Something's need to end so that others can start. That's the theme of the movie, beautifully directed and even more elegantly presented by all the actors. One of the most amazingly crafted movie which really goes into the dimension of evergreen epics. Beyond the horizon of those limited 26 alphabets are capable of expressing. This movie is an experience which every individual should take. Creatively written, unique storyline and powerful acting. 3 hours feel like 30 minutes, that's the level of involvement and grip the movie has. Enlighting and thought provoking.

13 July 2014,beautiful,"I am far to be a fan of it. decent acting, lovely idea and a lot of romanticism for a not really inspired story. the choice of Brad Pitt for lead role is not inspired but he does a great job and that fact saves the movie by many sins. but not the whole. the love is axis, god and excuse for movie. and the good pillars of film are solids. but the basic idea is too fragile and almost fake.sure, the love is its virtue and error but, in fact, after the magic falls, remains a frame of disappointment. but, sure, it is a beautiful film.and that detail does it a successful movie yet. is it enough ? maybe yes. for admirers of Brad Pitt, Sir Anthony Hopkins and romanticism.

4 June 2003,Meet with boredom...,"Remake of a movie launched in 1934 and whose name was ""Death takes a holiday"", ""Meet Joe Black"" must be very inferior to the original movie although I didn't see it. This is the typical movie with a good idea but badly exploited. Here, death is epitomized by a good-looking young man (Brad Pitt) and he'd like to know why men dread so much death. He's settling down in the life of a well-off man (Anthony Hopkins) and his daughter falls in love with Pitt.

""Meet Joe Black"" is a movie whose result isn't convincing at all. The screenplay is very repetitive with annoying cues (Pitt who often asks for peanut butter) and contains a few weaknesses like Pitt's weird car crash at the beginning of the movie. Besides, this is probably one of Pitt's weakest performances to date. He leans too much on his physical appearance and I find him too inexpressive.

It's also a movie that is terribly long-winded and it drags on. A flat and listless film-making doesn't help matters. It focuses too much on the actors' faces as if it wanted to define their feelings.

At last, this is an overlong movie and in three hours you find time to be bored because nearly nothing's happening. A dull and tiresome movie where you only remember Claire Forlani's shiny beauty",
22 March 2008,Another Great Concept Fails to Deliver,"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie a handful of years ago, but only saw it for the first time recently. My expectations for this film were higher than usual: with Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt highlighting a film that paints itself very clearly as philosophical rather than entertaining, I put on my 'literary analyst' cap and popped the DVD in, ready to delve into whatever notion of Death the movie was ready to explore. Even if I'd kept my standards at par, I'd still have been disappointed.

The obvious problem with this film is that it drags. On. And on. And on. This movie would have been absolutely incredible had there been at least an hour and a half less of it. What I was expecting was the Death character questioning or bringing about questions of mortality or family or SOMETHING. Instead he mostly wonders around with a blank stare while obscenely rich people mutter angrily behind his back. There are at least four plot lines going on simultaneously: we have Anthony Hopkins taking death around the world because apparently even Death gets bored sometime, his daughter throwing the Party of the Milennium for Daddy much to his chagrin, a backstabbing employee trying to Oust the Old Boss and Become the New Boss, and the Love Story between non-manic daughter and Death, who has found love. Right away we can (and the producers should have) eliminated the business side of things; it did nothing at all for Pitt's character, except for the last scene which, I will admit, was nicely done, and also tacked on much of the extra mileage of this movie. The love story was fairly well handled.

It was the ending, though, that was the final, crushing blow. After a long, long, LONG drawn-out film I was expecting at least some brilliant moment of realization, some philosophical monologue, something. No, the ending...is rushed. It's as if the director finally realized that he ran long...two and a half hours (or thereabouts; it felt like two and a half) into the film. So, instead, anything any of the characters were supposed to have learned must be inferred via subtext.

This had all of the potential to be an amazing film. The idea was flawless, the cast was brilliant...and it flopped. See it to believe me, but I guarantee you won't watch it twice.",5
21 March 2004,"""Meet Joe Black"" gets 4 enthusiastic stars and 2 thumbs up.","""Meet Joe Black"" is one of those films that will make you smile from start to finish. With talented stars, a script rich in plot and characters, ""Meet Joe Black"" is a movie to watch.

""Meet Joe Black"" is a remake of an earlier film called ""Death Takes A Holiday."" In ""Meet Joe Black"" death takes human form as he comes to see the world, with the assistance of the body he is going to take. Anthony Hopkins adds his superstar status as the fiesty father, which he plays so convincingly.

There is only one result that can come from inserting two of the most talented actors in a film that has great writing. Hopkins stars alongside Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani in one of the most romantic, intelligent and character driven movies I have seen in a long time. Excitement and pleasure were two feelings that made my heart skip a beat.

When I heard Hopkins would be a part of the film, I immediately thought the amount of credibility he would give toward ""Meet Joe Black."" Hopkins is the type of actor like Robert De Niro and Morgan Freeman whose mere presence on film will alert the viewer that they will be watching a great film. Hopkins brought integrity, intelligence, and honesty to this role.

""Meet Joe Black"" is truly a movie filled with romance, excitement, joy, happiness, and sorrow. Brad Pitt's approach was enjoyable to watch as he seemed to pull it off with innocence. It was like he is learning everything from scratch, though he may know more than he is letting on. Also, Pitt's performance is like a mirror image to that of Hopkins.

Forlani is a vision to behold in ""Meet Joe Black"" as her beauty radiates off the screen with such heat. Forlani showcases her true ability to capture the essence of her character and portray it with innocence and sincerity. Audiences will enjoy the surprises Forlani has in store for them.

""Meet Joe Black"" gets 4 enthusiastic stars and 2 thumbs up.",
26 April 2021,Anthony Hopkins...,"Is the only reason I give it a 5. He gets me every time. Other than that, not even Brad Pitt's close-ups could compel me to up my rating from 1 star. Long, drawn-out, dull, full of pregnant pauses that made me want to run for the hills.

28 January 2018,An interesting depiction of death,"Bill, a very wealthy and important person is about to receive an unexpected visit from a very unexpected person. The guy in question is no other than Death itself (as Joe Black), who came to ""collect"" him. Thankfully, Joe isn't in a hurry and the longer Bill is able to keep him entertained, the longer he lives. Thus, Bill must integrate Joe in his family, buying himself time to fix the remaining problems in his life.

It features a lengthy but interesting plot about a man who must keep his integrity while the impersonated death infiltrates into his life and family, threatening him with every move. It's twisted and nonlinear, maintaining suspense and interest throughout its length, keeping you lusting for the upcoming finale. Its love story brings some needed romance into the picture, completing the wonderful atmosphere transmitted by this film. A very enjoyable movie!

27 March 2020,Celebrates living,"A great film that is very ordinary and what I mean by that is, it celebrates normality unlike most movies these days. I felt it was slow-paced, given that we expect movies to show and make us feel things we will never have and make us forget our own reality and the truth of how limited time we have, which this flick is good 3-hour reminder of. Enjoy the small things like peanut butter ;) and live everyday like it's your last.

27 September 2009,Beautiful and peaceful,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",10

21 July 2004,Marcia Gay Harden was extraordinary!,"This is a rather odd film and interesting. I particularly enjoyed the supporting characters who were all excellent. I've always been a fan of Jeffrey Tambor's and found his Quince character to be decent and touching. Jake Weber as Drew was terrific. However, I was blown away by Marcia Gay Harden (playing Allison) and became a big admirer of hers. I'm so glad she's become recognized and acknowledged! What a gifted actress she is. Allison is so real and textured. Marcia makes every scene count. (Mystic River is another example of her great talent.) The best moments in Meet Joe Black were between Marcia and Anthony Hopkins' characters, when she frankly discusses their relationship. She made this movie memorable for me.

30 November 1998,"Whattaya know, Joe?","This could have been a really good film if there had been some consistency with the character of Death. He is powerful and all-knowing when need be, and totally clueless the rest of the time. Death's work is to end every human life at their appointed time, but he has no idea what he's ending. So, for reasons unknown he has the time and ability to find out. Pitt is handsome and charming as a doomed young man in a coffee shop, and handsome, boring and charmless as Death. Hopkins can do great work even in a flawed film. Forlani is believable and beautiful, despite looking as though she is about to fall asleep every five to ten minutes. Not a good quality for a character in a nearly three hour movie. Harden and Tambor (both wonderful talents long before Larry Sanders existed) do some top-quality film work. The message seems to be that family is most important, lots and lots of money is really good, and that death and taxes are still inevitable. I think they also ask the cinematic question, ""Just how long can we get away with keeping the camera focused on a well-groomed Brad Pitt in total silence?""

Brad Pitt plays the role and he does a great job, as do Anthony Hopkins and the rest of the cast.

It has tones of WINGS OF DESIRE and a few other films, but it does its own thing at the same time. It's wonderfully directed. It's about love and life and death and business. It's funny and sad, with some interesting twists and some fun scenes that seem totally new and original. Even at three hours it doesn't feel a bit too long. It's never boring. I've seen it many times over the years. Highly recommend.

20 September 2019,An absolute treasure,"Meet Joe Black

What can I say, you either hate this movie or you love it. For me, it's in my top three movies of all time. It's rare to find movies with such a unique premise (please no more superhero, cop, hospital shows/movies). The acting is superb, the soundtrack is absolutely out of this world, and the subject matter is... happily heavy?

What I love most about this movie is how it simultaneously explores so many different types of relationships and storylines: the love between a father and daughter, romantic love, true love being self sacrifice, the full spectrum of emotions humans have, facing your own mortality, what it truly means to be human, leaving a legacy, the things that really matter in life, settling in love and life, the importance of passion... and so much more. Painfully breathtaking and moving, extremely emotional.

I can honestly only watch this movie once every few years because it brings out such deep, raw emotions,m. I ugly cry, and I can't get it out of my head for days.

It's not for everyone as it's long, a bit slow, and not action packed like most are so accustomed to these days. But if you're looking for depth, a novel storyline, a haunting soundtrack, and stellar acting, this is it. An absolute treasure.",10
2 June 2020,An ambitious movie that is better than many gave it credit for,"Not a commercial or critical hit upon initial release, Martin Brest's long in the tooth and extremely high concept re-imagining of Death Takes a Holiday has over the years remained a well-liked audience drama, even if this unnecessarily epic event has its share of glaring letdowns and mismanagement's.

Well known in the industry for delivering comedy classics Midnight Run and Beverly Hills Cop and the Oscar awarded Scent of a Woman (let's just forget about Gigli shall we?), Brest has proven to be a capable director across a range of genres and its through his keen eye and commitment to remain resolute throughout the very odd happenings in Meet Joe Black that the film remains a watchable experience, even when things appear as though they're set to be derailed at any given minute.

Talking about the film via the written word makes one wonder how on earth such a plot could come to life, with Black's mix of family drama, businesses takeover potboiler (a real anchor to the film), love story and rumination on life and death ensuring that 3 hours of should've been edited film is taken up in all instances, with its capable cast showing a commitment to the cause that showcases its clear many believed in what they were working on.

Remaining a stoic presence throughout and delivering a typically assured performance as wealthy businessman coming to terms with his mortality William Parish, Anthony Hopkins is on fine form here, while the arguably never better Claire Forlani as his daughter Susan reminds us all that her career appears to have been an opportunity lost as she now flounders in direct to VOD fare, leaving the performance of its leading man Brad Pitt the major debating point of a film that many dismissed without ever really giving it a chance.

Playing both a charismatic guy in a coffee shop that meets an untimely (and meme worthy) end after running into Susan at a New York diner and Death himself in the form of the newly minted Joe Black, Pitt's performance is quite possibly the most divisive of his mostly impressive career.

It's hard to know sometimes whether what we are witnessing is one of the more awkward leading turns of the 90's or one of the most unexpectedly brilliant, with Pitt tasked with the unenviable task of showcasing what it may be like should death take the form of a strikingly handsome 30 year old single male, as Joe discovers the joys of peanut butter, French kissing and the art of tie wearing.

It's a tough gig and due to the films often too mawkish in nature script and delivery, leaves Pitt hanging in the wind without a crutch to fall back on and there are often too many odd moments of Joe traipsing about in Parrish's life that leads to an extended 30 minute finale that reaches for the stars but misses by a wide amount.

Throughout Brest's film however there are moments of real tender beauty, backed by a stunning Thomas Newman score and some great moments of movie making art and at its core, Black tells a well-intentioned story that will warm the hearts in various moments, a fact not many movies of this kind can attest to have done.

Final Say -

A story that should never work done in a way that mixes wonderment and bemusement, this overly long and sometimes poorly handled epic isn't classic filmmaking but Meet Joe Black has enough moments of joy and heart in it to warrant another go or perhaps a first time viewing for those turned away by its initially cold public response.

Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",10

26 October 2021,It is so good that is hurts,"What is best about this movie? Well, the dialogues.

They are not so much about what is said, but the body language, the eye expressions, the smiles, the years, they say more than words. I cared about the characters, and I did wanted a happy ending, because the movie depicts a family you admire. And the beauty of the main couple is the cherry on the cake. Just looking at them is like and experience itself.

26 July 2005,I have this vision,"of Benjy Stone and company sitting around and writing this screenplay, but there is no King Kaiser to tell them it smells, so each of them gets to put in their little story, with the result that when the film seems like it is about to end, it still has 45 minutes to go. Benjy, the lover of Alan Swan movies, insists it needs the big business intrigue, which could have been dispensed with a lot easier, and with two or three less characters to clutter the landscape. Cy wants to punch it up with a sex scene, and has the idea to shoot it so that with a few added cameras, it can qualify for late nights on Cinemax as a half-hour feature. Silent Herb has the right idea: why can't Death just come for this big wig and leave it at that. Maybe he can choke on a gristly piece of lamb and get the picture over in 90 minutes.

Thirteen years ago my friend D___ dropped dead at 62 on a Long Island golf course. He had piles of money, loving kids, a wonderful second wife and many friends. He was lucky; he told me once that was how he wanted to go. If he'd waited, this film would have killed him.",4

3 March 2000,The person reading this could do a better job,"The cinematography and soundtrack were above average -- the movie looked and sounded fine.

However, anyone reading this humble review could write a better script.

Boy meets girl. Both are very engaging. The possibility of a straight story being told and the potential entertainment that might have been makes MEET JOE BLACK all the more horrible.

GHOST used the afterlife myth plot in an interesting and fun way. JOE BLACK did not and fell flat.

No wonder Anthony Hopkins (incorrectly) claimed that he never wanted to act in another movie again after he saw the final cut of JOE BLACK. No wonder that in promoting this movie, Brad Pitt did the talk show circuit and stuck to praising his fellow actors.

Last, chocolate is the number ONE most craved food on earth -- the food of the gods, the food of passion, etc -- NOT peanut butter.",1
19 May 2006,A Beautiful And Melodious 'Romance' Movie,"I remember that when this movie came out, a lot of people were disappointed with it. The chief problem I heard was that it was long. Well, it is long, running exactly three hours to the end of the credits. But I find that the length allowed me to achieve some 'distance' from the events that began the story, so that when the ending arrived, it wasn't so fresh - in other words we as viewers have been taken on a journey.

And what a journey! We are treated to a warm and insightful examination of what it means to love. The love of a father for his daughters, and between the characters of Susan (the always-stunning Claire Forlani) and Joe (the equally gorgeous Brad Pitt), are the main focus of the story, but we are also treated to a very special moment as Jeffrey Tambor's character (a corporate ""loser"" with an ill-fitting suit and unfortunate facial hair) shares the joy of his relationship with his neurotic wife (the wonderful Marcia Gay Harden). There are also hints of fraternal, platonic love among Joe, his ersatz guide (Anthony Hopkins), and his son-in-law, Tambor.

This is not an immature or simple love, either. The film deals tenderly with questions of responsibility and power, self-giving and fidelity. I am a huge fan of stories in which a person simply and confidently ""is who they are"" and forces others to react, think, and make decisions. There are several moments in this movie when Joe follows Lewis Carroll's great advice, ""When in doubt, don't just do something. Stand there."" There is an entire conversation with Susan in which he says nothing, but it is not one-sided, because she is forced to think about what she's saying. (Another example of a film where someone forces others to react and grow, simply by being himself, is ""Life As A House."")

One of the problems with the initial release of this film may have been the theatrical trailer, which portrays a fun, humorous, and 'jaunty' Rom-Com with a slight metaphysical twist. People who went expecting to see that kind of movie would certainly be disappointed. The metaphysical content is more than slight (Joe is the personification of Death), and the movie never becomes fun or jaunty. What it is, is touching, intelligent, and utterly romantic in the best sense of the word.

On the negative side, it is difficult to identify with the lifestyle of the characters (Hopkins is an unimaginably wealthy media mogul) and I found the sheer opulence and excessiveness of their surroundings to be distracting at times. However, it does make for great eye-candy on the screen, and the actors are more than able to bring their characters to life; none of them are dilettante, and Hopkins brings an elegance and self-awareness to the ""rich man"" stereotype.

And speaking of stereotypes, the only antagonist in the film (Jake Weber as Hopkins' corporate right-hand and Susan's would-be love-interest) ends up a two-dimensional and utterly unsympathetic character who is incapable of the kind of love displayed by the people around him. It's a disappointing caricature in a movie filled with deeply explored archetypal characters. The filmmakers had an opportunity to demonstrate that all people have subtle, nuanced personalities, but there is none of that with Weber's role. On the other hand, Weber does a fine job with what he was given, and it is an interesting example of how an immature or self-interested person will attempt to sabotage the well-being of others rather than allow them to change and grow.

This is an unusual movie that has not developed a cult following, which means it is probably destined to be overlooked by both the mainstream and the fringe movie fan, which is unfortunate. If it had been better marketed (the trailer is a criminal misrepresentation of the movie) it might have a higher profile today. At any rate, if you are a fan of careful, thoughtful, and emotionally mature storytelling, I fully recommend this movie to your perusal. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.

9 December 2022,Philisophical -- don't take time for granted!,"Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt have each made dozens of fantastic movies and this flick should be near the top on both of those lists.

This exquisite film is very very unique. Although the idea of ""death knocking on the door"" and end-of-life themes have been oft-explored, Meet Joe Black manages to blend humor, drama, and reflection in ways that few have done before.. or after.

This flick attempts to examine humanity as whole and weigh the good against the bad. It reminds us that life is both wonderful and complex -- and that you can't hang on!

PS: CON: The movie is extremely long at around 3 hours of run-time and it unfolds in a bit of a cliche fashion. Pro: Amazing cinematography!

30 August 1999,Lots of eye-gazing!,"If you overlook the impossible plot and sit back and enjoy the screen presence of Anthony Hopkins and boyish good looks of Brad Pitt, ""Meet Joe Black"" is entertaining enough though at 180 minutes it's rather too long. The early coffee-shop scene which introduces the Joe Black character is most enjoyable and the parting of the ""lovers"" with backward glances is a charming interlude in the story. Then comes the traffic fatality- a sudden jolt and so unexpected. There is a lot of eye-gazing in the next two hours and very little audible conversation. There is a lot of speaking in whispers! I thought the final birthday celebrations were much overdone even for a very wealthy family, but at least the spectacular fireworks could be heard. If you watch the closing scene carefully, you will note that although the sky is filled with brilliant light from the multitude of bursting rockets, the dark figures of of Pitt and Hopkins who are walking up the stone steps of the garden are not illuminated by flashes of colour from the sky. This is a bad oversight. One expects better.

PLEASE don´t waste your time and money on this movie

3 August 2006,Simply beautiful........,"Have you ever watched a movie where you are taken from one beautiful moment to another, and continues until the very end? well 'Meet Joe Black' is one such film.

There are many other excellent reviews of this movie, and while I subscribe to most of those opinions, I like most how 'Meet Joe Black' puts the viewer in a rather unique perspective: To be able to 'feel' the characters innermost feelings through subtleties of their speech. How do you honestly answer a question you aren't supposed to, yet answer the question honestly? This movie is full of nuances of such dialogue exchanges which contain a superficial, yet profound undertone throughout.

I also like the presence Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani bring to the screen, and the complementary performances that resemble a finely-tuned symphony. The storyline, dialogue and character development is beautifully crafted through a remarkable script - and very fine acting. The musical score is also well done in this film, and is a true delight to hear.",10
21 June 2013,A different romance,"I just got through watching this again. I didn't remember that What A Wonderful World/Over the Rainbow by Israel ""IZ"" Kamakawiwoʻole played at the end during the credits. What a beautiful way to end a beautiful movie. I would have made a few different decisions, the main one being a different leading lady. She is crazy attractive but not the greatest talent. Still, she was far from a mistake. Brag Pitt was awesome. I mean, GEEZ! I'm not gay but is this guy good looking or what. It was stupid. And his attitude was perfect for the role. Like the girl said in the movie, his indifferent attitude was sexy...or something like that. Hopkins was Hopkins. This dude couldn't turn in a bad performance if his family was held hostage and the captors demanded a bad performance for their safety. The ending was amazing. It captured the sorrow of love and goodbye perfectly. In closing, this whole movie reminded me of that first love, where you couldn't quite get a good breath and where every second was filled with thoughts of them. Still sad in the end but very romantic. I would think, the perfect date movie...although it is 3 hours. Maybe too long for a date. But try it anyway.",8
14 September 2003,This film is a brilliant beautifully moving film,"This film is brilliant & beautifully moving, wonderfully scored & perfectly casted. Yes its three hours long but it just means it lasts longer and thats good because I loved it. I can't understand all these moaning people slagging this movie off, they should get out more I would guess that any bloke slagging it off would just be jealous of Pitt's looks.

Hopkins plays his part with sincerity & is very moving, Brad Pitt is ideally cast and his acting in it is far better than the miserable lot here would have you believe, the supporting cast were very good as well especially Tambor

15 June 1999,Poor older sister,"The dad obviously barely cared for the older daughter, not even bothering to try a false repudiation of her statement that he had always favored the younger daughter. She strove the whole movie to please her dad and he ignored her almost completely. it was quite sad.

The movie was a little too long. I was also not enjoying Pitt's attempt at a jamacian accent.

can't wait to see the original though.

13 June 2022,"This movie helped me heal, and hurt at the same time","There are few movies that can trigger healing, from grief and cause the grieving to surface all at the same time. This movie did it all. Every person in it knocked it out of the park. I've seen this movie 3 or 4 times, because of the way I feel when it ends. Next year will be the 25th anniversary of it, and I will be watching it again (probably before that) I highly recommend this movie to everyone.

23 January 2020,it's time to tie your brain in knots,"When ""Meet Joe Black"" got released, a lot of people went to see it just for the ""Phantom Menace"" trailer. Infamous as ""The Phantom Menace"" was, the trailer must've been the only interesting thing about this melodrama. The movie itself is probably best known for getting Universal executive Frank Biondi fired due to the movie's weak performance (a mere two weeks later, the dismal performance of ""Babe: Pig in the City"" got Casey Silver fired). Leave it to Robin Williams to give the studio a hit (""Patch Adams"" was Universal's only successful movie in 1998; it got the studio out of the hospital, you might say).

Anyway, back to this one. Director Martin Brest is best known for ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and ""Scent of a Woman"" (his last effort, 2003's ""Gigli"", became a punchline and pretty much ended his career). It probably says something about Hollywood that the director of one of the most famous movies of the '80s is practically unmentionable nowadays.

Basically, even if you interpret the movie as a look at the meaning of life, it's still three hours leading to a cop-out ending. The original version, 1934's ""Death Takes a Holiday"", isn't much to brag about either.",4

3 March 2005,Proudly enters my #1 position!,"There's an sense of awe in my mind, I have never seen so beautifully described, in so many angles shown - LOVE. The meaning of life, for one who ever met it on his way, the origin of good which makes even death bow to the ground, that's it - we, humans, are made for LOVE. I can't explain to myself why this movie has so low note from watchers, maybe the LOVE experience isn't as common as I thought? ""When you find love, when you know that it exists..."" - George Michael, and yes, what a terrible amount of LOVE has created us, human beings? I highly recommend this movie, watch it with someone you love for the full blown experience and if you don't understand what ""to love"" means, maybe this movie can help you... love.

5 February 2004,Awe Inspiring,"Meet Joe Black is a beautiful in just about every way. It's 3 hours long and if you let the beauty of this film take hold of you, you'll not feel as if any time has gone by at all.

It's a film about ""death"" and it is rich in everything that make a movie a sentimental favorite in the ""It's a Wonderful Life"" vein. In short, if you do not fall under the spell of this film, you are a hopeless cynic without a whit of heart!

What's beautiful about Meet Joe Black? First of all, it's directed with such love and and an eye for detail that you can't take your eyes off it. The art direction, cinematography, musical score and staging are blended into an artistic triumph. The music by Thomas Newman is especially brilliant; haunting and sinuous.

The cast is so good, it's hard to believe the movie was received so disparagingly by critics. Brad Pitt's impersonation of the devil inhabiting a young man's body is pitch perfect in every way. He gets everything right; a child like innocence of first experiences. Anthony Hopkins has never been better. Claire Forlani says more with facial expression than a thousand lines. Her love scenes with Pitt are unique. They're not only erotic, but deep and soulful in all the right ways. Marcia Gay Harden is perfect and Jeffrey Tambor as Quince gives a delectable portrait of a character we've all met and known from time to time.

This is a ""feel good"" movie, so it was automatically dismissed by half the critics out there. It not only makes you feel good about life and death, but it makes you contemplate a lot of the important, simple issues of our existence.

A classic in every way that will be loved by the lucky souls who really understand it.",10
16 November 2006,What If Death Came?,"MEET JOE BLACK ***1/2 Have you ever feared death? What if death came knocking on your door for you? That's the premise of 'Meet Joe Black', a unique, thought-provoking story of an aging businessman (played by Anthony Hopkins) who has grown wise through life's journey, and Death Incarnate, in the form of an Earth-bound man of curiosity (Brad Pitt), dismissing him from his time on Earth. It's a strange thing for both our characters, as Hopkins, now, must say goodbye to his loves, and Pitt starts exploring the enriching human truths that define ideal relationships, particularly that which becomes of his newfound attraction to Hopkins's daughter. An interesting - albeit overdrawn - movie.

9 August 2003,Meet the devil,"The movie is slow and surprising. You cannot foresee the events and the ending. Brad Pitt is convincing. The dialogues are sober but efficient. The encounter of Joe in the dining room is well written. Is this a movie of our time? I think it is too spiritual to be commercial. Anyway, well tried by the producers, the actors and the director. The Enron case has now (dis)appeared and people look different at all forms of fraud; so this movie has really a message.

27 June 2021,Misunderstood (Some spoilers ahead),"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",9

16 November 1998,A trite 3 hour butt killer,"If someone told me that I'd be wasting not only four bucks, but three hours of my life, sitting in the most uncomfortable of places as a witness to one of THE most boring love stories of all time, I would NOT have gone to see ""Meet Joe Black."" Or, as I like to call it, ""Dramatic Long Pause."" Don't get me wrong, I think Clair and Brad are fabulous actors, and I *love* Anthony Hopkins. But after about ten or fifteen minutes, I began to notice that every . . . . character . . . . took . . . . an awfully . . . . long . . . time . . . to finish . . . their . . . . sentences. . . . It was horrid, like somehow William Shatner infiltrated the rehearsal sessions and table reads, brainwashing Clair, Brad, and Anthony into reading their lines as slowly as possible, as if to accrue more screen time. The only redeeming characters were Allison and Quince (played by the talented Jeffrey Tambor,) and their story lines were not given the full attention that they should have been. If I ever earn the esteemed privilege of having one of my screenplays made into a movie, someone PLEASE kill me if it turns out anything like ""Dramatic Long Pause."" Its script was not penned by one, or two, but FOUR, count `em, FOUR individuals. All of whom seemed to be oblivious to the concept of interesting dialogue. Even in the few scenes that would be worth fast forwarding to, should you choose to rent this, the three main characters are given so many BAD lines in between their GOOD lines, it's not redeemable.",1
18 January 2011,"Meet Joe Black...........A ""whisper of a thrill""","Yes, these are the only word combination which can describe this film - ""A Whisper of a Thrill"". great movie with superb direction, excellent music( thanks to Mr. Thomas Newman, he is at his best with the score),wonderful cast and very very especially, the performance. No doubt, the combination of Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins proved again(after 'The Legend of the Fall')the best of the best combination in Hollywood.

This movie is all about emotions - Love,Life and Sacrifice - but these emotions has been presented so deeply in this film that I found the new meaning of these words. This is kind of movie which will definitely move your world of emotion and your life as it did to me.

But one thing I need to say is that this a kind of extraordinary especial film which is definitely not for everyone but only for especial one who can feel the message of this masterpiece.

Watch this film with your love ones and I bet you will thank me later.

16 September 2001,tied for worst movie I've ever seen,"Yes, this movie is the worst. The point was dragged out and beaten to death. It managed to make Anthony Hopkins look terrible. The rate of speech was... so... painfully... slow, and overdramatic.

Coolest part was Pitt getting blindsided by the van. Rewind that.

30 May 2009,Pretty Vacant (but it Sticks to the Roof of Your Mouth),"""Death Takes a Holiday"" is revised and updated for a lovingly glamorized Brad Pitt. According to the DVD sleeve's synopsis, ""Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) has it all - success, wealth, and power. Days before his 65th birthday he receives a visit from a mysterious stranger, Joe Black (Pitt), who soon reveals himself as Death. In exchange for extra time, Bill agrees to serve as Joe's earthly guide. But, will he regret his choice when Joe unexpectedly falls in love with Bill's beautiful daughter Susan (Claire Forlani)?""

The picturesque Pitt (and Mr. Hopkins) will please most aficionados; but, the movie is overindulgent. Jake Weber (as Drew), Marcia Gay Harden (as Allison), and Jeffrey Tambor (as Quince) give the production fireworks some much-needed balance, with fine second tier performances; possibly, Mr. Weber offers the film's best characterization. The scenes with Pitt confabbing with a Jamaican woman in the hospital should have been sent to deleted scenes heaven; the actress, Lois Kelly-Miller, could have played a doctor who recognized Pitt as an accident victim.

****** Meet Joe Black (11/2/98) Martin Brest ~ Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani",6
28 December 1999,Carpe Diem!,"This is a terrific movie about seizing the day or the Latin, ""carpe diem."" To enjoy life- to remember that we are all food for worms, is a universal theme. I enjoyed all the performances. Especially Hopkins, Pitt and Forlani. I rather liked Brad Pitt's totally innocent approach to everything. The love scene was especially nice, aided by the music. Instead of being the usual groping romp, this scene briefly touched upon the sanctity of sex with someone you love and how special it is. The only part of the movie that I didn't care for were the long parting scenes. They could've accomplished more with less here. All in all, a great movie about love, honor, life and death.

11 January 2020,Beautiful and terrible life at the same time.,"Good movie. An excellent cast, especially good as always Hopkins. The film shows what a beautiful and terrible life we have at the same time. The film is a little tightened and did not have enough negative emotions (too many positive personages in the movie). The film is overly romantic. After watching this movie I remembered the saying ""Death cannot be deceived, but you can make friends with it""

20 April 2019,"Claire Forlani is a serene Goddess, who captures Mr. Death","I was absolutely mesmerized by Claire Forlani. She has the most outstanding facial expressions; her eyes are absolutely hypnotic.

Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins are, as ALWAYS, fascinating. But Claire Forlani stole this movie. She reminds me so much of Audrey Hepburn that it is almost painful recognizing that Audrey is gone forever.

I can see why Star Wars fanatics would see a Star Wars trailer and leave after ""Meet Joe Black"" begins. No, it is not a movie for video game and fantasy movie fanatics with their constant scene switching and chaotic action.

Oohmygod. Anthomny Hpokins actually dances with his daughter for nearly a minute in a classic quiet ballroom dance without jumping around like a Mexican jumping bean.

Heaven forbid. Anthony Hopkins and Bradd Pitt actually enjoy watching fireworks together from the terrace for 20 seconds.

The intrique concerning Anthony Hopkins's business is, frankly, irritating because of its simplistic idiocy. Brad Pitt's ""lovemaking"" is what you would expect from Mr Death.. seriously in need of a bucketful Viagra pills.

But Claire Forlani, like a Goddess, serenely rises above all the action around her. Where is that coffee shop again?",8
22 October 2019,Ever wish you could watch a film like no other?,"This is one is it. Enchanting, mysterious, somewhat enlightening at times. Amusing, intriguing and genuinely like no other film I have ever seen, and I own well over 500 blurays and dvds. Give it a go, you won't regret it. Like American Beauty it makes you look closer, much closer, but apart from that solitary similarity - this is a film apart.

13 September 2003,Meet Joe Bland,"I guess the pitch for this movie went something like this : "" It`s a touching romantic fantasy where death in a human form comes to take the life of a millionaire but death falls in love with the millionaire`s daughter "" . This might have been a success if someone hadn`t said the following two things

1 ) "" Great . Let`s make a movie that lasts three hours ""

2 ) "" let`s cast Brad Pitt as death ""

That`s my two criticisms of this movie . How on earth could anyone working at a Hollywood studio believe that a romantic fantasy has enough legs to last 178 minutes ? I guess that`s because so much of the running time is taken up with Brad Pitt on screen doing basically nothing as the camera holds his gaze , I mean look at the number of times the camera lingers on Pitt , it`s like someone`s told Pitt to just stand there while the camaraman has nipped out to lunch . I know a lot of females in the audience can`t get enough of Brad but is this a good reason for stringing out a film to twice its natural length ? The story could been easily told in 90 minutes if someone had decided to edit out all the scenes with Pitt staring into camera for no apparent reason

Not to be totally negative MEET JOE BLACK does have a couple of good points. With the exception of Pitt , who as usual shows us he was cast entirely down to his looks rather than talent or charisma , the cast give touching understated performances , and it goes without saying Anthony Hopkins gives the best performance of the lot . Perhaps the film`s best point is Thomas Newman`s score which absolutely beautiful and you`ll be able to remember it for days afterwards . If truth be told the score belongs in a better film",4
20 November 2012,A fabulous film,"Although this is a 3 hr or so movie on waiting for death it is a lot more then that and is a real hidden gem. With the set design, performances and music really make this movie a enjoyable time. While death is a main theme of the movie its really a romance movie between death (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Claire Forlani). It ends up with there being a great chemistry between them with a very intense love scene. There are some real enjoying scenes where death takes the body of a human and slowly learns to be human having his boyish innocence. In exchange for a few extra days Brad and Anthony's character come to an agreement, a few extra days in exchange for a tour a life as a human. A funny scene was just seeing how much he enjoyed peanut butter and seemed to act like it was the greatest thing in the world. It is very easy to wake up every morning and complain about your life and how much better it could be. We can all find something wrong with our lives, it is human nature to. What are the things we can do to change the situation. How can we ensure that our life gets better? Is this really all that bad of a life? This movie asks us to realize that this life is a gift and we shouldn't take it for granted. Death is a by the book robot type of guy but by being in a human world acting like a human at the end he makes more of a human choice rather then a non human emotion. This movie should have won some academy awards it was deserving of so. This is a movie any movie lover should watch and have as part of their collection. Enjoy.",9
20 August 2006,One of Hollywood's best expressions of what there is to love about life,"Living, dying, loving. Sometimes we take it all for granted. What if you knew when you were going to die? Wouldn't that change everything? Wouldn't every minute left make a difference? Wouldn't you let the people in your life know how important they are to you? Wouldn't you tell them how much you love them?

Why wait? Watch this film and remind yourself to live and love fully. Savor every little thing life has to offer, even peanut butter!

Brad Pitt is excellent AGAIN! His incredible ability to express emotions without saying much.

Anthony Hopkins, the grand master of acting, IS Bill Parrish

31 January 2011,Death never even got warmed up.,"Did I get this right? Brad Pitt got paid $15 million for making this movie???? Well they say the bigger the scam the easier it is.

A pity, because Brad stuffed this movie up completely. He was the only one of an otherwise great cast who could not act. Loved Claire Forlani. Where has she been hiding? And Anthony Hopkins can always carry a scene with his formidable screen presence.

Interesting concept for a plot but a very, very SLOW death. If you record this and then watch at 3 times the speed you might be able to stand it. But definitely the greatest piece of miscasting I think I have seen on the screen.

Loved to have seen a real actor in the main lead. Clive Owen would have been great or some-one like George Clooney. But I guess there are lots of guys and girls that drooled over Brad.

Brad, I can only say I hope you donated most of your fee to the White ladies.",3
21 May 2003,A chronically underused Forlani shines between Pitt and Hopkins,"Meet Joe Black is one of those films, that did not exactly was the way I expected the film to be. This, I am certain had a lot to do with the nature of the trailer and the things I've heard other people say about it. Just to maker it clear: yes Meet Joe Black is something of a romantic film and yes it is probably best enjoyed (especially at certain moments) with your girlfriend, but there is much more to this film that just the romantic side. This film is also funny, enchanting (in a non-romantic way), utterly entertaining and intriguing. The credit for creating a compelling story, that never gets boring (despite the films length), certainly must be given to Martin Brest (of Beverly Hills Cop fame), but he couldn't have done it without his actors and one actress in particular. Brad Pitt (Joe Black) and Anthony Hopkins (Bill Parrish) certainly are the main focus of the story, because it the main point is an agreement they both have and the story between Bill's daughter Susan (Claire Forlani) is just' a by product of that. But I will not focus too much on the story, as most of you will probably know that Pitt plays death who has come to earth to get Parrish, whose time has come. Instead I'd like to focus on the great people in from of the screen. Now most of you / us know that Brad Pitt is a wonderful actor and I must truly say that he is able to show it here again. His portrayal of death experiencing what it is to be alive for the first time was really great and I must say that I thought he even outperformed Hopkins. This is not to say that Anthony Hopkins was bad, on the contrary he was good, but just not as top notch as Pitt. Standing there right between those two like a hill between the mountains was Claire Forlani, who was exceptionally well cast as young Susan. I think not enough credit has been given to this beautiful young lady. I think it is quite an accomplishment to stand in the middle between Hopkins and Pitt and still be able to stand tall and not be blown away by the talent and ability those two actors possess. I also think it is a pity that an actress so beautiful and talented has not been cast in bigger, more successful films in the past 5 years. What kind of films are the casting people looking for references anyway? Forlani would rule as a Bond girl, she could play an Austin Powers film, she could even do great character work in A Beautiful Mind like film if someone would let her. I admit that she's too cute for some parts, hey but there must be other roles out there for her than the one she's getting lately. I admit that she does some low budget films, but as all actors and actresses I'm certain that she'd like to be in big production every now and then like she has been in The Rock and Meet Joe Black. Therefore and because I think she's a good actress I hope that The Limit (with Jackie Chan) will do her career some good and that she'll get more credit for her work as an actress besides that Saturn Nomination for Meet Joe Black for I feel that she is CHRONICALLY UNDERUSED in good and big productions that can make her name a household one. I mean she certainly starred with some good and famous actors the past few years, but why must the productions always be so cheap and bad?

While I was going on and on (sorry to have bored you) about Claire Forlani, I mentioned a nomination for a Saturn Awards in Meet Joe Black. A few Saturn Award nominations were actually the only indications of this films quality, which makes me wonder if anyone of the academy or golden globe folks have watched this film? I for one, feel that Pitt and Forlani should at least have gotten Globe nominations and I also feel that there cloud have been an Oscar nomination for the wonderful Cinematography or the set decoration. But since this film got nothing but a few Saturn nominations, a worst remake nomination and an award for worst film I MUST BE MAD. Even if I am, I still know I liked it from beginning to end.

22 September 2021,Don't Let the Runtime Push You Away,"What a surprise. I had low expectations when I started Meet Joe Black. Perhaps it was because of the 3-hour runtime, but I was expecting a convoluted and boring mess of a film. The exact opposite was true for me. I was continually transfixed by the story and glued to the screen for the full duration. The concept of having Death learn about the subtle wonders of life was beautiful and compelling.

The script was well-written, though slightly melodramatic at times. The performances were excellent, and I finally saw the brilliance of Anthony Hopkins. He brought a quiet confidence and sense of acceptance to the role. His relationship with the other characters, especially Susan, had an emotional pull that brought me in. On top of it all, this score is one of my favorites in recent memory. Other than a few quirky moments in the first act, the music was a powerful reminder of the depth of the story.

One of my favorite elements of this film was the use of silence. The runtime allowed the audience to experience stillness usually brushed past in the average film. Nothing felt rushed, everything was calculated, and you leave remembering that nothing is as certain as death and taxes.",9

15 August 2023,Hard to let go isn't it? What can I tell you...that's life.,"The bottom line, having seen this film over a dozen times and watching it again, experiencing it for the first time. This film is so utterly moving. It has near perfect cinematography and even better lighting. Every shot has so much depth and they took such care in the composition.

The score is absolutely flawless. It informs the characters emotions and causes an inner reflection in the viewer that rivals several John Barry scores.

Claire Forlani is absolutely perfect in this role. Her eyes grab you and allow you to see such vulnerability that few performances have matched. Some of the best scenes involve supporting roles. Marcia Gay Harden is a pro and some of the most touching moments she grabs a hold of. It all comes from a very real place, and is exciting to watch.

I've read some pretty brutal reviews. I just don't think they come from a place where the person wants to sit down and watch a 3 hour love story with fantasy elements. Moreover, the reviews are so tome deaf, and reek of jealousy. You have to let yourself into these characters lives to fully appreciate it.

If Euphoria is your taste this is definitely not for you,

This is a story about a man who loved his wife, adores his daughters and has had a very successful existence. It's about being able to hold on, and have the courage and gratitude to let go.",10
9 April 2007,Torturous and unending!,"You'd think that between Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt (not to mention the inimitable Jeffrey Tambor), an at-least-decent movie would emerge, but that was regrettably not the case here. That is not to say that Hopkins and Pitt turned in bad performances; they were both what you'd expect of them: Hopkins at turns stiff and explosive, Pitt utterly chameleonic. Rather, it is the ineptitude of the writers (all FOUR of them!) and the director that fails this movie so miserably...and what is there to a movie after that? So much of this film reminded me of Peter Sellers' 'Being There,' but that movie worked with a fluid story, single-minded direction and all spot-on performances. This...well, the story is single-minded, the direction is sloppy and the performances are (at best) spotty. Even the usually excellent Pitt's character is all over the place: one moment he's naive or petulant as a 5-year-old, the next he's as omnipotent and stern as a god! Again, not his fault clearly. His performance at every turn is solid, but the turns he's given are just too much. Behind all this is a score that sounds like it's been lifted from 3 or 4 other movies. It sweeps, dips and soars often completely counter to the action on the screen. Nowhere is this more evident than in the last conversation between Hopkins and Pitt. My wife and I were convinced at any moment they were going to be pressing their faces together in a climactic kiss! But, no, it was just a chat...that went on forever. My pregnant missus was laughing so hard, she felt certain it was going to induce labour! The writers of this movie should've stuck to TV scripts. It's clearly what they do best. Too much of this story was too trite, and too much of the dialogue sounded like it was pieced together from greeting cards. The best example of this is Hopkins early speech to Forlani on the plane, regarding looking for true love. That monologue jumps from one cliché to the next, as though the writers stood in a drugstore on Valentine's Day, rifling through a rack of niceties and copying down the insides. I gave it a 4 out of the IMDb 10, and that mainly because it wasn't '""Manos"": The Hands of Fate,' and did have a pretty solid core cast. But do yourself a favour: avoid this movie. I watched it with my wife (though at my own suggestion, I'm ashamed to say), and it's truly surprising we both made it through all three hours of this dreck. Don't do the same. Go watch any of the number of other better movies either Hopkins or Pitt have done...then just put the quality together in your mind. You'll be a better person for it. I only wish we'd done the same.",4
10 July 2001,Too long...,"This movie had a promising premise and a great cast. Unfortunately it was very slow-moving and an effort to watch. Some scenes were very entertaining, but the story could have been told in almost half the time. That would have also contributed to it being a more enjoyable film.

I was disappointed by Martin Brest's first effort since Scent Of A Woman, one of my favourite films. It had none of that movie's fun, emotion or humanity. Pitt and Hopkins, as always, delivered very fine performances and Jeffrey Tambor impressively showed his serious side.

If you have the time, it's worth a look, but it's no Scent Of A Woman.

7 September 2008,"A good movie, but did it have to be 3 hours long?","I've seen this movie a couple of times on television, but only bits of pieces of it. Now after finally getting a chance to see it all the way through, and at my own pace, I have to say this is a good movie. I liked all the actors performances, each of them add diligence to their characters. Even though Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt were the leads, I felt Jeffrey Tambor and Claire Forlani did the best jobs as the comical Quince and attractive Susan.

The story maybe a little unrealistic (since it is about the Angel of Death wanting to be a human), but it has some moral lessons, such as enjoying life to the fullest, because it is too short. Thomas Newman's score sustains much of the mood and somewhat mystical feeling to the film. But the problem with this film is the length. Three hours. Sure, there's a plot going on, but does it really need 3 hours to develop? A bit too long for my taste. 7/10

24 August 1999,Joe Who?,"I honestly can't believe some of the reviews posted here. This film was one of the most placid, sterile, coldest cinematic texts I've ever seen. For a film like this you should create a heart first and build everything else around it. Instead Mr. Breast believes that by placing star credentials and production values above all else we the audience will be gullible enough to lovingly swallow his shallow love story. Not only that, we'll pay him 10 bucks for the privilege of doing so.

I'm not gonna bore anyone with the plot because there isn't one. It's just a pure waste of time. Seriously, in three hours you can manage to convey some quite profound feelings (Godfather, Shortcuts, Schindler's List) but Meet Joe Black didn't make me feel anything. It hoped to latch on to the same elements that made Titanic a smash hit (love story, length, evil fiancées, floppy hair) but least that had decent special effects to salvage its hollow characterisations. Even the car accident that provides Joe with a ticket to `our' world looks crap. Brad Pitt wasted his talents in this week affair, as did Hopkins. Both of them look as if they are quite unsure of why they are here in the first place. As for the characters that comprise of Hopkins family, well what I was just hoping for was that Joe would have a sudden change of heart and decide to kill em all for being so darn ungrateful. I really can't hack listening to rich white people complain about how horrid life is because they can't find `true love'. I don't think that you need a three-hour time frame in order to accomplish that. These are the very same things that annoyed me about Notting Hill, yet that film at least didn't take its self as seriously as this drivel.

As for all this talk about Claire Forlani, well yes she is one amazing looking bird but she sure can't sustain a leading female role by herself. All she did is look like a sulky rich girl drifting from room to room, suffering from major existential teenage angst. She was about as animate as my Granny's antique wardrobe. It's a case of great face but zero charisma.

You know what, this might have turned out into quite memorable film if ... In the end you have enough time to think about the emptiness of it all and feel like cursing yourself for having gone to see it in the first place.

It's not just that it's such a pointless film that annoys me. Rather more it is the actuality that it cost $90 million to subsidise this wet, soppy, nonsensical mess. If you have a great desire to see what a personification of Death may look like, I wouldn't waste my time watching this filth you may as well wait for the real thing! At least I bet it'll be more interesting this movie.",5
15 November 2006,Meet Joe Black,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",4

5 May 2003,The longest three hours you will ever endure.,"It is totally beyond my comprehension that an experienced director could imagine that the subject matter of Meet Joe Black would justify a three hour running time. There are indeed some movies that can pull this off, such as the Lord of the Rings films, or Gladiator (which is two and a half hours), however these do it by employing strong plot elements, exciting action sequences and quality character development. They do not do it by sticking a bunch of big-name actors together on screen, with no clear idea of how their characters are supposed to behave, no sense of purpose throughout the movie, and a script that consists largely of people staring at each other and saying nothing for a long time -- but this is exactly what Meet Joe Black attempts to get away with. The character development is virtually non-existent, with Joe Black (Brad Pitt) undergoing more personality changes than you can count; the plot itself is melodramatic to the point of farce (including an excruciatingly embarrassing scene where Brad Pitt puts on a poor Jamaican accent to talk to a dying old lady), and the music so tedious that you will be wanting to scream by the time the credits roll. Unfortunately it seems that Meet Joe Black is victim of the ""lovey-dovey"" film culture of Hollywood, whereby innocent lonely hearts can be duped into thinking a film is touching simply because it purports to contain romantic elements. Don't fall for it.",2
28 July 1999,Boring,"The most boring film I've seen in years. Even the nice ending couldn't save it. Brad Pitt lights up the screen for 10 minutes, then he takes on the world's most boring and silly persona. Waste of time.

4 November 2012,"A touchy feelie ""Death"" explores earth","Hollywood periodically decides to take ultimate superhuman spirit concepts such as God/The Devil/Death/Angels/etc personifies them and enters them into some little human dramas. In this iteration Death is a human form god; the human drama includes a dying billionaire some hostile politics in a company board room, the IRS (did the writers intend some humor? death/taxes) and of course the central boy meets girl romance.

Using Death as a Pluto like God is bit odd especially in a non horror movie.

In this high dollar rendition ($90 million),Death takes over the dead body of Brad Pitt and makes a Faust like deal with Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins a billionaire with heart problems can live a few more days until a birthday party his daughters are giving him--if he acts as guide to show death around earth. How imbecilic and trite is it possible to get? Death is one of those poor somehow shackled superhuman spirits who doesn't know what life on earth is like.. Basically a pack of idiotic garbage on every level. Death predictably falls in love with Hopkin's daughter and wants to take her with him a la Prosperpine.

OK, fine how is this plot carried off as a film? Well apparently if Brad Pitt looks cow eyed and says nothing for long periods that is what Death/Pluto would do. Grand epic serious music indicates (how else can you say it?) life and death themes are in play. But the scenes are too long and nothing unpredictable happens. We know everything that is going to happen so there is no suspense. This movie is a long boring trite drag.

The use of a touchie feelie Death spirit and the utterly mundane conventional human side of the story--it is all really an insult to your intelligence. I also really hate movies that put a sign every 10 seconds on how you are supposed to think and feel.

By the way this movie grossed $140 million and cost $90 million. What do I know about making money with movies?

DO NOT RECOMMEND.",1
13 January 2007,Borrowed Body,"What happened to Martin Brest? This is a director who knew how to channel excessive actors and extract something palatable from them.

Here he takes on an opposite challenge: what to do with subtlety and understatement? Brest is completely lost.

This stuff is so thin, we get nothing more from Pitt than his borrowings from his own character repertoire, particularly his bad-boy-with-a-heart-of-gold from ""Thelma and Louise"". Hopkins plays it more or less as his ""Bounty"" captain/tyrant persona.

And the premise is somewhere between ""Being There"" and ""The Seventh Seal"". Brest has no idea of how to tap into Bergman's angst, so he attempts some Kubrickian inertia. No dice there either. The lakeside party is filmed in the manner of ""The Godfather II"".

I suppose this makes fine chick-flick grist, what with all the facial close-ups on Pitt during the love scene. But this does nothing for me; no irony, no narrative games, just parts of better predecessors on loan.",4
24 June 2002,It still makes me squirm,"And not in a good way, readers. For all those who think this film is insightful, deep, and philisophical, you've been exposed to too little actual depth and philosophy.

There were holes in the script. Brad Pitt is a decent actor, but this movie had him acting like half robot, half mentally deficient. The movie takes itself way too seriously and is way too long.

I would give it a 5 out of 10, maybe a 6 on a good day.

It's two and a half hours long, and it does get a little dull, but Brad Pitt is so beautiful that it's bearable.

16 April 2022,Clare Forlani is intensely irritating in this film!,"It's quite a nice idea. However, any enjoyment is undermined by the intensely irritating and contrived acting of Clare Forlani. She does this pretentious posturing with her eyes. It is very noticeable and feels like a 'technique'. Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins' performances are so beautifully subtle and multifaceted but unfortunately show her acting to be rather 2 dimensional, sickly sweet and cliched. I do quite like the idea of this film and do rewatch it every few years but I forget how intensely annoying her performance is each time I watch it! It's not a bad story and there is some wonderful acting, but it is not balanced.

2 October 2015,The dim reaper gets his coat,"A memorable, poignant film with a good script and unusual twist on an old premise. Anthony Hopkins holds the fort throughout as the warm hearted, wise father and Brad Pitt plays the emotional virgin type in which he was cast at the beginning of his career.

My only real complaint is that this film is far too long. In particular toward the end, with its long, lingering close-ups which are totally unnecessary. I found my attention wandering in a ""Yeah, alright, we GET it"" kind of way. It was almost as thought the director really wanted his money's worth of two good-looking actors. Half an hour could easily have been trimmed off the end which would've seen us all off to bed earlier and with greater satisfaction.

Still, it has everything you ever wanted to know about love but were afraid to ask.

10 March 2000,...death takes another holiday...,"Enjoyable but long movie with a competent cast led by Hopkins & Pitt. Despite the retelling I found the chemistry between Forlani & Brad Pitt did work. I was also impressed by a marked improvement in his acting abilities. Theres hope for the man yet. Without giving too much away this premise of the spectre of death coming to earth in human form and mixing with us mortals is an intriguing one. What if he liked the place, found a nice woman or man and decided not to return home. The thought of living an over extended life is not an unpleasant one but the question arises of the millions of sick & suffering who would welcome a quick relief to their discomfort and pain. Oh well just a thought that niggled at me afterwards. The supporting cast here give very commendable performances. Marcia Harden as the 2nd favourite daughter and Jeffery Tambor as her effusive,bumbling yet loving husband. I rated this film 7/10. A great romantic tale but a tad too long.

26 July 2021,I cut the 2 points because of the ridiculous ending...,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",8

24 October 1999,An otherwise average movie spoiled by the last ten minutes.,"Had it not been for the last 10 minutes, this might have simply been an average, if ovelong, movie. It's one of those endings that appears to have been written by a market focus group rather than an author with a story to tell. The direction seemed insipid at times. As one dimension to a larger story, the sap oozing from this film might have had a purpose. But I had a real tough time digesting three hours of people trying to look emotionally pained, enigmatic and thoughtful, especially when the payoff fizzled.

22 October 2000,Very good film,"I thought this was one of the best films I've seen in a while. A very unusual story which was well thought out and played to perfection. The performances, with the exception of a stiff Brad Pitt, were done to excellence. The settings were nice, especially that poolroom overlooking the city; everything was just luscious. The ending worked out satisfactorily, also. 4 stars.

29 April 2001,How long does a dream last?,"Martin Brest has delivered a spacious movie, in which he rightly allows plenty of time for his actors to register very complex emotions, which they do most admirably. The moment when Claire Forlani realizes just who Joe Black really is is moving and memorable. Brad Pitt beautifully conveys the difference between the two characters who inhabit his body; and Anthony Hopkins delivers a tour de force from beginning to end. I know it's a hard thing to do in these frenetic times, but try letting go of reality and day-to-day mundanity when you watch this and other movies. Go with the characters; let the director take you on a journey. When the whole story is a fantasy, don't nit-pick about ""inconsistencies."" So the situation is preposterous; sometimes preposterous things happen to people and they discover new ways to respond to those experiences. A dream is as real to our brain as waking reality.

28 December 1999,Worst film ever,"After 20 years of moviegoing, I finally found it - the really really bad movie, the worst I ever have seen. The story was good for 45 minutes - not for three extremely boring hours which ironically made the theater collect an additional charge for over-length. And that was what I got: over-length. Much of over-length for a few Deutschmarks, in that sense it was a good deal.

The story of Death coming to Earth as a person bears many possibilities - none of them was used. There are many long scenes with dialogues like ""who are you"" ""I'm Joe Black"" ""but who are you?"" taking five minutes' time. Sometimes even nothing was spoken, and the poor actors had to grimace endlessly to make it through the scenes. You see beautiful people in beautiful locations - but that does not make a movie! With 30 frames per second, you *are* allowed to move!

I never leave a movie after half the time, but this time I almost did, if not for my friends with whom I watched this thing. Finally, we just thought ""F*** her, and let us go!"". And what the heck were the scenes with the black woman in the wheelchair speaking a strange language (in the German version, it sounded like Dutch) *without subtitles* ??? For ten minutes, I didn't understand a word, and nobody helped!

This was bad. Worse than anything else. Even after bad movies I usually think, ok, I've seen it, I can talk about it. But this time I regret wasting 16 Deutschmarks and three hours.",1
10 September 2006,Wonderful but just too long,"It's great that Hollywood can make something like this, and it shows that only a film can convey this important message..TV just gets mawkish. but it really is too long, and too much stuff about the Hopkins' character's business...you could cut almost an hour off and it would be a better film without losing any of the message...I've just been told my comment is not long enough..it must have at least 10 lines of text...erm so yes I thought the younger daughter was very pretty and she had a nice luminescent back..and great cheekbones and lovely blue eyes...and this was probably the reason she was cast....................................................I think that's ten lines.....

27 April 2010,"A lovely remake of ""Death Takes A Holiday""","This movie is a remake of a classic '40's movie called ""Death Takes A Holiday"", and while remakes can be chancy, this one is sweet and fun to watch. My only quibble is that the movie is a bit long, but all the scenes are woven together so that the length of the movie (3 hours) pass by seamlessly. Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt, especially, are wonderful together and it is very interesting to see the youthful Pitt be in the 'power' position with the far-more-established, older (and always superb) Anthony Hopkins. Pitt's portrayal of Death incarnate is delightful as he attempts to navigate the world of the living; his often naive but utterly honest character is delightful to watch and Hopkins carries off his role of guide to Pitt with his typical panache and elegance. The supporting cast of Claire Forlani, Marcia Gay Harden, Jeffrey Tambor and Jake Weber are all superb and perfectly cast in their roles. I would be remiss without mentioning the musical score by Thomas Newman. It is gorgeous, sumptuous and stunning in places.

In fact, the final scene (which I won't ruin here!) is made so much more poignant with the gorgeous music of the soundtrack adding to the emotion of the moment that the music is, as is often the case in movies, like another member of the cast. If you are a fan of any of these actors or just enjoy movies with a pleasant and/or slightly supernatural plot, this movie will not disappoint you. There is a touch of comedy, a lot of pathos and an offbeat love story all mixed into one, and if you can watch the last ten minutes of this movie without feeling moved to tears I would encourage you to check your pulse because, music included, it is a stunningly beautiful ending. Take a chance and get to know Mr Black..he and the Parrish family are worth it!",8
18 May 2021,Is okay,"I was watching the movie, then all of a sudden I saw the girl fall in love with death character, I was scratching my head, which part of his ""colorful"" personality did she fell head over heels for? The guy was barely saying a word.

Unless pure physical attraction is love, then ok.

The main characters were boring, some secondary ones I found more interesting. Overall I guess a person can watch the movie once by taking some patience pills, I've seen worst movies for sure.

14 May 1999,"Death is the pace, shallow is the aim.","I really had hopes for this movie, as I think film above many arts can portray best life, death, the afterlife and things of similar magnitude. But this film was, despite the subject matter, incredibly shallow. ""Love"" in this film was no more than one meeting, two kisses, and a long Brad Pitt sex scene. ""Family"" was full of the touching smiles which you expect, but also functionality and trite pre-death resolutions which the viewer was expected to swallow with no satire. This work simply scratched all of its surfaces, never letting Hopkins explore the true consequences of his life, and never letting Pitt explore real life, save all of that peanut butter he got to taste. In short, sadly wasted potential.

11 March 2000,One of the most romantic and sentimental movies ever..,"Meet Joe Black is a very original movie. Sure there are movies who resemble the sort of situation (City of Angels, Sixth Sense). But the acting in Meet Joe Black surpasses every one of them, for as far as I'm concerned.

The story might be a little unbelievable, but that's ok. The storyline isn't really what counts here. It's the excellent dialogues between Pitt, Hopkins and Claire Forlani (what a discovery !!) that make this movie worthwhile.

The whole film is set on a very emotional edge. You feel you could cry any moment. Pitt is so magnificent as the shy and inverted Joe Black. Forlani is a sight for sore eyes, and Hopkins, what can I say ... nothing but good things. Great things.

I've heard that many people found Meet Joe Black a bad movie, that it was too boring, or too long. Well in my opinion that's so untrue. The 3 hours are very worthwhile, you must not be put down by the long dialogues, or by the romantic, dramatic undertone.

Meet Joe Black is also one of the few movies that I actually cried at the end. Really cried. The ending is so beautifull, so amazing.

I recommend this movie very highly. It's in my top 10 of all time, but beware, this movie is not to the likings of everybody, only to those who truly appreciate great filmmaking.",
15 December 2004,From The Director Who Brought You Gigli,"An acquaintance recently insisted that I watch Meet Joe Black, his favorite movie and one that he was sure would change my life. I remembered it as being a critically reviled movie that prompted one of two responses  it's so bad it's good, or it's so bad it'sjust bad.

Meet Joe Black is quite possibly one of the worst movies that I've ever had to endure. The script, or the mess that resulted from reassembling the shredded remains of a dozen rewrites, was so bad as to be funny. On several occasions, my wife and I laughed out loud at the mock sincerity and vapid attempts at 'meaning' and 'depth'. The entire thing sounds like the laughable doom laden poetry of a maudlin teenager. The actors, left with nothing of any substance to work with, and operating under a director who clearly has intellectual aspirations far above his capabilities, struggle to create characters that amount to anything more than shameless pouting and vacant stares into the middle distance.

Buried beneath the portentous dialogue, the awkward performances, the dull production design and wildly inconsistent storyline, there IS a kernel of a decent story. Had we been able to focus on Joe Black and follow his own emotional journey as he weaves between the variously dysfunctional members of the Parrish family, playing with the irony of death healing these people's wounds, something of value may have resulted, but alas, it's not to be. Even my wife, a hardcore fan of every romance put to screen, found the whole thing to swing wildly from embarrassment to tedium.

The blame for this entire mess can only be laid at the feet of Martin Brest, a director of very little evident talent who created a reasonably enjoyable buddy cop movie 20 years ago and has been riding on the wake of it's success ever since. He should stop deluding himself, his actors and audiences, that he is capable of subtlety or intelligence. Hopefully, Gigli will be the death of him.

As for a rating, let's give it a 3 out of 10, out of respect for capable actors put in an impossible situation.",3
25 February 2023,Beautiful,"It's just so beautiful the emotions and feelings are portrayed so well. The beauty of life is the chore heart of this movie, How knowing death changes our perspective of life. Meet Joe Black is a wonderful mixture of comedy, romance and drama and is done exceedingly wellThe ending of ""Meet Joe Black"" is a meditation not only on the beauty of life and the exuberance of passion but also of learning when to let go, to sacrifice our happiness for the hope of someone else's. It's an act of true love that makes the film's ending bittersweet but still oddly hopeful.

The Chemistry between Brad Pitt and Claire forlani is one of the best on screen chemistry I've ever seen, it was completely fire we could tell everything by their eyes.

7 February 2006,A Re-make of An Old Movie,"Greatly enjoyed this version of the story and of course the great beauty of Claire Forlani,(Susan Parrish),""The Limit"",'03. Susan Parrish is the daughter of a very famous business man, Anthony Hopkins,(William Parrish), and is his favorite daughter, who he is very protective of and does not approve of her present boyfriend. Susan meets Brad Pitt,(Joe Black) in a coffee shop and all at once they both seem to be very much attracted to each other, almost like Love At First Sight. It is not long after this encounter with each other that they become face to face in Bill Parrish's large home and are having dinner together, however, Joe Black seems to be a different person. This film deals with Life & Death situations which we all will face some time or other. Entertaining film and very SAD !

3 November 2017,A disrespectful ridiculement of death and sorrow.,"A ridiculous movie in all aspects. If this movie should have worked, it would probably needed someone like Kurosawa to pull it off. A more dreamlike, bizarre setting. The Angel of Death, taking people's lives personally, doubting his own role and falling in love with a beautiful woman? Has he not seen beautiful women yet? A ridiculous question, about a scaring subject matter. This movie had to have been more dreamlike, absurd, to work at any level. Then it could have been a serious tale about loss and loss of life... But it becomes like a bad comedy instead. Do not waste your time on this.

11 March 2017,"Charming and beautiful, but too long for this kind of movie.","In this film, Death takes the body of a person to be able to approach William Parrish, a media mogul to whom she asks for information about human life. Speaking in these terms, it looks like an old tale brought to this day. However, although the idea is good and the film has truly beautiful moments, its far from perfect. The film is quite elegant and has a beautiful cinematography, full of warm colors and little contrast, as if everything developed in a late afternoon or next to a fireplace. The actors are veterans that we like to see working, the environments, sets and costumes are exquisite... its good, the film has quality! Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins make a good pair when they split the screen, being able to get the best of each other, as well as being both icons of male charm, each on its own way. Claire Forlani also made a good, very restrained but strong performance, although the romance with Pitt's character is as cold and impersonal as his character. I said the movie was not perfect, remember? Beginning with the actors, Pitt made several mistakes and did certain things he shouldn't. His character is always lacking in human warmth and, if Death really wanted to learn more about humanity, this was something that should have gradually emerged in this character, especially when he falls in love. Love is the most intense and transformative human feeling and this is never suggested to us... I don't know if Pitt accepts without criticism everything directors and writers say he has to do, but it's his duty not to let his character fall, so he should have had the perception of the mistake that would be to keep such coldness from a certain point. But there are more problems: the script has an excellent main plot but is too dense and there are too many subplots, and that only helps to get the film out of focus. The director, Martin Brest, did a good job filming but clearly didn't give great relevance to pre and post production. He should have scrutinized the script better, eliminating some things, as well as requiring the editing team to cut out what was left over. And there's plenty of leftovers in a super slow movie, which drags on for three hours without any need, with overly long or ancillary scenes. It's a beautiful movie, but it's tedious to watch because we just lost the patience needed to watch something so long and so empty.",6
5 September 2006,Why very little middle ground?,"Having been lurking on this site for quite a while, some fellow writers have arrived at the conclusion that some movies apparently have their creative team or fan club jump on the site to deluge it with high praise. I typically dismissed such claims, but with a movie like this, I have to wonder. Seriously, 10 out of 10 stars? Casablanca material here? Citizen Kane?

I agree with some of the readers here that the first part of the movie has energy and engaging dialog and I kept thinking, what happened as the movie progressed? Hmm, let's see the problems I have with it.

Claire Forlani--It took me a while to figure out what it is about her that bothers me...it's as if she is trying to prevent her lower eyelids from coming up and closing her eyes. Like she is constantly battling it. Then at other times, she just closes her eyes while she talks. Is she on Demerol? Watch her next time and you will not be able to stop thinking about it.

Brad Pitt--First, his character at the beginning is interesting. As Death, he is not. I could care less if he wants to experience being human. I don't exactly feel compassion for him. He falls in love, then he is a smart azz to Hopkins when Hopkins objects to him using his daughter as a test lab for his feelings.

Anthony Hopkins--His performance was, as typical, very good. It's as if the movie starts MOVING again when he comes on screen. However, I have problems with his character. Why, when he got upset at Death fooling around with his daughter, and objected about it, and Death basically said ""Too bad"", did he say, ""What are you going to do, kill me?"" Everyone was waiting for him to say that. Also, as to show the screenwriters dearth of ideas, they don't give us anything interesting to chew on. If you were Hopkins, wouldn't you be asking ""Where do we go when you take me""? What's it like? Where did you come from? What can you really see? His character doesn't ask these questions because the screenwriters aren't creative enough to come up with anything.

Length--Lots have been said about the films length. Perhaps some people can become more engrossed than others. But man does this film go on. There are whole scenes that don't need to be there, then they ramble. The last scene even drags on and on...walk over the damn bridge already!

What's good about the film:

1) Central idea 2) Supporting actors like Tambor 3) Cinematography and overall ""look"" 4) Anthony Hopkins

So, overall a fair package. I can enjoy a moving, romantic or sentimental film. But long passages of nothing happening, with piano music draped over it, does not make the scenes for me automatically moving, or profound, or even interesting.

One of the other writers I read wrote that he left the theater a number of times and came back. This is one of those few films that you can do that with, because very little actually does happen during the course of the film.

10 stars? Geez.",4
4 June 2004,Seemed kinda like a would-be-Heinlein book to me,"I suppose the usual critic for MJB is its length. Granted, when I did chose this movie to start the evening with I did not know that there would be so little left after the movie. THREE HOURS ... puh, well, a Harry Potter would have needed that amount of time, but for MJB it was way to much time and gave it a ""slow"" feeling.

But it wasn't entirely bad. Although the story is not new (personally, I like the Death in Sandman by Neil Gaiman much better, and she is only mortal for a day every hundred years) the setting was quite nice. A media mogul with an accomplished life as a guide for death? Why not. The whole setting reminded me of the books of Robert A. Heinlein, where an old but wise man is often the guide for a younger and inexperienced person, hmmm, like a mixture of ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" and ""I Will Fear No Evil"". Regarding the need for guidance ... maybe death does not know what it is to live, but with the knowledge he has about other areas a normal dinner should be no problem for him - but perhaps it's the difference between seeing it done and experiencing it first hand.

All in all the movie was a slow, nice distraction with a Brad Pitt for the female audience and a very attractive Claire Forlani for the male. There are better movies about death, like ""My Life Without Me"" for example and much better comics, like the mentioned Sandman-Comics by Neil Gaiman (""Death: The High Cost of Living"" for example or the Chapter ""The Sound of Her Wings"" in a Sandman-Edition). Both are way superior to this movie (sorry, Forlani).

But it was o.k. for a slow evening (and the beginning of the night).

12 October 2019,One of the longest romantic fantasies I have ever watched. Not a bad film,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",6
7 April 2002,Love it or hate it,"I think this film is magnificent and very unfairly criticized. It is fantasy at its best, is beautifully filmed, well written and well acted. Anthony Hopkins, in particular, is fantastic. And above all, when it comes to love, ""lightning should strike"" and we shouldn't settle.

Some people (OK, most people) say this film is too long, and that is their biggest problem with it. I think that's one of the films more prevalent attributes, so that's where I'll start. Either you're into a film or you're not. If you're not into it, even a 90 minute film can seem like an eternity if there's no ""action"". Camille, A.I., Me Myself and Irene and any James Bond movie fit that bill for me. Therefore, this is one of those films where I won't argue with someone who doesn't like it. It's impossible to like a film that can't sustain your interest. Usually, unless it's just an obviously bad movie, the blame for this lies with the viewer. However, I can concede that this film is not for all tastes and let the naysayers off the hook.

I don't think the film is slow at all, I just think that Martin Brest took his time in allowing the story to unfold and the characters to develop. Joe Black is very much a character study. Most character studies only involve one person. This one has two main characters and three or four more lesser characters who are all studied to one degree or another. Cutting this film down to two hours would mean losing a lot of the insight we get into these characters. No scene is rushed in this film. All are allowed to develop at their own pace and continue on until they've said what they have to say. It's a marvel, and an tribute to the film that the studio allowed it to be released at this length. The decision makers must have had similar thoughts, or they would have chopped an hour off it. After all, the far inferior original, Death Takes A Holiday, was less than 90 minutes, I believe.

The cinematography for this film is absolutely beautiful. It's not real hard to believe that the movie had such a large budget when you stop to notice how magnificent the settings are.

Thoughts on the cast...Anthony Hopkins lends dignity and credibility to every film he's in. His character represents another moral of this film, I think, that we should do as much in this life as possible before it's gone. He, particularly, is the master of ""keep filming until I'm done talking"" in this film. He's a careful man, and he chooses his words carefully. He is not one to be rushed. Neither is Death. Brad Pitt certainly isn't the best thing about this film, but he doesn't hurt it any. His take on the character is at least a fresh and interesting one. And often funny. Marcia Gay Harden is effective as the lesser loved daughter. The first time I saw this film, I thought for sure Jeffrey Tambor would be a villain, as he always seems to be. I was pleased to see him in a role as a weak, but essentially good man. Claire Forlani is really what makes the wheels of this film turn, though. After all, what is the premise of this film? Death falls in love with a mortal woman. How long has this guy been around? How many women has he come across? In other words, the girl better be pretty great. One of the many weaknesses of Death Takes A Holiday is the girl that Death falls for, Evelyn Venable, is pretty weak. I won't pretend Forlani is a modern day Katherine Hepburn, but she is incredibly beautiful and, in addition to portraying her character well, has a presence about her that Venable lacked. She's believable as someone Death would fall for. I guess. How the hell do I know?

This film is a big throwback to the classic era. I won't say it's Capraesque, since it digs a lot deeper into the characters than any of Frank's films, but the idealistic hero in an unrealistic situation is very reminiscent of Capra's films.

Here's a thought that I can't really fit into any other paragraph, so I'll give it it's own. Although the propensity of films to include an obligatory sex scene seems to have dwindled off in the last decade from it's ridiculous plateau in the 70's, I still tend to get annoyed by them in today's films. Come on, it's the 21st century. We know they're having sex, we don't need to see it for five minutes. Every director seems to think he'll be the one to make his sex scene better than the others, or show us something we haven't seen hundreds of times already. Almost always, they are wrong and the sex scene is tedious. This film's scene is an exception. First, it is different because we're talking about Death here. But besides that, Brest films the scene just like he films the rest of the film. Beautifully and slowly. Most importantly, he concentrates the camera on facial expression, not naked bodies.

The ending is sappy and pours it on. But I love it. Go ahead and call me soft. I love the fireworks. I love the endless rendition of ""What a Wonderful World"". And I love the happy ending.

Typically, I think remakes and new takes of/on old films are inferior to the originals. But this is the exception. Meet Joe Black takes the far inferior Death Takes A Holiday much deeper. Death Takes A Holiday portrays Death falling in love at first sight, and the whole film only lasts one night. Fredric March is a great actor, but was extremely robotic in that role. To do a story like this, the Death character needs to have a personality. One of the many reasons this version is superior.",9
13 January 2006,"Terrible, awful, ack","It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",1
20 June 2021,"Meaningless, plotless, overlong.","Sat through all 3hours waiting for something to happen. Nothing did! Endless scenes of meaningless conversations which contributed nothing to the (non-existent) storyline.

14 September 2022,An epic love story!,"At the crux of it all, what Meet Joe Black is, is a love story, be it for Anthony Hopkins' character Bill's love for his late wife, his family, his life, his life's work or Joe Black and Susan's romance. What works is this beautiful story told from the perspective of the main characters, the kind of romance that makes you go ""weak in the knees"", as taken from the movie itself.

Words would never suffice when talking about the talented Sir Anthony Hopkins. He has always been captivating in any role he has played, be it the doddering but lovable old man in ""The world's fastest Indian', his chilling portrayal as Hannibal and as the vengeful husband in 'Fracture'. Continuing his exemplary work, he essays a role here that takes him through different motions in a very short period of time, from a very successful professional caught up in his work, whose entire life changes as he is paid a visit by none other than 'Death' himself. Suffice it to say he was brilliant as ever!

I have always liked Brad Pitt in the many roles he has essayed over the years. Now he is no Leo Di Caprio when it comes to acting (who I feel acts his heart out almost every time), but I have always felt Pitt does a reasonably good job of acting for the roles he has played. What he doesn't seem to bring with his acting chops, he more than makes up for it with his screen presence. And man, he does it in spades here!

The revelation was Claire Forlani for me. I have only seen a few other titles she has been in and do not actually remember much of her other body of work. But I will carry this movie and Claire's performance forever in my heart! To sum it up in colloquial terminology, 'Find yourself someone that looks at you the way Susan looks at Joe Black'! :D

Not a great lover of the romance genre, but I found myself deeply moved by the story and the performances, undeterred by the 3 hour run time, which did seem daunting at the beginning, but once the movie got going, I was hardly bothered by the length of the movie, captivated as I was by the story and the brilliant actors.

A perfect 10 from me! :)",10

14 June 1999,Sore butt award,"This film was an enigma. I applaud any director willing to make a movie with long, meandering scenes that explore characters more deeply than the average skin-deep Hollywood flick. At the same time, long and meandering coupled with boring is a bit too much to stomach. There has to be some reasonable, believable motivation, and none of these characters had it (except for the money-loving Drew). The spiritual connection between Pitt's Death and the other characters never went beyond his being courteous and properly enunciating their first names. Claire Forlani is a wonderful girl to look at, but I hate being confronted with those ""only in Hollywood is she a [doctor rocket scientist primate researcher]"" characters.

I like watching people muse about life and death, and it's great to see writers tackling interesting approaches to the subject. Some people will undoubtedly connect to this film. I didn't. This gets the sore-butt award of the week.

6 January 2000,a wonderful reminder of the gifts of life.,"I watched this film at home, on TV, after i heard from all my friends of how it was too long and boring. i disagree with them all. Meet Joe Black is a celebration of the wonderful gifts life has to offer. sounds corny? not so at all.

Anthony Hopkins is great as William Parrish, a very successful businessman, who is nearing the end of his life. he is visited by Death, in the form of a very charming Brad Pitt, who tells him he has a few days to ""show him around"" the real world. soon Bill realizes all the things in his life that he took for granted. especially the love of his daughters, Susan and Allison.

On the other hand, Susan (Claire Forlani in a worthy breakthrough) falls for Death, known to them all as Joe Black. as Joe experiences love for the first time with Susan, this upsets Bill and the three main characters all journey through epiphanies of love and life that will change them forever.

The film may drag on at times but it is beautifully shot, and filled with some unforgettably touching scenes of dialogue between all the characters. and with one of the most haunting love themes in recent films Thomas Newman confirms himself as one of the best film score composers of the 90s. i suggest this film for anyone who wants to set aside 3 hours to explore the importance of life, love, and family.",
2 February 2005,"This could have been either very gloomy or sweeter than sugar, but it all went well.","I guess this is the kind of movie about which only two opinions seem to exist: people love it or hate it. Apparently there isn't a way in between the two. Knowing that this movie is about death and that Brad Pitt is playing in it is already enough for many people to dislike it. Personally I don't have any problems with the subject, nor with the actors playing in it. I thought that Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins were a very good match. Everything they did was convincing, not too sweet and interesting to watch, what more can you expect?

Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) has everything he can dream of. He's a rich media tycoon, he has a loving family and he is about to celebrate his 65th birthday. But than Joe Black (Brad Pitt) appears into his life. Joe isn't just an ordinary young man. He's Death who has taken over the body of a young man, so he could pay Bill Parrish a visit. But instead of killing him immediately, he enters into an unusual gentleman's agreement with Parrish. He'll let him live a bit longer if Parrish shows him around on a tour of life and doesn't reveal Joe's secret identity. When Joe meets Bill's daughter Susan (Claire Forlani), they fall in love. Now Joe, being in love for the first time, threatens to change the rules and Bill Parrish will have to do everything he can to protect the ones he loves.

This movie could easily have become very dark and gloomy or sweeter as sugar, but somehow the creators have been able to keep it all well-balanced. I'm sure that even people who are a bit afraid of the subject will be pleasantly surprised by it. Only those who have always hated Brad Pitt probably shouldn't watch this film, because he is his usual self in this one. Personally I don't have any problems with him and I loved to watch this movie. That's why I give it an 8/10.",8
1 February 2003,Star rating: 1 out of 5,"Meet Joe Black tries very hard to be a Significant Movie, but fails miserably. It certainly has many of the constituent parts of a classic film including a three-hour running time, a respected senior actor teamed with Hollywood heartthrobs, and an orchestral score. Unfortunately the music is also intrusive and overly sentimental, the film is at least an hour too long, and Claire Forlani irritatingly spends most of it in tears (although Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins are adequate in their roles).

Hopkins plays Bill Parrish, a media mogul squillionaire whom everybody loves. We are expected to believe this without question, despite the fact that he is irritable, insensitive and patronisingly patriarchal towards his daughters. The hands of fate have decreed that it is Bill's time to die, but over the millennia Death has become curious about the ways of people and offers Bill a bargain. In return for a guided tour of the thing we know as life, Bill will be allowed to continue living for an unspecified length of time. Of course Bill has a beautiful daughter (so Death can fall in love), a Machiavellian business partner (so Death can prove that he is really a good guy), and assorted family crises which provide the fodder for seemingly endless poignant glances.

Perhaps the only thing that the film gets right is the sensual undressing sequence, with Pitt and Forlani proving that incredibly slow is also incredibly sexy. That however, is the one bright point in a movie that waffles along towards its drawn out and saccharine conclusion. And as far as conclusions go, it's pretty lame. Don't watch this - you've got better things to do with your life.",2

Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

30 August 2020,Thankfully the TV version was shorter,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

2 March 2006,Powerful and profound,"Sir Anthony Hopkins AND Brad Pitt! Death takes a Holiday. not original but well worth a remake with these two formidable adversaries, that is lead actors. Wish the director didn't take himself so seriously, there could have been a lot more nuance in handling these two lead characters without all the takes. Why does every film have to fit a genre? ""Legends of the Fall"" indisputably on my all time top ten list notwithstanding, I would love to see these two really given the reigns to see where they want to go.

The rest of the luxurious cast and sets are well worth watching in themselves. Do people really spend that much making movies anymore?! Since I only rent DVD's and haven't seen the inside of a movie theater in decades, production costs must factor in my selections. Directors should never be one of the lead ""players"" unless they're Clint Eastwood.

4 May 2002,Beautiful film in spite of itself,"I have seen both the original 1934 film of Death Takes a Holiday, the 1971 TV-movie version, as well as the play on stage numerous times. I agree that in many ways, this film is superior, though mostly because of the very dated acting styles in the original. Also, Claire Forlani turns in a luminous performance, as does Anthony Hopkins (as always).

There are two elements from the original play which I miss in this remake. One is that the premise of the story is that Death appears in human form in order to find out why humans cling so desperately to life. The other is that nothing on earth dies while he is on 'holiday.' I realize these concepts don't fit well with the 'Hollywood-ized' happy ending, but I do feel they're at the core of the story. In all the stage versions and both earlier filmed versions, I found the premise of the girl (originally Grazia, then Peggy) being one who constantly defies--and seeks--death, who then goes with him, a very romantic ending. It always felt as if she became immortal.

Oddly, in all film versions, the role of Death has been miscast. Brad Pitt is quite wooden, March silent-movie stiff, Markham a little too ingratiating. Onstage, this role is usually cast with a true romantic leading man: handsome, suave, sensual. This does help make the whole story work. The original play's premise is that death arrives to take Grazia as she crashes her car, then he finds he can't because of her beauty and vitality. I find this a much more solid and believable foundation for the story than the convoluted meeting between a guy and Susan in a coffee shop, and then at a dinner table. Originally, SHE is the reason for it all--why he takes human form, why he takes a holiday, why he seeks the answer to his question.

By opening up the film as Hollywood will do, all the stuff about Hopkins's business is extraneous and the idea of Joe attending at board meetings (and the IRS resolution) rather preposterous. The original confined the story to a remote country house, the 1971 one confines the now Kennedy-like family to a private island. Meet Joe Black did the opposite and brought in the whole world and is the worse for it.

Yet MJB does work, in spite of itself. Perhaps because the idea of seeing death in person and trying to figure out how he thinks is quite compelling. Despite his stature, Hopkins is not the center of the film, nor should he be. Forlani is, and it is she who makes her scenes with Pitt work. I was prepared to hate this film because I've loved the original story since I first saw it in about 1954, yet I find the film compelling and enchanting.",2
3 January 2004,Trash!,"I accidentally saw this movie yesterday. I gave it a chance since I had nothing else important to do. I guess you have to be American or at least heavily americanized to be able to like this piece of trash. It was sad to see a good actor like Hopkins prostitute himself like that, but, oh well, even good people make mistakes every now and then. The movie is hollow, like air wrapped inside a seemingly beautiful present. It's like sugar on top of cream on top of honey on top of candy on top of chocolate... Only hollow people will think the film is deep. Well, here's the catch: It isn't!!!

14 January 2020,Worst love story before Gigli happened,"My two star rating is largely for the production values and a star cast that includes luminaries Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt. The highly implausible, largely senseless story and plot get a zero unless you're a tween girl who cares for nothing other than seeing a wooden/stoic Brad smooching his leading lady (unknown Claire Forlani), which must be why this film gets scores in the 8/9/10 range. Yes, it's a fantasy that involves death personified but granting you that as an element of the story is fine. It's the presentation and execution of this character that shows a level of immaturity and implausibility not typically associated with director Martin Brest, but then again this is the guy that went on to direct Ben Affleck and J-Lo in ""Gigli"" one of the worst romances of all time, so bad in fact, that it was Brest's last stint as a director! So, clearly ""Meet Joe Black"" was a descent into the disastrous ""Gigli"".

21 September 2004,Tradition,"One has to admire dogged admiration of an established tradition for its own sake, however misguided or foolish it may be. Rather like our national penchant for elevating family scions and movie actors to be heads of state, Hollywood chooses to produce its own brand of Stepford Husbands and foist them off on sentimental audiences until the last possible dollar can be wrung out at the box office.

In the tradition of aging Kewpie dolls like Ryan O'Neal, Warren Beatty, and Robert Redford, we now have Brad Pitt joining the parade. As Dorothy Parker might have said of him, he displays the full range of thespian emotion from A to B. I think he probably got as far as ""bewilderment"" in this dismal and tedious remake. It must have been a painful job for the hairdresser to keep his golden hair strands properly mussed from scene to scene, given that everything else about him suggests wooden immobility.

Beautiful as the sets and costumes are, and with at least some of the cast able to generate a spark or two, this lifeless attempt to find profundity in cheap sentiment is not worth a second glance.

And, in order not to beg the question, I admit that I watched it only as a way to fill some time waiting for the postman to arrive with my social security check. The luxury of tedium.",3
13 January 2021,Great performance from Anthony Hopkins,"Anthony Hopkins excels in the role of a wealthy businessman, both in his scenes of business dealings and his relationship with family and his guest

I also enjoyed the performances of Forlani, Harden and Tambor, I was not 100% keen on Brad Pitt's performance but I think this was writing and direction rather than the actor. For example, I found some of the hospital scenes somewhat nails on chalkboard.

There is good writing elsewhere however. There is an engaging plot - although you are left filling in blanks with regard to why characters do not act differently and also you are thinking at the end - so.....this is going to be tricky, what happens next?

There is a good tale of romance.

I liked the indoor swimming pool which I read was made especially for the film.",7
13 December 1998,"Great Acting, Slow Pace","Meet Joe Black. Meet Brad Pitt, for 3 hours. This is a movie that spends three hours on a screenplay that was written and rated for two. It's a fine idea of a story. Death (Pitt) comes to take a holiday with a dying millionaire (Hopkins) and just happens to fall in love with his daughter (Claire Forlani). Meanwhile,a two-faced, untrustworthy man, who happens to be engaged to Forlani, attempts to steal the family business from Hopkins. Death, however, has come to save the day for Hopkins, only long enough so that he can bring him with him to the great beyond. It's a great plot with an excellent cast. Yet, this movie fails to deliver the goods.

The main problem that this film has is that they must have fired the editor before they took the final copy to edit. This movie is three hours long. And it's a long three hours. As a result, it flows along like a turtle who is in a hurry to get to the end of a mile long stretch. Some scenes are painfully long. I kept waiting for something to happen that would move it along, but it never came. The climax of this film (you know, the part where all of the movie's problems get solved) lasts well over an hour. I kept waiting for it to end, but it kept on going.

Many women that I've discussed this movie with think that it's the greatest movie they've ever seen. Why? Simple...Brad Pitt. I keep thinking that if they hadn't cast Brad Pitt in the lead, this movie would have been a complete failure. I like Brad Pitt, and I find that he has great acting skills and an ability to captivate his audience by his charm and good looks. His presence somehow makes this movie tolerable.

The guys in the audience will find newcomer Claire Forlani equally attractive. She offers a stunning screen presence and surprisingly good acting skills.

Hopkins, of course, is a genius of an actor. He brings credibility to this movie. Who else could play a millionaire with such style and finesse in such an honorable way. Once again, he provides a great performance.

I gave this movie a 6 for the following reasons. High marks for the exceptional acting from Hopkins, Pitt, and Forlani; and a clever idea of a script. Low marks for the slowness of its pace. All in all, it's a better than average film that is dragged down by it's length and pace.",6
1 September 2019,Simply bland,"This movie left me repeatedly wondering how such an interesting concept could be portrayed so blandly. Pitt is charismatic and charming as the coffee shop man, and his Caribbean accent was spot on, but his attempt at making Joe Black mysterious doesn't ever show any emotion at all. Hopkins also provides no emotional depth to his character, reacting with bizarre calm when told things that should be truly terrifying. The few times that he does, the emotions seem very muted, downplaying the events that he is reacting to. Everyone else's performances are equally forgettable, but I was honestly surprised to see such blandness from the usually memorable Pitt and Hopkins.

The cinematography was also unmemorable. It reminded me of the early age of US films, where most movies were based on plays or written as a play, intentionally refusing to change the scenery or show anything other than cookie-cutter lighting and camera angles, utterly failing to take advantage of the play's transition to film. Likewise, the music also never swells with emotion or attempts to make the score memorable in any way.

A bland and forgettable film is bad enough, but when it's stretched out to a 3-hour length, it makes for a truly poor excuse for art.",3
13 November 2002,Somehow it works,"On the surface, a three hour dialogue-driven drama/love story might seem absurdly long. But ""Meet Joe Black"", in that undefinable way that some movies do, manages to deliver a satisfying experience.

The story is actually quite simple: Death himself comes calling for the latest mortal soul whose time on Earth is done, but instead decides to take a short vacation and familiarize himself with Earthly ways and human experiences.

Anthony Hopkins, the soul in question, is a wealthy media mogul who strikes a deal with Death (Brad Pitt) and plays host to his curiousities about life. While showing him around and introducing him to family and friends, Death falls in love with Hopkin's daughter (Claire Forlani).

The performances are solid all around. Despite the criticism I've seen, Brad Pitt's subtle performance was intended and I thought right on the money. I don't think Death would be quite normal walking around in something as unusual as life.

Yes, the movie is long, but surprisingly it never drags. It's just one of those three hour films that feels like an hour and a half. There are countless scenes of well-written dialogue and excellent acting that keep the modest plot moving.

I'm not surprised this movie generates mixed reviews, it seems like one of those ""love it or hate it"" things. But somewhere in the middle of it all, there are some truths about life that shine through. It's difficult to put your finger on all the impressions you will come away with after watching this movie, but it's certainly three hours well-spent.",10
30 November 2002,Lame lame lame,"I actually turned this movie off because it annoyed me so much. Brad Pitt is the Grim Reaper.. or just slightly simple, thrown in to appease the ladies? I usually like films with him in but this really was dire. It p***ed me off so much I'm not going to bother wasting time thinking, or writing about it.

30 May 2020,Silly Brad,"I thought this movie was wonderful. It was really quite fun, but it also carried quite a bit of deep meaning. It was the perfect blend of stupid and brilliant. I loved it! Very creative idea, executed and performed perfectly. It's three hours long but did not feel like it! I have two negative things to say about it though. I did not like how Anthony Hopkins character had a favorite daughter. I thought that was weird and out of character. I also am not so sure about the ending. I liked it. But I'm not sure it's what the movie called for. Maybe too foofey? I dunno¿ great flick!

4 July 2021,I love this movie,"This is my 2nd viewing of the movie in 2021. The 1st time I saw it when it was originally released. I absolutely love this movie. The actors are amazing, the score is perfect, the story is fairly original (excluding Death Takes a Holiday), the cinematography is just beautiful. I didn't cry but it definitely leaves me feeling emotional. I have never seen such a beautiful couple as Joe (Brad Pitt) & Susan (Claire Forlani). They have great chemistry as well as Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt. Interestingly, Sir Anthony Hopkins is autistic. He found out he had Asberger's in 2014 which I believe makes him an even better actor. The film is a bit long, being 3 hours long but I feel every scene contributes purposefully to the movie. Highly recommend this beautiful movie, even if you're not into the romance genre.

29 July 2003,Painfully slow and boring,"Three hours of drivel! I liked the concept...was willing to suspend disbelief long enough to accept Brad Pitt as Death (in a suit instead of a cloak...), but the ""love"" story and the boardroom ""drama"", give me a break. I was hoping the titles would roll about an hour and a half before they actually did.

13 March 1999,"Long on visuals, short on action.","If your main reason going to the movies is to see Brad Pitt going through every imaginable facial expression (and a bit of his pectorals) then you'll probably enjoy most of these three hours. Claire Forlani has a wondrously enigmatic face, but it was too enigmatic for too long. One expects more from a film that comes from the same stable as ""Scent of a Woman."" The four writers surely could have done more with the ingredients they were given. A promising young doctor and Death? They just let the opportunity slide. Anthony Hopkins did his usual performance, but possibly the best act was Jeffrey Tambor, playing the apple-short-of-an-orchard manipulatable guy married into a New York boardroom. This movie did create one landmark: probably the longest, most protracted audience scream I've ever heard. If you see it, you'll know when it happens.

16 November 1998,Meeting Joe Boring,"The only thing I got out of this movie was a pain in the butt after watching it for 3 hours. I've liked most of Brad Pitt's movies, but this one was a real dud. Brad is suppose to be Death, but he seems more like an idiot savant - a cross between the characters in movies such as ""Being There"", ""The Rainman"" and ""Charley"", etc. Maybe the reason people in real life are able to cheat death frequently is because death is semi-retarded! I cannot recommend this movie to anyone unless, of course, they are already dead and don't get bored easily.

19 April 2022,Death takes a break...,"For me, the standout performance is Brad Pitt.

His ability to portray Death as a child in a man's body and not come across as a cornball comedy piece is an exceptional piece of work.

Balanced against Sir Anthony Hopkins Bill Parrish portrayal as a man who slowly begins to understand that his time is coming to an end, and you have an exquisite work of art.

Those who brush this off as a powder puff romance film are wide of the mark.

It's a film that works on so many levels.

On reading the plot for 'Meet Joe Black' I was unsure what sort of movie to expect - I mean Death to me is DEATH of Pratchett fame.

This movie plays the fantasy as straight drama and does it rather well. Pitt looks great and Hopkins acceptance of his strange fate if quite believable. The movie is long at almost 3 hours but didn't seem so.

6/10 worth watching.

The movie is good though it's two movies, superb drama with the likes of Anthony Hopkins and sentimental rom com with fireworks and sizzling , protracted lovey eye scenes.

Brad Pit played dual roles very believable, and subplot of parental favorites was interesting. Strong cast and even silent Board Members stayed deep in character with their facials and body lanquage.

5 February 2006,Best movie and acting for Hopkins and Pitt,"We didn't watch the XL Super Bowl. Instead we watched ""Meet Joe Black"" for the first time. It was such great acting by both Anthony Hopkins and Brat Pitt, their best ever. Great plot and a bit different than the usual movie. It had a plot. Not like so many movies now, with car crashes, special affects and filthy language. It takes thought to write a plot, it's easier to do the other movies. Brat Pitt had to be two people or two acting roles. The lst person was an outgoing personality, the 2nd person was a slower, more serious acting. You could see he is truly an ""actor"" not just a ""pretty face."" My wife, of course, loves him even if he couldn't act.

13 November 2002,A Beautiful Film,"This is a wonderful movie. It takes an extraordinary premise and deals with it in a realistic way. This is how it would be if Death were to visit Earth in human form.

But the main story isn't really what this film is about. It shows life and people at their worst and at their best. We have selfishness, greed, betrayal, loss and death. But we also have family, love, joy, hope and courage in the face of the ultimate foe. All these and more are portrayed with heartaching beauty.

Sadly, some people just won't get it. They will see the perfect pacing as slow, the story as fanciful. They will bemoan the lack of ""action"", regale the realisticly restrained character portrayals as poor acting. That's a shame - for them. They will miss one of the finest cinematic experiences without ever knowing it. But for the rest of us this film will remain forever a stunning portrayal of what it is to be human, to live, to love, to win and lose - and to die.

One of the very finest of life's vicarious experiences.",10
3 January 1999,Would've been better if it was an hour shorter,"Counting previews, MJB was a three-hour movie. The story isn't really that complex. It felt like a giant ego-trip by the director to drag out every scene as though we are going to ponder the wisdom bestowed to us in every frame.

And yet, I spent most of the movie wondering why no one ever asked what the afterlife was like! Brad Pitt plays Death, he tells Anthony Hopkins he's going to die soon, and Hopkins doesn't ask about the afterlife or his dead wife or any of that. It's not like the movie didn't have enough time to explore these aspects. Despite the director's indulgence and Pitt's unbelievably portrayal of Death, Hopkins still pulls off some wonderful moments. The direction, the screenplay, the lack of editing and Pitt's performance all warrant this a thumbs-down.

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",5
15 November 1998,Meet Joe Bore,"Everything in this unfortunate remake of Death Takes a Holiday (1934) is so miscalculated, suffering death itself would seem even the most enjoyable vacation. Brad Pitt offers no depth, playing the role of death with all the emotion of a stick, and Hopkins snarls through yet another thankless role. Thomas Newman's overbearing score swells too many times during the film's three-hour running time, but the ending is easily foreseen after the laughable fate that awaits Pitt as a mortal early in the film. Smug, dull, uninspired moviemaking -- another example of Hollywood at its worst.

20 July 2019,"Too long, strange writing","You'd think with the powerful movie stars in this project it would be better. But the writing and directing left the characters flat or even confused.

The main character Joe Black is sometimes full of wisdom and at others can't communicate. His character is quite uneven.

Every major character in the movie stares for seconds before spewing out minimal dialog.

The movie is quite slow and simple. Had it been 90 minutes in duration it may have felt like it flowed well. At 180 minutes it just dragged on and on.

I'm a little hard pressed to understand why such well known actors as Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins signed on for this strange script.

3 April 2004,"When it smells like overlong, and looks like overlong...","Meet Joe Black, aka death. Now, he wasn't always death, but decided to take the body of Joe (Pitt), who gets run over (quite spectacularly I might add). Death visits rich guy Parrish (Hopkins), and makes a deal: he will let him live (for now that is), for a look at life and how to live it. Problem here: Parrish's daughter (Forlani) falls for Death, erm, Joe, who she met right before he died.

As interesting as it may sound, that's no reason to make the movie last for 3 whole hours. There just isn't enough to work with, so an interesting story with perhaps some interesting statements is completely gunned down by the dreadful pace. It's just annoying, there's no other way of putting it.

There seems to be an interesting downfall of Brest's career going on: from the great Midnight Run, then this nonsence, and ultimately the much talked about Gigli... say no more, say no more!

26 July 2001,not very good.,"I saw this movie about three years ago, and thought it was very long and unrealistic, the plot wasn't very interesting, the only good thing in this movie is Anthony Hopkins' performance, he was great, I also like his performance in ""Hannibal"". How come the death will be in love? it wasn't coherent, but anyway even though the movie was very long and unrealistic I enjoyed this movie a little. The story was unrealistic, but different. After all this is just a movie in which everything is fictitious.

16 June 2020,"Timeless classic, an exploration of love and emotional separation","Meet Joe Black is the story of death personafied. A thought provoking film about mortality and emotional separation. An enchanting masterpiece which taught us about life and why you never takes it for granted.

We believe, life flashes before your eyes when you're about to die, all the years, struggle, love, friendships and relationships waved in a blink. Joe Black is a fiesta of love and life, a reflective and philosophical tale.

Yesterday was the 3rd time, I watched this film. It reminded me of the good old days, a young college student thinking about exploring the world and falling in love. I had dreams which I want to live. I want to sell my talent to the world. I want to prove myself, I considered innocence is the art to captivate each and every detail of life but the world out there was harsh, full of predators. Well, I had my own moments. Received the compliments, appreciated by closed ones.I love this film because it remind me of my earliest life philosophies, which were bit different from nowadays.

This is one of the finest film from Brad Pitt legendary filmography though Anthony Hopkins is the real master here, he was outstanding.

The chemistry of Pitt and Claire Florani is magical, I loved the idea of ""Martin Brest"" to capture their emotions through eyes and it's been difficult for both Pitt and Forlani to showcase passion, obsession and madness as they communicate their characters to viewers largely by means of their eyes, which, as taught by ancient philosophers, are the windows of the soul. Emotions which words can't express, eyes do.

In short, Meet Joe Black is timeless classic, an exploration of love and emotional separation. Your story will reflect in the 3 hour tale, a missing part which engages you till the end.

27 September 2022,Classic one with less entertainment.,"RATED 7/10 Language: English Source: Netflix

The best part of this move is decent story and great cast. The acting and making are classic and outstanding. The problem of the movie is its length. Felt too much of dragging in the middle portion. It is good movie with some clap worthy scenes. But cant attach to the lengthy presentation.

If you are looking for classic and artistic presentation you will be overwhelmed by this one. If you are expecting more entertainment from good cinema, it will not fulfill appetite The fantasy angle was unique and i felt bit on the romantic side story.

Classic one with less entertainment.

3 January 2002,"""Has my father shown you his collection of rare books?""","Oh, what a masterpiece. For all those unsatisfied souls who thought they'd never live to see the day when Brad Pitt did a Jamaican accent, I give you: ""Meet Joe Black"". For all those desperate men and women who wanted to see a movie in which Brad Pitt spends ninety per cent of his screen time looking blank and, frankly, a little stupid, I give you: ""Meet Joe Black"". Some viewers, however, may feel a certain something is missing. What could it be? What is the elusive quality that this film lacks? Oh yes, it's all coming back to me (I drifted off for a second there, mesmerised by the thought of the production meeting in which the Brad-raps-with-black-lady scene was first suggested) - the one thing this film needs is a plot. And at least an hour of its running time cutting out. And an entirely different cast. And something happening, at some point. Another imdb reviewer has asked what us precious souls could have been doing with our precious time instead of watching this. Well, I could have been asleep. I could have been having my toenails removed by masked intruders. I could have been starring in a porn movie. All sorts of things! In fact, next time ""MJB"" (as I like to call it) is next on TV, I would happily be doing anything except witnessing it. Saints preserve us, in a more enlightened time than this, the people responsible for ""MeetJoeB"" (as I like to call it) would have been burned at the stake. There can be no excuse, no explanation, for pap of this quality and quantity. The only possible response for any sane individual who accidentally endures the monstrosity known as ""MJBlack"" (as I like to call it) is to systematically seek out all those involved and have them destroyed. Yes, that would mean ""Fight Club"" would never have existed. You know what? I can live with that. If I could turn back time (as Cher once so memorably said) I would do the job myself. Happily. No court in the land could convict me, once exhibit A had been, uhmmm, exhibited. Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you: ""Meet Joe Black"". And you can keep it.",
17 April 2020,Two superb male leads,"Anthony Hopkins, in my opinion, is one of the greatest actors of all time. He has a beautiful modulated speaking voice. Brad Pitt is also a really good actor so picture them together in a film. 'Because I could not stop for Death he kindly stopped for me' comes to mind. Beautifully paced drama filled with emotion and mood, great music, lovely characters makes this an unforgettable movie. If I saw it many years ago I had forgotten it. It stirs the emotions and takes you far away into your memories of love and life. This film is about a good man who leads a good life and brings out the best in other people with one exception. The three hours can be broken up now as it is on Netflix in 2020 when we have more time than we know what to do with being isolated and fearful. Most of all, I loved the presence of Anthony Hopkins about this film.

21 November 2022,"When Leonard Maltin gave this clunker 2 stars out of 4, he was too kind!","This big sappy Hollywoodish dinosaur is all about rich, shallow, pretty people, and what it says about life and death and love and marriage is about as trite as a Hallmark greeting card.

Apparently -- at least judging by many of the comments on this site -- some moviegoers need to be reminded periodically that life is precious, that there are more important things in life than money, that love is a wonderful thing, that you should only marry for love, etc., etc. And when they encounter a movie that preaches these timeworn truths, and that throws in some philosophizing about death as well, they regard it as profound and are deeply moved. Either that or they're friends of the producer.

22 July 2010,Could Have Been Better....,"This movie, an up-dated version of the classic film ""Death Takes A Holiday"" from the 30s, which starred Fredric March, is devoid of any real philosophical or moral qualities. It is filmed, or so it appears, purely for the entertainment value. That, in itself, is not bad, but because of the lack of true focus and insight on the part of the director, the film suffers tremendously. Here, Brad Pitt plays the part of ""Death""...but, really, at this point of time in cinematic history, no one is afraid of him. Not really. And though Pitt is an excellent actor, he is not able to pull off an authoritative performance, one that demands fear from those he encounters because of Death's cold finality, and because of the ensuing questions as to the afterlife and what one's fate could possibly be in that afterlife. I would not expect the director to give us a ""shot-by-shot"" repeat of the original...as did some unfortunate director who gave us a needless play-by-play of ""Psycho"" some years back...but there were opportunities that were missed to make this a film above the cut. And any film with Anthony Hopkins has that possibility. Talent is wasted in this one, as are opportunities to make the picture rise above the fray by mere virtue of situational possibilities that could have gone in virtually any direction...but which failed to do so. First, I feel it was a mistake to make the main character one who has lived a fairly charmed and privileged life, who does not struggle with moral and philosophical issues on a 'hand to mouth' basis daily. Where is the redemptive value in inspecting the life of someone who flies into Manhattan in his own helicopter to a private helipad, to go to his office in the midst of Wall Street to a board meeting on the top floors of some corporate structure to a meeting with his board of directors? I don't see much --if any-- redemptive value there. Second, it seems that a role reversal might have served this movie well. Brad Pitt--at this time--did not have the authoritative presence that such a terrifying spectre as death should possess. People are very much afraid of death...the fear of the unknown. But clearly, the presence of death in non-threatening form is incredible waste, and its meaning is lost on both the performers and the audience if it fails to score and make its deadly presence known and felt. This was a true failing. Hopkins could have done this, and, indeed, he has done it before...Hannibal Lector is one of the classic movie villains, and Hopkins gave Lector that life and presence. One of the missed opportunities was witnessed in the boardroom when Drew--a very arrogant character--demanded to know just who Joe Black was and why he seemed to have a strangle-hold on Hopkins' character, Bill Parrish. The way the scene was handled, without giving away the identity and purpose of Joe Black was, at that critical moment, a big letdown...almost an act of cinematic cowardice on the part of the director. It really took the steam out of the sails. Plus...that character needed to be brought down a few notches, and Death would have been the ideal one to accomplish this...but it never really happened to my satisfaction. It was one of the most dis-appointing moments of the movie, a real low. This movie had the potential to be something far more than what it wound up being. Maybe someone might try it again, and there may be something of a more fluid flow of ideas...but the writers got stuck in the mud...the direction was wooden, stoic, not multi-directional and all encompassing. Because of this, the film implodes under the weight of its own imperfections. I really wanted to like this movie..and I expected more. I cannot recommend it very highly...and I would advise a watching of the Fredric March version to get a real feel of what is going on before you tread the murky waters of ""Meet Joe Black"".",5
7 September 1999,Tedium in the extreme,"If there was ever a film that required an hour slashed from its length, it's this one. Now, I love a good romantic film, one that makes me sniffle a little, and this one started well. You know, a bit of true love and so on. But did it go on? And on and on and on ad infinitum. I was so tired of flowery speeches and interminable pauses full of ""meaningful"" looks, that by the end I was screaming for death to take them ALL! Mercy please. 3 hours! 3 bloody hours! It barely had the plot to carry it 1. Make the bad man go away.

25 June 2002,Good but for Pitt's mouth,"Overall, this is a good movie. The death scene in the beginning is one of the most unexpected, violent and memorable since Psycho. And the scene where Anthony Hopkins says goodbye is heart-wrenching.

But what brings this movie down is Brad Pitt's inability to speak clearly. His role demands a smooth talker. His lines want to crackle with enunciation and spice.

But Pitt has always talked like he has a mouth full of marbles. Here he sounds like he is reading a line, instead of talking, because someone who speaks that way wouldn't choose words unnatural to his cadence of speech.

This isn't to put Pitt down. It's just to say that he was not a good choice for this particular role.

10 March 2000,The Pitts,"I guess this movie is for people who like to watch make-believe rich people and fantasize about how they must live. So by all means, cast it with pretty Brad Pitt, Claire Gooeylani and Anthony Hopkins, who has worked his way up from a butler in some other movie.

Hopkins, who probably couldn't screw up a role even if he tried, is the only character in the movie who doesn't come off making you crave sucking on toilet paper soaked in imitation maple syrup. Pitt plays the ""Angel of Death"" sorta... How clever to have the Grim Reaper act cuuuuute!

Oh, there's some sort of storyline, some kind of high-falutin' big deal message to the movie about (who would guess?) LOVE, and well, yawn. Claire What's-her-lani plays Hopkin's character's daughter who happens to be a doctor, and I guess it's supposed to be meaningful that a doctor falls in love with Mr. Death, although when I mentioned that to the people who watched the movie with me, they just laughed. Maybe the two have a love affair just so you can get all dewey and fuzzy watching such cute people mumble at each other and make cow eyes.

And I gotta hand it to them, 'cause it was one of the dewey and fuzziest fall-for-me scenes. Oooh, that ULTRA SOFT voice that Claire ???Lani has! I don't know, is that some kinda electronic effect that they use? She sounded like a persian kitten purring in a down sleeping bag on a hot summer day, and was about as easy to understand. Is that supposed to be sexy or something? Is that the way she really talks? With that pencil neck of hers, I'd expect more of a squeak. Shows what I know.

I recommend this movie for people locked into a trailer park lifestyle, to get some ideas going on how they're gonna spend their lottery winnings. Oh, those rich people are SOOOO fuzzy!",3
19 October 2015,Interesting piece of crap,"The only reason I give this movie a 5 is because, I have to admit that throughout most of the movie I found interesting the whole idea of death taking the form of a guy and learning to be human and all that. Everything else was just dumb, unrealistic, Hollywood cliché kind of stuff. Everyone who liked this movie a 100%, was just fascinated with how pretty and cute the protagonists looked together.Superficial BS.Yes it had a good message about life and how we should not take it from granted, but I don't think we need 3 hours of our time to be reminded of that. The acting was OK, the girl's acting was horrible, Brad Pitt was good, Hopkins was OK, everybody else just seemed desperate to look good in from of the camera.

28 March 2001,Way too long!,"Why was this movie so long? I saw quite a few scenes that should have been cut from the movie. Overall, this movie was extremely boring. Did I mention that it was too long? The only reason I saw it was because it had Brad Pitt and I had recently seen him in 'Sleepers'. This movie was a waste of his and Sir Anthony Hopkin's time. There were some cute scenes in here...e.g. the peanut butter. And seeing Brad Pitt get hit by a car was kind of amusing. But the rest of the movie was just plain boring. Also, it's horrible to see Anthony's character treat that annoying little brat Susan or whatever the heck her name is better than the Allison. What was so good about Susan? If you like Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt you will probably like this movie. Then again...you might not.

And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",1
20 June 2007,Brooklyn Dodger Relief Ace Joe Black?,"The first time I heard the title, ""Meet Joe Black"", I immediately thought of 1950's Brooklyn Dodgers relief pitcher Joe Black who had one or two great seasons before falling into obscurity. I LOVED it when Jeffrey Tambour brought up the subject, complete with Black's 1952 record. Best part of the film! To be fair, I missed the first half-hour. The first half-hour of which I'm certain must have explained exactly why Joe Black (Pitt) is so PAINFULLY slow and stupid. I mean, he's DEATH, but the director took that description literally! I always thought that death was stupid, but not as in ""idiot"" stupid, but more like in conceptually stupid. Anyway, I came in where Death was explaining himself to Anthony Hopkins. They then go into the dining room where Hopkins must introduce Death as an acquaintance who'll be joining the party. What follows is one of the most PAINFULLY_PACED_SECNES_ IN_HOLLYWOOD_HISTORY! Again, I obviously missed out on WHY he's so stupid, but after a while I didn't care WHY. I was just really annoyed with the idiot routine as well as a plethora of pauses big enough to sail the Queen Mary through! OK, so the ""fish out of water"" premise is a classic Hollywood device. Hillbilly Jed Clampett and family trying to adjust to life in Beverly Hills? Hilarious! Death as a complete idiot ADJUSTING to LIFE while being played by Brad Pitt? Appropriate, but not nearly as entertaining! I give the film three stars, two more than it deserves, because it had the class to mention the real Joe Black. Joe Black of the Brooklyn Dodgers!",3
27 November 2021,Ahhh!,"Pitt sounds like a whispering idiot! This movie is an overlong boring piece of crap! So glad when it was over! Trying to make this to the minimum 150 characters!

24 June 2003,One of the best ever!,"I've seen this movie more than 10 times and I haven't get enough of it!

Death (Brad Pitt) decides to spend a few days as a mere mortal and his target is a wealthy men (Anthony Hopkins). Little does he know that he'll fall hard for Suzan, the daughter of his victim. Now, he is confronted with a dilemma: to listen to his heart (and love Suzan for the rest of his mortal life), or to listen to reason (and to become once again the angel of death).

The end lives you a bitter-sweet taste in your mouth. One one hand you're happy that he didn't take her with him (she would have died), on the other hand you cannot help but feel sorry for him, because he has to live her, to go back and continue his lonely existence.

Brad Pitt is great in the role of Death. He is, as Suzan says: ""shy in the most seductive way and yet powerful"" When we think at Death we don't picture it as a blond handsome guy with a stunning smile. A men who likes peanut butter more than anything and who has the candor of a child. And this contrast is what makes the movie great.

Anthony Hopkins is, as always, at his best. A elegant gentleman who has the wisdom of his age. A father who love his daughters more than anything. Who dares to face Death when he realizes that He wants to take Suzan with Him.

Claire Forlani (Suzan) is perfect for this role. She knows nothing about Joe and yet she falls for him. She accepts him without any questions. I'll never forget th moment when she realizes who he is. The look on her face when she accepts the inevitable: ""you're Joe!"" she says smiling through her tears.

Ok, enough! As you can see I'm a sucker for this type of movies: a touch of mystery, a touch of love, a touch of supernatural and I'm hooked!",10
15 February 1999,Bradd Pitt dies and returns as Bo Derek...,"No wonder Anthony Hopkins decided to retire from acting after seeing himself in this bloated glob of Hollywood bilge. Sure, it makes good entertainment (in the true tradition of television) but I really can't excuse the screen writer from allowing so much cliched dialogue in one film. I haven't seen such a bad performance from a major actor like Brad Pitt in a long time - sort of a male Bo Derek, finger in mouth and all. Get acting lessons from Anthony before he retires for good. The only thing that made me stay was Claire Forlani who was positively edible...

1 January 2001,Brad Pitt strikes again!,"Brad Pitt kills this movie. The movie is slow, it's long, it's almost silent, but those aren't necessarily movie-killers. No, to really kill a movie, you have to get the leading role completely, utterly wrong - like here.

It's basically a remake of the old movie ""Death Takes a Holiday"", where Death assumes human form, and falls in love. The old movie was from the early days of sound and consequently clumsily made, but had a gothic romanticism that makes it still worth watching. The new version tries for a bit of the same, and came close in some places, but you can't do Gothic Romanticism with a blank like Brad Pitt at the center of the film. It could have been a good film with a decent leading actor, the director had the courage to try for the kind of stillness and quiet that makes the smallest nuances seem vital (a la ""The Innocents"" or ""The Sixth Sense""), and for stretches of the film it actually works. It does get you to actually get into the relationships between the characters, the silence really does draw you in - when it works.

But some actors can't stand that kind of scrutiny - Brad Pitt being one. Death was written as having a mix of utter innocence (new to humanity and all that) and terrible depths - which HAD to be played by an actor who's at least capable of registering feeling in a close-up! For this movie to work at all the endless close-ups needed to be fascinating - we needed to watch the thoughts, feelings, and depths playing through Death's eyes. But neither thoughts, feelings, nor depths play through Pitt's eyes, nothing plays through Pitt's eyes, except a vague awareness that he looks good. All the close-ups of Brad looking clueless (the closest he can come to innocent) do not fascinate, instead he looks deeply stupid!

If you want to see a good movie with Death as a character don't see this, see ""The Seventh Seal"" or the original ""Death Takes a Holiday"" or Woody Allen's ""Love and Death""... or even ""Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey""  which is a way better movie than this.",
12 June 2022,Beautiful,"Aww, this was so cute and funny to watch!, One of my favorite romcoms of all time... simply super worthy to watch. I loved this cast and the plot. 10/10 cause I could never be tired of this masterpiece haha.

9 June 2022,Drags Towards The End,"Meet Joe Black is long. The first 2 hours are ok but the final hour is a real drag. I may be in the minority but i thought Brad Pitt gave a good performance in this and Anthony Hopkins is great. That last hour though..i counted 6 goodbyes, 3 farewells and 2 i'll miss yous. It gets very schmalzy towards the end, which is a shame as the first half was very enjoyable especially the first meeting between Brad Pitt & Claire Forlani.

25 June 2002,"Love is passion, obsession, something you cannot live without!","I confess I've seen this movie many times. I liked it since the first one. Beyond the story of the movie there is a deep meaning: Love is passion, obsession, something you cannot live without. And live without looking for it is like to not live. Sometime life gives us a chance, sometime in a coffee shop, sometime in a party. Don't wish it away and try to love.

8 December 2007,"Yeah, I love this movie","10 out of 10 for me too, Mr. Sponseller. Some trivia first. Two of my favorite movies star both Pitt and Hopkins. The other one being ""After the Fall"" of course. And I just noticed the other night that ""Twelve Monkeys"", for which Brad Pitt won a Golden Globe, also contains Louie Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"". ""Meet Joe Black"" is on satellite a lot, and I watch it most of those times. I bought the sound tract CD, for Thomas Newman's beautiful music. Susan and Joe are staring at each other to Newman's music right now, and Pitt does this so well. Claire Forlani, also. The two scenes with the old Haitian lady were just so damn good, too. I wonder whether that was one scene, and seeing it, Brest thought: ""We have to have more of this"". Bravo to Martin Brest, who directed some other great films. Great cast here. Jeffrey Tambor is perfect as ""Quince"", a complex character. No, he's not a pedophile; just a sentimental guy who knows he married well. The look that Marcia Gay Hardin's Alison gives him at the dinner table is priceless. Wrapping this up, the handsome, talented kid from Missouri continues to do fine work.",10
17 May 2006,"A Film, not a Movie","So many of us enter theaters to be entertained. To laugh. To cry. To relax. We go to escape from the cares and responsibilities of life. Meet Joe Black is not what we expect. Filled with the best actors of the day, we expect the usual entertainment, but Meet Joe Black is anything but usual. We are forced to step into an unfamiliar arena. Things look the same, but we find ourselves forced to deal with the issue none of us wants to think about, let alone contemplate deeply, and certainly not something we expect to see on film. Meet Joe Black is among my top twelve favorites. It's slow pace is unfamiliar to Americans used to instant gratification, and though Brad Pitt's finely sculpted face is easy on the eyes, many viewers lack the patience to absorb the films content. I wish they would try. A few lines are insipid. The 'multiply times infinity' makes me gag, but the scene where Pitt tastes peanut-butter for the first time is positively brilliant, and should be studied by all actors hoping for a film career. The shifts from high drama to low comedy are subtle, and you don't notice many of them until you have watched the DVD version several times. What critics point to as flaws, I find to be some of the best parts of the film. Thomas Newman's music is masterful, each performance superb. What Martin Brest did was release his Director's Cut in theaters. Many viewers failed to spend the time needed to absorb and enjoy it. A pity.",10
11 September 2015,Ruined by lead actress,"I'd have given this an 8 but for the irritating performance of the lead actress. From start to finish she simpers and bridles either through plain bad acting or in a gargantuan effort to look adorably doll like throughout the whole thing. Perhaps she overdid the botox, or suffered from constipation while filming. Whatever it was, she slaughtered the role and how Brad kept his pecker up during his scenes with her, I'll never know.

Apart from that, a great film, fascinating concept, and the rest of the cast were excellent. Needless to say, I've not seen Ol Glassy Eyes in any other leading role since.

16 July 2000,"If this movie doesn't put you to sleep, nothing will!!","I cannot believe that I actually sat through this boring piece of cinematic trash. Those were the longest three hours of my life. By the end of this movie, I had no idea what was going on or what had happened nor did I really care. I kept wanting to just close my eyes but I kept thinking that maybe this movie will get better. However it never did.

What was Brad Pitt thinking when he read the script for this movie? His movies are either really good(i.e. The Fight Club, A River Runs Through It, Seven) or really horrible(i.e. The Devil's Own, Seven Years In Tibet).

So, if you're having problems sleeping, just put this movie in and you'll get to sleep really quick.

Then they explained something in a supplement after the movie, I think I know what they said they thought they wanted to do, but didn't.

Hopkins; overdone, this isn't the stage, yet he never got there, wherever it was. Yell, whisper, couldn't see either. Pitt; where did he see this simpleton stuff? Theatre 101? Forlani, I know she was supposed to be a naive daddies girl, but, but, I'd like to see he do something good.

If you like these two guys, see the movie.

24 April 2009,"Bad script, bad actress, bad experience!","I remember when this movie came out. I wanted to go and watch it in the cinema but then I missed it, and well, after 10 years I watched it on the TV. Uf, I'm happy I didn't pay to watch this!!! Why? Well... The story is full of gaps, clichés and pointless episodes. Where are these characters going? For instance, why does the girl fall in love with Brad Pitt? Because he is weird -Joe Black? Or just because he is cute -the guy at the coffee shop? She does't really seem to care... Very superficial. And why does Brad Pitt fall in love with her? That's even more mysterious. Her character is so flat, or at least the the actress make it so flat. Such bad acting, oh my! And the ex-boyfriend, the bad guy. Why does he become so bad all of a sudden? Cliché, cliché, cliché. And what about the character of the father? What is wrong with him? He admits that he prefers one daughter to the other and he's OK with it. Sweet. Why is he considered such a good father then? Anyway, this makes us conclude that the main problem with this movie is the script. Mamma mia, those lines! Terrible, boring, a lot of nonsense. No no no. I watched the movie to the end, fascinated by its low quality, curious to see what would be the next demonstration of cinematographic pathetism. Meet Joe Black? No, thanks.",3
16 June 2002,Snore,"Just had to sit through this movie - thanks to the effects of several coffees I didn't fall asleep (actually I wish I didn't have the coffees).

Several words come to mind to describe this film- ""ponderous"" is one, it goes nicely with ""overlong"". Rarely is a film made that is so full of its own self-importance and so over-blown. The only thing that made the film vaguely watchable was Mr Hopkins, even then this was one of his worst performances.

I was wishing that Death would come pay ME a visit by the time this one finished.

30 July 2004,awesome from start to finish,"""Meet Joe Black"" is one of those films that will make you smile from start to finish. With talented stars, a script rich in plot and characters, ""Meet Joe Black"" is a movie to watch.

""Meet Joe Black"" is a remake of an earlier film called ""Death Takes A Holiday."" In ""Meet Joe Black"" death takes human form as he comes to see the world, with the assistance of the body he is going to take. Anthony Hopkins adds his superstar status as the fiesty father, which he plays so convincingly.

There is only one result that can come from inserting two of the most talented actors in a film that has great writing. Hopkins stars alongside Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani in one of the most romantic, intelligent and character driven movies I have seen in a long time. Excitement and pleasure were two feelings that made my heart skip a beat.

When I heard Hopkins would be a part of the film, I immediately thought the amount of credibility he would give toward ""Meet Joe Black."" Hopkins is the type of actor like Robert De Niro and Morgan Freeman whose mere presence on film will alert the viewer that they will be watching a great film. Hopkins brought integrity, intelligence, and honesty to this role.

""Meet Joe Black"" is truly a movie filled with romance, excitement, joy, happiness, and sorrow. Brad Pitt's approach was enjoyable to watch as he seemed to pull it off with innocence. It was like he is learning everything from scratch, though he may know more than he is letting on. Also, Pitt's performance is like a mirror image to that of Hopkins.

Forlani is a vision to behold in ""Meet Joe Black"" as her beauty radiates off the screen with such heat. Forlani showcases her true ability to capture the essence of her character and portray it with innocence and sincerity. Audiences will enjoy the surprises Forlani has in store for them.

I give ""Meet Joe Black"" 4 enthusiastic stars.",
5 September 2022,"Ready for your close up, Mr Pitt?","It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film.

30 August 2002,A nice picture,"This movie has an awful lot going for it. It's theme can be summed up by one of the old Jamaican womans lines, We lonely here mostly too. If we lucky, we got some nice pictures to take with us.' Well this is a nice picture.

Claire Forlani is just achingly vulnerable as she (understandably) struggles to comprehend what is happening to her life. The scenes where she and Brad are talking, or almost gently dancing, inches apart as they oh so politely marvel at each other are foreplay at its finest, to be frank. The movie revels in the slow burn. What happens is often much less important than the way it does. Some of the plotting and characters can seem a little simplistic or one dimensional but after paying attention there is usually a little more going on that might appear. (Allison: I should have my head examined again.'). There are also some really funny and bizarre moments in huge contrast to the popular slow and ponderous' impressions of it. Early on Allison sees fir to introduce herself to her own sister? And later their father (Anthony Hopkins) is reminiscing about when they were both little girls and out of nowhere Quince chips in with I love little girls.'. Or Brad to Anthony, Calm down Bill. You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation .' And later on Bill, who has been very clearly set up as having almost everything a man could want, is reciting a list of all the things that in fact suck about his life and it finishes with, And oh yes! I almost forgot. My daughters fallen in love with death.' It's hard to accuse this of getting too serious really.

Everything is nothing without love' is a huge theme of the movie, and there are some great lines and moments as they make their point.

Be sorry for nothing.

Thank you for loving me. (ahhh!)

and

Bill: It's hard to let go, isn't it? Joe Black: Yes it is, Bill. Bill: What can I tell you. That's life.

Watch this and let yourself go with it. This is a nice picture.",
31 May 2012,"Inspired by Death Takes A Holiday, a classic stage play...","Inspired by Death Takes A Holiday, a classic stage play that many of my generation read as teens for either English or Drama class in high school, this film marks, for me, the coming of age of Brad Pitt as an actor with depth. I know some people will point to A River Runs Through It, or even Seven Years In Tibet as the films where Brad showed true ability, but Death Takes a Holiday is a pivotal film where he has to reach into the unknown and his past to portray a ""stranger in a strange land."" and he does it with a remarkable freshness and style. As an amateur actor, I know the importance of any production is to give the audience the illusion of the first time. Brad does that beautifully in this film.

Of course, it doesn't hurt that he is surrounded by an incredible cast, lead by the incomparable Anthony Hopkins. Jake Webber demonstrates his range as well, as do both Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Tambor. Somewhere beyond perfect is Claire Forlani's portrayal of Susan Parrish, the younger daughter and medical resident who is attracted to Pitt's character, first in his portrayal of the young attorney freshly arrived in the big city, and then as Death personified in Joe Black.

The plot is straightforward, the photography exceptional (try filming a sex scene without revealing any body parts that shouldn't be seen), and the sets are exquisite examples of architecture. While certainly not an action film, the film moves forward briskly, without needless exposition or character development beyond what is needed. Rated PG-13, thanks to that incredible photography, this is a film for contemplation and reflection, and offers no religious allegories to good or evil. I own a copy, and I think it will be regarded as collectible.",10
25 December 1999,Long and sentimental but beautifully done,"There are already a surprising number of reviews of this film. It is long, yes, the stares border on tedium in places, yes, and the wrapping up does seem to leave a tangle of loose ends, yes. All that said, the writing is often very clever and always good, the sets are beautiful and the sound track is excellent. Aside from roving stares from Brad Pitt that are occasionally distracting, the performances are also very good. And Ms Forlani is very beautiful. Obviously, a meticulous effort from the directors that went beyond marketability. In my view, like the life's work of the central character, they have created a thing of beauty the merit of which will stand the test of time.

11 March 2009,"Timeless, A Classic Whose Time Will Come.","Many films get made with such passion and craft but get simply released at the wrong time. We look upon Classic films, and forget that many of these great pictures flopped in their era. Neither the critics nor the audiences grasped the intent and strength of those stories and the way in which those stories were told. But years later through cable, VHS, DVD, and Blu-Ray we've been given an opportunity to reappraise films like ""Meet Joe Black"".

This film should've been a no-brainer. With up-and-comer Brad Pitt and Academy Award winner Anthony Hopkins holding the leads audiences should've run to the cinemas. But, alas, a three hour long love story/drama proved too daunting for a 1998 audience.

The story is a simple yet elegant fairytale. Death (Pitt) takes the body of a man and needs a guide (Hopkins) through a life away from his responsibilities. And along the way Death finds what he's been missing, love.

This is old-school film making. When a director was allowed to take his time to tell a story, to let his characters and dialog breathe. The actors are all superb. The photography, the design, and the costumes are top-notch. The settings are absolutely grand. And the score by Thomas Newman is one of the best he's ever done. And there is no hint of digital trickery. The film could've easily been made in Hollywood's golden era.

And I feel as more people see this, and recognize the timelessness of it's themes of love and life, it will become the classic it deserves to be. A modern day ""The Bishop's Wife"".",8
11 November 2018,it is either for you or it is not,"For those that did not like the film i can only accept and respect your choice. For myself however, this movie didn't even need to be about death coming for a visit. The performances of the actors was just fantastic. The build up and slow pace made this film truly an amazing thing to watch. The slow but incredible build up from a potentially boring start builds toward something that left me as one with a sense of appreciation for life and the moments within that can make it truly great.

I have seen this film many times now and every time i watch it, i experience hesitation toward the end because i simply do not want it to end. I wonder why they dont make them like this anymore.

All i can offer is 10/10, i hope you enjoy it too.

12 February 2016,"Amazing film, with an amazing story","This is one of my all time favorite films. Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins are amazing actors, who really capture your attention through out the whole film. The story, about what is true love, what does it mean to live, and finally what awaits after death is very interesting. What i really liked about the film, was that Death wasn't the antagonist, but what just another being trying to understand the complexity of life. While Drew played by Jake Weber was the typical type of human who was after greed. The acting in the film was great from the main cast to the supporting actors. The story never let you go or got boring, and the cinematography was really wonderful as well. This is hands down one of the classic films that people should watch. Well in my opinion at least.

I know I have seen this movie over 20 times, and I cannot watch it without an entire box of Kleenex, some good ice cream, and to curl up on my futon with a heavy blanket. This film is so amazing. The first time I watched it, I really didn't give it much patience, or attention, or thought. But after watching it a second time, I did a complete turnaround. It is my absolute all favorite movie with one of my idols, and I love it. What else can I say? It has everything a good movie should, with a little dose of extra emotions added in for comfort. If you want a really good cry, rent this movie. You won't regret it, I promise.

10 May 2000,"Death affirms life - A Gorgeous, moving film.","The concept of the grim reaper taking human form on Earth presents many potential dark moments. Rather than focus on such things, director Martin Brest and screenwriters Kevin Wade and Bo Goldman (""Scent of a Woman"") chose to focus on the life-affirming aspects of the concept.

And what a ride it is - three hours of some truly touching scenes. Imagine a nether-worldly presence that looks at the world through detached eyes, not knowing what or why humans feel. Death breathes down everyone's neck and people concern themselves with trivial worldly matters.

This film has a wonderful spiritual theme. Enjoy your life. Wake up knowing that you need nothing more - that when it's time to leave for the next world, that's ALL that needs to be done. No regrets. There are not many films that give people a sense of calm about leaving this life. I think ""The Sixth Sense"" is the last one that did that for me.

Brad Pitt is no Frederic March, and nothing else about this movie really measures up to the original. I guess if you haven't seen that one, you'll like this -- but I'd urge you to save your money and get or see the 1934 version instead. It's far more beautifully filmed, and better acted (though Anthony Hopkins gives a good performance in ""Meet Joe Black""). Even the tag lines - ""Joe's"" No One Can Die -- While He Loves! and ""Holiday's"" No One Can Die -- While He Makes Love! -- are identical, given the shift in meaning for the phrase ""make love"" in the last 60 years. I don't necessarily hate remakes, but I do hate it when they pretend they aren't ... and this one isn't as good, not nearly as good, as the original.

9 November 2019,"""BACKGROUND"" MUSIC ?","Some may not like this film because it's a bit slow and thoughtful; I pity them. It's actually a rather nice example of how films used to be made, films that had less ""crash, bang, wallop"" and a little more story, acting and dialogue.

Anthony Hopkins, as always, is excellent; Brad Pitt, despite what some reviewers have said and despite my own mild aversion to him as a modern day, pretty boy method actor, is actually not at all bad and the supporting cast is also more than adequate. Yes, the story is a bit cheesy but since when did every film have to carry some sort of deep message ? This one has a rather old fashioned sentimental, romantic bent and it's none the worse for that; the musical accompaniment is dated, but isn't it so much better than the modern garbage ?

I would have really loved this film except for one thing - the sound quality. The musical background so often drowns out the soft, half mumbled speech of the characters - is it my television or my ears ? No, I've no problems with either, so it's down to the production.

While Hopkins delivers his lines clearly, for the most part, Pitt and Claire Forlani, both speak so quietly, or mumble US style, as to make their words almost unintelligible under the horribly loud ""background"" music. I love the music, but I'd really like to hear the words of the actors too.

I think it's a rather lovely film; simple and straightforward. It has messages about love and family, loyalty and betrayal, honesty and deceit, but none of these take over. No one turns up to shoot the bad guys or rescue the good ones; it's old fashioned sentimental schmaltz. It would certainly be worth an 8 if it wasn't for that bloody annoying ""background"" music, so it's only a 7 from me, though I'll watch it again, and again, and again ---------------- .",7
15 November 1998,"No Doze, Anyone?","Hmmmmm......Brad Pitt stares at the camera. Brad Pitt displays a counterfeit Jamaican accent so irritating you'll wish Death to come knocking to relieve you of the tedium of this moronic ""morality"" fable.

That's not to mention the ponderous, humorless and patronizing tone of the film. Pointless and lifeless, it wanders through three hours of your time (assuming you're dumb enough to waste it here).

30 November 1998,"Too Long, too dull","Movie would have been greatly improved if at least one hour had been cut out - the editing could have been much tighter. The film was pretty, Brad was pretty, girl was pretty but the whole thing was so drawn out - after an hour and a half you just wanted it to end! The only reason I stayed was to see how it ended. It had potential - just needed a stronger direction.

24 September 2006,Avoid avoid avoid,"You'd think that with a couple of big names like Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins this film would be watchable at least. The only highlight of this film is when Mr Pitt meets with an accident inside the first ten minutes. The film then plummets way, way down from then on. A completely ridiculous plot, an awful 'performance' from Brad (and most of the rest of the cast too) and three hours of the most tedious drivel imaginable, which gives you plenty of time to wonder how this film got past the ideas phase. Avoid this film like flesh eating bacteria, that would be preferable to watching this trash again. The WORST film I've ever seen (based on prior expectations, or just compared to any film that actually had, say, money spent on its production).

4 November 2021,for sure in my top 10,"It remains one of my favourite movies of all time, I just love the way Brad Pitt is able to impersonate so well the main character, it's just wow, I never thought I could have seen such a good movie that I actually discovered by mistake.

Also this movie is on the line between being romantic and hilarious, I love it!

27 March 2012,Lacked depth to be really good,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",5
8 September 2005,You'll love it... if it's the only movie you've ever seen or you're a female.,"What ever happened to Martin Brest? A ring of critical and financial successes -- ""Beverly Hills Cop,"" ""Midnight Run,"" ""Scent of a Woman"" -- and suddenly... ""Meet Joe Black""? ""Gigli""? Huh? This three-hour dramatic epic (yawn!) is a remake of an older film, which I hear is much, much better. The updated version stars Brad Pitt as Death. (Apparently Death takes on the form of young 30-somethings with strong abdominal mid-sections and glistening white teeth, despite having a taste for the gruesome. At least he's got a good fashion sense.) The movie starts with Brad Pitt meeting a pretty girl (Claire Forlani) and then being struck by a moving vehicle, which is one of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes in any film - ever. It's so fake and ridiculous; you can't help but laugh as a plush man gets pummeled by oncoming traffic and spins through the air dozens of times.

He dies and Death takes on his physicality, returning to earth to visit a poor old man named Parrish (oh! the symbolism!), played by Anthony Hopkins. Death claims it's time for Mr. Parrish to die. Mr. Parrish disagrees and offers to give Death a tour of the world in return for his soul. (Nevermind that he's in his sixties and has lived a full life and might very well die soon of natural causes anyway.) Death agrees. He meets Mr. Parrish's daughter, who happens to be...you guessed it... Claire Forlani! Oh my! What a coincidence! She falls in love with him, and he falls in love with her. Mr. Parrish disapproves of his daughter dating one of the Satan's spawn, but what the hell? At least he managed to get a few extra years out of his materialistic, financially-obsessive life.

""Meet Joe Black"" will instantly remind you of countless other films (unless this is your first movie). I do not hold a grudge against it because it's a ""chick flick"" - enjoy many so-called ""weepy"" films, but this just didn't do it for me. I found it pretentious, unnecessarily slow (come on, the story and the characters are not deep enough to warrant three hours) and ultimately very disappointing. Pitt and Hopkins are fine actors and watching them go through the motions in a dull wannabe-epic is quite unsatisfying. Add on top of this that Martin Brest officially sold out his career to the ruthless nature of the Hollywood circuit with this movie, and you can understand my nonexistent feelings for it.",4
30 December 2006,A moving and inspiring film,"I know there are certain people who don't particularly care for movies with a big emotional punch, like this one. But I find myself deeply moved each time I view this film. It certainly doesn't hurt to have all the actors at the top of their form. Anthony Hopkins, in particular, gives one of the richest performances of his career -- as do Jeffrey Tambor and Marcia Gay Harden who shun caricature to show us that rich people can be genuine and kind. This is about the best thing I've seen Brad Pitt do; he shows a remarkable restraint that is perfectly consonant with his character. And Claire Forlani is a wonder. I have a feeling that in 30 or 40 years, people will be talking about ""Meet Joe Black"" with the same sort of affection and reverence accorded classics like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or ""Casablanca.""

13 February 2020,"Good movie, just dragged about undermining what could have been great","VERY few movies should be 3 hours long. The story line and characters have to be far more complex to justify such a lengthy film. Meet Joe Black is compelling and for the most part it is all well done. Why did the filmmakers feel the need to extend this so long? Especially the last act. I could easily cut out 30 minutes of fluff, probably an hour and still kept the main themes of the movie intact. 6 stars, undermined by the unnecessary length.

16 May 2000,Only Hollywood could make a movie like this.,"In a time when the tag ""Hollywood movie"" means something negative to most European movie-goers, I think it is important to take notice of a film like Meet Joe Black. The story is okay without being truly original, but it is told so masterfully that it manages to go from comedy through romance to melodrama without ever becoming trivial. By acting opposite an institution like Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt proves that he is more than just a teen idol, he is a great actor. Claire Forlani is astonishing, and Jeffrey Tambor is very funny. All in all, this is one of the best I have seen in a long time.

2 September 2018,Love this movie,"I'd say that if you do not understand the movie then why leave a bad review. > Not all of the bad reviewers failed to miss the meaning, but a lot did. >Death could not understand why it was so hard for people to let go of their life when they died. Never having ""lived"" himself; he decided to see why living was so consuming. So he found someone about to expire and jumped in right when their soul jumped out. This is why he seems so childlike and naive at times because every single experience is new and fascinating, like peanut butter. > Fast forward, he falls in deep love and learns to appreciate the kindness and goodness in people like Mr.Parrish. Only at the end does he finally understand why every person he comes to get when they die have such a hard time letting go. > Death understands now how hard it is to leave your loved ones and because of this he will be able to be a better "" Death"" because he now understands ""life"".

16 September 2006,Magnificent....,"This is truly one of the most fascinating and enjoyable love stories i have seen in recent times. I was completely captivated by the relationship between JB and Susan... their love for one another transcended all that stood between them, it was unending, unconditional, true love. It did not matter that Joe was essentially death this was irrelevant to what Susan and Joe felt for each other. Finally, i was extremely impressed by the performances by all in this movie, and in particular that of Claire Forlani. Her performance as Susan captured me in a way which few actresses can do. She was magnificent.

Long, rather meaningless, and just plain boring, with a rather stupid ending. Brad Pitt may or may not be a good actor, but as an Angel of Death he just doesn't cut it, give me the late John Dye as 'Andrew' in 'Touched By An Angel' any day, that's the kind of Angel you'd want assisting you with the Transition. This movie may just put you off dying all together?

1 February 2020,"Joe Black dropped by to say hello, today.","As usually happens with cardiac moments, I have learned, it was just after I got up, as it had been for my first real heart attack 3 years ago.

(When that happened, I went and lay down on my back in bed and then - on the spur of the moment - on the brink of the abyss - reasoned that raising and laying my left arm up above me on the bed might straighten out the heart artery and let the blood flow again, which it apparently did, with the help of an aspirin. A half hour later a second attack came, I did the same thing, it subsided, and I fell asleep - happily to awaken. I almost forgot to tell my doctor about these, and when I did he became alarmed, tests verified the attacks, and - at no expense in Norway's wonderful national health care - I had an angiogram: a little pipe inserted in the artery. I had stopped my heart medicine for about a month, ergo this recent little episode this morning, apparently. And I have now just gotten back from one of my long but careful heart walks.)

In any case, my first thought this morning - again confronted with the possibility of dying and deserting my children - was this movie, which I had seen some years ago, long before the attacks.

It is very gradual - slow - and gentle and gentlemanly, as Hopkins&Pitt movies are, and its subject is one of the most basic to living creatures.

And it has an appropriately beautiful ending. HIGHLY recommended.

(And yes, I have seen Andre Rieux's excellent performance of Sir Anthony's similarly beautiful composition, And the Waltz Goes On.)",10

A very nice story. If you've recently lost a loved one, this movie will bring a tear or two to your eyes. The movie deals with death and life as differing shades of the same color.

For Freemasons this film also is a real treat. Just about every scene has Masonic undertones. Enjoy.

19 September 2009,Painful to watch,"OK, here goes.....

This was PAINFUL to watch. Someone recommended it to me multiple times, and when I saw it in the WalMart bargain bin for $5 I picked it up. I was glued the whole time, and that usually is a mark of a good movie for me. Can I be captivated for 2 hours?, if so, ""good movie"". In this case, it was 3 hours of pain. I was captivated because I kept holding out for something to happen (since it was so highly recommended), but it never came. It is what I call a ""Cluster F@#$%K"". It was all over the place. I think someone decided to get Brad Pitt for their movie, and THEN made the movie. This is clearly made to showcase Brad's pretty face for 3..long...boring....hours.

I loved Legends of the Fall, which had both of these guys in it, so I am not anti-Brad. And I love Hopkins (as long as he isn't playing Hannibal). But this movie goes NO WHERE FAST! (I mean...SLOW!!). You may get a woman to stare at Brad for 3 hours, or maybe a gay fella, but for me, you MUST have a better story line that THAT!. Wow....BAD. Whoever said ""hey. lets make a shallow stupid film, and lets let it go for 3 hours, needs to find another line of work.

Jeffrey Tambor is the same character he plays in EVERY movie. But it was Jake Weber that gave me whatever it took to stick around and say I SAW one of the worst movies of all time. And when I tell someone that opinion, I Don't want to hear ""Did you see the end? NO? OH you MISSED IT!"". Nope, I saw the whole stupid thing.",1
19 April 2022,"Great film, superb acting","Simply first class. Anthony Hopkins is a superb actor yet again. Just so genuine and real. Brad Pitt is just gorgeous. Its taken years for me to get round to watching this film and it was worth the wait. Great plot, nicely done. No spoilers here, just watch the film and enjoy.

17 July 2004,stooges emote,"curiously slow-moving effort - scratch that, there's no effort about it, if we discount forlani's wrinkling her nose (which to do her credit, she does very well: it can keep one quite occupied during the enormous gaps in the 'action'). hopkins is miscast (when is he not?), doesnt much trouble to empathise with the character the screewriters have in mind; brad pitt is in one of his 'look at me, i cant act' roles. my kids were in stitches staring meaningfully, and for long, long minutes into each other's eyes, but then, they are human.

epic classical themese here, transported into a milieu (and a country of production) that cannot support them. pleasant for passing time on a long plane journey, for example, or anywhere where time does not matter - perhaps that was the plan.

30 May 1999,Not very flattering.,"This movie had a good premise but the slow pace and terrible score were almost unbearable. This was a showcase for Brad Pitt fans as he got to just stand there in most scenes with a minimum of dialog. He acted as if he were playing the part of a robot. The slow reactions of the characters surrounding him made the entire movie and all character interaction unbelievable. I know that many critics liked this one but unless you're a Pitt fan forget it.

31 July 2021,Susan and Brad Pitt Steals this Film,"The film was wonderful, especially with Claire Forlani as Susan. Susan's character stole the show. However, what happened at the end? This leaves the audience to think and come to their own conclusions of what happened.

Brad's character and Susan's characters seemed to connect well. The both characters steal the film and are wonderful as romance characters. Claire is gorgeous and add Brad makes a wonderful couple.

This film is worth watching.

7 December 2003,Thoroughly absorbing.,"This seems like a slow-moving film when you step back from it, but I honestly did not realize the passage of time as I became utterly involved with this absorbing film. Since that first viewing 4-5 years ago, no matter how many times I see it I'm always misty-eyed at the end, with a renewed sense of my own mortality, and a renewed appreciation of what I have in life. How many movies can one say that about? This is a very well done film, with outstanding performances by all.

27 August 2006,"Every time I watch this film, I want to cry happy tears","""Meet Joe Black"" is one of those films that will make you smile from start to finish. With talented stars, a script rich in plot and characters, ""Meet Joe Black"" is a movie to watch.

""Meet Joe Black"" is a remake of an earlier film called ""Death Takes A Holiday."" In ""Meet Joe Black"" death takes human form as he comes to see the world, with the assistance of the body he is going to take. Anthony Hopkins adds his superstar status as the feisty father, which he plays so convincingly.

There is only one result that can come from inserting two of the most talented actors in a film that has great writing. Hopkins stars alongside Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani in one of the most romantic, intelligent and character driven movies I have seen in a long time. Excitement and pleasure were two feelings that made my heart skip a beat.

When I heard Hopkins would be a part of the film, I immediately thought the amount of credibility he would give toward ""Meet Joe Black."" Hopkins is the type of actor like Robert De Niro and Morgan Freeman whose mere presence on film will alert the viewer that they will be watching a great film. Hopkins brought integrity, intelligence, and honesty to this role.

""Meet Joe Black"" is truly a movie filled with romance, excitement, joy, happiness, and sorrow. Brad Pitt's approach was enjoyable to watch as he seemed to pull it off with such great innocence. It was like he is learning everything from scratch, though he may know more than he is letting on. Also, Pitt's performance is like a mirror image to that of Hopkins.

Forlani is a vision to behold in ""Meet Joe Black"" as her beauty radiates off the screen with such heat. Forlani showcases her true ability to capture the essence of her character and portray it with innocence and sincerity. Audiences will enjoy the surprises Forlani has for them.",
30 April 2001,Doesn't Really Work,"The pace of this movie is deliberately slow. The shots take there time. The actors settle in for the long haul. The problem is awkward glances and intimate moments(long ones at that) where very little dialogue is exchanged doesn't really work for this movie. Hopkins is excellent as usual, but the movie doesn't rest on his shoulders. It rests on the chemistry between Joe Black and Susan Perrish. I didn't feel that chemistry. I thought Claire Forlani bit off more than she could chew. Oh and the whole scene in the hospital and the ""business scam"" seem thrown in, like the writers knew they didn't have enough for a movie. They were right.

10 December 1999,Death has a holiday romance,"This really is a feel good movie, well, right up until the compulsory happy ending where the guy from the coffee shop... no, I won't spoil it for you if you haven't seen it yet. And if you haven't seen it, go, now, get a copy and prepare yourself for a big blub! I really felt sorry for Death, poor soul just wanted to see what it was all about. Well, he found out alright.

No cheesy special effects, absolutely marvellous scene outside the coffee shop.

Oh,I'm away to watch it again!

29 April 2001,A total waste of time,"I caught the last hour of this disaster on ABC last night, and am grateful I only endured an hour. Judging from the other reader comments, it was three hours long. Dear God! The hour I sat through seemed like ten...and the final scene suffered from the slow pacing, endlessly repetitive tuneless music trying unsuccessfully to emulate the great Victor Young, and a pitiful performance from the female lead who I had never heard of. She should go back to acting school! As for Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins, they both looked uncomfortable - but not nearly as uncomfortable as audiences must have felt in a theater sitting through this pretentious attempt. When is Hollywood going to stop trying to redo films that have already been done - and done much better. As for the direction and editing, oh, dear... ! Films like this only underscore my growing aversion to too many contemporary films preying on public adulation for name actors and forgetting that without a good script and competent direction, a film must inevitably fail...as this one certainly has.

14 January 2019,An over-produced dime store novel,"This movie is cheating as far as aesthetics and production goes: the setting, the actors, wardrobe, music-- they're all great. Your movie is likely going to enchant some viewers with one of these aspects if not for another.

But for those of us who can look past those aspects, my god is this one hokey, stupid, over-extended premise.

Death decides to take the form of the most handsome young white man he can find and go visit one of the richest old white dudes he can find to learn about the human experience of life. I'm so glad everyone's white and rich so as not to taint the glorious view he walks away from this experience with. Can you imagine if he'd taken on any other person to experience life through? A lower class person of color in America? Anyone in a third world country? He'd have probably gone on the biggest killing spree of all time.

The only people of color in this entire movie are two black women from Africa, which Death effortlessly switches dialects to, and who both know of Death through their... not-so-tactfully, super-cliche ways.

If you're anything like me, you eyed this movie and said yourself ""Anthony Hopkins? Brad Pitt? A Thomas Newman soundtrack? Sign me up!""

Unless you're a rich person fearing death, or someone who wants to fall in love with Brad Pitt, or just someone who's completely oblivious to class warfare the concentration of wealth, skip this.

Read the synopsis and the main character's name, and tell me you don't know how it ends.",3
7 July 2022,Anthony Hopkins is fantastic - the movie could have been a classic,"Great film. Really enjoyed it.

Anthony Hopkins is fantastic in this role, he steals every scene. Claire Forlani does a great job.

The rest of the cast works very well - though Brad Pitt at times delivers a lackluster performance that only at times manages to reflect Black's evolving understanding of the human condition. His performance however, did not get in the way of enjoying the movie.

Overall, the pacing, dialog, characters and situation is intriguing. I find it hard to believe that a truncated version would have the same emotional impact.

Highly recommended!

18 January 2015,Tedium defined,"Meandering, pointless dialogue, stretched out and padded with verbose trivialities, long,long pauses within the dialogue, and pacing so slow it can make you itch, all blended together. In this film to create the experience of excruciating boredom. It is obvious that the director did not have much faith in the script or hr would not have had to resort to these kinds of tricks of the theater. Either way he took something bad and made it worse. Much worse. A much quicker pace and scissors to the script would have been very helpful.

I would discuss the acting but what's the point? You really do not need to see this film, unless you suffer from insomnia. Stick with the brilliant original, ""Death Takes A Holiday,"" a classic, with Freddy March.

22 June 2006,Loved it! It was Oscar- worthy.,"When my husband and I first saw this movie we were dating. We both thought it was beautifully filmed and a great story. I bought it when I came out on DVD a while ago and my husband watched it (again)when he was home from work (sick). He said he cried his heart out after watching this time because he had a whole new perspective now that he had girls of his own. I can only imagine watching it again as we move closer to Bill Parish's age and thinking it's still a wonderful movie. I was not happy when prof. reviewers picked at stupid things. It was the first time I actually wrote EW magazine complaining that they let Owen review it. He just didn't get it. Anyone that doesn't see the depths of this movie is someone who swims in shallow waters. The cast was perfect, the music was perfect, etc... I actually think of my memories as ""saving pictures"" for when I pass. I also hope to see Brad at my death bed or a reasonable fax. thereof. :)

30 October 2001,Good handling of a risky film.,"Good handling of a risky film to make, 3 hours and doesn't really end up anywhere new, but like The Green Mile, it takes you on a journey, not a very compelling one, but definitely an entertaining one. Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Claire Forlani are just right for their roles and the film pretty much relies on them to break or make this film, and they make it, excellently. 8/10

1 August 2000,Want to see a movie not even Anthony Hopkins can save?,"And I'm not talking about ""The Edge"", either.

The cinematography is very good. Set, costumes, music, sound. The direction isn't bad, and some actors give stand out performances (not Brad Pitt or Claire Forlani, but excellent performances from Hopkins, Tambor and Weber seem to even things out).

However, the script is absolutely appalling. The screenplay is credited to four writers, and you can see why. Each one probably took over as the other got bored with it.

The tag-line in my TV guide said ""Death takes a holiday and makes a deal with a dying billionaire"". It takes about an hour to establish this premise. That's it, just establishing it. Then, apparently, Death falls in love with the billionaire's daughter. Well, how or why Death does this isn't explained, but it's certainly made easy when the daughter is written as a slut. A slutty billionaire's daughter getting her just deserts? That would make an interesting movie.

At just under three hours, this is an agonising movie ... I was forced to fast forward, and ended up with a terrible ending that involved Death pretending to be a member of the IRS. What the hell was that?

Look, seriously, take the screenwriters, tie them up in a basement somewhere, and make sure nobody feeds them. Please, for mercy's sake.",2
5 October 2022,Cherish Life,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",6
24 June 2023,Be careful when you make a deal with Death.,"Meet Joe Black (1998) -

With the exception of his appearance in the 'Transformers' franchise, you can't go wrong with Anthony Hopkins, who played the death stalked William Parrish, but as I started out with this film I felt that Brad Pitt was still somewhat finding his feet as an actor with his role of the titular Joe (The Grim Reaper's alias).

For me his diversity and improved acting abilities came a bit after 1998, although I did like his performance in 'Legends Of The Fall' (1994), also appearing alongside Mr. Hopkins and well worth watching.

In this film he seemed to be playing the same sort of Stoner/Dude character that he had played in 'Thelma And Louise' (1991), if perhaps a tad more child like.

I felt that a lot of his character and performance was akin to Macauley Culkin as Kevin in 'Home Alone' (1990) with his naïveté and with his confidence too and with hints of 'Forrest Gump's' (1994) social awkwardness as well. Throw in the fact that he was a bit like Tom Hanks' other character Josh from 'Big' (1988), a childish mind in an adult form and that strange connection with William/Bill's Daughter Susan (Claire Forlani) seemed even more inappropriate, as if she was kissing a child in a man's body, because it really did feel like that.

Perhaps it was just hard to believe that Death would be so clueless about the world? He seemed to know some things when the story required it, but was also completely clueless at other times as if to show the reasoning behind his visit to Bill and his/their (I'm not sure what gender Death goes by these days) need to learn.

I did like the fact that he always seemed to be eating, as Brad had also done a lot in his other films, especially 'Ocean's Eleven' (2001).

And as the story progressed I also found that I could appreciate his performance and character more. I realised that it can't have been easy to play a part that didn't have any real emotional ability or idea about the range of feelings available to him, which may have been what was missing earlier in the film as he started the exploration of the world and his new body, including the emotions that came with it.

I didn't think that Claire Forlani was the best actress. To start with, I quite liked that she was new to me and a different actor from the standard ladies that are usually selected for such roles, but her delivery got a bit corny as the film came to a point, although that may have been the script, which was a tad twee at times, but possibly needed to be for the subject it was covering.

I couldn't help but notice that it was the sort of story that Terry Pratchett might have written as part of his many tales about The Grim Reaper's attempts to know the real world better. Of course Terry's Discworld was a very different place to this films New York and Rhode Island settings.

It also reminded me of 'Sabrina' (1954) and I felt that it could have been a good vehicle for the likes of Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn or the others of that time, if it had been available to them.

There were also echoes of 'Heaven Can Wait' (1943) with its look at a potential entry to the afterlife, its conditions and rules, one way or another.

Initially I thought that the film was quite odd, I couldn't tell if it was a Comedy, Thriller or Horror film and the dinner conversation where Joe was still establishing what it was like to be human and basically everyone was already acting very strangely did not help to clarify that uncertainty. They also didn't seem to find Joe's lack of social etiquette that odd for most of it, which stretched belief a bit too much.

I also felt that Bill's acceptance of Joe's real persona was a bit too easily submitted. I might have wanted a little bit more proof that Joe was Death before allowing him to stay in my house and around my family.

The lighthearted treatment didn't totally match up with the more serious nature of the main subject matter. The juxtaposition of its humour and sobriety just didn't quite balance properly. It needed to be one way or the other.

And the filter that was used was too schmaltzy in my opinion.

It did get a bit more thoughtful as the event's developed, but I had expected most of them to happen.

In general though the storyline was very good, the idea and concept was quite clever, it was just some of the execution that I struggled with.

I wondered if it might have worked better if it had been filmed in a similar style to 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' (1993), because it had the same sort of tone and fantastic element. I could definitely see it working that way.

While it was a tad slow towards its finish, I did enjoy the pace of it, the chance for it to air itself properly and go gently towards the finale, with some lovely emotion.

I would definitely watch it again, because it was so simple to follow and intriguing, perhaps upon a second viewing I might appreciate it even more, because as I grew closer to the end of the film I really started to like it. It might be nice to see it without reviewing it at the same time.

13 June 2021,"""Love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without""","Meet Joe Black is a romantic fantasy movie directed by Martin Brest and stars Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani, Jake Weber, Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Tambor.

Death comes to earth in form of human to take back tycoon but falls in love with the younger daughter of the tycoon.

The outcome of any movie depends on how the movie is been made or how the plot of the movie is executed. We have seen many movies with a simple or predictable plot but with good execution the movie had turned out to be a great movie and and many movies with good and unique plot which turned out to be a bad movie due to poor execution. The concept and plot of the movie is very interesting and unique but also is been executed nicely. This is a very emotional and heart warming movie which will surely make you feel good.

Acting is superb and Anthony Hopkins had proves why is he being called a genius, he had played the character of a tycoon and father with utmost perfection. Brad Pitt was charming and suave, Claire Forlani was elegant and beautiful, Jeffrey Tambor was funny, Jake Weber and Marcia Gay Harden were effective and decent.

Screenplay of the movie was good and beautiful, some may complaint about the length and the movie is around there hours long but will not bore you and will keep you engaged. The climax of the movie is emotional, touching and bids a perfect farewell to the movie.

If you wanted to see a beautiful romantic movie then this is the movie for you. The movie will gives you a feel good and heart warming feel. A great movie to watch.",9
14 December 2021,Extraordinarily Beautiful Film,"Everything about this film is beautiful - the locations, the sets, the cast, the script, the acting, the musical score, and the message & sentiment. Brad Pitt does an incredible job of portraying his character with words, looks, facial expressions, body language and meaningful silence. The movie is 3 hours long, but it is well worth the time, and it doesn't seem that long as you are watching it. The only criticism I have is that Claire Forlani spent too much time looking down at the ground, and seeming too quiet and introverted. She's supposed to be a doctor, but seems much too meek.

10 November 1999,It could have been a good movie...,"This movie has great actors, looks good and is based on an interesting idea, unfortunately, that's not all it takes to make a good movie. The movie fails to go in depth on anything, one should think that with a movie lasting almost three hours you'd have plenty of time to do that. The characters in this movie are too superficial and death is too nice at best, personally I think he's ridiculous, he's romantisized to death. (Please excuse the pun, I couldn't help myself.) Also, I have to wonder how death,as he behaves like autistic person in periods of the movie, suddenly becomes quite brilliant and ""with it"" at the end. The movie doesn't really have a climax either, it's all very nice and predictable, very, very Hollywoodish. I gather this is a pure money making scheme and not made to upset anyone who is regarded as would be audience.

In short, a very lame movie unless you're hooked on love stories.

What on earth was the director even thinking. And dont get started on the ""on the nose"" dialogue throughout the movie, ""oh I can feel the love for you"" ""I like making love with you, do you like making love with me?"" Oh my God its confusing sometimes whether this is a parody or a real film. I was laughing hard at some of the acting and dialogue. There is bits and pieces which are good here and there and the movie could have been made better but it is what it is.

Were it shorter, it might be laughable as lunkhead pretty boy pitt, facile and shallow as ever is incredibly miscast as Death. Following lots of tense melodrama with Anthony Hopkins at his most vague, we wait hours for a plot to appear. Instead we get lots of gushing scenes with pitt looking as though he's just sustained a head injury and the dumb girl appearing to be in training for the crying olympics.

21 January 2013,Mirror and Razor,"""Meet Joe Black"" is very much like many of my favorite books. I can read them often and they lose no flavor; in fact, their characters and the stories woven about them seep deeper and deeper into my own life to the extent that fiction and non-fiction intermingle.

Anthony Hopkins, one of my favorite actors, again becomes the character, Magnate Bill Parrish. Hopkins again makes it seem as if every word emanating from his lips is newly-minted as if the struggles he is undergoing well up out of threat, terror, and Ozymandias-like success.

Claire Forlani truly seems to be the real daughter of this business titan; I believe it is her most convincing role to date.

Despite the fact that much of the movie's plot takes place in the rarefied atmosphere of the biggest business on the planet, in pressurized board rooms where the fate of lives and corporations are decided like a knife fight in an alley, I continue to find more and more to relate to in this movie over the years.

Thomas Newman's intriguing, ethereal musical motifs are like shadows of the characters and their tentative actions in a movie about people who illustrate, in a fresh manner, the cliché that money does not necessarily buy happiness; in fact, opulence makes life trickier.

This is especially a movie about fathers and daughters, about two very different kinds of beings who ingratiate themselves into the good graces of a father, with mixed results, because, ultimately, this movie is about various kinds of love and various kinds of life lessons.

Brad Pitt demonstrates that his earlier work in ""Interview with a Vampire"" was no fluke; Pitt earns my respect in a dual role, alternating from sympathetic and lovable to the obverse and then back again.

I think that ""Meet Joe Black"" is a film that acts as a mirror for my own life, forcing me to do quite a bit of personal self-reflection. The film also behaves very much like a razor: the dialog is sharp, cutting, peeling away layers of every character as powerful emotions buffet their lives, paring away all sorts of fronts, romantic, mercenary and societal.

Like some novels that I regard as old friends, stories I can savor and truly delve deeper into as I read them every year, I am a different person each time I watch ""Meet Joe Black."" The dialog, plot and all other elements never deviate, but I change as life buffets me, paring away my many fronts as I grow, learn and take risks.

This is an entertaining movie, but it is a very pensive film. The humor is very lightly ironical, but quite cerebral in the sense of discovering anew just what each of us truly wants in our lives, in our relationships, in our business deals and careers. The movie strongly investigates personal and professional legacies, ethics and morality.

Despite the high society backdrop, I found the story very much down-to-earth. The Seven Deadly Sins and the Seven Heavenly Virtues do not budge simply because the personages who grapple with and adopt these values are rich, spoiled, guileless, unaffected, or effete. This is a good people movie, especially in terms of very deep questions such as ""Who am I?"" ""Who do I truly wish to be?"" ""What do I really want from love and life?"" ""Meet Joe Black"" is a movie that touched me at first viewing; and each time I watch it, it gets to me, down deep.

Each of us has his or her own definition of entertainment. This will not be everyone's cup of tea. Hopkins, Pitt and Forlani fans may enjoy the manner in which the script opens each actor. I can imagine each of them reading the script for the first time. I can imagine Hopkins reading it and deciding that the script would provoke from him a different set of subtle emotions, gestures and interactions in a different set of unique relationships.

Like a razor, the movie shaves life very close. Tomorrow and next year, I will need another shave, but the feel of the blade strikes me as quite different at 67 than it did 15 years ago when the movie came out. The film is also like a mirror, in that I find much in my own existence to think about and weigh in terms of happiness, success, expedience versus making truly authentic choices in life.",9
13 September 2003,Awful,"This film is rubbish, utter rubbish. As for Hopkins I must be missing something, to me he is an awful actor, constantly playing the same role, in this and films like The Edge, OK he was the second best Hannibal Lector but that was 12 years ago, he's a rubbishy Welsh actor in my opinion. As for Brad Pitt, well I'm neither female or under 14 so of course i realise he can only play two roles, sub Jack Nicholson mad or boringly bland, in the latter he's probably just playing himself. Claire Forlani is beautiful but I'm never seen anyone overact so much since that actress who played Sue Ellen in Dallas. To think this director made Beverly Hills Cop and Midnight Run, looks like he has disappeared up his own ****.

12 March 2001,Wow!!!,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",10
26 November 2015,"A thoughtful, wonderful mixture of comedy, romance and drama despite what my husband thinks","I originally saw this in the theatre with my husband who fidgeted and laughed his way through it. He absolutely hated it, let everyone know it and talked about what a terrible movie it was for years afterwards. I didn't dislike it then and in re-watching it (by myself) now I really liked and appreciated it. Sure it's too long, with so many scenes stretched out that it could easily have been pared back to a 2 hour viewing time but the story itself about family and the meaning of love, about discovery, seizing the day and sacrifice is just beautiful.

The plot is intriguing and has apparently been done before in 'Death Takes A Holiday' which might explain why this had such an old fashioned feel to it, style, music and even dialogue. It follows the grim reaper, who comes to earth to retrieve a media tycoon shortly before his 65th birthday, but agrees to grant him a little more time if the mogul will teach him about life. In the process he falls in love with his guide's daughter.

Stand out performances from everyone involved, I love watching Anthony Hopkins & Brad Pitt together on screen (Legends Of The Fall) they have fantastic chemistry and once again Pitt is almost too good looking here. Excellent back up cast too, Claire Forlani as the love interest is lovely in a simple trusting way, Marcia Gay Harden, trying to get her father to notice her and I loved Jeffrey Tambor's character Quince, such a nice man. As Joe Black says ""one of my favourites."" The character of Black must have been a hard one to play and I'm not sure Pitt ever quite got it right, he just felt awkward at times in his wide eyed, robotic and childlike portrayal, in his discovery of life's pleasures and quest for more peanut butter. I will say he provided one of the most ...interesting love scenes I've witnessed on screen, watching death get it on, feeling things for the first time. Oh my! Ultimately a thoughtful, wonderful mixture of comedy, romance and drama that left me thinking about it for days afterwards. 7/27/15",9
11 June 2003,"As opposed to other reviews I've read, I truly liked this movie...","Um, a lot of people seem to dislike this film, but I can't agree on any point with them... I think this movie tells the audience that there can also be love stories that don't have the familiar 'Oooooooooh, it's again a superhappy-ending and everything just went the way I wanted it to, jeeeej'-feeling at the end. I'm not going to tell anything about the final scene of the movie because I don't want to spoil anything for the people that would decide to see it. Pitt acts quite convincingly to me (he plays Death, who took over somebody's body, it's normal that he acts weird as he doesn't even know how to sit down on a chair...) I just find this movie a welcome change in the romantic hollywood moviescene. I'd recommend it to everyone who wants to see a film that touches you and can keep you interested for 3 hours long! My two cents

28 May 2008,Amazing and Unique!!!,"This film is a pleasure to watch, I have done so more than once. The acting is superb and the plot thought provoking. What really stands out is the dialog which is several notches above the usual drivel that comes out of Hollywood. Very quickly you come to like and care about the characters in this film and by the end of this film it is very hard not to get weepy eyed. I have never really noticed that this movie is long and I don't think it is possible to cut any parts out without losing something important. Very few films have profound things to say besides being entertaining, this is one of them. The low rating on this site is reflective of the problem with society today, we have to many people who require special effects, several dead mutilated bodies, car chases, graphic sex, and foul language throughout before they can enjoy a movie. They then rate this movie based on the lack of the things I just listed.

20 November 2007,Anthony Hopkins excels....once again,"I admit the film is a bit over drawn and there are a few blank moments. However, the performance of Mr. Hopkins adds his charisma and cadence, as when he realizes he is facing his own death, and remembers his deceased wife from twenty years earlier.

Brad Pitt is surprisingly good as 'Death' (Joe Black). Reminiscent of ""Death Takes a Holiday"" (Gig Young, circa 1965). A beautiful looking man who brings the ultimate horror to us all. It is not a complex plot and has been done.

There are, however, some nuances as the relationship between Marcia Gay Harden, the less favored daughter and Hopkins, a media magnate who is preparing for his final birthday. There are several clichés, but the visuals and performances by Hopkins and Pitt somewhat transcend this.

Occasionally, over-analyzing a film cannot garner further knowledge, accept it at face value and enjoy. It is, after all, only a movie, not a play.

8/10.",8
14 July 2020,Charming!,"Amazing acting, wonderful story, exciting characters. Film captures a profound message about life and death. All around excellent movie!

Somehow I managed to pay attention to the dialog that took place in the setting of corporate business environment. Very often in movies I would skip pieces and wonder away in my own mind at moments like those, but the unique characters really kept me captivated and focused which let me enjoy the funny bits and pieces that otherwise would have been many times missed.

23 March 2000,Deadly Dull,"Incredibly long, extremely slow-moving version of the much-better 'Death Takes a Holiday' (the plots are virtually identical despite the fact that they were made some 60 odd years apart). Pitt once again proves that he's in a dead-heat with Keanu Reeves for the worst, most overpaid actor of all time. Hopefully Hopkins just did it for the money, though his acting skills are also a bit overpaid and overrated. As creaky as the original is by today's standards, at least it told the same story in half the time! Oh, another 90's drawback: much of the dialogue between Pitt and his leading lady is inaudible. This is someone's idea of good acting? They should be forced to work in a theatre where people will walk out if they can't hear the actors!

28 March 2004,"A bit too long, but a fine movie anyway","'Meet Joe Black' is a movie that could raise a lot of questions and a lesser movie probably would have. Here I accepted what the movie was telling me and I enjoyed the story, Anthony Hopkins and the charm of Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani.

A guy (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Claire Forlani) meet, flirt, probably fall in love and both go their own ways. The guy is hit by a car and Death takes his body to find out more about life. You hear me right, Death itself looks like Brad Pitt and he visits Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) to tell him he is going to die. Bill must show the life on earth to Death, who is introduced by Parrish as Joe Black, and in return Bill can live longer. Bill is a very rich guy, loved and respected by almost every other person in the movie, and it happens to be that Susan turns out to be his daughter. Of course Joe Black is not the guy she met that same morning, and although she notices strange things, they do fall in love. Death falls in love with a human being, but I didn't ask any questions.

There is another story. Bill, the rich dying man, is in the middle of a deal concerning his own company. He has to take Joe everywhere so people start getting suspicious and in this way the movie creates a real villain since Pitt can't be it. This story was not really necessary but it makes sure we know how to feel about every character.

Like I said, this movie has some things that make sure it works. The story is sweet with a good heart, probably stupid in a way, but we don't need to care. I didn't even want to. Hopkins is great, like almost always, and especially the way he speaks adds something to his perfect performance. Pitt shows why he is such a popular guy and may be it is true that his performance is a little overdone at times, he seems too aware of who he really represents, his charm pulls him through. Especially in the scenes together with Forlani, who is at least as charming, Pitt finds the right note for his character. The last thing I want to say is that the movie is a little too long. I wasn't bored once but I realized some scenes were not necessary, especially near the final moments. I was able to not be bothered by this, and I guess you can do the same.",8
27 July 2003,my dad liked it,"and he always says he watched so many movies in his life, that all he cares about movies right now is pure action. i think that says a lot about the movie.

and i, of course, liked the movie too! it was definitely well made, and had a special place in my heart for the few moments after it ended.

very romantic, and yet suspenseful and dark. umm... a mark? 5 out of 5, because it's worth your time.

30 June 2006,death wants to sample the life prior to taking William Parrish,"This is one of the most under rated films of all time. For those who have never contemplated the ""Final Question"" (is this it?) you are missing a treat. Anthony Hopkins is cast as the ageing mogul William Parrish who is starting to experience the first signs of death. Tightness in the chest, inner voice asking the final question.. Is this it? YESSSSSSS whispers death (Brad Pitt).

Pitt's character then falls in love with Parrishes daughter over a chance meeting in a coffee shop only for ""Death to take his human form after a horrendous knock down scene. Pitt's character is thrown feet in the air and hit by two cars in a truly shocking cinema moment.

This film does rattle on but will keep all viewers entertained with the sub plots.

31 March 2002,A True Classic!,"This is one of my all-time favorites. A true Motion Picture

Masterpiece! Sure it didn't do well, and most everyone seems to not care for it too much, but my explanation to this is that it just wasn't the time for it. What I mean by that is that if this movie would have been released back in the 50's, it would have been a smash!

It is very deep and deals with lots of emotions and interactions of people. This Movie has a heart, and every time I watch it I get inspired.

It is a true masterpiece in writing, directing, cinematography, and acting. A remake of the 1938 Motion Picture, Death takes a Holiday, the script is outstanding. I give Martin Breast full stars for undertaking the challenge of this script, and he definitely succeeded. Emanuel Lubezki delivers amazing images (I love the images of the coffee shop). The Acting is incredible. Brad Pitt practically delivers two characters, Claire Forlani is breathtaking, and Anthony Hopkins is out of this world.

This Movie is a true Classic!",10
29 March 2020,Horribly written film with no focus,"Great acting can't save a poorly written story. The worst part of the film was the long drawn out ridiculous love story. Too many stories were jammed into a story that didn't have any continuity which led me to not care and just want the story to end. Then after 3 hours the ending was horrible. Don't waste your time on this poorly written film. Another annoying part was how the lead actress was supposed to be a doctor but was demure and clueless in every other part of her life. Give me a break!

21 August 2015,Neat Joe Black,"Lets face it, Brad Pitt is easy on the eyes and ears and when you can catch Anthony Hopkins too, its a watcher! The premise is good as well as the story too. The pacing is deliberately slowed down because it is connected to the storyline which is death. Don't ask too many questions on the movie itself when it is over because it may go into places where there are little or no answers. It is fantasy entertainment and delights the viewer allowing one to escape. Isn't that what we pay for? Good supporting actors as well. There is humor on nothing less than the subject of death and taxes which I found cute and appropriate for the movie. Light snack recommended, tasty drink and watching with someone else will enhance the discussion potentials afterwards should you decide to go there. Enjoy

7 February 2009,Great acting hampered by terrible pacing,"It's amazing that Brad Pitt, even at this young age, could hold his own with Anthony Hopkins. The fact that they make a great team is even more impressive.

While Hopkins plays a pretty standard ""60-something businessman,"" Pitt plays death itself. This film presents a more intimate view of Death's trying to understand Life than the old flick ""Death Takes a Holiday,"" so we see Death try to understand things at a very personal level. Pitt is perfect in the role, showing a charming innocence along with the necessary amount of gravitas.

But the picture is severely hampered by its pace, which borders on the Jurassic (the epoch, not the epic, Jurassic). If this had been edited much more tightly, we'd move briskly through a beguiling and thought-provoking story. Instead we're treated to affected dialogue (which the actors valiantly try to overcome) and tediously long takes that give us plenty of time to lose interest.

Kudos to Hopkins and Pitt; onions to the director.",3

2 January 2002,"Emotional, human and perfectly acted.","I was not intending to see this film at all as the reviews I saw/received were not glowing and it looked extremely boring, as well as long.

I happened to see all but the first hour tonight (yes, it is long) and I must see the beginning. Perhaps I will see all of it when I am next with my closest loverd-one. It's how this film is.

Although the ending left me feeling as though we needed to see more, perhaps we didn't. We know what happened - although the emotion may have needed turning around.

It is a very emotional film and although there are parts I would have liked to have seen included it is such that you feel absolutely connected with the characters - even without ever having known their kind of life.

Every actor/ess is perfect and the cast could not have been better. Anthony Hopkins is, as always, genius. Even the supporting members were perfect.

29 December 2005,Death has never been sexier,"I was never a Brad Pitt fan until this movie. He truly makes you fall in love with Death. Pitt gives Death an innocence that draws you in. One think of Death as a worldly being but we find that he has never experienced many things that humans take for granted. Things like love, security and friendship. St first he comes off as heartless having killed a young man for his body. He is uncaring in his first approach to Mr. Parrish, allowing him to fell the pain will come with is death. Then we see his kindness in the hospital when he talks to the elderly black woman and calm her fears. He learns why humans risk everything for just a little more time with those they love.

My favorite scene is when Black enters the kitchen look for a snack. He is offered some peanut butter and he asks for it on ""just a spoon"". I've never found peanut butter sexier. You can't help but grin as he asks for peanut butter while at a fancy dinner, once again stating ""just a spoon"".

Enough about Death. Hopkins as a man who knows his time has come is outstanding, as Mr. Hopkins always is (has he ever made a bad movie?) I did find Claire Forlani's portrayal of Susan Parrish was a bit off. I think she was trying to mimic the innocence in Pitts character but it lacked something. I really haven't been able to put my on it but it just doesn't play right opposite such great performances.",10
11 February 1999,The Worst Film of 1998,"Though among 1998's movies were quite a bunch of doozies, the decidingly dudly and deadly doozie is Meet Joe Black. A film of immense inanity, Meet Joe Black contains one of the worst performances of the year (model/dilettante Claire Fontani) and one of the most embarrassing (Anthony Hopkins -- after starring in a film this bad, I would never act again too.) The only performance that stings me with regret for giving the movie a rating of 1 is Marcia Gay Harden's. Her scene with Anthony near the end of Meet Overwrought Opus when she tells him that she knows he doesn't love her as much as his other daughter (Claire Fontani -- As If!) is heartbreaking and the only scene with genuine emotion. I won't even discuss Martin Brest's style and technique as a director because all that comes to mind is ""Hack, Hack, Hack.""

11 November 2003,Orchestral emotion,"The critics never gave this a film a good start in life. Bring together Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt in the same film on one occassion, Legends of the Fall and the magic works, try the same again and you may think it can't work as well. Meet Joe Black rises above it all, as it takes flight with the innocence of a wandering spirit, whose only task in eternity, is to take a life to the next place. Moving into the bodily form of an unknowing participant (Brad Pitt) named only as Joe Black, he spends a holiday in the presence of a wealthy man of stature and decadence, William Parrish (Hopkins), delivering heart warming charm and wit, as he falls in love with Susan (Claire Forlani) the daughter of William Parrish. His main task, to take his host to the next place once his holiday has concluded.

Experience this movie, don't simply watch it, from the charm of all the charcters to the heart pounding orchestrations at the end, when Joe knows his time is over.

Believe me when I say, you will feel this movie.",10
14 February 2014,It goes by in a blink,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",7

It was off to a rocky start but within the first 30 minutes, I was hooked. Bradd Pitt has his own charm and talent to drive the film. Anthony Hopkins also does an incredible job.

9/10. It has it's issues, but its amazing- regardless.

16 September 2018,"An underrated fairytale, perfect date movie","Who knows if Harvey Weinstein, from whom Carly Forlani has said she had escaped five times, had anything to do with the bad critical reviews this movie received. It was a bit of a box office bomb, so it took me two full decades to catch it. I wish I had seen it sooner.

This movie is epic. Watch it again, and a comment one of the daughters says at the beginning will make more sense. It's unrealistic in the way that truly grand tales are--if a woman meets a man in real life who forgets who he is, it's not a turn-on, but it is different when it happens to someone in a fairy tale. But this story is set in the real world, and so for the romantics among us, it represents something bigger than this world.

The length of the movie may discourage some, but this is a real story, and all stories don't come neatly packaged in 90 minutes. The B-story works too, until the very end, but that is the only reason I took a star off. It doesn't matter though. This is a love story of father and daughters, of love lost, of new love, of love regained.",9

19 December 2000,looks great.,"Well, hell this movie does look great. It has Dante Ferretti(Casino)'s production design, and Emmanuel Lubezki(Sleepy Hollow)'s gorgeous cinematography. But there is one problem that gets in the way of making this a good movie. Martin Brest's case of Kevin Costner-itis(The film runs for 3 hours) and it went through Ron Osborn and Jeff Reno(big mistake, writers of Radioland Murders). It should have just stayed with Kevin Wade(Working Girl) and Bo Goldman(Scent of a Woman). Another thing I would have done if I were Martin Brest is, he used two editors, His editor, Michael Tronick(Scent of a Woman) and Joe Hutshing(Jerry Maguire), to liven up the pace, I would have had the film re-chopped by the best editor on the planet, pace-jumper John Woo-editor Christian Wagner(Face/Off). The story is about Death who goes to take Anthony Hopkins, and oh, yeah, his daughter is one of the best looking things ever displayed on celluloid. So, he chills on earth, with Anthony Hopkins, and he shows him around. This movie is a great movie to look at, and considering Brad Pitt is one of my very favorite actors(I am a 15 year old male, who is heterosexual). This movie is not bad, just needs trimming. Great to look at. Rated PG-13(for thematic elements, language, and a sex-scene that will let you get a good night's sleep, trust me :-)",10
23 July 2005,This is a great film,"I really like this film and think it is grossly underrated and wrongly criticised for being too long. The people who level this criticism obviously have no idea about films that take their time, which when done properly reward the viewer much more richly than any MTV goldfish attention span MTV Hollywood-twee twaddle ever could. Claire Forlani has to be one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen and Brad Pitt is a much better actor than he is given credit for and the emotion that sparks between them is spell-binding. Hopkins, as always, applies his reliable safe pair of hands to the script and the score is also terrifically evocative. So if you're not a goldfish give this one a go, I think you'll like it.

13 December 2001,Let the feelings fairly rule the world!,"The Best: Among all the movie is hard to pin point a better part, as the movies better part is its whole! The Worst: The runtime of the movie may have been boring to some people, not to me, anyway. Rating: 8 /10

One nice morning multi-millionaire Bill Parrish wakes up in his New York's surroundings manor aware of the voices he said he heard during the last night. Bill Parrish holds in his hands the possible future of his company Parrish Communications with his follower Drew possible fiancé to his daughter Susan. Susan, fresh woman at an hospital, routinely heads to the coffee shop where she usually has her breakfast, and there she meets the man who can possibly change her life forever, as for Bill, his head his in a weird place right now, not only he's nervous about the deal as for the upcoming 65 anniversary party. The voice Bill heard that night constantly hits him and speaks with him coldly and scarily, until one night at dinner the voice says it is on the door of his house waiting for some one to get him in. when he orders the maid to let the person in and join him to dinner, Susan gets in instantly gets in and gets in shock realizing the mystery man is the young man at the coffee shop.

This is the square one to a movie with several twists emotions and commotion. There's one thing that really may step the movie's promotion behind, and that's the point that common sense may think that the movie has some supernatural nature. It doesn't, the movie has its fantasy, but this isn't one of those movies that in the final 10 minutes has a completely CGI monster threatening to kill all mankind.

Plunge in to this movie where everything in it is over the top, but the dark line is that, in my opinion the movie isn't one of those that can be chosen as the all time favorite of anyone. The script is inventive and deep, and the choose for directing was a nice touch Martin Brest was a director that in common opinion wouldn't have been a possible choice but as it was I stand correctly has his work is after all appraisable. On close inspection, for instance you can see there is no actual goof of any kind. Brad Pitt is actually revealing himself as a versatile actor, but still many people associate his name to teenager fan hysteria. Anthony Hopkins once more gives a show of acting, his calm and bland acting is always a joy to watch, (maybe) newcomer Claire Forlani is not only a beauty face but a beauty talent. Emmanuel Lubezki, cinematography did an awesome job and most incredibly (it wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award!), and composer Thomas Newman, well I have loss for words for his incredible job, (my sister cries every time she sees the movie in its final half hour).

Too bad that Hollywood doesn't present us with movies like this every year! 8 out of 10.",8
20 September 2000,Too Many Cooks Spoiled the Broth,"A beautiful film, at times. Director Martin Brest hit his stride with ""Scent of a Woman,"" and that style is evidenced here-- the scene when the young Ms. Parrish meets the Man in the Coffee shop, at the beginning, is a truly beautiful scene, and it is moments like this that the director, and the film, thrive upon.

The moment immediately after it, coupled with the ending of the film, simply do not gel. Without giving the ending away, there was simply no thought put into it. Every individual moment in the film works superbly on its own terms, but as a whole, the film fails. This can only be the fault of *SEVEN* credited screenwriters, four people trying to update a screenplay written by two people, working from a play written by a single man. Hollywood overkill in its purest form.

This film was great, almost. One more rewrite and it could have been there, it's a pity this version got made. It's like a really beautiful sports car, excellent interior, exterior, sound system, but it's missing a radio. You can enjoy it on so many levels, but it really feels like it's missing something.

7/10, and a wish that Brest reads his next script before he shoots it.",7
22 March 2002,A must-see for all those who like unusual movies.,"""Meet Joe Black"" is a movie that grabs my attention from beginning to end. Not only is the acting wonderful for both Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins, but the truths taught through their relationship are profound. A warning that some may not understand this movie, but for those of us who do, it is an intricately well-done movie.

23 July 2005,Meet Joe Black but of course we don't,"So much more could have been made out of this script as the denouement is weak in extremis and the ending simply doesn't hold together but if I explained why I might spoil what was still a thoroughly enjoyable film. But then I think that Brad Pitt was totally miscast as Death - a Roger Black but not as tall but with more acting experience. I would have preferred a version of Death closer to that in the Grolsch Advert and certainly black but then he would have had to be Mr White would't he ? And the ""speaking in tongues"" would have been both more authentic and relevant. Anthony Hopkins gave yet another thoroughly warm and dignified performance and Ms Forlani really did look love struck but the whole saving the family company bit didn't work nearly as well as in ""Pretty Woman"". All in all a good effort but perhaps a wasted opportunity but well worth seeing to make up your own mind.

8 March 2004,Martin Brest is on fire!,"Not having worked on the picture or participated in any form of the production, I can only wonder what went wrong with 1998's MEET JOE BLACK.

For me, the questions start with Pitt.

Why did he take on that dull persona I wonder? Why did he insist on playing death like a dolt? Also, why did he have that high lighted sunshine-puff-puff doo?

He injured the movie with blank looks and a lifeless stupidity, while giving his love interest (played by the delicious Claire Forlani) absolutely no reason to desire him.

Director Martin Brest (who suffered immensely at the hands of GIGLI) should have known that his lead actor would be box office poison. As kind as genetics have been to Pitt, they have not endowed him the ability to portray the surreal. Therefore, I would have suggested Jim ""The Jesus"" Caviezal for the coveted part of Joseph Black. In addition, I would have held back on the whispering voice overs that appeared more like severe editing errors than the magical messages they were intended to be. In addition, I might have rewritten the script, told Hopkins that Don Sutherland was getting the father role, and asked Claire Forlani to marry me. But, as we all know, that would require a time machine and some Hollywood connections--two things which I don't have.",
29 January 1999,some good points but way too long,"Overall I agreed with many of the reviews I have read - this film was way too long. Maybe the directors were trying to get across some deep and meaningful thoughts which required length, but the plot and stereotypical characters ruined any effect for me.

William Parrish is a successful, popular, clever guy who everyone likes and so in Hollywood style, has to be about to see his life's work destroyed by some young hot-shot. Of course, he's not quite perfect, preferring his younger, intelligent and fairly pretty daughter over her sister. For me, the best character was the Jamaican woman although she only appears briefly.

Death taking over a human body was interesting to watch and Brad Pitt did do well in this role, giving Death the appearance of knowing language but learning to control a human body. Maybe the thought of Death being human with human emotions just unnerves me a little, but a Death which learns to be a

good guy whilst on earth and fall in love just doesn't seem real to me. And if Death exists outside of time, why worry about taking Susan Parrish with him - she'll be dead herself in the blink of an eyelid?

Verdict: save your 5 quid (and back from those cinema seats) and rent this on video when there's nothing on tele. Or even save that and wait for it to be shown on TV. This also has the advantage of the bathroom being close by!",6
21 February 2006,one of the most under-rated movies i have seen,"I read some the user comments on plot loopholes and idiosyncrasies but you you should watch this movie and learn the lessons of life. I was really taken by the performances of Hopkins and Forlani with the father/daughter relationship. I fell in love with Claire Forlani when i saw her in this movie. She had an ethereal quality that really was the key and brought the film to another level. She was very well cast. It is difficult to imagine someone else in the part after seeing her.

The cast did a great job of making you feel for them even though they are rich and pampered - that is no small task. What can you say about Anthony Hopkins. He is more believable as a most respected , heavyweight CEO who has lived a meaningful and honorable life than any you will ever meet in real life. The stars of this movie are Anthony and Claire plain and simple. Excellent writing and casting If you don't appreciate this movie I feel that you probably have not experienced real life yet.

27 September 2000,A BITTER-SWEET ROMANTIC TALE,"Engrossing story retelling of DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY, which examines life, our relationships with other people, our principles and our ultimate mortal destiny. This much maligned movie deserved better.

MEET JOE BLACK has its flaws, yet is a captivating story. The performances were solid, without the over use of special effects to carry the picture along. Unabashedly sentimental and romantic, this movie should please those in a romantic mood.

18 March 2002,For those who appreciate beauty over technicality,"Meet Joe Black is a great film. It's way up there in my all time favourites. Never have I seen a film deal with death and love in such a beautiful tender way. The running time allows the film to move at a steady pace, not rushing itself for the sake of those with short concentration spans. Infact the running length is indicative of the entire film for me.

It seeks not to conform but to draw you in. It gives you space and time to watch the characters develop, to show depths and aspects (especially with Pitt) that help you appreciate what is happening. Hopkins is on form here - he leaps on Parrish with passion and takes the dialogue to a level far beyond it's worth on paper. Pitt is also convincing and Forlani is superb.

Much work has gone into this film and I believe it shows. It moves me to tears each time I watch it. It's not perfect - the pay-off towards the end as Pitt reveals himself is disappointing and could have been better executed - but this is secondary to what the film is really dealing with. The core issues of a man coming to terms with a life about to end, the wonder of whether Forlani really did grasp what was happening and more captivated me.

Please do ignore those who whine about having to sit more then two hours to watch a film. This is simply a wonderful film and well worth your time to watch. Just have a box of tissues ready.",10
4 January 2002,Enjoyable and done well,"""Meet Joe Black"" tales the story of how Death fell in love... Well I'd give it marks for an original premise (if it wasn't a re-make). I have never seen the original so I can comment only on this.

In it's favour: A fine performance by Anthony Hopkins as William Parrish, a man who is forced to humour Death's ""holiday"" in return for a few more days on Earth. The directing is generally finely handled by Martin Brest as it is able to observe the grandoise life Parrish has built up for him and yet also convey some of the intimacy that develops between Brad Pitt's character of Joe Black and Claire Forlani's Susan Parrish. He also manages to keep the tale evenly paced so there is no sense of any scene being rushed to force it to a climax (though this will detract some people from the movie). The score is - for the large part - nicely observed and complements the scene at hand.

Against it: Brad Pitt generally gives a fine performance as the eponymous Joe Black but at times it's hard to see the passion of love in him. While the musical score was generally good it most certainly grated at the end of the movie falling prey to Hollywood's incessant need to constantly swell the music to match some climatic event. And of course there's the arguable length of the movie - the movie doesn't drag and I was never bored by it but, at the same time, it might have benefited by some pruning in certain areas.

Overall it's a good movie. It's no classic and the ending to the movie is no surprise (though it's not meant to be particularly). It's leisurely and does not rush itself. Ultimately forgettable and a piece of well done visual candy but there's nothing wrong with that. One to catch if you can.",
17 May 2010,A strangely fascinating film,"Every time this film comes on I watch it...not because I really want to. But, for some reason, I just can not help myself. It's like not being able to take stop stealing glances at a beautiful woman you see on a bus.

I read many of the reviews above and I am taken by how long they are. People are wanting to tell how much this film touched them in a place that is both tender and worrisome. We must all face death eventually. We don't know what that will be like...probably not nearly as traumatic as our birth was. But, we like to imagine we can somehow deal with it....that is, to face it, accept it and then be able to look back over our days and hope we see something there worth leaving behind...that we regret leaving behind as much as Joe and William do. We end up envying them rather than feeling sorry for them. ""Meet Joe Black"" is that imaginary inevitable moment in color.

I don't think the film is that good in any one specific thing. It is great, though, when all the parts are assembled. It lingers too long...wanting the audience to dread the leaving of it...as the actors do as they portray the characters, savoring, enjoying the last slowly vanishing morsel of flavor from that favorite dish...like lovers tasting and holding and feeling and smelling each other for the last time before a long time apart...like watching the last sunset from the front porch of your home before leaving it for the last time.

Yet...in spite of the flaws....the long facials, the continual lingering of it all...I simply can never get this film to leave me alone when it is on. I just have to watch it.",8
5 October 2008,Chick Flick it is NOT!!!!!!!!,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",10
20 June 2021,If Tommy Wiseau Had a Budget,"I've somehow avoided seeing Meet Joe Black since it came out almost 25 years ago, having heard whispers of its poor quality. Last night found me couch-bound with a bad hangover and no internet connection, so I strapped myself in and watched it start to finish with an open mind in spite of its reputation when I saw it was on TV.

It's laugh-out-loud bad. It's as bad as everyone says and maybe even a little worse. It's so bad it feels like a movie Tommy Wiseau might have made if he had access to a real budget and Hollywood A-listers.

Where do I even start?

Brad Pitt doing Jamaican patois in *multiple* scenes that are meant to be touching and not screamingly funny? (I literally screamed out loud with laughter the first time he goes into it)

Claire Forlani's terrible, completely unrealistic acting? The audience is supposed to believe her character fell in love with a complete stranger over the course of a stilted, bizarre encounter at a coffee shop? And then fell out and back in love with him all over again when he shows up at her family dinner acting like he's had a frontal lobotomy? It's one of the least convincing love stories ever portrayed, and probably 75% of it falls on her shoulders.

Brad Pitt veering all over the place tonally with the character of Joe Black? One minute he's like a stoned version of Rainman, eating spoonfuls of peanut butter and interacting with people like he was raised by wolves, the next he's cracking jokes about the IRS and giving stern lectures on business ethics. It's extremely embarrassing to watch and I have to imagine he disowns this movie completely.

What else?

Jeffery Tambor looking like an alternate universe Dr. Phil, and uttering weird non sequiturs like, ""I love little girls""

Marcia Gay Harden as the whiny, 2nd best daughter who just wants her father have a happy birthday despite the fact he's completely uninterested and obviously extremely distracted by all the crazy events happening in his life

It's all just so, so bad.

As other reviews have pointed out, this has no less than *6* people credited for its screenplay. You feel the ""too many cooks in the kitchen"" vibe very deeply and that this was no one's vision as it swerves around trying to wax poetic about love and death, failing to make us care about any of the characters along the way.

Anthony Hopkins gives this movie way more than it deserves, and the only moments of quality come from him.

The end result is a very, very bizarre and unintentionally hilarious movie in which most of the characters' interactions with each other feel extremely unnatural. Imagine what your own family's reaction would be if your elderly father brought home a bleach blonde stud who acted autistic and spent every waking minute with him, explaining none of it. Then compare it to this movie.

If someone gave Tommy Wiseau the directive to combine Ghost and It's a Wonderful Life, this would be the end result.

Watch it for a laugh.",2

17 April 2000,The Reason Why Movements Such as the New Wave Came About,"Directed by Martin Brest, of Beverly Hills Cop and Scent of a Woman fame, this overlong and typically Hollywood remake of the 1930's classic, Death Takes A Holiday, casts Brad Pitt as a boyish Death wishing to experience life as humans do. He 'takes' the body of a charming young man whom charmed Claire Forlani (Hopkins doctor daughter) in a coffee shop. He then calls upon billionaire media mongol Anthony Hopkins, a paradoxically wise, kind, old-fashioned elderly man whose 'time is almost up' and makes a deal with him: Hopkins is to show him the world as humans see and experience it, and Pitt will extend Hopkins life. All that follow is predictable: Pitt and Forlani fall for each other all over again, and Hopkins teaches Pitt a thing or two about life.

Disappointing is perhaps one way to sum up Meet Joe Black. The story offers a great deal of potential and the director was clearly given more than enough resources to bring it to life. Despite this, the film feels static and overlong (the last hour in particular would have to be one of the most agonisingly frustrating and predictable pieces of cinema in history). You can literally see the dust floating past the characters in several scenes. Also, whatever message the film is trying to present (assuming that it is trying to present one at all) is so strongly diluted by contradictory statements. Messages of pro-euthanasia are nestled amongst those of patriarchy. Also, Pitt announces that 'Money can't buy you happiness', though it certainly appears that for Hopkins it did. Meet Joe Black is not all failure, production-wise the movie is scrumptious. In the end, however, Meet Joe Black proves even to itself that it is mere Hollywood candy: all style and no substance, leaving the audience teased and uninspired.",
23 November 1999,"Very good film, but did they really need three hours?","""Meet Joe Black""... Well... What can I say about it? A beautiful movie, a wonderful story, good acting, good direction... This could have been an excellent film, but there is a problem- it is too long, and without a reason. I liked the film and I really recommend it, but two hours were good enough for this one. Fortunately, there are many good things on ""MJB"" and it didn't happen the same thing of ""The Horse Whisperer"" (three hours, bad story, bad acting, tedious).

The story is about the millionaire William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), who is about to die. The Death, or Joe Black (Brad Pitt), makes a proposition for William - if he shows Joe the life in Earth, he will not die soon. However, Joe falls in love with Susan Parrish (Claire Forlani), William's daughter, and then everything takes another way.

It looks like a little strange and nonsense, but it's not. It is a beautiful film that, even with some defects, is a worth-seeing.",4
19 November 2009,Compelling beautiful movie with delightful dialog to enchant you,"The first time I saw this movie was on its opening weekend in the US. I was taking my soon to be girlfriend (and later to be ex-girlfriend) to our first date. Naturally you can guess, being a guy I wasn't the one who picked this particular movie to watch. Yet after the first few scenes I was drawn in.

The thoughtful, almost classic literature-like dialog all throughout this movie simply make it a masterpiece. The cast are the key in any such film, and everybody delivers here, especially Anthony Hopkins. The characters truly interact with each other, and you never feel like you've lost a step, you never think that the feelings portrayed are not credible.

The story is endearing, it has a few funny dark comedy moments, but most of all it simply gives an overall good feeling to the viewer. I've read some negative comments regarding the length, all I can tell you is, until I read the comments I never even realized it is three hours long. I had to check the box of my DVD to confirm that it is indeed of the said length.

I also can not finish this comment without giving some extra love for the performance of Jeffrey Tambor (as Quince). He nailed the role down to the last twitch of the thumb. The klutz loving husband who has always got the side of his wife and his family is absolutely the most lovable character of the movie, and everyone understands that he would even be one of ""death's favorites"". An absolute must see movie.

PS: On a side note I would like to mention that this movie has to be watched in the original English speaking version. I have seen it in both Hungarian and French dubs and neither did the amazing dialog any justice.",9
14 October 2022,Stunning Film,"I'm continually uncovering layers of beauty the more I contemplate what a gorgeous and intimate piece of storytelling this is. Exceptional concept, story, writing, and execution. And utterly brilliant and immersive performances. And all of it wound and bound together by the phenomenal and touching work of Thomas Newman and his beautiful music. I cannot believe I have not yet discovered this movie but I also feel that it came to me precisely when it was meant to. All I can say, as corny and overused a phrase as this may be in such a context, is: thank you. This movie has sunk deep into my heart the way few films have. Bravo.

31 August 2023,Tony is great. The idea is great. But ...,"The way things wrap up at the end is a bit of a problem. They didn't really explain it well or handle it logically, so it leaves us feeling unsatisfied and like something's missing.

Brad Pitt totally nails it as Joe Black, giving a performance that's full of layers. He captures the character's curiosity and innocence while trying to figure out all the complicated stuff about human feelings and connections.

And let's talk about Anthony Hopkins - that old man is a total legend, no question about it. He really brings some serious weight to the movie as William Parrish, juggling business and family stuff right in his final days of life. His acting really hits you in the emotions and gives the character a ton of depth.

""Meet Joe Black"" really gets into some deep stuff about life and death, love, and what it all means. It's like a nudge to the audience, making us think about how important those little moments in life are, even though they pass by quickly.",8

3 November 2001,Spectacular!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Judging from the reviews I guess that if this movie doesn't catch your interrest right off it never will, and then, yes, 3 hours is a VERY long time. However, it all went by fast, and I didn't take my eyes off the screen. (Many movies have me watching TV while they're running.) Admitted, yes, Pitt was a little too much sometimes, where he just seemed silly, but his preformance was captivating most of the time. It was genuinely intertaining to see this kind of manifestation of death. Majestic, powerful, utterly inconsiterate, but at the same time rather pathetic with no idea how to behave. Think 'Rainman meets the Terminator'. 9/10 if it catches your interrest. If it doesn't; you're in for 3 hours of solid boredom. But take a chance and rent it in any event.. And bring peanut-butter.

30 April 2021,Tripe.,"Terrible film in so many ways. The presence of Anthony Hopkins can't redeem this tripe, but that is why I was prepared to give it a second star. The story is beyond parody it's so bad. Pitt is (as often) pitiably poor, but his self obsession in the film is possibly a reflection of his self obsession in real life. The idea that a multi-millionaire can be a deserving and upright person at all is fairly bizarre (to become rich you must have made many other people poor, obviously, and in any case the only reasonable course of action should be to give it all to charity) but I guess that's the USA for you. As to Death being an innocent abroad!! Never mind, it's tripe, but people who like tripe will give it a high rating so there we are.

29 April 2017,Pure art may stretch the audience,"The beauty of truly creative story telling is discovered as it enters your mind - hours, days and years after we experience the art. The power of love is a subject that limits the reach of many films. Meet Joe Black offers the well crafted cover of business, power and the supernatural. The story line seems rather simple until the twist comes and it gets a little challenging for a lot of us to handle. The good news is that while we are trying to come to grips with the surface story, the creators sneak in a second slow moving tale of the limitless power of true love. They address a father's love, a daughter's love, the love between a man and a woman and most importantly the film makers get into superficial convenient love. Power over others can cause us to be selfish. This story highlights the brightest version of power and love. We are able to do what is best for another even when that is not aligned with our own desires. Reaching this level takes care and practice. Real love is greater than our needs. Meet Joe Black does a wonderful job of sneaking this life lesson in on us.

25 August 2020,A Masterpiece.,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, to be honest I was shocked that I didn't see the movie before or even heard of it. It's a movie that goes deep inside your hart that when you finish it , it would be like you've waken up from a dream that is so good and you want to sleep again to resume it. And it's one of the most underrated movies ever.

And the end I just wanna tell you that i didn't write any reviews before to any movie that I watched before but this one is really different, cuz as soon as I finished it, I grabbed my phone and i said to my self I must write a review because that is the only thing that allow me to express my feelings . so here I am , so don't waste your time by not seeing this movie it's really worth watching it.

17 November 2013,Really really bad,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again.

24 April 1999,Wonderful!,"I always knew that this film would be good, but I never saw it in the movie theatre and that was pretty disappointing for me. Yet when I first saw it out on video, I just grabbed it off the shelf before anyone else could. Anyhow, at first, the movie is a bit confusing, but you pretty much do get the whole idea later on in the middle.

This movie was wonderful to watch, and very impressing. It's three hours long, but it didn't feel like three hours at all while watching this. I enjoyed every minute of this movie, and I highly recommend this movie, so have fun!!! :o)

3 March 1999,Painfully long and utterly boring,"Frankly I expected much more from this movie. Although there are, occasionally, interesting shots and nice touches, most of the movie is very cliche, despite the original idea. It's the very standard story of boy-meet-girl, with the angry father and the bad guy and everything else that goes with that kind of movie. Also the very soap-opera-style display of the problems of the rich and famous. No actors stand out. No interesting characters. No plot worth speaking of. In short, a good idea for a movie, wasted because of a poor script.

2 January 2001,"I think I'm being mean in this review, but not as mean as I could make it to be.","I had heard the hype and I had heard the criticisms. So I thought that I may as well watch it to judge for myself.

You know, this really could have been an incredily interesting film. It isn't though because I guess it had box office obligations to fulfil. (Come on, Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins don't come cheap!) I respect that. Ok, so it's going to be a bit cliche ridden and a bit sappy, as long as there was a reasonably good storyline, I could live with it...not the case here.

This film had an unbelievable premise (no pun intended). I mean, here was director Martin Brest who made the wonderful film Scent of a Woman, Anthony Hopkins who was just magic as Hannibal Lector and Brad Pitt whose only praise I can conjure is his terrific performance in 12 monkeys and his near cameo appearance in Thelma and Louise. There was so much talent yet somehow, they didn't contribute to the desired effect.

First off, most of the dialogue is in ultra hush hush tones. Not for the hearing challenged. And if you can get past the volume, there's a clarity problem. Pitt just doesn't seem to talk much and when he does, it's undecipherable mumble.

Secondly, death taking on human form. If death is the undeniable force Brad Pitt earlier claims to Anthony Hopkins, he certainly dumbs down to meet the real world. There was so much conviction of his own importance that I find it improbable that 'Death' could be so naive. And if 'Death' is so easily led to falling in love, certainly he would feel the sorrow of the world, the ordinary sufferings of humans which we have taken for granted and he would have been affected by these thoughts as well. In the true style of Hollywood, 'Death' manifested into humanity sees and experiences the good but not the bad.

Thirdly, the sick Jamaican woman. After adopting the accent, I didn't recognise that Pitt was trying to sympathise with the woman. I thought he was mocking the way she spoke. Anyhow, it was terrible to the nth degree.

Fourthly, Oh my GOD did it DRAG!! Three hours which could easily have been cut down to two if they'd cut down on some of those pseudo-important, sentimental or romantic close ups which achieve nothing except that they are pretty faces to look at. It gave the effect of looking at pictures of the actors in a tabloid magazine. They were just so frozen and lifeless.

Fifthly: maybe I wasn't paying attention by that stage but I thought that the ending wasn't very coherent. It was never made clear the nature of Anthony Hopkins' ending and what would happen afterwards. Also, this film's ending focuses on Pitt and Forlani and seems to forget that someone has died...? (a fate suffered also by the film Return to Paradise). And if you think about it, why would Joe Black be in the coffee house to begin with?

and lastly. Death which apparently knows the workings of the universe doesn't knock on your door everyday. So why wasn't Anthony Hopkins' character a bit more opportunistic and asked him to reveal some of that knowledge? I certainly would.

I thoroughly didn't like this film but at least I watched it to the end to be fair and so I could give a valid review of it (kinder than a lot of people who just give an opinion even though they've only seen half of it). So watch it, and have a good laugh with me.",
3 March 2001,wonderful performances,"I was reluctant to see this movie when it opened in my country since it got lousy reviews and because everyone I knew who'd seen it said it was boring. Some days ago I saw Anthony Hopkins in an interview where he said this was one of his favorite movies and I confess this awakened my curiosity.

It was on cable tonight and thought I'd found out why he´d said that, being an actor I admire and found always excelling in whatever part he is to play.

I did find the movie a bit too long and slow moving, but I also found that was not disgusting at all. I like situations and characters to develop and ¿why should that always be quickly done? I also found some of the moments when Joe Black is introduced to the family a little awkward. I believe director Brest does not always blend the comedy bits well with the romantic or dramatic streams of the story, maybe it's due to the pace, maybe it's due to some solemnity imposed to Brad Pitt's performance.

Anyhow, however corny the fireworks at the end it might have seemed to some viewers, the movie builds up to an overwhelming finale where life and death are marvelously brought together.

Hopkins and Forlani are wonderful all through the movie and so is the rest of the cast. Brad Pitt looks somehow restrained at moments but ends up by convincing you(at least I was).

Underrated as it is I think it deserves a high rank, much above other pretendedly masterpieces of our days.",9

25 April 1999,A Yawner,"""Meet Joe Black"" was a drag. It kept dragging on, not wanting to end. Think of a stubborn spike being driven into a piece of knotty oak. The finality of this film came three and one-half hours in, in what seemed like eternity with what seemed like every out-take left in.

Pacing and length, towering above any apparent cinematic style, provided excellent saboteurs in making this film one of unfilled potential. For the most part this movie was deadpan serious and a yawner save coming alive on occasion with exchanges of some clever dialogue. Yet even with this little spark, it failed to ignite MJB, for just about every single scene was excruciatingly long and tiring. It seemed as if either the editing machine broke down or the makers of the film got so enamored with their handiwork they couldn't decide what cuts to make. The result was that everything got left in. What probably could have worked as a shorter film - or even as a farce - was too melodramatic and hokey. The filmmakers took the topic and indeed themselves way too seriously. The old saying that ""the good die young,"" might aptly be restated: ""To 'Meet Joe Black', Death came too late.""

Death's usurping the body of a young man to fulfill a special earthly mission while falling in love promised to be a tricky proposition to pull off. From this standpoint of plot, the film wasn't a disappointment and did fulfill its almost self-fulfilling prophecy to come up short. The body that was chosen for Death - Joe Black - couldn't have come in a prettier form of blood and flesh. Brad Pitt could steal any woman's heart, I suppose, even if in this miscast role of Death he did come across as if he had been born the day before. Wide-eyed and fresh-as-new-snow in his knowledge of life and its pleasures, he showed himself to be a fast learner, puckering up those lips for the obligatory love scene. Seeing that Adonis physique getting hot and bothered showed that even Death can be human. It gave the ladies in the audience and those of nontraditional sexual orientation their money's worth. It wasn't hard to imagine these raw images firing up sounds of oohs and aahs in viewers as he and Susan Parish (Claire Forlaine) cooed and cawed and grimaced and earned the movie its PG-13 rating. From my lofty perch, however, it's hard to conceive of anything death wouldn't have known about in life, for the two go hand-in-hand. Death/Brad Pitt was ingenuously out of touch with the happenings in life, yet paradoxically possessed so much insight on other things. In the matter of love, which is intrinsic to life, Death knew nothing about. But he knew the skinny - all the dirt and good things, too - about the key players in the film. It would seem that to know death (which Mr. Pitt was) is to know life. Why then was Death clueless about female wiles while knowing so much about everything else? Is this too philosophical? Too picky? Or am I the one who is taking myself too seriously instead?

All this wetness behind Death's ears notwithstanding, one cannot help but to get a chuckle out of the movie's second best running gag. Death's ET-like mulling over the spoonful of peanut butter and the ways to down it did cut into the monotone of this feature-and-a-half-length picture. Praise be to Death who did come through in the clutch stealing the show and saving the day, ultimately, by giving the wannabe corporate cut-throat his comeuppance with the best gag about nothing being certain but ""Death and Taxes"".

Not to take anything away from an overly serious film. it did have its lighter moments, although few and far between long takes in which everybody spoke in low tones as if they had trouble expressing their true, innermost feelings like those at an Inner Child Within meeting or something. When Mr. Parish (Anthony Hopkins) became infuriated, Death tried to settle him down. ""Don't have a heart attack. . .you'll ruin my vacation."" There should have been a few more doses of comic relief like this in an all-too-serious film like Meet Joe Black.

Such seriousness may not be as big a culprit in the film's lack of punch as the slow pace and long length. What could have been a well-versed screenplay turned out to be an unwitting accomplice to the movie's failure. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen. Getting nothing is a terrible letdown. For one thing, it took too long for the plot to begin to unfold, and when it did, it was hard to discern what it was. Too often the dialogue was cryptic and impeded the understanding of the film. May I use the word, ""Serlingesque""? I just did. . .left to your interpretation.

I hate to rant on. (I could be accused of being long-winded myself). But I do have one more thing to say. . . or to ponder. This has to do with the film's budget. Was it on a restricted diet or did it just appear that way? This was one of the worst cases of special effects and use of extras I had ever seen. Joe Black (before Death usurped him) hurtling through the air the way he did after getting hit could have been itself comic relief. It looked so much like a dummy and the set looked like a sound stage. (Maybe it was a stand-in who was upgraded to stunt man). A tight budget may have manifested by use of the extras on the board of directors, who remained mum and stoic throughout their presence on screen. Seriously, a few words would have been called for from a few members during the cloak and dagger meeting in which the ouster of Parish was raised. This scene called for interaction. The cynic in me asks if these characters sat stone silent because the producer was too cheap to pay them the upgrade from extra to bit player. Though redeeming qualities in Joe Black were infrequent, there were some. A few scenes could be preserved for a film school acting class and on screenwriting dos and don'ts. The film did not look like it was directed by someone of Martin Brest's track record and capabilities. Weaknesses in the movie rest squarely on his shoulders. The actors seemed strained at times and the dialogue pulled out like hot water taffy. That's because everything was way, way too long. The 40 minute ending had the makings of a tear-jerker, but the duration to get it over with (Parish's demise) got in the way. (Had he made a secret deal with Death behind the scenes for ""just one more day. . .?) 20 minutes for all this would have given people time enough to cry and get it out of the system. Instead, it gave them time to dab their eyes dry and await another emotional farewell of false endings. By the time the real ending came around, it hurt too much to cry (being so long).

Meet Joe Black should have been a comedy. In a sense it was.",
16 April 2001,Annoying waste of an appealing topic,"There's hardly any topic that appeals so constantly to humanity's strongest feelings as - death. More specifically, the blend with love and beauty, this very ancient ""Death and the maiden""-motive - it seems to GUARANTEE a heartbreaking, powerful movie. And then the disappointment. The script is so primitive, redundant and kitschy that you will not believe it. I disagree with many comments that say it was the fault of the actors. Hopkins is - although not brilliant - pretty O.K., and the Death-character would be even less convincing without Brad Pitt. (Of course, he has nothing that I would consider thrilling, sublime or from the ""hereafter"", but his 'strangeness' is well reached and there are some funny - in the good sense - parts even within the love story.) But the endless mistakes of the argument - that death makes friends with almost everybody, the never ending farewell-scenes, that the young guy from the coffee shops returns to guarantee the happy-end etc. - make this movie a very annoying sentimental garbage issue. It's a pity.

23 July 2001,Length matters,"Meet Joe Black had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it failed one of the most important tests of filmmaking: the length test. It was much too long to keep me entertained.

When I went to see this movie, I had no idea what is was about. For all the trouble I went through while watching the film, I'm still glad I saw it. I liked the message it presented. It was new, and it was presented in a rather unique way. Sir Anthony Hopkins, as usual, performed tremendously. I saw this as a rather unusual role for him (at least from the films I've seen). He lights up the screen every time he appears in this movie. Brad Pitt also gave a good performance. He has real acting potential if he settles down a little bit (Check out Fight Club and Snatch.). Cinematography was well done. It added a subtlety to the film that I thought was necessary.

Unfortunately, the film was too drawn out. The love scene should have been a minute long...not 15 minutes long. It became unnerving after a while. The scene of the accident was just ridiculous. It completely halted the mode/tone of the film. It made me realize that we were watching a movie...bad move. There were moments of lengthened silence and dialogue that were also not needed. The film should have been 2 hours long...not 3 hours.

The ending was fitting but much too melodramatic (and drawn out). That's why I consider the music to also be a weakness in this film. It added to the melodrama, which there already was enough of.

In short, the movie shows potential and has many memorable scenes (The first meeting between Pitt and Hopkins in particular is quite good.). However, it loses its power the longer the movie goes along. For a three hour movie, this is not the trend I wanted to see.

15 November 1998,I enjoyed this movie,"I saw Meet Joe Black last night, and I can say that for me, this was a very enjoying experience at the movies. Movies like this are why I go to see movies. It had everything you could want in a movie; it was a love story, a friendship story, and it teaches a very good lesson that we've all heard before, but need to be reminded of...the lesson that life is short, so you better enjoy it while you can, and never take for granted what you have and the people in your life who mean everything in the world to you. Three hours is a long time, but I am not one who usually complains about length when it comes to a good movie, and this was a very good movie.

10 July 2008,truly amazing,"I think this is one of those occasions that film has created something bigger than its self, film is just celluloid and a great number of talented people doing their job however in this instance due to what can only be described as beautiful acting and an incite by the director and writers into the true depth of what makes us human, they have made something truly meaningful.As an independent filmmaker myself i can only wish to work on a project with a cast as talented as these, Its incredible how the eyes of a great actor can convey more than any dialog ever could and for that reason It is and will always be one of my favorite films.

30 November 2011,A waste of 3 hours,"This movie was terrible. I kept waiting for it to get good, but it never did. And the ending was the worst ever. The ending brought the climax of a dull film to a an even duller and less believable ending. I want my 3 hours back! This movie lacked believability completely! The total calmness of Anthony Hopkins was not believable to me. Brad Pitt trying to come off as some kind of robotic being that has no idea what things are, or what people think, yet he has been around forever. I had heard that this movie was good, and I was bored so i figured I'd give it a shot. It had some sweet moments, and some sentimental and reflective moments, but were so minutely developed and so short compared to all the filler that dragged this movie out to 3 hours. If you are bored and have absolutely nothing to do, then this is your movie.

18 January 1999,"Pretentious direction, horrible script, questionable acting.","Don't get me wrong, I like Martin Brest... I thoroughly enjoyed Scent of a Woman; likewise Beverly Hills Cop. However, Brest's need to drag out every single scene to at least twice the length it should be had me squirming in my seat, most notably the scene where Hopkins first meets Pitt. This movie was based around a similar movie (Death Takes a Holiday, 1934) which was 74 minutes in length and I can't help but think Joe Black could have been condensed to a similar length without taking out too many of the essential ingredients.

Onto the script. Apart from the glaring inconsistencies (without giving too much away, one minute Death is so incredibly naive, whereas the next he seems to know a great deal about things he shouldn't), a lot of conversation seems to be somewhat forced, with a lot of people repeating what someone else just said. There is also a lot of empty silence in the movie, which could have been filled in with music, or _something_. It's not like it's meant to be a tense thriller or anything.

Finally, the acting. Hopkins, as always, puts in a good performance, but it seemed like his heart just wasn't in it, and he appeared more subdued than usual. There was very little chemistry between Forlani and Pitt, and during those moments when they're alone, he seemed to be looking everywhere _but_ into her eyes (was the set background _that_ interesting? I mean... she has beautiful eyes, I wouldn't have a problem looking at them).

In conclusion, I would have to give it two big thumbs down.",3
25 February 2003,Good credits,"You need to be in right ""levels"" when watch this nice movie if not it could feel a bit too sweet... But anyway I liked and I have to say that it's quite rare that you really watch all credits at the end, isn't it. Well, big thanks from that to Israel Kamakawiwo'ole who performs own version of songs Somewhere Over The Rainbow and What a wonderful world. AMAZING ending for the movie!!!

13 November 1999,Superb! But what it takes to love this movie is...,"My wife and I rate this movie a 9 out of 10. Maybe a 10. It was absolutely superb. What is needed for this movie is great sensitivity and a deeply loving quietness. If you are young and seeking sex and action, you'll probably find this film boring, like some of the comments below indicate. If you have faced death in your own life, if you have cried over lost love and if you have also cried at having true love, then you will probably find Meet Joe Black a wonderfully fulfilling experience. You will see comments below that support this. The slow pace was perfect for us, perfect for dealing with a benevolent Mr. Death, but other comments found it way too slow. Quite a disparity here!

The top three actors (Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani) give Oscar-level performances. Claire Forlani delivers some of the best love scenes I have ever seen. Her facial expressions convey far more than pages of the usual Hollywood script. The music, editing and casting were faultless. Brad Pitt could not portray Death better. I am going to find other films by director Martin Brest.

If you feel you can handle great depths of love, life and death with maturity, see this film. It is one of the best!",
30 November 1999,Meet Joe......Elevator,"Ohhhh, the pain.... Death in love? It was like watching an elevator fall in love with a human woman (and getting her into bed). But THREE hours of this? I honestly can never stomach another romance movie again after watching this... However, I'm sure Brad Pitt will make an EXCELLENT elevator!!!

Anthony Hopkins was, as usual, the best and most memorable in this tear-jerker of a flick. The girl Joe elevator - oops, I mean Death - falls for was little more than a pretty prop. It was fairly predictable that Joe elevator - sorry i mean JOE BLACK!!! would end up performing the standard romance cliches.

The main female character was very irritating. Aside from being a prop, She plays the part of a vunerable, gullible, doe-eyed daddy's little girl convincingly, however.

Can't really say much about this as I got utterly bored with the snails pace of it and gave up on it halfway through. What bits I did see, well read all of the above again.

CONCLUSION: I watched it on video! Saved my sanity!!! But romance lovers and Brad Pitt fans will love this flick. If you are not a lover of romance movies, avoid.",
29 August 2006,Most definitely my favourite movie ever,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",
15 February 2006,Worst movie ever,"Not only does it drag on endlessly, but there is not a single moment of subtlety here. You are constantly beaten over the head about the meaning of ""true love"". The number of times you want to slap yourself on the forehead and say ""Give me a break!"" are too numerous to count. It's impossible to take Brad Pitt seriously in this role. He looks like he should be in a teen surfer movie, and couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. It was an embarrassment to see someone like Anthony Hopkins, one of the greatest actors ever, in a movie such as this. The only possible saving grace is Claire Forlani, who managed to convey a freshness and honesty the movie itself does not.

11 January 2015,This movie does not deliver...to the point of being silly.,"What a great premise...what potential! Unfortunately, what you have is a stiff, trite, dull movie. The performers are fine, although Pitt is miscast in the role. The movie sombers itself to death. The script is weak, the direction...ordinary. The dreariness of the Joe character buries the film. The movie has no charm, humor and cleverness. Pitt wanders through the role like an automaton. It reminded me a bit of Peter Sellars in Being There but without the script, charisma or humor to make it work. This movie has been done before in other incarnations and this type of story works best when it doesn't take itself so, so seriously. I would love to see a remake with the same story but a much better script.

30 April 2001,Sometimes slow is good...,"The reviews for this movie were so mixed that I avoided it until it went on the ""cheap"" shelf at the video store.

I thought it a really fine piece of movie-making, on its own terms (that is, putting aside that it's a remake of ""Death Takes a Holiday""). It's nice to have time to get to know a character, and this movie was mostly about two: Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) and his daughter Susan (Claire Forlani). By the time it was all over, I admired an obscenely wealthy man, and was in love with Susan. Brad Pitt did a wonderful job of playing a one-dimensional character (which I thought was the point), and Jeffrey Tambor and Marcia Gay Harden were terrific in support.

The Thomas Newman soundtrack is superb; the movie looks great; and even the closing titles are moving (accompanied by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's amazing rendition of ""Over The Rainbow/What A Wonderful World"").

But my main reason for writing is that last night ABC showed something like the infamous ""Airline Version""--the entire backstory concerning the plotting behind Parrish's back to overthrow his publishing empire was expunged, and most of Tambor's best scenes along with it.

That the networks regard themselves as entitled to butcher movies I find quite as startling as that some think themselves entitled to negatively review a movie they haven't, by their own admission, actually watched...",
1 June 1999,Made me wish I had three hours of my life back.,"This movie was awful. Why? I really can't explain that, I just didn't like it. The length of the movie was grossly long and the story was plain at best. I just didn't feel for characters and the ending was one of the most predictable and worst endings of all time. If I had paid to see this movie, I would consider myself a sucker.

5 February 2006,A stunningly good movie for evolved souls,"I've just seen the 3-hour version of Meet Joe Black for the second time. It improves with re-viewing. What I find amazing about this story, and about the way it has been executed on film is its gorgeously rendered mix of: subtle yet passionate performances (all of them, including supporting cast), perfectly chosen and applied music, idealistic but utterly believable characters whom you wish you knew personally and whom you can care about, and the ""production values"" (rich yet subdued cinematography ~ in particular the graceful, gradually unfolding, almost spiritual PACE that is so well geared to this story, rather than to the ""attention span of a flea"" unfortunately created within so many movie viewers by their having been bombarded with 30-second TV ads for their entire lives. (READING an actual book REALLY takes a lot of time too, this is called ""literature."") Hence, most likely, the complaints about this movie being ""too long,"" which I find utterly baffling. In the hands of a lesser director and producer, the special effects geeks might also have slimed their way into this production and removed all traces of subtlety. Hooray ~ this DIDN'T happen, either. And, since the major characters are all gradually revealed as being awake, conscious, perceptive beings (as well as being complicated flawed human beings) ~ none of them are forced to fit into the false American ""belief"" that bigger and faster are automatically better (they aren't). In summary, this is a delicious meal of a movie for grownups who love a good story and who don't cynically believe that idealism, love and spirituality are ""boring.""",10
21 April 2002,An absolutely flop,"This movie is bored,stupid and sappy.The plot is simple and Brad Pitt acting is simply horrible.Don't waste your time in this awful 3 hours.There are movies about the death better than this.For example,you can see The Seven Seal or even Ghost.These movies are deeper than Meet Joe Black that is an idiotic and pink Hollywood romance.

23 June 2002,"Watch this movie, ignore the bad reviews!","I was upset after watching this wonderful film, and then coming to imdb.com to look up its awards, and found that it had been nominated by Razzie awards for ""Worst Remake"" and other awards it won for worst movie! I don't understand, this was a great movie. It was slow moving, but that just added to the melancholy drama of the film. I found it moving, sad at times, funny at times, and the acting was terrific. I don't know what reasons Razzie had for ridiculing it. Furthermore, I feel it was better than some films that have won Academy Awards (Out of Africa, Titanic, The English Patient). Do not let the reviews frighten you out of watching this film! Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins were wonderful in this film, and I think that the average person that watches this film will agree with me than with the critics.

26 August 2012,Decent....then Unbearable!,"This film had such potential... (that's as good as it gets) However after trying to sit through that unscrupulously long-and-boring scene between Pitt and Forlani where they are dancing, the sound of her voice for so long made me want to kill someone. I couldn't bear to watch anymore of the film after that point.

The thought of instant death to the entire world entertained me more. Someone with a much nicer voice is absolutely mandatory for a scene like that. She is so uninteresting and killed the film for me.

I couldn't be more p*ssed off after having sat through as much of the film as I did.

I wont even rate this film seeing as I couldn't watch it to the end. The only reason I'm giving that mercy is due to the fact that it was decent up until that point. It was so long ago and yet all I can remember was how much I F'king hated that scene!

24 October 1999,"Handsomely produced but really poorly edited, written and acted","This is one of those ""posturing"" movies. Brad Pitt acts for about five minutes (maybe) in the movie but mostly just apes Jeff Bridges' performance from Starman. In comparison, Anthony Hopkins manages to generally rise above a very awkward, illogical script.

Kind of fun to watch if you like seeing how the super-rich live, and there's a wonderfully sparkly scene when Susan and ""Joe"" first meet.

20 November 2007,"Beautifully Done. Excellent story, acting, direction and music.","Despite this being an older movie, I saw it for the first time tonight and was delighted with it. All the actors were marvelous with the lone exception of Claire Forlani who was OK but I got rather tired of the ""shy - I want to look at you but I'm afraid to"" thing in every scene with Brad Pitt. The music was excellent but too loud in many scenes and drowned out some of the dialogue. Especially loved the scenes with Pitt and the dying old Jamaican island lady. I didn't understand every word but the accents were marvelous. Pitt is more than just a pretty face. Hopkins turns in his usual excellent performance. I don't know how he does it. Jake Webber is a terrific villain as the oily, stab in the back character. Marcia Gay Harden is totally believable in her role. She doesn't overdo it. Just right. Jeffrey Tambor is equally believable as a slightly ""in over his head"" son-in-law who gets pushed around but finally stands up and does the right thing, regardless.

17 January 2001,More comedy than drama,"Of all the Brad Pitt movies I've seen, this is definately the one disappointment. While this is, without a doubt, a fantasy movie, I found it more comedical than anything. It proved to be the movie substitute for a soap opera, with death taking over a human body rather than someone coming back to life after being dead for two years. The dialogue bordered on corny, and the characters were all too idealized and familiar. While the acting itself was fine, there was something lacking to engage the viewer who wasn't a fantasy-fanatic. The idea is an interesting one, but could lacked any substance for an enjoyable story. The friend I saw it with loved it, so maybe it's just me. Nonetheless, I think I'll stick with Pitt's darker movies

24 November 2011,"Meet Joe Black...........A ""whisper of a thrill"",","Yes, these are the only word combination which can describe this film - ""A Whisper of a Thrill"". great movie with superb direction, excellent music( thanks to Mr. Thomas Newman, he is at his best with the score),wonderful cast and very very especially, the performance. No doubt, the combination of Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins proved again(after 'The Legend of the Fall')the best of the best combination in Hollywood.

This movie is all about emotions - Love,Life and Sacrifice - but these emotions has been presented so deeply in this film that I found the new meaning of these words. This is kind of movie which will definitely move your world of emotion and your life as it did to me.

But one thing I need to say is that this a kind of extraordinary especial film which is definitely not for everyone but only for especial one who can feel the message of this masterpiece.

Watch this film with your love ones and I bet you will thank me later.

""William Parrish: Its hard to let go, isn't it? Joe Black: Yes, it is,Bill.

William Parrish: And That's Life......What can I tell you.""",10

7 June 2004,Excellent remake of 'Death Takes A Holiday',"I read in a previous review on this site Brad Pitt's performance described as 'stiff'. That strikes me as a misinterpretation. Brad Pitt plays Death, taking on a body to find out what he's been missing, to discover what life and love are like. I found Mr. Pitt's interpretation, a challenge for any actor, one would think, poignant and even delightful. He seems uncomfortable and uncertain in this body, like someone who has never worn one before, while at the same time he is enjoying the experience and the new discoveries he's making, such as...peanut butter. But even with the uncertainties, there is an underlying sense of power whenever he is brought back to himself. And a wonderful poignancy as he discovers the wonders and heartbreaks of life and love.

The movie moves rather slowly at times, but it seemed to me to build throughout, and the ending is that much more powerful.

A delightful movie. Definitely one for the personal collection.

And besides, it's Brad Pitt looking his best, which one doesn't always see, in his movies.",10
24 August 2022,A Masterpiece's Masterpiece,"This movie is a masterpiece of the highest, highest order!

Acting: A+++++ Pitt & Hopkins, and LITERALLY every cast member is on another level! They all play off each other beautifully.

Story: A++++ Everything about the look into humanity, and people, and relationships, and legacy is simply perfect! PERFECT!!!

Pacing: A+++ Simple and yet, beautiful, and masterful. A slow, light beauty.

Characters: A++ You will not find it done better in any movie. This is how you write characters, even the supporting ones.

Score: A+++++ Sheesh, simple, subtle, and just INCREDIBLE.

24 September 1999,one of the most underappreciated movies i have ever seen,"It is apparently highly fashionable to bomb on this film. I would simply like to state that if you intend to watch meet joe black with the preconceived notion that it is a ""3 hour long, boring and sappy love story"", then by all means i suggest not seeing it because you obviously won't like it. Most of this movie's bad reviews are part of the mentality that most have that if a movie comes out of hollywood, it is supposed to appeal to all of the masses.

I found meet joe black an excellent reminder of our mortality as humans, and also a great example of character development. The story moved along as if it were a merchant/ivory film in a few ways in my opinion, and if you don't like those films i suggest passing this one over for something more stimulating like varsity blues or i know what you did last summer.

Although a bit long, i sat through the film and felt that none of the scenes in particular was a ""throw away"" except maybe the fascination with peanutbutter, which added a quirky little edge to the already dead-serious (no pun intended) joe black. If you are a person that is capable of sitting down and watching a 3 hour movie full of dialog and nothing more, then by all means i highly recommend this film, for i found it to be one of only a few love stories that is capable of pulling out an emotional reaction of the viewer on many different levels, including a fairly true representation of love, fear of mortality and the universal (if not by subconscience) ideal that as humans we simply do not want to die, but leave our mark on society or history before we go. This is a movie that takes all of these things that we believe that make us ""human"" and presents them to a cold person that knows not of human nature, and sometimes has quite a clear and true perception of life that is unclouded by emotions.

However if you are expecting anything along the lines of Titanic (a much inferior film), than i suggest passing this up. This is not the movie to watch with a closed mind, or simply by someone that cant appreciate similar movies of the genre.",10
10 November 2003,boringboring,"I have never seen a film so boring as this one. I saw it at a sneak preview and hoped every minute that it would get better, but it didn't happen. Never spent 3 hrs. of my life so bored. I'm waiting for a sequel...

23 November 1998,"well acted and written, good romantic comedy","If you are looking for a fast paced movie Meet Joe Black is not for you. However, if you are looking for a good movie that is humorous and touching even though it deals realistically (even in farcial way) with the extremely serious subject of Death then this is the movie for you. The movie takes its time and develops all the character well. The dialogue is excellent and the supporting cast is very good, Mr. Pitt and Mr. Hopkins are great. Mr. Pitt who plays Joe Black/Death is the only actor I can think of who have played this part. He is an excellent actor who plays the part of an attractive, both socially and physically with his boy next good looks, Death (Joe Black). He is actually likeable in his innocence. I can hardly say enough about him. Mr. Hopkins who is certainly one of the best actors of 20th Century was excellent as well. The chemistry between the two is great, and I suspect that they like and respect each other off the set. The movie is about three hours long but I did not notice until after. If you like well written, well acted, good dialogue, and great characters then you will enjoy Meet Joe Black. I would give this movie three plus stars and once again thank Mr. Pitt for an excellent performance.

20 November 1998,"""Lightning has struck!"" The year's best film, so far.","This is such a beautifully made film, the best film of the year, so far. Brad Pitt gives his best performance since ""12 Monkeys."" Anthony Hopkins gives, (surprise surprise), another excellent performance. If the academy doesn't consider him for another Oscar, I lose all faith in them. Claire Forlani, a very beautiful woman with a very exotic name, gives an impressive performance. She has matured so much since I first saw her in ""Mallrats."" My motto is that sometimes less is more. That might seem like an oxymoron when it comes to this film's time length. What I mean is, that the longing looks between Brad and Claire said so much more than actual dialogue. I found myself getting caught up in their emotions, or perhaps there were things going on in my mind at the time. In any effect, the scenery is beautiful throughout. Each scene is lit perfectly and made it appear much more elegant. The love scene between Brad and Claire was very sensual. I would compare this film to Martin Brest's other great achievement, ""Scent Of A Woman."" The performances, the scenery, the cinematography, the score and the dialogue has made this the year's best film and one of the greatest romances of all time.

1 April 2023,Make it a totally overlooked gem!,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",9
23 February 2000,Hollywood at its best,"This is vintage Hollywood: a great, romantic love story, excellent acting, top-notch production values, very good screenplay! Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt are together again (previously on Legends of the Fall) in a beautiful love story, a remake of The postwar Death Takes A Holiday. Long, but quick-moving: you won't notice that the film is 3 hours long! One of my top 100 films. This is going to be a true cult classic: shunned by critics and missed by millions of film-goers, yet enthusiastically loved by millions since its release on video.

9 December 2001,10,"Utterly captivating beautiful film. Yes, the plot may be a tad controversial, who cares. watch it and love it. Brad pitt was excellent as death, truly meeting the task of the ""experience"". the way he walked and touched and ate and just appreciated every little thing there is to this wonderful life. All the stuff we take for granted. but not now, not for me. Death and taxes. outstanding cast. The whole movie just gave me a feeling that is undescribable, soft maybe. not too long at all either, which i get alot. Just a damn good movie and no im not ashamed i like it even if i am a guy. (ill be honest though, i like a chick flick here and there). Just a beautiful tale of love, true love, deep love, death and life...

3 February 2019,Believable movie on an curious topic,"I am beginning to notice I usually really like a movie or pretty much dislike it. This one I really like, here's why. As unusual as the topic is, the scenes seem like they would go down exactly as depicted. Even in mid-scenes or from scene to scene the dynamic changes in a plausible way. It's only after viewing the movie would you understand, so what I am getting at is that the dialogue is very plausible also. The acting is just so damn good, it really makes the movie...especially Anthony Hopkins, but in reality they all play their roles spot on. Normally I like it when I get so lost in the acting it doesn't seem like I'm watching acting. In this case because of the unusual topic I sense there is acting going on, but it's just so well done. It's difficult to recount things without having spoilers so I am going to end it there, aside from recommending that you view it.

8 September 1999,Meet a great film.,"This has wit, charm, wisdom and is delightfully different. The performances of Claire Forlani and Brad Pitt are magnificent and Anthony Hopkins plays Anthony Hopkins to his usual high standards. The real pleasure of this film is that it takes the time to deal with something properly. It glides into its messages and observations rather than charging in. This is a quirky film and, I say, all power to quirk!

10 June 2003,"Flawed, but with some great moments","I agree with commenter mccracd (11 April 2003) on most points, except that I found that Brad Pitt was really good in his role. And - independently of this - am not a fan of his, but his extreme good looks were a real treat for the eye. Though the casting of such an extremely handsome man as Death who wants to take a 65-old straight man with him left me wondering: why did Death waste all these good looks on such a ""victim"" (he didn't plan to fall in love with Susan Parrish straight from the start, after all)? If the two men themselves had had a love story with each other, it would have been different of course, but in this case, I agree with commenter mccracd that another, older and less handsome-looking actor would have been more aptly cast. Also Death's lack of knowledge on human ways seemed misplaced in a story on such a serious topic and reminded me of cheap comedy fare that was completely unnecessary here.I also think the script on the whole was flawed (it did not really know where to go and wanted too much, I think) and much of the dialog lacked punch and intelligence. Some memorable dialog bits could have made a cult movie of this one.

The story was compelling though in a weird way and made me think a lot (about my own mortality, among other things). Formally, the movie was really beautifully made (great photography! - watch the scene where Hopkins and Pitt meet for the first time) and for me at least, it did not seem to drag.

What was a really supreme moment in the film was the lovemaking scene between Susan and Joe. You don't find very often a mainstream Hollywood film where lovemaking really MEANS something (in case they do include such a scene in the movie), but here, it was the peak of Death's experience as a living person. Look at Brad Pitt's face here: what mixture of astonishment, awe, love, lust, fear...! Just plain wonderful. Death engaging in the ultimate act of Life.

As for the tears in the last few scenes: Claire Forlani's weeping all the time didn't move me at all - but when Death sheds a tear, it did....

I'd give it 6/10.",
20 June 1999,best chick-flick of the year,"Alright, it's a chick-flick guys ... nothing blows up and ppl cry ... but it's excellent. It way better than You've Got Mail for intensity, Hopkins daughter is just so intense. This is adult love, not that teen stuff like Titanic. It's worth it just to see Brad Pitt pretending to be a virgin in bed ... he probably can't even remember his first time ... a bazillion women ago, but it's priceless. And most ppl won't see the ending coming, because we really aren't sure how the Grim Reaper operates. See it guys, it's really first-date calibre, so take your babe. -Bob

5 January 2002,"Truth told, this movie is a bit too long","It was a solid drama movie, with decent actors, yet somehow I did start to feel weary of the theme and by the end of the film I was more or less disappointed with the ending, yet relieved over the fact that it finally ended.

Brad Pitt & Hannibal the Cannibal do their work as actors rather well, even the Quincy character (anyone else remember that actors character in Hill Street Blues) was rather well played, but the rest of the cast did not convince me with their acting skills. Perhaps these ""younger"" actors will make an impression in some later film.

Be aware, Joe Black is a drama movie that might make your hands itch for the remote to your video, fast forward being a button you'd wish to press.

1 October 2006,A pure unadulterated Masterpiece,"Underaprieciated in ever respect.When i first saw this movie i didn't like it that was when i was 9.the when i was 15 i saw it again and being a guy i don't cry at movies i just don't but this one had me very close. First of all to those who say this movie is crap? you are the kind of person Jake Weber(Drew) portrayed. The score was utterly beautiful.One of the most moving compositions ever made. The story line made the impossible seem very real while sweeping overtones of the beautiful piano piece swept you off you're feet into another world. The actors played there parts FLAWLESSLY not one stupid scene not one overdone expression. Perfect the critics got it wrong ,way wrong. worst remake,fools.Worst movie? What the hell were they thinking!

This movie is something to live you're life by.

It has profound advice in every scene.

After all how can you live life, if you never love,and how can you love if you never,""Tell her everything,and let the chips fall where they may.""",10
14 November 2006,It's a great movie and really make me think,"I have watched this movie more than 10 times and every time I was moved. But when I asked myself what is the real thing that make me feel so, I can not tell. I would say that's the overall feeling. Excellent performance by Brad Pitt and Antony Hopkins and that girl, Susan, great plot and meaningful conversation, the background music, the speech that Parish gave at the party, the love story, the purity of soul when a human kind first come to the reality ... all these things put together just make a wonderful string of soul mining trip. I have rated this movie as one of the top 5 movies I like most. It indeed gave me a lot of pleasure of thinking when I watch it every time.

26 June 2022,Hem and Haw,"I hemmed and hawed between rating it 7 or 8 stars. It is a very good movie. Especially if you really like Brad Pitt when he was younger. Gorgeous to look at and - honestly - a very fine actor. Not just a pretty face. Anthony Hopkins outstanding as always. Claire Forlani I had some difficulty with but I do not think that it was because her lack of acting ability but, rather, how her part was written. I found her breathiness annoying at times. My biggest criticism of the movie is the length. No, it shouldn't be a 90-minute movie but I bet if they really tried they could have easily taken 30 minutes out of it. Way too long for what it was. The ending was nice. Kudos to Brad Pitt for handling it so well...just needed to bring us to that point faster.

19 January 1999,A drawn-out meeting,"Well, I met Joe Black - and I wished the encounter hadn't been

so long. That is not to say the film is bad, on the contrary, it

is (for most of its time) very entertaining. Because the

emotions come across as very true and the lines bring up the

glorious past of screwball comedies. Which, in great part, is

due to the perfect casting. Anthony Hopkins, impeccable as

always, manages to make believable the turmoil and despair of a

man who has just learned that he is going to die - while still

not giving away the jokes. Any lesser actor would have either

opted for broad comedy or heart-feeling tragedy. That Sir

Anthony walks the fine line between these two choices is one

more proof for his genius (and I sincerely hope he won't call it

quits). Much chided Brad Pitt turns in a wonderfully subtle

performance. One really believes that his Death is becoming more

human through the experience of love, but Pitt always keeps that

glint in his eye that reminds us of who (or what) he really is.

Besides that he shows a profound talent as straight comedian.

The only drawback is Claire Forlani who tends to ham up her part

as the lover a bit. But why, in death's and taxes' name, did director Brest have to

stretch the delicate story out over three hours? Endlessly drawn

out scenes of people walking senselessly about, looking at each

other for eternity and repeating things that had been said

before make one wonder why nobody told him to ""speed things up a

bit"" (probably James Cameron was forcing them away at gunpoint). In the end we've got what Johnny Carson would have called: ""Two

hours of splendid entertainment stretched over three hours.",
25 January 1999,Everyone should have an angel like that !,"Haunting, relentless and unforgettable -- three terms that would certainly describe Death. Then, add Brad Pitt in a green suit with necktie askew and voila! After Hopkins' near seizure, there are a few moments early on during which one doesn't quite know where this film's going (e.g. how can Death be so dumb?!), but the comics do work and the story launches. Once it does, it grabs your attention for the remainder of the film; you don't want it to end but you know it has to -- Death didn't stop over for nothing, after all. Add West Indian accents to Mr Pitt's repertoire and a sensuousness that remains beyond compare (as a couple Pitt & Forlani have got definite repeat-appeal). Hopkins is great, as usual, and must never rest for the quantity of excellent films in which he's partaken over the past year. Would that we all go out on such a high note, with full understanding and our eyes wide-open. Superbly done -- go and see it! (Rating 4.5 stars of 5.)

30 August 1999,Feel the eternity...,"Brest tried the Wender's long take, which Wender is best at: it makes you feel what the characters are experiencing, through looking and gazing at them and the scenery. Wender manipulates the viewers this way and does it expertly. Brest attempted the same intensity, but with an empty, shallow result, lacking the rhythm of the artist, only the feeling of time dragging, ending up with the laughably hollow result of being in hell for 3 hours (that's already something, though!), not going through an unforgettable experience. Just a long, long time at the theater...

24 July 2002,"Well shot, and well acted","Although to some this film may be seen as a drag, the creators did a fantastic job on making a film that both looks brilliant, and leaves you in a certain frame of mind. All of the actors from the charismatic Hopkins, the powerful yet interesting Brad Pitt, to the hideously obnoxious Jake Weber, and the beautiful and expressive Forlani, did an exceptional job.

Combined with Thomas Newman's touching soundtrack and Emmanuel Lubezki's camera-work, Martin Brest and Co. have created a little-known yet wonderful film.

Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",9
20 September 2004,big Claire fan? Watch w/ the sound down,"I think it must have actually said in the script ""PAUSE A FULL 5 (OR 10) SECONDS AFTER EACH LINE"" Now if you can stand this awful script, and love sappy love stories that have no substance and depend on 'meaningful glares' between beautiful people without any real acting going on, you'll love this film. There's no skin, no fun and no believable chemistry at all in this movie. I figure there is a whole generation of soap opera addicted, brad pitt worshiping youth that just love this movie. Claire is beautiful but the words coming out of her mouth here are all written for the above mentioned. I know she's capable of much better. Not even worth a watch on free cable weekend.

2 August 2000,The Most Romantic Movie in Recent Years,"This movie surprised and impressed me. The acting and music was paramount! I love this film, its premise, its stars and the scenery and songs. Pitt was never my favorite but he does an outstanding job as Death. Claire Forlani is just stunning and Sir Anthony Hopkins is awesome as a man in the September of his years.....Truly for the romantic at heart, Meet Joe Black cannot be missed.

18 March 2023,"A philosophical, wonderful, romantic picture, but...","The film will certainly not leave you indifferent, but you may find it very long and drawn out. The golden years of beauty of Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani, with an equally gorgeous Anthony Hopkins, are the main cherries of this film.

The picture has a philosophy, and can't help but touch you about the meaning of being. The melodrama with its romance with beautiful actors will keep you captivated. The plot will hold your gaze until the very end, and the music will hold and nudge your emotions from watching. The entire movie is well done, but...

The plot has holes, some scenes will seem drawn out, some moments are silly that you wanted to rewind away or even turn the movie off! This may sound harsher than it actually is, but still. This movie didn't need to be stretched that far, it could definitely have been made shorter.

Despite the low rating and flaws, this movie can really be okay to watch. Personally, I came away with a philosophical aftertaste to ponder and a nice pairing with beautiful lead actors. You have to be prepared for the fact that the movie will not leave you indifferent, but you may get bored with a long 3 hours of viewing.",7
23 October 2002,The 3 hours Flew By,"When I watched Meet Joe Black, it was before I was an avid Hopkins fan. Back in 1998, I was never really in the Drama movie scene but after watching this, I was. I can now appreciate and recognize excellent acting. The story was quiet unusual but I couldn't change the channel. I was so into this movie that it was over before I knew it. For anyone who wants to see excellent acting, I recommend watching this film. Hopkins and Pitt are excellent!

4 November 1999,go meet someone else,"Oh dear, nightmare.

Personifications of death crop up quite a lot in cinema, but in my view seldom with so little effect as here.

I join with everyone else in being delighted by the ""coffee shop"" scene at the start. But after that, we have a slothful grind through some suspect acting and a plot (and sub-plots) which defy belief even in the context of a film based on death taking a holiday in the US.

Clare Forlani is of course not offensive to the eye, but I did worry about her repertoire of acting techniques. To cheer you up during your nye-on 3 hour sitdown, I suggest you count the number of times she stares at Pitt or Hopkins as they talk, then looks away to stare into the middle distance, gulps and nods rapidly a couple of times. Presumably that was doing ""sensitive and vulnerable"", but after a few repeats I didn't really care.

Pitt, well, less said the better about his attempts for much of the film at imitating the lobotomised bloke in ""Planet of the Apes"". And Hopkins does what he can, but is stuffed by having to play the straight man in a comedy double act with robot-boy.

I was fed this as an in-flight movie after I had seen it once in the cinema, it's an hour shorter, a mercy in itself, but the scenes which are cut leaves it even more confused. Almost everything about Hopkins' business activities goes out the window, along with the best (only) one-liner in the film.

The film may be good for people who have missed the difference between sentimentality and romance and I would recommend it to them. But for me, this film was dead on arrival. Inquest verdict: misadventure.",5
16 June 2019,"Great movie, in spite of mawkish ending.","It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

19 November 1998,As near to perfect as they get!!!!,"This movie comes as close to perfect as can possibly be done. The acting was perfect by all. The storyline was great and a nice mix of emotions evinced by it. Some humor, some seriousness but no sadness. I kept envisioning one ending but ended up with another. Mind you the actual ending was what it should be but I kept thinking it would be different. But as it turns out the ending was perfect and I wouldn't change anything......Well that's not exactly true but I won't say what because I don't want to spoil it. Anyway, I suggest everyone see this movie. I think you'll find it to be one of the best of the year if not ever. :) Enjoy.

24 May 2016,Beautiful film to watch.,"I'm not a big fan of love stories. I only like two--""UNTAMED HEART"" and ""MEET JOE BLACK."" They are on opposite ends of the spectrum in the sense of story and production. UNTAMED HEART is a relatively low budget movie shot in a way to make it feel real. It was filmed in a real middle-class neighborhood and the characters were lower middle class. It was an absolutely sweet story. MEET JOE BLACK is all about extreme wealth, very beautiful powerful people, and the whole story is a fantasy. In both films, the couple in love project innocence and are compelling to watch. In a interview, Brad Pitt said that his mother wanted to see him a movie in which he looked good. Well, he never looked better. The girl is just as lovely and charming as any film character created for the screen. The only way to watch this film is just to buy into it and enjoy each frame. If you analyzed the story seriously, it's full of holes. So don't ruin your experience. Just listen to the beautiful score, engage the credible performances, embrace the classically simple but effective directing, and as with any good love story worth it's salt, bring a box of Kleenex.

28 September 2019,Unrealistic behaviour,"All through this film I kept thinking 'no one would react like that'. The concept of the film was great and Anthony Hopkins is always great, but the film was terrible. All that vacant staring and no one saying, well this is weird, dad's just brought some random hot man home and won't tell us anything about him. I would be thinking, does dad have something to tell us?

21 September 2004,Meat Blow Jack,"One of the worst films I've ever seen, but without the benefit of being so bad it's good. The acting's utterly wooden (Brad Pitt) or completely OTT (Hopkins); every line of the dialogue's quite unbelievable and the story's so boring I've been more interested in watching paint dry. What was the production team thinking? That a pretty face (well, TWO pretty faces), an name actor hamming it up and a decent soundtrack could carry a film without the need for anything else? Judging from the number of people who rate this farrago as good, their cynicism seems to have paid off. I gave it a 1 in the IMDb voting, but zero would have been more appropriate. A turkey, an absolute turkey, with no saving graces whatsoever.

24 June 2005,A pleasant surprise!,"I just finished watching this movie. What a pleasant surprise! Either it was woefully under-advertised or I was living under a rock at the time, but this movie is well worth seeing. I sat down to watch it just because it had the great Anthony Hopkins in it. I did not even know until his appearance that Brad Pitt was even associated with this project. Normally I consider Pitt a ""woman's actor"" in that he acts primarily in films that appeal to women. But occasionally he has shown flashes of talent (such as SEVEN MONKEYS), and he does again in this film. The doe-eyed beauty of Claire Forlani is the perfect complement to him. While both rich and beautiful, she comes across as someone who looks for something deeper in a man than Pitt's obvious physical charms. I am surprised she has not been in other big-budget films, since this was made in 1998. With his under-appreciated charm, Jeffrey Tambor plays his usual character of the slightly dim-witted loser, and Anthony Hopkins is good as always. But this is a star vehicle for Pitt, and he is surprisingly up to the task. I had intended to watch and discard this movie, but now it is a keeper for my video library. Guys - this is a perfect date film. We should all keep a couple of ""chick flicks"" like this on hand, that appeal to women but are more thought-provoking than just their usual Titanic-level garbage.",7

4 August 2009,You can not miss this movie,"Meet Jo Black is a combination of comedy, romance and drama one of the best movies I have ever seen. This film last for three hours and it is a story of Death personified. In this movie you realize the value of life and appreciate the time you have on this planet since nobody knows how long it will last. The story starts with the scene where a couple Joe Black and Susan Parish meet in a cafeteria and find themselves in love; after this he leaves to go to work and while he is on his way he stops to think and wanting to go back to find out more about her he stops in the middle of the street and a car hits him causing his death. On the other hand Susan's father William Parish, a very important man who lives a very stressful life is experiencing a strong pain in his chest and feels like his time is very close to the end. He even starts hearing a voice, the voice of death. At the same time death is looking for a body to use in order to explore and discover how human life is. This body is Joe's body. Brad Pitt as Joe Black, is the perfect wonder, pure joy of the human elements; Antony Hopkins as William Parish brings his years of experience to this character and reflects the perfect business man whose life is out of control and his health is paying the price of his success, and Claire Forlani as Susan Parish the character who is in the middle and does not know what is really happening, she is just a victim of this game. The dialog of this movie is very interesting and sometimes it gets to be scary especially at the beginning of the movie when the death calls Bill to play his last card and then throughout the movie the way death's voice tells them what to do. This dialog puts the audience in a situation where everyone realizes how difficult would be to have a conversation with the death. I am sure nobody knows how to handle it. Lighting in the movie is fantastic with a lovely golden glow that goes by the hand with the soundtrack of Thomas Newman ""What a Wonderful World"" adding an extra depth to this movie. Music truly enhances the movie captivating and enhancing it. The mixture of the piano and orchestra builds up to an inspirational and emotional pull. The cinematography of the film was well thought out and extremely picturesque. This is the kind of movie that after you watch it you want to re-watch it more and more times. I absolutely recommend this movie not only for the message it leaves to the audience but also for the outstanding work done combining technology and technique to make the essence of the film come to life.

I want to get drunk to forget what I just witnessed. I just wasted 45 minutes on this «masterpiece». I saw the first 45 minutes but then had to FF the rest of it, I found no joy nor entertainment. Consider yourself lucky if you haven't seen it, I cannot unsee this and I am probably scarred for life.

8 August 2000,"Great idea, but too slow.","I truly wanted to love this movie, but in the end I just wanted it to be over. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't change the channel if I saw it on t.v., but it's just not the kind of movie that you would want to watch over and over.

The cast is what caught my attention with this movie. Sir Anthony Hopkins is, by all rights, one of the best actors still performing. Claire Forlani is a beautiful actress that has a brilliant career ahead of her. And of course there is Brad Pitt who has put out a decent amount of credible work. Even with this kind of acting muscle behind it the movie wasn't the gripping story that it should have been.

Most of this comes from the fact that the movie has such a dark undertone to it. There isn't any real sense of joy at any point. Even the love scenes between Pitt and Forlani leave you feeling as though it was just a cold exchange between two people weary from the troubles of their lives. There just isn't any chemistry behind the two of them.

The story also tends to drag on. A little more editing should have gone into the movie to get it to move a bit better. At the end you feel as though you've watched a three part mini-series without commercials.

Watch this one on t.v. Don't spend any money on it.",6
12 December 2005,better than I expected,"I have just seen the movie on TV. It is telling the story in a little bit slow way, but still it is worth seeing. The movie is much better than I expected... Love will always have a place in every heart, even if we know what it takes. I agree with the idea ""Every one has secrets and we have to find a way to face our secrets""... I liked the relation of Joe Black with the old woman the most. She was the one that knows the real life. May be that's why she understood that he is the angel of death... The time for every one comes, whether we like it or not... It is amazing to realise what we have before it is too late for us and in Joe Black we see the relation of love, life and death in a very logical way...

29 January 2011,Beautiful and romantic,"Wow, what a surprise! I usually watch action movies such as Aramgeddon, Bad Boys, Strange Days, and Star Wars, so I had absolutely no interest in watching this film. My mom kept telling me how great it was, so when she said she had watched it three times in two weeks, I knew there had to be something to it. Let me tell you, I was hooked right from the beginning, and captivated until the very end.

This movie makes you remember that it is the people you love that make life worthwhile. I thought about my deceased grandfather, and my former wife in particular. But it only made me recall all the good, happy times with them, and just kind of reminded me of what is important in life.

It's really hard to describe this film, and explain what it is that enamored me, but all I can say is JUST WATCH IT.

I think the reason this movie did poorly at the theater is because the trailer does not portray accurately what it is about. After watching the film, I watched the trailer on the DVD, and said, ""That is not the movie I just watched.""",9
30 July 2023,Strikes the Right Emotional Chords for me. Mortals have their own virtues,"No regrets.... It's a good feeling isn't it?

Well I fear this will be eventually be added to my list of guilty pleasure movies. In my opinion any particular cinema that makes me feel, think, relate and lingers with me even after it has ended has succeeded in doing it's job.

From a PoV of a budding cinephile who has seen many exquisite works of brilliance, this one does not check the boxes in many aspects. This is stretchy, it takes it's own time to weave the narrative, few plot points are lazily handled and of course logic & reasoning takes a back seat sometimes.

But.... from the PoV of an admirer of art and basic humane sentiments & feelings it does check a lot of boxes.

A particular scene of this movie along with another has been made viral a lot and honestly that is one of the reason why I had wishlisted this one a long time back. Post some research I found how this one had quite a few nominations in the Worst category and it is a whopping 3 hours long which threw me bit off track. But finally I made time to watch it today.

And oh boy, I have no regrets whatsoever. I thoroughly liked the movie, almost whole of the 180 odd minutes. It had it's subtleties and I feel it never really forces the audience to feel sad and sympathetic about it's characters, but it still unknowingly managed to leave me teary eyed by the end. It explores human emotions, love and sacrifice in a way that feels real and relatable.

On the logical part, I can't help but think aloud that this movie is always a fantasy and the events can never happen in reality, so there is no point in deeming it unrealistic; and also the behaviour of Death to be illogical. Maybe there are some things/feelings exclusive to the mortal beings that even eludes an immortal timeless entity like ""Death"".

And there is nothing much to say about Anthony Hopkins performance. He slays as always.

This one really strikes the right chord for me and I will definitely be visiting this again.

-It's hard to let go, isn't it?

-Yes.

-That's life. What can I tell you?",8
18 May 1999,"Great concept, a tad long.","I liked the idea, but I think they could have cut certain scenes down considerably, saved time, and still have made this film impactful. For instance didn't the scene in the study when Bill first sees Joe kind of drag on just a little too long? Maybe I'm a little impatient, but I kept thinking, ""Okay okay, we get it! Let's move it along!"" In fact this holds true for many scenes, including that first family dinner scene with Joe. They could have wrapped up this movie in a nice, tidy 2 hours without losing any of the emotional qualities. As far as the ending, didn't Brad Pitt seem like he was having a few problems believing his own lines. I thought I saw him struggling to maintain a straight face while saying something to the effect of, ""Well, I don't really know what happened after the coffee shop, but hey! Looks like you got a nifty little party going on..."" Me? I guess I'd be just a tad more disoriented and just a smidgen more incredulous as to how one minute I'm in a coffee shop with the woman of my dreams, and then suddenly I'm standing with her at a groovy soiree dressed in a tux. But hey, that's me. I guess I'm funny that way. Brad just seems to go with the flow on that one. And how about Susan. She seems to accept the death thing pretty well. I mean her father disappears over a hill with some guy she falls in love with who just happens to be death, right? Then the guy comes back alone, and all she can say is, ""I wish you could have known my father. C'mon, lets party."" And off they go hand in hand. I really did like this film, however. There is an undeniable emotional quality, especially during the scene with Bill and Susan near the end. A little long, however. Ridiculous in certain parts.",
30 September 2018,For your consideration...,"Firstly, this movie is an hour and a half longer than it needed to be. There is so much dead air that does nothing for the narrative.

Secondly, a much better movie would be watching the social, emotional, physical, romantic, and over-all FALLOUT that would happen because of what happens in the last half hour.

Thirdly, I want to strangle the sound designer. ""Accenting the emotions"" my ass.

3 October 2006,Idea,"I have watched the movie several times but i don't seem to get enough of it.It clearly showed that a lot of effort was put to the making of it. Ihave an idea, this is how it goes: I think it should make a come back possibly with the same crew and few recruits if possible. This time Bill showing us the trips he took with Joe Black and how difficult it was for him to be taking lives and separating people. This times will be giving the viewers the feeling that Bill has come to contact with (the touch of death, smelling and discussing lives to take and why and when). Drawing a picture of the good and the bad side about death. I think this kind of thinking can also set in motion lot of minds and the thinking around the death.

5 April 2019,A movie for your soul,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",10
5 October 2009,"Really, Really Long","Anthony Hopkins is wonderful in this film. Marsha Gay Harden was also spot on.

Brad Pitt...well, that was a head scratcher. Can't say that I would know how to play death and it appeared Mr. Pitt did not either. The only thing I could gather from the performance was that death appears to have Asperger's.

The film was very long and drawn out, scene after scene. If there had been more delivered, that would have been fine but the film seemed to be so enchanted with it's ""deep"" message that it just KNEW we would need lots and lots of time in every scene to take it all in. Ummm, nope, not that deep, tell me the story and move it along, thank you very much.

Beautifully filmed but plodding and overly enamored with itself. Could have been a real gem in the right hands.",5

5 August 2001,A brilliant 2 hour movie (if only it was),"Yes it is too long, and it needs to be edited. But if you invest the time in this movie and let your mind explore the questions posed by it's story (preferably during the slower middle part) then you will be greatly rewarded. The performances are brilliant. The script good, I especially loved the flawed characters. The Cinematography beautiful and the Score excellent. My only complaint is about the editing. Seconds could have been cut from almost every scene and the story would have still been in place and the pacing would have been better. I've seen it twice now and I still love this film.

7 December 1998,Death comes faster than you think...(!),"I really liked this movie although it definitely is too long. But having a whole plot working up to the one point which has to come (the death of Bill Parrish) is a bit boring as the audience can feel the conditioning they go through. For example: In ""Die Hard 2"" we can see the people in the plane that is going to crash. Why? So that we can feel bad about this and hate the evil guy. Hadn't we seen the people we might even have liked the explosion. This could have been done more subtle. But as I said: I liked the movie!

24 January 1999,A Miracle,"This movie is nothing short of a miracle. What a simple and old story we´ve seen so many times on the screen and on stage throughout the world! But this time, it really takes you away beyond ordinary cinema story-telling. The movie works perfectly because of an excellent director who creates the exactly right atmosphere full of romance and humor, and who never crosses the fine line between cheap entertainment and art; because of outstanding actors (Brad Pitt has never been as good as in this movie, Hopkins outdoes himself, and Claire Forlani is just breathtaking - in every sense of the word) and because of a very sensitive and beautiful music. And whatever bored and cynical critics tell you - this movie is not a single minute too long! Can´t wait until it will be relased on DVD!

10 November 2018,Rather dull feature film considering the amount of talent involved,"Meet Joe Black is ultimately a disappointment and an an exercise in how one should understand the pacing of the movie. Starring Brad Pitt, Claire Forlani and Anthony Hopkins this is based on an older film called Death takes a Holiday (1934). Brad Pitt dies and is reborn as ""death"" and enters a wealthy mogul's life to understand the meaning of life, meanwhile falling in love with his daughter. The pacing is a killer and sorry to say but the acting is pedestrian- especially Brad Pitt. It seems they're all here to collect paychecks to buy mansion, the likes shown in this film. Avoid.

10 March 2013,"A very short review for a very long movie. A very long, awful movie.","It is not that we don't love long movies (we love many long movies)....or sensitive, deep movies (we love many such movies). But to combine length, with weak plots and leaky writing, with regrettable acting - well, that's a deal breaker. We love Howard's End, Remains of the Day, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Lost in Translation - but we absolutely hated this movie. The awkward, long pauses (when Pitt and Hopkins had that weird stare off going, I was praying for the Larry David Curb Your Enthusiasm type scenes with squinting and face making!)....bizarre face contortions (Claire, why?), and amazement at such nuggets as why Joe Black was ignorant of peanut butter (or, indeed, why he was eating at all!).....don't walk, run from this mess!

After reading these comments all those males out there who felt threatened by your girl friends falling for brad get over it and enjoy the movie. I thought it was fantastic and having done drama in school myself can see the difference between good and bad acting and this movie gets a ten out of ten.

Anthony Hopkins is great as the dying billionaire, and Claire Forlani is an actress I hope to see more of. Go see this film right now. It's one of the best romantic movies in a long time.

23 August 2003,Meet Joe CRAP!!,"One of the lousiest movies I have ever seen. Decided to watch it because of Hopkins and Brad Pitt. Hopkins is great as usual, but Brad Pitt was really pathetic as an actor. I guess the fault lies with the script writer and the director. They seemed to be totally confused about how to project Pitt's character as Joe Black. Besides, I felt he was horribly miscast. The least said about the storyline the better. The concept is commendable but the presentation just got on my nerves. Watch it only if you have nothing else to watch!!

19 June 2005,A better movie than I originally thought...,"I didn't particularly care for this movie when I first watched it, but on viewing it a second time I had a different judgment. This is a movie that has its own pace, a little slow at times, and the viewer must adjust to it. Once you're attuned to it, the movie has a charm and a poignancy that makes it possible then to see that it's about the transcendency of love over death. When ""Death"" comes to earth in the form of Joe Black to find out what it's like to be mortal, he learns that love trumps ""Death,"" though not in quite the way one would expect. It's a fantasy based loosely on ""Death Takes a Holiday,"" a 1934 film directed by Mitchell Leisen. The luminous presence of Claire Forlani as Susan lends beauty and a moving piquancy to the scenes between her and Brad Pitt as Joe Black. When one sees Susan and Joe Black together, one wants the scene to last ""forever."" Anthony Hopkins is as usual excellent, though it seems by now that he could almost, to use a cliché, phone in his performance. Brad Pitt is studiedly thoughtful, and one can almost see the wheels turning in his head as he portrays Joe Black.

It's a long film that could have been a little shorter without sacrificing the mood or the plot. The music, by Thomas Newman, is a perfect complement to the movie, though once or twice I thought it a little loud and thus intrusive.

Forget what the professional critics have said. See this movie, but be prepared to let it sink in.",9
27 May 2021,I've seen it so many times!,"I can never be bored of this movie. I like it a lot! It's interesting, funny at times and it definitely brings tears to my eyes. Claire Forlani is so beautiful in this movie, she always amazes me. Don't miss this movie. It's good.

2 August 2010,Abysmal,"If you look up the word ""diarrhea"" in the dictionary, this movie will come up in the definition. This is the worst movie ever made in the history of time. If you took all the worst aspects of all of the worst movies ever made and combined them into a single film, Meet Joe Black would make the finished product look like The Godfather. Words cannot describe the atrocity that this film commits on all of creation by existing. Given the choice between watching Meet Joe Black and throwing myself into a volcano, I would seriously consider the latter. 3 hours of pure and unadulterated cinematic putrescence. One of my recurring nightmares consists of being forced to watch this film.

17 November 1998,Death with a heart,"Despite its long running time (3 hours), Meet Joe Black manages to keep the audience enthralled with its captivating characters, and emotional story. Basically this movie is about ""Death"" learning about life. ""Death"" takes the form of a human in order to learn about life and what are its qualities if any. In doing so, he falls in love with the daughter of the man he's supposed to bring to death. He must now decide whether to take the woman he loves into death, or leave her on earth to experience the goodness of life he's learned about.

Meet Joe Black is a movie loaded with romance and drama. The former part including scenes with Brad Pitt and Clair Forlani flirting with each other, or making love. There is a lot of chemistry between the two, and it just brings a smile to your face when they interact with each other. Anthony Hopkins brings a lot of drama to this movie, by outstandingly playing the part of a loving father with two daughters who must bear the weight of his company on his back. This movie is well acted, and shouldn't be missed. You'll leave the theater, knowing how precious life is and that love can even conquer ""Death"".",9
24 May 2004,Waaaaay tooo looong and (ouch) painful.,"For the first time in my life, I walked out of a theater seriously considering whether I should write to the producer, director, distributor, whomever, to see if they would give me my money back. Multiple times I had considered walking out in the middle, but instead waited to see if there was some payoff in watching it through to the end. There wasn't. And those are hours of my life I will never get back!!! I thought this film contained some very poor acting (with the exception perhaps of Anthony Hopkins -- but even then, it was probably not his best considering the acting quality of those he was working with). Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani were irritating throughout. And, I really didn't understand why this movie had to be so long. Some serious editing might have helped, but even then, I'm not sure if that could have overcome the acting.

Well, I hope that this would not happen by me saying how great this movie is. But it is definitively one of my favorites. enjoy!

4 May 1999,When movies are at their best...,"Movies are at their best when actors are allowed to do what they do: act. Director Martin Brest isn't afraid to allow his principals (Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt, and Clare Forlani) to take their time making their characters real for us. And these characters are real--they not only live, they also breathe on the screen. In fact, Brest luxuriates in the story-telling process and allows us to revel in the glorious results. This is an exquisitely emotional film, delicate and beautiful, brutal and incisive. Although some reviews have criticized its length (approaching three hours) and pacing, the truth is that virtually every scene is vital. In fact, some sequences seem to move with somewhat less smoothness and subtlety than others, suggesting that, even at its current length, the film has been extensively edited for time. Hopkins is ferociously good; Pitt is enigmatic and engaging; Forlani is breathtaking, luminous, a revelation of deep and naked emotion. Inspired by ""Death Takes a Holiday"" (1934), ""Meet Joe Black"" is less concerned with what happens in the next life than with how to live fully and with integrity in this one.

4 June 2005,Whisper of a thrill,"It's kinda hard to write about this movie. It's one of the most popular romantic movies, and I'm not surprised at this fact. As I experienced it's really enjoyable though sometimes it's a little confusing. Maybe because of the 2 main topic: death and love. Brad Pitt or rather: Death went on a holiday to find out ""mortal coil"", and he asked William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) to be his travel guide before he takes him to the other world. The only problem is that in the meantime Death falls in love with William Parrish's daughter: Susan. (Claire Forlani)

This is really an unique movie. (Funny but still sentimental.) Not just because of the unique story, but because of the unique actors, and music. Thomas Newman did his best again. Just like in Pay if forward for example.

Sometimes you will find this movie a bit worn-out and trivial, but it still worth watching at least once. So if you are in the mood and you're alone, just get yourself a glass of wine and meet Joe Black.",9
13 November 1999,"Stunning, but not everyone's cup of tea!","Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani and Brad Pitt - brought together under the direction of Martin Brest paves the way for an emotional and frankly quite compelling love story where Brad Pitt pays the cleverly unusual role of Death as ""Joe Black"".

Having assumed the body of a recently deceased earthling (which I won't elaborate on), Joe explains to ""Bill Parrish"" (Anthony Hopkins) that he wants to spend some time in the life of the famous millionaire, to experience the way of life - the key being that as long as Bill Parrish can keep Joe Black ""interested"" he gets to defer his pending heart attack.

Sounds simple enough but Bill's sweet daughter ""Susan Parish"" (Claire Forlani) sitting at the dinner table when Joe arrives complicates this otherwise simple theory (as love tends to do!)

This is a very long film - perhaps a little too long to maintain the interest of some viewers.

If you get through the first 15 or so minutes of this film (the coffee shop and associated scenes) and find it enjoyable the rest of the movie will simply fall into place. There are a few sub-plots hatching concurrently

Having browsed other reviews, it is obvious Meet Joe Black won't appeal to everyone.

I think it's a great film. The cinematography is excellent and I thought the acting was very strong.

And the amazing level of humour brought into the film by Brad Pitt once he starts playing the presumably undefinable role of Death finished it off perfectly.

Oh, and the music... Memorable soundtracks are few and far between. With the exception of 2 out of the 20 tracks they are all original compositions composed and conducted by Thomas Newman. As orchestral staff goes I thought they were stunningly appropriate - certainly emotion provoking without a doubt.

Soundtracks are designed to enhance the movie experience - and this one achieves that. Having seen the movie (DVD), listened to the soundtrack a number of times - then actually watched the movie again I was quite amazed to find the second watch better than the first.

I'd give it 9 out of 10.

Stunning!",9

18 November 2006,Saved by Hopkins,"The way I look at this movie is, what if Anthony Hopkins had NOT starred in it? How good or bad would it still have been? The only answer I can find is that the movie would have been the absolute pits. AH sustained this movie from start to finish. Without him, it would not be worth the cost of blank DVD disk.

The story was blah, the other actors were more blah. Claire (Susan) was unbearably saccharine and inept to the point where she made me wince with embarrassment. That constant flitting of her eyes up and down and left and right.. ugh! Coupled with her shifty smile/grimace, it was enough to bring out the barf bag. I cannot understand how this can be anyone's definition of emoting.

Brad Pitt didn't have a whole lot to do, except stand around looking impassive and making monosyllabic dialog. Wouldn't have been any better/worse if they'd picked the other actor best suited to playing a lamp-post - Keanu Reeves.

In terms of storyline, it was just passably interesting. ""Heaven Can Wait"" with Warren Beatty was more interesting, in the same theme.

I watched it on AMC too, and cussed my way through every commercial break. Just wanted the damn thing to finish, so I could check it off my to-watch list. In the end, I wasn't sure whether I cussed more at the commercials or at the movie itself.",3
26 November 1999,"The most amazing thing about ""Meet Joe Black"" is . . .","Claire Forlani! The quality of her acting was eclipsed only by the quality of her beauty. What an extraordinary face! Kudos as well to Sir Anthony, who is perhaps incapable of a poor performance. There were some touching moments to this film, and I found myself liking it better than the critics said I would. I can hardly wait to experience more of Ms. Forlani!!!

21 August 1999,Beautifully Done - Best Movie of the Year,"I fell in love with Claire Forlani. Now I see why everybody loves Brad Pitt. I'm not surprized that he won an Oscor for is work in 12 Monkeys. He deserved one for Legends of The Fall too. However, Claire Forlani made this movie work and I am very disappointed that she did not at least get a nomination in some category.

I enjoyed Armageddon, but Meet Joe Black is special.

2 February 2001,Too many loose ends,"Though the acting was fairly good, there were just too many loose ends, not the least being how a man who is seen at the beginning of the film to have been hit head on by two different cars going two different directions returns at the end of the film without a scratch on him and dressed, nonetheless, in tails...it just doesn't work. And such an interesting idea to work with; what a waste. Brad Pitt fans will enjoy the film, nevertheless. Too bad; he can be good.

11 April 2000,The reason films were made,"Meet Joe Black is everything that films are about. Because it it is a message, a story and an experience that leaves you with ideas, hopes and dreams. You could call it a love story, but the film has so many truths and encounters that count for so much in life that I would call it an experience. The setting of the rich lifestyle gives an arena where money & material things are not an issue, but the fact Hopkins' character has to lose his life's work shows that no matter how material people are, we should respect others lives and what they are worth. The fact that Hopkins' will soon be dead put an immediacy on things and then we have to see a character who is bright and intelligent think about the things that are most important to him. This film handles everything so beautifully, the way the characters are also well placed but are then put with the rogue factor of Joe Black, I wasn't sure who was to be more unwelcome in their environment, death or the people that came into contact with him. For someone like myself who hopes to make their own films in the future, I wish I could make something as clever, thoughtful but above all, emotional as this. The score is fantastic as I'm sure everyone else will tell you. I love punk rock and soul music but the classical pieces in this film were nothing short of exceptional. As for Brad Pitt's performance and the way in which Death is portrayed, Death would really be that mellow and calm, cause I mean you have to live with being the bearer of the worst news possible for everyone who ever existed, you gonna be mellow ok?! I will live my life by this film, and those who discard it should take a look at what they want in life and watch this film again and again and again",
16 February 2019,There are certain do's & dont's..,"It's not that this film doesn't have merits.. it does: Thomas Newman's score.. Chivo's cinematography.. but this is not Gone With The Wind.. and it's never a good idea to take 180 minutes to do what could have easily been done in 90 minutes!

When a senior recommended this gem of a movie to me in 2021 saying why haven't I watched this till now, I didn't pay much attention. But now after I've watched this twice, whenever someone ask me what to watch, this is the first one I recommend.

2 hrs. 58 mins. Of pure drama with a touch of great background score. Clair Forlani, you beauty. The way she looks in this movie, I'm not a bit surprised that the death himself falls for her.

Anthony Hopkins & Brad Pitt, two of the greatest this industry has seen facing each other which just makes you want that this must go on & on.

One scene that will always remain in my heart is where Forlani comes out of the pool and Brad pitt is having just peanut-butter out of a spoon. That when you hear the soundtrack A frequent Thing. Another one is the coffee-house scene. One where both watch each other at different point of time while walking away from each other. Just wow!!!

All I can say is one cannot miss this.",9
10 August 2021,"Truly inspiring movie, totally enchanting and a must watch movie","It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",9
9 February 1999,"Great beginning, good middle, slow end","In this movie Brad Pitt plays Death on vacation in a human body. I have to start out by saying that the car accident in with which he obtains his host is the best RTA I have ever seen comitted to film. Genuinely disturbing, but not as disturbing as the people who insist on laughing at unfunny things in the cinema.

Following from the interesting beginning the movie moves slightly into 'fish out of water' mode. However it dabbles in this genre just the right amount. It doesn't go overboard as you would expect in a kids' film, and these moments show Pitt at his best.

As we approach the middle of the film, the romantic interests come out and things do start to slow down. Some scenes are torturously drawn out and over-long.

Having been charmed by Pitt's character, we now come to realise that by not being human Pitt doesn't just not know which knife to use at dinner, or what peanut-butter is, but he doesn't understand the love or comittment that humans can demonstrate for each other. He doesn't realise that human beings are not toys that you can just take without paying for.

Come the latter part of the movie things have all but ground to a halt. This movie could easily lose half an hour. It is very unfortunate as the ending *is* good, just tainted by the length of time taken to resolve plot points.

All in all quite an original film, but you are forced to suffer somewhat before they give up the goods. Kinda like having to wait in a long queue to go on a rollercoaster ride, or having to sit through a time-share demonstration before you get to pick up your free prize.",7
1 November 2002,Far above the norm,"Most modern movies use tricks and conceits to grab and hold your attention. This movie, like its protagonist, fails to stoop to such manipulation, instead gently allowing you to bring out your best. The message here is very simple - love, be courageous, accept your weaknesses and failures but don't let them hold you back. The acting is so precise and compelling, that no tricks are necessary to carry you along into what should be an unbelievable premise. Brad Pitt pulls off the daunting task of portraying a non-human discovering what being human is, from the first taste of peanut butter to the pain and rapture of love. Anthony Hopkins is a mouthful of fine wine from a lead crystal glass - so odd to think this could be the same man who plays a cannibal elsewhere. If you feel an unexamined life is not worth living, you'll enjoy this film.

28 April 2001,A Pleasant Surprise!,"Am not a particularly big fan of Brad Pitt -- no particular reason -- just haven't watched many of his movies......But a most pleasant surprise having just watched ""Meet Joe Black."" Had missed slightly one-half hour, but found myself very, very much taken in by the dialogue, most significantly between Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins -- Mr. Hopkins being the most superb actor he is indeed......very intelligent plot.....having absolutely no clue who Joe Black was...I respected Mr. Pitt's nuanced skills -- conveying overall innocence; a sense of detachment; wonder, and especially conviction and strength as he was ""sparring"" with Mr. Hopkins....I don't feel the film was slow. On the other hand, it built up gradually a very plausible and believable story......good film!

4 November 1999,a three hour long movie that seemed like eternity,"By the time this movie ended, I was beginning to hope that the Grim Reaper might pay me a visit to end my misery - if he came in the guise of Brad Pitt, of course. I don't think that I have ever watched a movie that took so long to say so little. As a rule, I find movies that deal with the supernatural highly suspect. This is particularly true of those that try to do so in a ""user-friendly"" manner as MJB tried to do. As always, Anthony Hopkins' performance was magnificent, but, unfortunately, that was about the only thing that made this movie bearable. Brad Pitt is a very good (if not, yet, great) actor, but his talent isn't enough to shine through this dim-witted romp through never-never land. He spends most of his time throughout the movie just standing around eating peanut butter, being coyly silent and smiling like the cat that ate the canary. The ""cafe scene"" early in the movie was very good, with good interaction between Pitt and Claire Forlani, but the rest of the movie was, well, just plain dead. In my humble opinion, don't waste three hours of your life on this one; let it rest in peace, the real thing will come soon enough. (6/10 thanks to AH)",6
25 February 1999,Gets better each time you see it,"I went to this film the first time simply because I adore Brad Pitt. However, I have now seen it 6 times, and not just because of him. I think it may well become one of my favourite films of all time, and will be critically appreciated more in the future than now.

The script is excellent. There are a lot of subtle hints and throw away remarks which you simply tend to miss first time around, especially those of the delightful supporting cast. Jake Weber as Drew is particularly enjoyable. The elder daughter, Alison, says at one point ""I should get my head examined again."" This is just about the only clue we ever have to suggest that life in the Parrish family is not idyllic, and it is simply left hanging, not followed up. Like real life in fact.

The sets are fabulous; it is worth seeing for Bill Parrish's library alone. I read somewhere that it is the most expensive non-special effects film ever made and I can quite believe it.

It is often said to be over-long, but after 6 viewings I would be hard-pressed to say where I could cut more than a couple of minutes.",9
25 February 2006,Very touching and beautifully done,"We have watched it SEVERAL times.

A well played out movie with a beautiful score.

I was so intrigued by all performances and was literally drawn in and convinced of the feeling of newity (not sure this is a word but works for me) in Joe Black's experiences. Witty and charming like a child was he.

Then of course Anthony Hopkins was great as usual. Everyone else added their flair to make the movie whole.

Not action packed but full of wonderful happy and sad moments.

The sound track was very touching and tied it all together.",10
4 July 2009,It is worth the three hours,"When William Parrish is about to die, Death, in the body of Brad Pitt makes a deal with him: he will live longer than planned as long as William be his guide in Earth.

After the deal the story develops in a very natural way. Death proves the Earth' passions one by one (food, desire, love, anger) and these moments make the movie be worth it. Brad Pitt knew how to act like a naive child discovering a new world, and, at the same time, like a serious and cold creature.

Claire Forlani also made an outstanding job. It's impossible to imagine another actress to interpret Susan, the beautiful, shy and naive William's daughter. Both roles (Death and Susan) worked perfect together, what contributes to the success of the movie.

The negative point is the length of the movie. The movie itself is not too long, but the scenes are. There are some that it takes about 10 seconds for the character to say something, and this slows down the rhythm so much.",9
11 February 2005,Meet Joe Black is perfect.,"I do not find any movie ""perfect"" but I find many movies good enough to use that term. I liked each character and thought they were well casted.

Brad's earthly ""innocence"" about normal human activities is extremely well done and Hopkins seems to play himself. I would love to know him better since he is always best when he plays the man he surely must be, 3 hours is long but I remained completely engrossed. I will watch it again with relish because there is much to savor as far as I am concerned.

The necessary personal confrontations - hard and soft - are well filmed but Brad's first love encounter does a great job of capturing innocence satisfied.

I have had fairly little concern for Brad before but now find him worthy of watching more.

15 November 2003,My All-TIME favorite movie!!,"This movie (despite its 3 hour running time) is by and far the best movie I have ever seen. With riviting performances by both Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt, I can't see why anyone with half-way decent taste in movies would ever say a negative thing about it. Brad Pitt plays a suprisingly strong role as Death, even next to someone with the acting chops that Anthony Hopkins has.

Ever since 'Legends of the Falls' I have been waiting to see an Anthony/Brad reunion, and I must say, this performance by and far tops the previous one.

I still can't really understand why this film didn't recieve an Oscar for that year or why the critics trashed it like they did. But, coming from a fan of film like me, this movie is Oscar-caliber.

The supporting cast also shows strong presence and I say it is a wonderful job done by all!

14 November 1998,a MUST SEE movie for true romantics,"I just saw Meet Joe Black and I was very impressed with

everything about it. The acting, the cinematography, and the plot..even though it was LOOSELY based on the Fredric March 1934 classic, Death Takes A Holiday. In order to like this movie, you have to:

1. Be a romantic 2. Like long movies and 3. Not be so darn picky about little mistakes.

I think thats the problem with Net Critics like James Bernatelli & conservative critics in the media, they analyze movies too much. Go to the movies, see Meet Joe Black, order a drink & popcorn, sit back & enjoy a FINE romantic/dramatic/comical movie, Meet Joe Black.

24 February 2002,i absolutely loved this movie,"people usually think that since i am young i am completely devoid of the ability to properly judge a movie, but they are wrong. i loved the subtleties that Anthony Hopkins brought to his character, steering it away from the cookie-cutter image of a misunderstanding, overbearing father. and Brad Pitt was brilliant in bringing a child-like quality to Joe--i just fell in love with him when he licked the spoon with penut butter on it. this is a great date movie as well as an intelligent drama/romance.

14 October 2000,"So, um, er, is there a god?","Loved the coffee shop scene and the sense of joy on the faces of two beautiful, young people. But that gets lost when Brad Pitt decides to play the Grim Reaper as a sleepy Mr Bean. And what was it with all the hesitations? There was a chance here to explore, lightly or profoundly, an interesting area. How come Anthony Hopkins doesn't ask a few more questions about life after death, about God, about good and evil, about chance, about what Gene Kelly's up to these days? Silly movie, but enjoyable.

8 May 1999,"A truly excellent movie, the way Hollywood used to make them","I had decided I would see this movie from the very beginning, and I was not disappointed. I was amazed by how involved the story was, and how each character was clearly developed. I got lost in the story, I watch it at least once a week. Most movie's lately lack that certain Hollywood magic, that feeling of grandeur. With the exception of Pleasantville, this is the only movie I saw last year that possessed that quality. It does not rely on special effects, or cliches, it simply asks you to follow this story, and it's characters, and I did. I felt that it was Oscar material in every way, and I regret the criticism it's been forced to take. As for the three hour running time, I say only this, it could not have been shorter, every moment was required to convey each detail. Since seeing it, I have gone back and watched other movies by Martin Brest, and this one was truly the most impressive.

17 November 2006,Music and dialog,"I enjoyed the movie, watching it on the TV. The biggest problem I had was hearing the dialog between Brad Pitt and his love interest.

Is it just my poor hearing or did others find this a problem? My wife and I both had this problem. At one point I turned up the volume to the maximum, and it still seemed like they were whispering. This is not the first movie in which this situation has occurred.

I would appreciate a response from anyone who has or has not experienced this type of a problem.

Thank you.

16 May 2004,Silly,"There are NO mythical room big enough for Death in a straight romantic movie such as this! I usually love the character Death in movies or literature, but this installment became just completely bullocks! It is simply not believable. Death falling in love? arg! Silly, silly, silly!

I gave it a 3 in voting - the only thing that saved it from me giving it a grade 1, is Anthony Hopkins who, as always, is giving a splendid performance. Anthony is just a lovely and talented actor - why did he say yes to this movie? Did he need some extra cash?

No; please! Don't rent/buy this movie. It is a waste of money! AND time!

6 March 2023,veri noice,"Veri noice movie, to cheesy for me tho. But I can also enjoy a movie that is 6 years younger than me. I think everyone plays their role very good and makes the movie more fun and entertaining. Even if it is 3 hours long it makes it feel like its a normal 1-1,5 hours movie and that is something I can appreciate because I have a hard time sitting through a normal movie. And this movie leaves you satisfied unlike movie from today and thats what I really like about this movie. You can really sympathy with some roles as they seem real and that gets your attention. And with that said I think this is simply a beautiful movie.

Once you have seen it, take a step back, and really think about what you have just seen. Think about how sometimes you have so much love for someone, but that you stillsometimes have to let them go. Yes, it will hurt, but you never know what will come along to appease that hurt. Enjoy!

11 April 1999,Wouldn't want to meet Joe Black,"Meet Joe Black was a big fat dumb bore that got more and more ridiculous especially with the idea that death comes to earth in the form of a man with plans to stand by some old rich guy and watch him work then fall in love with the old man's daughter (who if she found out will be found in the tabloids with the headings: I SLEPT WITH DEATH). As everyone knows this film is too LONG! Three hour of babbling is just pointless and could be condensed into a mere hour! The movie was a joke - a pointless waste of time.

12 January 2000,Great performances; worth the length,"I went into this movie skeptical....then it started slow. I didn't see a lot of promise for it, but by the end of the first hour I was completely hooked, and now I've watched this movie countless times.

Great performances all around....and although choosing the best is tough, I'd have to go with Anthony Hopkins. He put on an amazing performance as Bill Parrish, a great character who is very prominent in the emotional climax of the movie.

Brad Pitt was amazing as Joe Black...as has been pointed out in reviews (and in the making-of featurette on the DVD), death is a fairly impossible role to prepare for, but Pitt pulled it off wonderfully. Black is a character that definitely has to grow on you, but once it does, you'll have a great appreciation for Pitt's performance.

Claire Forlani did a good job in keeping up with the great cast all around her. She pulled off Susan Parrish very well, and was believable throughout the film. The character of Susan was one that I didn't particularly care for, but Forlani deserves credit for a very nice job.

This movie is just great all-around...it will invoke every emotion inside of you. Don't let the length deter you...by the end, you'll agree that it was worth every second. Don't let the subject of the movie deter you either....it's far more positive of a movie than you'll expect. I give this movie a 9 out of 10, and strongly recommend it for everyone.",9
30 December 2001,Do you have any peanut butter?,"This movie is so well done. Some may say it drags things out, but I think that made it more natural. In one scene my family was almost asleep because the Bill Parish character kept saying ""um.,.and...uh "" in a speech he was giving. That is how PEOPLE talk. Movies now a days are so concerned with delivering information quickly that it doesn't even seem like the people are thinking this stuff up off the tops of their heads. No, they seem like people with their lives scripted for them. Wouldn't that be great?

Brad Pitt deserves a lot of credit for this role. He had to convince the audience that the man Susan met in the coffee shop and Joe Black were two very different people. He also handled the other two hard tasks of this role very well: mix innocence and knowledge, and to have an edge to him that portrayed the cruelty we all see Death as. He handled it excellently. Mr. Pitt, you did great things with that character.

GO RENT THIS MOVIE!!!! 8.5/10

Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",6
24 March 2001,A slight slow but is rescued,"My only reason for watching this film was Anthony Hopkins, and I wasn't disappointed in that respect. However, if the film had been any slower I think rigor mortis may have set in. Yes, there were good bits but the hushed voice of Brad Pitt and his quite uneventful love affiar with Hopkin's character's daughter didn't help the film. Although, I must admit the ending did make me fill up a bit but only due to Anthony Hopkin's superb acting as always. If you're a Brad Pitt or Anthony Hopkins fan see it, if not I wouldn't bother.

2 July 2022,Unexpectedly good despite the professional critics,"All the critics bashed this film. Why? Not necessarily a believable plot but believable characters. I thoroughly enjoyed Anthony Hopkins in this picture. This story was a story of such grand design that it must have been an eminent role for him to sink his teeth into... Faced with the certain limits of his mortality, a captain of industry is faced with a surreal proposition: be a guide to Death in life, and for so long as that engagement is useful the man, Bill Parish, shall live -- for Death has been watching him and has deemed him a suitable tutor. What would such a man think? How would he behave in the face of this? I believe this is Mr. Hopkins greatest role. Hannibal doesn't even touch it. And from Bill the camera swings onto other characters and other stars. Each fully believable in their respective roles. The beautiful Claire Forlani, and this, too, is her best role so far. Jeffrey Tambor, his best, from those movies I have seen him in. Memorable performances from Marcia Gay Harden, Lois-Kelly Miller, Jake Webber, and inspired moments from the title character, as played by Brad Pitt, especially as the guy from the coffee shop.

Beautiful pictures. This may be one of the themes of the story: that the meaning of life is to fill oneself up with beautiful pictures before leaving it, but the cinematography in this picture is truly breath-taking, especially in its conclusion.

Emotion. There is one requirement of a top-ten movie in my book and that is that it remains moving, that it causes the same emotions to stir, that it continues to raise feeling. This movie has achieved that for me. It is, in a word, Classic. Time and repeated viewing has left it unaltered.",8
2 January 2002,Superb film - why did I miss this until it made TV?,"Like one of my other all-time favourites, Contact, Meet Joe Black fails utterly if you start watching with any kind of expectations. Also like Contact, you need to have more brain cells than teeth to get to the heart of it.

Having watched and loved The Green Mile, I recognised the Tom Newman score. I also predicted the ending, but there is a reason if you look closely enough. Just like the rest of the film. Nobody could accuse it of being shallow!

Also, on a side note, the social ineptitude of ""Joe Black"" reminded me more than a little of Terry Pratchett's comical DEATH in the book ""Reaper Man"" in which he decides to take a holiday in the world of the living...

5 October 2005,"Good concept, however too slow in delivery","""Meet Joe Black"" begins with this brilliant concept- to personify Death; however the deliverance of the concept, like so many other movies, falters. The movie begins with Willaim Parrish, Anthony Hopkin's character, a highly successful man, with money and power. He is suddenly visited by Death, which takes the form of Brad Pitt's character. Death or Joe Black, as Parrish introduces him as, ask for a tour of human society, and in return, Parrish will have more time on Earth. As the story goes on, this all goes well until, Joe Black falls in love with Susan, Parrish's daughter. Overall I thought the movie started very well, but was average in an entire sense. The movie was much too long ( three hours), and the story seemed to drag. The plot seemed to elongate some scenes, and sometimes the plot seemed too dramatic, trying to send too many messages. If you have three hours to kill or really enjoy Brad Pitt see it, otherwise, you can understand the whole point of the story by reading the description on the back of the DVD cover.

30 December 2002,Original and Mind Blowing,"My first review of this film was way to plain and short because i was short on time so here is my second stab at it. This was an excellant film. It was unique and well thought out. The idea of making a deal with death was well above the screenplays we see today. Although it could have been cut down. It has some clever lines, but some scenes are too long to keep your whole attention. Anthony Hopkins is extrodinary as usual, and Brad Pitt kept up his end of the deal. The best part in this whole film is the witty and clever scene with Bill, Joe, and Drew. I recommend this film for people who appreciate film making and want another piece to critique.

27 December 2002,Excellant,"""Meet Joe Black"" is an excellant film. Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins did a great job. The screenplay was very original and is something thats never been seen before. Its thought provoking and clever. Way above the ordinary films we see today. It keeps your attention for most of the film . It is not an action movie so dont excpect action in it. It is good for its clever dialogue and theme.

5 October 2002,The Most beautiful movie since Forrest Gump,"Like the person who commented before me said, this movie truly is a celebration of life, love, and ultimately death. This film is so beautiful in a way that it is able to portray life, love, and death in a most dramatic way, that shows that even death has a heart. The character of Joe Black is so unique in the sense that he has feelings and that all he wants to do is feel what it is like to be ALIVE. Anthony Hopkins gives his usual outstanding performance as a media tycoon who believes that his company is there for the people and not solely for profit. He shows that his family, and friends are the most important things in his life, not his company. Brad Pitt delivers a most outstanding performance as the simple and curious Joe Black, or Death. He, mind you isn't the ""Death"" we all think of, he is more like the Angel of Death. He only wants to see the world for all it's worth. This film is an absolute masterpiece, a true cornerstone of raw talent, and great drama. This film should hold a place in your heart and it should always remind you to live your life for everything it's worth.

I give this film a 10 out of 10.

13 April 2022,A Page-Turner If Movies Were Books,"This one stays with me. I've got a few favorites and this takes the cake.

Everything about this movie will make you feel emotional, spiritual, joyful, deeply reflective.

Brad Pitt? Yes, please. Marcia giving us all WASPy angst about being second fiddle to Daddy? Amazing. Claire Forlani literally being the raison d'etre? Flawless.

And Anthony Friggin Hopkins. I believe him.

Essentially, stop what you're doing. Watch this movie in maybe two parts. Pause. Reflect. Receive. This is a work of art, not just a Friday night flick.

Cinematography, music, screenplay, the acting, the storyline(s)....

25 November 2018,Unique and masterful in all genres.,"This movie creates the perfect combination of romance, drama, fantasy and mystery, which at the end gives an inmensively sentimal and profound movie.

The characters and storyline are superb in every extent in the movie. The quantity and quality of dialogues of this three hours movie are compelling, unique and undeniable beautiful and eloquent.

The love between Joe and Susan it's unique and beautiful, but yet it's incomprehensible to the extent that at the end it is not clear the knowledge of each other throughout their romance. Love is expressed in all manners throughout this movie, it is shown in fatherly love, fraternal love, sister's love and pure and unreasonable love.

The noble character of the Parrish's make them endearing and highly aimable to love and feel attached to them; Allsion with her lovable loyalty to her father, Bill with who's impeccable honesty and candor, and Susan with her pristine soul that makes her a lovable creature.

This movie it's simple magnificent. It's a testament of love not only to a father, a sister or a lover, but it's also to life.",10
7 July 2002,"The greatest ending to a long, somewhat interesting film.","The ending to this movie is spectacular. The movie itself goes on for a little too long, but Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt, and Claire Forlani make this a movie worth seeing. You may enjoy it, but it probably won't be your favorite film.

11 January 2016,Better it or admit defeat.!,"A timeless classic and a update of how to make a movie. Should be a mainstay in school or anybody in the business or entering it. The big plot isn't the thing here it's the scenes with Susan and Jo that are the mastery, if you watch carefully they are a joy, kind of thing that rarely happens in that last 20 years. All we have now is The Intern and Quentintoo Taratinooo, seems love stories are hard work or expensive to Hollywood, but to be fair there aren't that many Brad Pitts around and this movie is all him, just nice for all the right reasons. A benchmark, that has never been bettered yet and I doubt it ever will, it has some faults but don't we all.

22 May 1999,Get a life.,"This movie has no life, which means no mystery, no suspense, no intrigue, no goal, no reason to be, no clue, nothing. It really does manage to capture the stale pace of death. While watching the movie you really do feel as though you were dead or wish you were dead. Brad Pitt treats his character like a six year old, and Anthony Hopkin's character is well portrayed but in a totally different dimension from the rest of the characters. I felt no love between Forlani and Pitt perhaps because there wasn't any since the movie has no life!

30 June 2002,What a Waste of Time!,"How in the world did they ever talk Anthony Hopkins into taking a role in this long, boring film! The length of the film and the robotic acting of Brad Pitt is enough to put anyone into lullaby land. And the concept of the film is so unrealistic that you keep wondering how can Tony Hopkins keep a straight face while acting as though what is happening to him is the most natural thing in the world. Don't waste your time on this turkey!

18 November 1999,Death meets love,"There's a trend to make films about angels, messengers of death and the Evil one himself. Here's another example of Hollywood's obsession with the supernatural and how the culture clash happens when someone not from this world is thrown into the pot of the big city. This could be Crocodile Dundee 3 if except for the crocodiles themselves. William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), industrial leader, father of 2, on the verge of dying, one night hears a voice inside his head. What to do and who was it? Death arrives a couple of hours later in the shape of Joe Black (Brad Pitt)knocking on the front door at a late dinner in Parrish's huge mansion.

Of course Death falls in love with Parrish's youngest daughter, Susan, who of course is already with a cocky young executive at her dad's communication company. From here on the movie starts to play with the idea of what happens if Death starts to get human feelings. It's a little bit like Terminator 2 where Arnie's robot finds himself caring for the people he is supposed to protect. All this happens while Bill Parrish is trying to save his company on the last days of his life, saving his life monument and besides his daughters, the only positive thing he's done in his life.

Hopkins is by far the film's best actor but this is not a very good movie. It lacks from conflict, it's too much of City of Angels and not enough of The Devil's advocat's provocativeness. All in all, a movie that all Pitt lovers will cherish because of his ""cute"" hair but for the one who wants something mind challening, watch something else.",
10 June 2006,Great movie,"I have been hesitant to watch Meet Joe Black because of how the story sounds. Death takes the form of a young man and takes a vacation with a millionaire and falls in love with his (the millionaire's) daughter. Death then faces a moral issue of whether to stay with his love, or go back from whence he came. Sounds a bit corny, no?

Then after I watched the movie, I immediately thought it was a masterpiece. Believable acting, conveying much emotion, interesting and unpredictable story, and very developed characters. There are interesting twists and characters significantly develop through the movie. Even though you don't like the movie, you would be intrigued by the difference between Joe Black at the beginning of the movie and Joe Black at the end.

I have not included much of the plot in this comment. You should watch the movie yourself. I assure you, it is more than just a love story.

Definitely a must-see.",6
24 October 1999,Love is about not hurting the object of one's affection,"As Larry King stated in USA Today, This is what great movies talk about. Love. Death. Family. Honor. Myth. All of these you will find in ""Meet Joe Black"".

Again, Anthony Hopkins delights us with an extraordinary performance of a man who faces death.

I can't say the same thing about Brad Pitt, who definitely lacked the ""old screening school"" to play Death.

This is another ""must-see"" movie.... specially if you think you're in love. I guarantee you will at least think twice before declaring you're in love after watching this movie.

21 April 1999,absolutely perfect,"Why are there so few people who appreciate ""Meet Joe Black"" as the absolutely perfect film it is !? Undoubtedly my favorite motion picture of 1998 (and I sat through over 250 of them), it is a simply beautiful look at the poetry of life and death. An intoxicating, mesmerizing film of macabre dark humor and romantic fantasy. Brad Pitt (not just another pretty boy given his choice of roles) is better than ever...and I stand in awe of Anthony Hopkins--who gracefully paints the portrait of a man of dignity and honor like few we see in movies anymore. I am moved every time I see this film-- I connect (and not everyone does); with it's representation of everything there is to love in a given lifetime...love between two people, love for your work, love amongst family; and the importance of saying goodbye. I'm a wreck, I'm reduced to a blubbering sissy for almost the entire last half hour (and that lovely ""nice pictures"" moment with the old lady in the hospital) I'm almost emotional typing this review !!! -- How do I respond to criticism of it being boring ? Impatience. I'll admit it's slowly paced. But, its length is a benefit to the story. So few filmmakers take the time and energy (and nowadays, the guts) to flesh out the aspects of a given story --this is what makes great movies people !!! I've also heard complaints about the pregnant pauses--long stretches of silence during one on one conversations between characters that 'seem to exist simply to draw things out longer'. Kids, acting is about more than words...check out what Pitt and Hopkins are doing in those beautiful moments of silence : look at their eyes, watch their face....THEY'RE ACTING !!! Those so-called unnecessary moments of silence shared between characters are priceless in the form of character development. Thank God for Martin Brest; it's four screenwriters; and the entire cast (Jeffrey Tambor will have his day). Thanks to all of them, along came a movie that I can add to the very short list of movies that I can honestly say changed my life.",10
15 June 1999,A Surprisingly Good Drama,"Not being a Brad Pitt fan I didn't see this movie on the big screen. I don't think this movie suffered because of it. It didn't have grand special effects, but it did have a great script and well-acted characters (I can't believe Anthony Hopkins didn't get a nomination) and an interesting, albeit remade, plot. I was very surprised to find that I liked this movie as much as I did--I had been expecting a boring drama in which I watched Pitt cry. Instead, I saw Pitt do a great job of playing through many emotions. I liked this movie and though it is three hours long, I could watch it a few more times.

25 August 2006,One of the best movies of all time,"So many people didn't think much of this 3 hour movie, but for so many reason, it has been my all time favorite for years and will be for years to come. If you are a die hard romantic, a Brad Pitt or Anthony Hopkins fan, it is a must see. To have such simple dialog, so many moments where it was just the music that set the tone, it was simply outstanding. But, then again, you really have to understand the tone and setting for 3 hours to be appealing. Much like the Hannibal Lector series, Anthony's roll commands your attention and the dance between his character and Brad Pitt (as Death) is simple yet the dialog is powerful. I know everyone won't agree with the comments posted, but this really is a movie worth having in your collection.

19 September 2004,It's usually in my top 5,"This is one of my more favored films. The two leading ladies really capture you. Anthony Hopkins is also a pretty classy actor (though why he did the Chris Rock movie is beyond me). Brad is okay, but mostly I think just eye candy.

Yes, this is a remake, please do get over that. They happen, let them stand on their own merit, and forgive them when they try to recycle too much of the original. For me the story wasn't about death the character, but about Hopkins' character. I'd probably have put the title of the movie something closer to ""A Life's Worth"" -- that's what I took from it.

Yah, it is long too. So? What're you doing with that extra 30-60 minutes of your life the movie took, writing a gripe on IMDb? LOL!

I also do not do the tears for a movie bit, I think three have ever done it. And this is one of them, and its the rare one that can do it to me repeatedly. Not always, but sometimes. Maybe its the father story and my own personal experience.",9
26 April 2003,"Meet Joe Black...sooner or later, everyone does!","Although this movie has been seen by many as a horrible remake or secret (remake of ""Death takes a holiday""), I find the acting talent to be amazing, even with stud Brad Pitt. The screenplay, as well, is amazing. I am not a big fan of Brad Pitt or Claire Forlani, but they both did an astounding job along with Anthony Hopkins, who I am a big fan of. This movie is emotionally moving and compelling! Don't take my word for it though, nor the word of any other critic! See for yourself!

27 January 2019,A beautiful struggle of the mind,"This movie is a masterpiece of the humanizing of death. The power we take over it and the brutality love has against it. To witness the cry of death, rattling and stunningly beautiful.

22 December 2018,Boring,"I thoroughly enjoyed the 1971 film of ""Death Takes a Holiday"", but I gave up after two hours of this overlong, tedious film. I started watching because I'm a fan of Anthony Hopkins and because it was likened to ""Death Takes a Holiday"", but Brad Pitt spoke so softly, I had to keep turning up the volume to hear him and although there were some interesting bits, on the whole, I found it utterly boring and terribly predictable.

9 June 1999,Good movie: Could have been great,"Meet Joe Black is just one of those movies that you see a preview for and you feel a deep emotion from it, but then you see the whole movie and wonder where all the emotion went.

Let me just say that Anthony Hopkins is by far the most talented actor on the face of this earth, and he did a great job with his role. Brad Pitt did the job he needed to do. People may think the character was stiff, but that was his role. He was death. Was it just me or does Claire Forlani have a hard time seeing. She is always squinting throughout the film. I was waiting for her to say,""I love you Joe but where are you at exactly"". All the supporting roles were sufficient.

What was wrong with Meet Joe Black, was that you cannot feal any sadness for Brad Pitt a.k.a Death. He is not human so how can you relate to him. By the end of that loooooooonnnnnnnnnngggggg birthday scene I could care less about the human characters also.

The movie was acted well, the direction sucked(slow and tedious even when it wasn't supposed to be), great script, and somewhat good idea. Remember slower and longer is not necessarily better Martin Brest.",
11 July 1999,Great performance by Pitt.,"A wonderful job by the excellent Brad Pitt in what is otherwise a less-than-stellar but okay film. Anthony Hopkins delivers a strong performance, although Claire Forlani's role is reduced to little more than a pretty face who looks at Pitt with lustful longing that's a little bit stalkerville.

13 April 2019,Joe Balck he is!,"I gotta say I saw this movie today! After 21 years of its release date.. and I have to say it's still among the best movies created in cinema history. The way of showing death (Brad Pitt) and the typical things in our life that he didn't know, was subtle. The movie has both Plot - Points that can change the whole view of the viewer. And last but not least, Brad Pitt & Anthony Hopkins played their roles very precisely👍.

3 June 2020,"Has some good things, others not so good","Liked it. I enjoyed watching it except for some scenes i found too long and repetitive. I think the story was ok but i personally didn't like claire fontaine's character and maybe the acting didn't help too. Pitt acted pretty well and Hopkins even better. I recommend it though i would not consider this as a great movie.

12 September 2003,"enjoyable, not fully successful","From Cary Grant to Nicholas Cage, it's a longtime Hollywood tradition (or cliche) to portray angels as noble but fun-deprived beings who long to be human and who envy the mortals in the story. This time the role goes to Brad Pitt, and the sole twist is...he's not an ordinary angel, he is The Angel of Death. Pitt enters Anthony Hopkins' life not to bring divine wisdom and help, but to end Hopkins' human existence. This concept has potential, but the theme of ""death as a blessing"" or ""death as transition to another reality"" was barely touched on. (More on this below).

Many good elements here -- fine actors, FABULOUS music, top cinematography, solid direction. The basic story idea -- about mortality adding extra spice to life and poignancy to love -- comprises a profound and timeless theme.

3 hour length in and of itself is no problem (nobody complains that Lawrence of Arabia is too long). The real problem is, an even stronger emotional payoff and greater romantic thrill could have been achieved with tighter writing and brisker pacing. Many repetitive scenes and speeches should have been trimmed or cut entirely.

Example: check out the key thematic scene with the father and daughter in the helicopter, where Hopkins tells her to seek ""lightning"" in her life. Hopkins is made to repeat his 1-minute speech 3 different times with only slight variations! The sibling rivalry subplot could have been axed; nobody would have missed it...etc.

Pitt's role as an otherworldly spirit who is awkwardly learning to be human led him to choose an odd acting style. Some like it, others loathe it. My problem is not Pitt's acting, but the way the role is written: Death is virtually omniscient about some things including minutiae of human experience (this is perfectly believable for an immortal, godlike being), yet at the same time Death is ignorant and wide-eyed innocent as a newborn babe about other very simple and universal human experiences (this is not credible and was mined for very weak humor).

In this movie, as in most others featuring the Hollywood cliche about ""angels who long to be human,"" the filmmakers reveal a certain poverty of imagination...regrettable in a fantasy, where imagination should be given full play. There is a consistent failure in these films to even consider, much less appreciate, the possibility that a transcendent, metaphysical, purely spiritual existence could be MORE satisfying (and more exciting and more full of love) than a physical, human life based on the senses.

Such a premise would not ruin the drama but would heighten it. For example, Meet Joe Black would have worked better if Death were somehow FORCED to be human for a while, hated it, and saw himself as the Great Liberator who was freeing humanity to transition to a higher, better existence. (In this film Death seems to regard himself as a sort of cosmic elevator attendant: his job is necessary but morally neutral.) Death might then progress from mere intellectual omniscience about every aspect of human existence, to an emotional appreciation that even the meager perceptions and intellects of human beings are capable of love and nobility. (Meet Joe Black came about halfway toward achieving this, but didn't quite make it.)

All the humans who meet Death should see him as a fearful, terrifying scourge. As the film was actually produced, only one character had that reaction (the Jamaican lady in the hospital, and she quickly got over her fear). The other characters in MJB who realized his true identity responded as if Death, in performing his basic function, was the school principal announcing that, regrettably, recess time is over.

In sum: portraying the angel character as one who strongly preferred his otherworldly existence would have sharpened conflicts, deepened the characters' motivations, and eliminated many inconsistencies. It would have invested the Death vs. Hopkins conflict with greater stakes, and made the love story even more poignant.

(By the way: if you personally met the Angel of Death, don't you think you would ask even ONE question about the nature of the afterlife? Even if he refused to answer, somebody in this movie should have asked!)",
15 October 2004,Why did I wait so long?,"I just saw this movie and am wondering why I waited so long to see this wonderful film. The songs and the acting took me to places that few moveis ever have. Brad Pitt does a wonderful job as 'Death', giving the character depth and feeling. He is all at once naive, sweet, bold and daring. You actually believe that death does not have any experience with interacting with people and yet understands love at the end of the movie better than any other entity. Sir Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as the man that challenges death while realizing that he is on borrowed time. The way he acts between protecting his daughter and teaching death about life in just a short period of time was the best acting I have seen Sir Hopkins give since Silence of the Lambs. Definitely a must see for the hopeful romantics of the universe!!!

20 August 2018,An okay one time watch for the cast,"Meet Joe Black is ultimately a disappointment and an an exercise in how one should understand the pacing of the movie. Starring Brad Pitt, Claire Forlani and Anthony Hopkins this is based on an older film called Death takes a Holiday (1934). Brad Pitt dies and is reborn as ""death"" and enters a wealthy mogul's life to understand the meaning of life, meanwhile falling in love with his daughter. The pacing is a killer and sorry to say but the acting is pedestrian- especially Brad Pitt. It seems they're all here to collect paychecks to buy mansion, the likes shown in this film. Avoid.

4 May 2001,It is worth watching!,"Although the film is considered by some to be overly long, and a bit slow, the story is quite captivating, and the performances are outstanding. Brad Pitt is marvelous as the strong, silent, yet curious Joe Black, and the sets are fabulous. This is not your standard Hollywood-style film, and it is a very refreshing departure.

15 November 1998,"too long, but worth a look","Death wants to check out life, so he borrows Brad Pitt's body and crashes at the pad of a multi-millionaire (Anthony Hopkins), who just happens to be a nice guy with a beautiful daughter about to marry a snake. If death always made such good choices, only the bad would die young. The death character is inconsistent. At times, he appears omniscient. He seems to know every sin some of the characters ever committed and he's familar with the IRS (is there a connection here?). But he has to be told what peanut butter is and has to be shown how to eat!

Like Brest's ""Scent of a Woman"", this film is too long but satisfying in the way good characters triumph over bad. And, as death films go, it's much better than ""What Dreams May Come"". In fact, it even has a more dramatic and shattering car accident.My score 7/10.

22 March 2001,Spectacular,"Meet Joe Black is and adaptation of ""Death Takes a Holiday"" movie created in 1934 by director Mitchell Leisen. Meet Joe Black is about a man named William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) who is nearing his 50th birthday and soon discovers he doesn't have long to live. Enter Joe Black or ""Death""(Brad Pitt) who decides to visit William Parrish to offer him a deal where by William gets to live as long as Joe Black is kept entertained and William doesn't tell any one whom Joe Black really is. From this Joe experiences human life and eventually falls in love with Susan Parrish (Claire Forlani) William Parrish's daughter, with his new experiences with life and finding love Joe finds it hard to go back to his job. This movie is great for the romantic at heart and it also has a few tissue moments as well and not to mention a spectacular music score by Thomas Newman that burst out full of emotion. The movie has a well-known cast and the right essence added to it, which makes it wonderful to watch especially on DVD with all the added features. .

23 November 1998,"A wonderful film, very moving.","""Meet Joe Black"" is a wonderful movie. I liked how it let the emotions of the moment, of a scene, play out. It did not jerk you about from one scene to the next or rush you along. Brad Pitt did a terrific job, and Anthony Hopkins was superb as always. As far as I am concerned, this movie is well worth the three hours - which, by the way, you don't really notice.

24 May 2003,There are no words,"There are no words to describe this movie, maybe because in fact there are so many that best fit it that it would be a crime to just use a few. It is excellent, not only because it's plot is so unique but because it takes human emotions to a deeper level. I personally enjoy the whole 'life's meaning' theme and the actual thought of having death take a vacation from it's dreaded routine to finding romance in an unexpected twist of fate. Both Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins's performance are brilliant, as they both go hand in hand in a secret of their own to their up-coming journey to that Next Place. When I watch this movie I seem to be confronted with a bundle of questions that unravel themselves as the movie continues-where do we go after we pass away? what is the meaning of life? why are we here? And I personally enjoy the dialogue between Joe and the Jamaican lady in the hospital as she explains child-like Joe that life is not all fun and games, and that he should take those colorful pictures that he was able to take through out his journey, before he takes unpleasant ones. I fully recommend this film, and hope that you might find it as unique and touching as I did.

10 February 2005,An almost perfect film...and a must see.,"I am not one for romantic movies, but Meet Joe Black is a romantic film that brings tears to my eyes every time I see it. Not only does this film tenderly touch on the wonderment and grandeur of first love, but it tackles other such weighty issues as nobility in the face of treachery, grace under pressure, the importance of honor in keeping ones word when to go back on ones word would be far easier and of course the courage of coming to grips with ones own mortality. Ultimately, Meet Joe Black it is a film about what is best in humanity; what it means to be human.

I will not go into the plot of the film, but I do want to address the main review of this film listed above. I think the reviewer is missing the point of the film when he criticizes the writing and the casting of Brad Pitt in the main role.

First of all, the writing was excellent. Second, it was important for the character of Joe Black to be young for the story to work on all levels. Joe Black needed a mentor. Anthony Hopkins could not have mentored someone his own age. Moreover, Joe needed to fall in love for the first time, and it would have been less believable, and perhaps less palatable, for a man of Al Pacino's age to convey the angst of first love with any semblance of innocence. Claire Falani's character needed her suitor (Joe) to be young so that the romance could be seen as fresh and new, and so that the character of Bill Parrish could see Joe Black as a young man falling in love with his daughter. Brad Pitt's performance was elegant and perfect. His youth, contrasted with Hopkins elegance, makes the relationship between the two characters all the more peculiar and interesting to the other characters in the film, who are on the outside looking in.

The ending requires the viewer to fill in a few gaps somewhat, but if you can do that you will be hard pressed to find a more visually stunning and beautifully told story.",10
9 June 1999,What a good movie!!,"I love this movie! I have not seen a movie this good in awhile. I have never seen a movie that quite captured my emotions like this. It is wonderfully touching sad and romantic at the same time. This film is beyond good. It is great!!

27 November 2002,Under-rated beauty,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",
17 December 2005,"the user comment was malicious; this movie was a very interesting, well-acted, with an amazing concept/idea","The user comment ''the perfect movie when you are alone on Valentine's day'' could be translate like:''If you don't think like me about this movie, your mother is a stupid bitch''. Very clever argument...I mean please... if others have other beliefs, respect them! Althow I wasn't alone on Valantine's day, I consider this movie a very interesting, well acted, based on an amazing concept/idea... It's one of my favorite movies. Am i stupid, or unattractive, or whatever, just because I don't think like the ''user comments''?!? I don't think so.. Gustibus non disputandum.... In the same way, for example, I could say about those who voted another movie, ''Johnson's Family'' with 3-4 ( incomprehensible, the most exaggerated harsh voting i've seen on IMDb; after all, that movie, for his genre-comedy, light, relaxing movie- wasn't so bad), while I 've been much generous with it, that'' They are gay or invidious women'', just because 3 gorgeous women are playing in that movie, and they are playing pretty well...

18 September 2022,Meet the most uninteresting people on the planet,"If a Billionaire's life is as boring as Hopkin's character, I would rather live under a bridge. At least I can count the number of vehicles crossing the bridge as I lay down under the bridge. His family is bored to death and they bore us to death. Speaking of death, he is in this movie but he is the most boring person/super human on the planet including the world the death came from. In Bollywood they did a movie with a similar theme but the producers and director chose a very different route. They made the movie into a comedy. The audience loved the concept and the movie was a blockbuster.

Try to cheat death and try run into him.

9 July 2023,Phenomenal,"Wow.

The movie revolves around Death (brad Pitt) coming to see what the world is like. Wanting to explore he takes the body of a young man and meets with, William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) making William show himself the world. The story develops and death falls in love with Williams daughter, Susan Parish (Claire Forlani) creating a troublesome decision for Death.

This movie was fantastic. The story is carried so well by the acting demonstrated by Pitt and Forlani, was well as Hopkins. Each character is so well developed. And all around very fun.

The theme is definitely Love. The story does a great job at replicating that theme, showing how love works, and how it effects everyone, even death. It shows really the premise of love and the different points of views and how it works. It in all is very well done.

The film was well carried by great lines, beautiful shots, and strong emotions, in all it was so powerful.

However, the one flaw was the movies soundtrack. It played happy music it felt at the worst times. It felt like the soundtrack didn't fit.",9

The movie was much better than I expected, although I initially was put off by the three hour running time. Well written and acted, although it had more pregnant pauses than a yard full of hesitant rabbits. I often felt like walking up to the actors and yelling, ""Say it! Say it!"" Lots of shots of people looking into each other's eyes. Nevertheless, a good flick.

13 August 2004,Loved it. A movie made with passion.,"I have always loved watching this movie. i must have seen it a zillion number of times and i still love to watching it. i used to think why i love it so much. the movie is made with so much passion and love. u can see it in the characters and the from the work of the makers of this film.

this movie is about love. unconditional love. such love which is very difficult to find in this harsh world. but once u have found it, u have attained the most priceless treasure. when i watch this movie i realize that no matter how harsh this world is, that no matter how hard we all work to satisfy ourselves and others throughout our lives we have lived a truly worthy life if we have found that unconditional love. life is so beautiful. i am quoting from one of the movies i had seen, ' every passing moment is an opportunity to turn it all around.' through out life we try to be unhappy and unsatisfied with whatever we have. but when the time comes for us to finally give it all up we find it hard to let go. That is Life.",10
25 August 1999,If Brad Pitt is the Grim Reaper...,"Perhaps the fact that Athony Hopkins is one of my favorite actors has something to do with how much I enjoyed this movie, but it is Brad Pitt who takes center stage this time not letting us forget for one minute who is in control of this situation.

One of the reasons I enjoyed this movie so much is because it deals with a subject that is elusive to all of us. But let's face it, most of us do not have a bargaining chip when Death comes a knockin'.

I found the characters to be believable, each getting caught up in the day-to-day stuff we all do; the sibling rivalry, the favoritism between father and daughters; but most of us don't walk around with Death following us, or do we? And if we did know Death walked with us keeping a score card, how much would we really change?

There were times when this movie dragged on a bit, but let's face it, there aren't many movies out there that don't have a lag time in them.

Pitt's character was often times arrogant, and neandethal, but yet weaved through this character was a sense of compassion and innocence that was refreshing. I was especially touched in his first kissing scene with the freshness of it all.

I kept hoping for a happy ending, but the happy ending I got left me wiping tears from my eyes. Life is choices, and apparently, so is Death.",
4 July 1999,Best-ever movie score,"I got to know this first as a movie score (was sent a promo of the CD), played it once as a joke, and gradually came to love it as much as any CD in my collection, even though classical is my usual area. Saw the movie (at home) with some trepidation, fearing it wouldn't measure up. As usual, much of the score is undercut by faintness or dialogue, but I really loved the movie anyway. The role of Death is so implausibly written (at some points he doesn't know his name, at others he's making up clever plots to foil the evil Drew) that nobody could play it believably. Given that, there is something godlike about Brad Pitt, and of course, Hopkins is superb as usual.

Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",8
14 November 1998,Death's delay provides a well made romantic fantasy.,"Led by a splendid performance by Anthony Hopkins, this fantasy about death will provide a romantic feeling to even the most jaded cynic. Pitt hangs in there, but any mention of him receiving an Oscar nomination is truly misguided and wholly undeserved. The underlying themes of the inherent dishonesty in business and the ruthless tactics of those focused only on the making of money is forthright and believable. But the emphasis is on the love story, and the chemistry between the young stars culminates in a well directed and tastefully titillating love scene. Strongly recommended for those whose tastes are insatiably romantic.

7 April 1999,Surprisingly touching film w/great acting!,"Going into the theater to watch this film I was expecting two things. The first was that I'd be there for quite awhile (it's nearly 3 hours long). The second thing I was expecting to see, were two great actors show why they are among the best in Hollywood today (Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins). I firmly believe that Brad Pitt is the best actor in films today (he often gets too little credit for his acting abilities due to his sex appeal and that's unfortunate). As far as the length of the film is concerned.yea, it is long for a non-epic type of film, but I was amazed by how quickly the 178 minutes seem to go by.

One of the best things about MJB is the way the film develops it's characters. Director Martin Brest does something in MJB that too few films do today.he makes you actually care about what happens to the characters you see on the screen. Some people may find many of the early ""setup scenes"" to be boring and useless. I, on the other hand, feel that those scenes are the one's that really bring us into Joe Black (Pitt) and William Parrish's (Hopkins) world. To end without mentioning Claire Forlani would be a crime. She does a wonderful job as Susan Parrish (Hopkins daughter) and I look forward to seeing her in more films in the very near future.

MJB is an outstanding film that is filled with some amazing dialogue. In addition to that it is: a great romantic film, a surprisingly funny film at times, and most importantly it is the most touching film that I have seen since ""Titanic"" (I fully admit that I may feel this way due to the fact that I have a daughter to call my own. Having a daughter enables me to relate to the father-daughter scenes, which are incredibly done by Hopkins, Forlani, and Martin Brest). Grade: A",10
16 November 1998,The director was trying too hard.,"Meet Joe Black had excellent acting indeed. The composition of each shot, however, was too dramatic. The director tried way too hard to make everything in the frame appear perfect. The visual symmetry between objects in the background and also between characters was overdone. Just watch Joe Black when he walks up the stairs at the end with William Parish. It's almost ridiculous how balanced everything in the scene is. Overall, Meet Joe Black has good acting, a bad storyline, but great manipulation of sound. I would recommend seeing it for a change from other films, but not if you're expecting to feel thoroughly entertained. The warped philosophy of death was also rather disappointing.

2 October 2023,Sublime,"I love this movie. It is gorgeous, gracefully paced, philosophically interesting, and filled with some wonderful acting by some truly beautiful people. It lingers as long as possible through so many scenes - some will find it slow, but if you can slow your inner ""rat race"" down enough, you will also find it sinks deep in and grabs hold of your feelings and takes you along. The way the main character describes his love for his daughter is almost too powerful.

The movie is about passages, about transitions, about honest realizations, about true love, about loss, about death, and about how all those mix together; as the main character says, ""That's life for you.""

4 January 2006,Incredible movie,"Is a great and sensational love story. The crew is very good and the performances are amazing. Once again Anthony Hopkins shows why he is a wonderful actor. Brad Pitt is recently appearing in Hollywood and makes an incredible performance. For me, the moment of the movie is the scene in the coffee shop, where he and Susan meet each other........the way he try to love her, the way he speaks to her is absolutely amazing. The other great scene is the end, when Bill dance his last dance with his daughter and after that he goes with Brad Pitt for dying.....the dialog they had a few moments before, makes anybody cry.....the music is very emotional. I think the only dab thing of this movie is that there are a lot of scene that goes very slow or takes to much time. I think the story could had taken less time, but is OK anyway

24 January 1999,A Miracle,"This movie is nothing short of a miracle. What a simple and old story we´ve seen so many times on the screen and on stage throughout the world! But this time, it really takes you away beyond ordinary cinema story-telling. The movie works perfectly because of an excellent director who creates the exactly right atmosphere full of romance and humor, and who never crosses the fine line between cheap entertainment and art; because of outstanding actors (Brad Pitt has never been as good as in this movie, Hopkins outdoes himself, and Claire Forlani is just breathtaking - in every sense of the word) and because of a very sensitive and beautiful music. And whatever bored and cynical critics tell you - this movie is not a single minute too long! Can´t wait until it will be released on DVD!

3 February 1999,A celebrated 8/10!,"What can one say about 2 very good actors of very different backgrounds meeting on a set of a 'theatrical play' and competing each other delivering the very essence of theatre and, why not, cinema ??? I was mesmerised throughout the film by the performances of both Brad Pitt and A. Hopkins, so much that I noticed how long the film is (more than 3 hours) only after it finished by looking at my watch! Martin Brest (Scent of a Woman (1992), Midnight Run (1988), Beverly Hills Cop (1984) amongst others) is not new to the 'theatrical play' genre, after Scent of a Woman (1992).Look out for Claire Forlani, she's magnificent! A celebrated 8/10!

11 April 1999,An admirable fable,"I enjoyed this film immensely. A fable about Death coming to earth as an atheist and leaving as an angel is going to test a lot of people's ideas about film as entertainment, including the film's producers. Brad Pitt is a major draw card and has a number of good scenes, but for me his Death lacked authority. Anthony Hopkins kept the piece going though with a convincing performance of the businessman out-negotiated in the ultimate deal. Jake Weber's Drew was also good, deftly handling the character we like at first but would grow to hate as we got to know him better. I heard friends complain of trite dialogue. Yet, talking is the opposite of what this film is about: I loved the pared down dialogue and the use of silence (how do you converse with Death?). Non-verbal communication gradually increased through the film and was triumphant in the climactic scene with Pitt and Forlani. This scene was a winner for me: from being a scene of a large party crowd, the camera pulls focus while the crowd soundtrack disappears and we are in the intensely private and concentrated moment of these two characters. Susan's love is without restriction, even knowing who he is and that he won't stay; Joe's receipt of that love and his new-found capacity for love in return converts him from Grim Reaper to Angel of Life. Only hardened cynics or those who missed the cinema door to the action flick will leave without a smile or a tear or both.",
9 January 2000,An Intellectual Movie for the Introspective Person,"This movie, if one allows, challenges the life one lives and how one chooses to live it. It is artfully poetic, reminding me certainly of how difficult we make our lives. LIVE life and enjoy the small and big things and take NOTHING for granted. It is not a movie for one looking for pure entertainment. This movie is for those who enjoy a well-written script and direction. As a writer/poet I could think of no other movie that moves me so very much.

15 July 2004,Fantastic,"I loved this film, so much even the next day i went out and bought it on DVD. The storyline is brilliant and touched me deeply. It was hard to believe that the film was not real, it felt so true to me. The acting was amazing, the cast was carefully picked and that showed. The emotion you get from watchin this film is very strong. I've watched it around 15 times and each time I've cried and cried and cried. Even though Brad Pitt plays the character of 'Death' you feel that you can really relate to him, which is a sure sign from an actor. Brad looks amazing in this film, and antony hopkins was great as always. I feel this film was very thought out and very emotional. If you like romance and comedy and positive and negative vibes from a film , watch this one.

22 January 2004,Beware brainiacs!,"Yes, that means YOU! Here's a little tip to start you off on the right foot with this movie: before viewing it, make sure you're calm, relaxed and have a good couple of hours to enjoy and think about what it means to you. If you're not sure about it, please do yourself a favor and try to find a better time spot to watch this incredible picture, because otherwise you won't be able to appreciate it to its fullest extent, an obvious and truly regrettable mistake for most of the viewers.

If I could have my own way, concerning the review, I would happily write at least 5 page essay on this film, because anything else is just smoke up the ass, --as someone very close to Joe (B. Pitt) might elegantly put it ;-) --, but this is hardly the place to do it.

Now that we've gotten that out of the way, I'd like to say a few words with regard to the nature of ""Joe Black"": it is the kind of viewing experience that you have,..no--you MUST enjoy with your heart, your emotions, don't let your everyday logic take hold of you and tell you what is and what is NOT possible because you will never understand what the ""deal"" is and will definetly miss the whole point by a million miles.

It's basicly a story about an impossible love between a beautiful and charismatic woman and an entity, embodied as a young man, which exists completly above the human condition even though it is inherently tied to its destiny. The journey and reunion of these 2 worlds can only be made through love, TRUE and pure in every way possible. Because it begins from such a mythical standpoint, evoked by genious artists of the past in numerous ballads and poems, the story can allow itself to blur out the crossing line between what we see as REAL and possible and the realm of fantasy, myth and philosophy. The comedic moments are of no real shortage either, except they do not abund but are skilfully enhanced by the delightfuly extraordinary performances of Sir Anthony Hopkins (solid as ever), Brad Pitt (the man never ceases to amaze me) and an outstanding Claire Forlani.

Stereotypical patterns of movie analysis that critics and movie-going, popcorn-tossing brainiacs have used for years and years simply do not apply here, because this one actually requires an open mind and a morally and intelectually educated person to fully comprehend. And no, damnit, I'm not that kind of person, I've just barely touched the tip of the iceberg here! Social statures, wealth and the location of the events in ""Joe Black"" are irrelevant, -- not inexistent -- and the reason for that is this is not a socio-political drama, but a huge metaphore of LOVE, please, PLEASE get that straight into your minds!

Even after watching it in perfect conditions, you haven't understood anything and feel as if you're looking down an empty, dark barrel with only your echo to keep you interested, then God damnit, it's NOT for you... and I don't give a rat's ass, because it was never supposed to be for everybody!

PS: if you are one of those persons that likes to whine about the movie being too long and you're so lazy you didn't even take the time to check out how long the movie lasted BEFORE you bought the tickets/rented it, you should stay indoors and stick to your soaps, seriously!",10

9 February 2000,Most touching movie,"This is the most touching film I have even seen. The topic of life, death and love is quite serious yet this film has quite a few humorous scene (anyone laugh at the IRS agent scene?) The end is kind of sad but the tone of the whole movie is uplifting. The first time I finished this movie, I had no idea that 3 hours had passed. In my opinion, the length is needed to develop the complex plot and the character. I am especially impressed with Brad Pitt's performance. When he first appeared as death, he was quite stiff in his movement, expression, and conversation. In the end during William Parrish's confrontation with Drew, he was quite sophisticated and humorous.

This movie is simply beautiful to watch. The cinematography is wonderful. The lighting, music, words, expression and body movement of the characters all fit together in harmony.

I lost my husband a year and half ago to cancer. I find this movie rings so many truth in my heart. The message about love, being deliriously happy, waking up in the morning and say ""there is nothing I want more"", saying goodbye and taking nice pictures with you. All these things I keep thinking about after I watched the movie, the happiness that I used to feel all come back in a flood...

I loved this movie so much that I searched for reviews and comments on line. I was horrified at all the bad reviews from critics. I wonder how many people didn't watch this movie because of the bad reviews. I am sorry for the people who disliked the movies simply because of its length. I suppose if some people think a good lunch is hamburger and fries washed down with soda in half an hour, they might not enjoy a leisure sit-down lunch in a french restraunt with a glass of wine. I recommend this movie to a friend who didn't watch it in the theatre because of the bad reviews she read, she and her husband really liked it. If you like this movie, I hope you recommend it to your friends too. If I had missed this movie, I would have felt it's a big loss.",10

7 November 2014,This Movie is a Master Class on What it Means to Love.,"This movie is in my top five movies of all time. In the ""making of"" documentary you hear about how the director would sometimes take a scene 20 times to get it just right. It shows! Every single scene is like something from a museum--perfection personified. The script, direction, cinematography, music are all examples of how a movie can be a true work of art. I can find almost no fault with this movie. The acting is top notch, although I think Brad Pitt's acting here is not quite up to the quality of all the others.

I just read a favorite review of another reviewer who loved this film and says that this is a movie about death. I respectively disagree. This is not at all a film about death, it is a film about love. I tell people, if you want to experience what love really is or really means, this is the movie for that--not in some romantic comedy kind of way--but a real philosophical experience and discussion of what it means to truly love. There are many characters experiencing their loving relationships in various ways and so many examples, discussions, and experiences of love, that to me this is a Master Class in what it means to love or be loved. The preoccupation about death is natural, since the main character is Death, wanting to experience human life, but in that experience, he thinks he falls in love, but he has no idea what that means. It takes the three hours of this movie (so well spent!) for him to be shown and taught what it really means to love. This movie is a classic. Of course it didn't do well at the box office. Works of great philosophical significance rarely do. I can only promise you, your life will be enriched after seeing this film and you will think about it long after--I sure did--after every viewing (about six so far).",10
29 September 2023,well made movie,"Celebrating his 65th birthday, businessman and devoted family man Bill Parrish is visited by Death, who wants to know what it's like to be human in return for giving Bill extra days of his life. Considering marriage, as Bill sees Susan is not deeply in love, he suggests she wait to be swept off of her feet, suggesting ""lightning could strike"".

It's a well made movie, you can see how much high quality it is, there's no rush everything took its perfect time, the music was good and the storyline was clear as well.. but there's something missing in the plot, the plot was lacking and the chemistry between the leads wasn't the best, anyway it got pass and i think it deserved the chance to watch.

26 June 2002,The good and the bad.,"I had second thoughts about watching this movie, from what I heard from others that watched it. But I finally got around to watching it, and I was very surprised in a good way. A lot of movies that are this long tend to have boring and unnecessary parts, but in Meet Joe Black, I didn't find this the case. Hopkins was great, Pitt was fairly good, and even Claire Forlani (I think that's her name) was good (much better than in Antitrust).

There were a couple of scenes that were a bit drawn out, but overall, the positives outweigh the negatives. The movie has many emotional scenes, and some are also quite funny (Pitt speaking in the caribbean accent was pretty cool). The fact that the director pulled off a a good movie, involving a love story, and Death in human form (how ironic is that?) surprised me. 8/10

1 December 1998,Innocence Lost,"Why do people still to go to the cinema instead of enjoying the comfort, cheapness and convenience of their own TVs, VCRs, DVDs, cable or satellite movie channels? The local multiplex certainly offers the latest (but not greatest) features, the big screen, the ""night out"" achievement, and a certain social comarderie with the huddled masses in the darkened theatre. However, for this movie it is the very masses themselves that detract from any enjoyment of the film. In any given theatre, on any given evening the film will be playing to a teenage female majority, whose primary interest in the film in the presence (not ability) of Mr Pitt. Anyone considering this movie who is either male or over the age of 18 should wait until it appears at their local video store and save themselves the squirms, whispers and giggles of the attending sycophants. The nauseous whimpering reaches a crescendo of near audible hormones when Mr Pitt is helped out of his shirt for the obligatory sex scene. And while you're in the video store, take a look in the ""classics"" section for ""Death Takes a Holiday"" and see how the material should have been handled.",7
23 November 2001,A good film if you approach it with the right attitude,"I really liked this picture, which is interesting, because I tend to agree with a number of the negative comments I've read on this board. Many have complained that the movie is redundant and too long (three hours!).

Whether, the movie is too long is, of course, a matter of perspective. I enjoy three-hour baseball games. Why not a three-hour movie? The question is whether one feels that the three hours were well spent--and that depends on what one expects out of those three hours.

If one is looking for a tight movie where characters set their course based on one conversation or one event, then skip this one. If you are open to characters that are somewhat more complex and need to hear the same thing in more than one way to get the message, then you just might enjoy this film.

Also, if you're looking for a love story balanced by an action film (Titanic, Pearl Harbor), then, again, you will be disappointed. I think studio marketing departments have figured out that guys like action films and women like love stories, so they try to blend the two in order to maximize box office. This film pretty much ignored that.

This film deals with a number of relationships among a number of people and their relationship with ""death"". I won't list them all, but at the conclusion of the film, I felt as if I knew these people. I liked many of them, and I felt they had depth to them. From the dialog I constructed their pasts in a way I tend not to with movie characters. These people stayed with me. If you give them a chance, they might stay with you as well.",9
12 February 1999,"One heart-felt movie served w/ Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, and Claire Forlani","Brad Pitt came across as an innocent looking Mr. Death, Anthony Hopkins was excellent, and Claire Forlani is stellar. With these elements combined Meet Joe Black is an intelligent, sexy, and delightful journey through the human heart. I didn't like Brad Pitt going into this film but this role reversed my way of thinking. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Joe Black is excellent because he comes across as an innocent, yet driven in his pursuit of seeing the world. I also enjoy the budding romance between Joe and the daughter played by Claire Forlani. Anyone who sees this movie should expect to be in their seat for 3+ hours, but it is well worth the wait and price of admission. I rate this film 9 out of 10.

25 April 1999,Amazed!!!,"Last night I rented Meet Joe Black just to see how I would like it. From critics' reviews about the movie I was not expected too much. This is how I felt. From beginning to end I was amazed how good it was. The acting for one was great. Brad Pitt was amazing and his best performance in a movie. Anothony Hopkins should have got an Oscar for his performance. Claire Forlani showed that she can be a great actor with I think the best performance of the whole movie. The storyline which was like the 1934 film Death takes a Holiday. I thought the film was long and could have been shorter but if you get through the 3 hours ok you are in for a good ending. I think you have to be in the right mood to watch this film but overall a great film. I give it 3 out of 4.

5 August 1999,surprisingly good,"I expected little from this movie going into it, and also knew nothing of the plot. Both factors, I think, contributed greatly to my liking of it. Many have groaned at the length of the film, which I found flew by rather quickly, as the plot was very engrossing. A good performance for Pitt and Hopkins, though I would not deem them oscar-worthy. What I found particularly enchanting was the love scene between Pitt and Forlani, which was neither gratuitous nor distasteful. It sensitively focused on their mutual experience of it, rather than on showing skin or being provocative.

All around, I would say this was a very charming movie, but with two criticisms:First, I do feel that the end was a bit drawn-out; Second, Brad Pitt's embarassing attempt at a Jamaican accent should never have made it past the cutters.

6 September 2009,Multiply by infinity and take it to the depths of forever and you will still barely have a glimpse of how disappointed i am,"Powerful characters, great acting but an average execution of the mythology of the plot spoiled it all. The message around which the plot was woven, was incredibly conducive to making a masterpiece. Certain moments in the movie felt terribly out of place with the consistent class the movie showed all along. Not to mention the ending, that was so shocking because after going through that painful moment ended any chance of the story having any depth whatsoever. If i were to suggest anyone to see this movie, i would urge them to stop the movie and return the DVD promptly and suppress any curiosity they might have of seeing the ending. This way, you will ponder about the additional dimension that the plot had but was never told. I hope this movie is remade to shatter records.

25 August 2009,A great story spoiled to the point of Good by the director,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",7
30 May 1999,"If there is any film that shows the brilliance of Brad Pitt, this is it.","This movie is so bittersweet, that it moves me every time. What gets me even more than the simpleness of this story, is the incredible performance of Brad Pitt. Is ability to transform from an ordinary (pardon the expression)joe, to death is an amazing feat. His ability to find joy in the little things he doesn't know as death, such as peanut butter, intrigued me to no end. It was such an experience to watch him portray death as such an innocent, that it literally took my breath away. Not to take away from Anthony Hopkins, who, as always, gave an amazing performance. If you are willing to take 3 hours, and believe me, it feels like maybe 1 hour, to watch this movie, it would be worth your time. Every moment was exquisite. A movie worth many Oscars, had it only been given a different year.

4 February 2003,an under rated film,"i'm a teenage guy (18) and not a big romance movie fan, but i must confess that i really enjoyed this movie.

i thought the storyline was superb. likewise, the acting was top notch.

another big reason i liked this movie was the soundtrack. the main theme for the film, ""Love Theme"" i believe it is called, is an extremely emotional song. it plays often throughout the film and makes a good movie great.

19 August 2005,Best Brad Movie,"Both my daughter and I loved this movie. We've watched it over and over many times and will watch it again. We do not get tired of it. I've seen many of Brad Pitt's movies and I believe he puts himself totally into character.

Brad's portrayal of death becoming human was like an innocent child learning for the first time. For instance tasting peanut butter and describing it, and listening to the characters interacting with each other and interpreting their reactions when discussing the party or business, then falling and feeling what love is like, and his questioning of everything. His character helps William Parrish, Hopkin's character, realize what is really important in life.

I would not change the cast at all. The scenery, fireworks, and music were all fantastic. I really didn't notice how long the movie was. It puts you in sort of a dream state and I really didn't want it to end. I'm a dreamer, what can I say.

15 November 1998,Infinity,"Imagine infinity, like Brad Pitt asks Anthony Hopkins to do in this film. Now multiply it by the depths of the longest thing you can think of. This gives you an idea of the running time for ""Meet Joe Black"". There are many good things in this film, including poignant performances by Hopkins, Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Tambor, and suitable ones by Pitt and Claire Forlani, and a few touching scenes. However, what is good about the movie is dragged out over three lugubrious hours, with many scenes that seem to take for-ev-er. Had director Brest not allowed his ego to overrun the project and had he kept the best stuff in while trimming the fat, this could have been an extremely effective 120-minute entertainment. As it is, however, I was afraid someone in the audience would eventually yell at the screen, ""DO SOMETHING!"", and equally afraid that audience member would be me.

3 December 1998,Best Film of 1998,"JauntyJen@aol.com Ronkonkoma, NY

I thought Meet Joe Black was a sweet, funny, touching, and thought provoking film. I already saw it twice and plan to go back a third time. For this movie to work, the viewer has to have an open mind about two things: 1. To accept the absurd notion that Death is a conscious being who experiences a sudden curiosity to experience life as mortal human beings know it. 2. To be forgiving of certain plot elements which are never fully explained. A lot is left to the viewers interpretation. I thought all the performances in this film were noteworthy, especially Anthony Hopkins as Bill Parrish. Here is a man who not only has to deal with the knowledge of his impending demise, but has to spend his last days accompanied by Death, in the heavenly human form of Brad Pitt. (who has never looked better). Death, introduced as ""Joe Black"" follows Parrish around as he tries to tries to tie up loose ends in his business (which Parrish considers his legacy), and tries to make the most of his time left on earth with his family. Brad Pitt as he plays the mysterious Joe Black is both innocent and awkward, charismatic and seductive, and frighteningly omnipotent. In his arrangement to give Parrish a limited reprieve while he ""sees the world"", he holds all the cards, and Bill Parrish is increasingly frustrated in his realization that he doesn't have the bargaining power which served him so well in former business dealings. The character Joe Black also develops a romantic interest in Parrish's younger daughter Susan (played by the misty-eyed Claire Forlani). As for the concept of Death falling in love or even having any human emotions, it can be explained that love and other human emotions are at least partly influenced by bio-chemical processes. It stands to reason that a being occupying a human body would be subject to these hormonal and chemical reactions to outside triggers (such as the sight or smell of a potentially compatible mate), which cause the human brain to experience feelings of lust, desire, infatuation and ultimately love. It is even easier to understand, since we already know the previous human occupant of Joe Black's body was also attracted to Susan, who had a brief but flirtatious encounter with him in a coffee shop. By the end of the movie, even the supporting characters such as the fawning older daughter, her seemingly inept but good hearted husband, and Bill Parrish's trusted business partner, are fleshed out. Each has at least one emotional or pivotal scene which brings their motivations to light. I did not think this movie was too long, in fact I hardly noticed it was 3 hours. I cannot think of one scene which could be cut without compromising the movie. The scenes were paced to give the viewer time to imagine what the characters might have been thinking at that moment. The actors did an admirable job of conveying the various emotions through their facial expressions and limited dialogue. The cinematography and lighting were also extremely relaxing and pleasing to the eye. All in all, I would recommend this film to anyone who believes the key to happiness is keeping close family ties, living life to its fullest without compromising moral and ethical principles, and settling for nothing less than true love.",10
9 June 2001,Great Movie,"I really liked this movie because it can give you another look at death. Death isn't something to be scared about, no, it's a beautiful man in shape of Bratt Pit! Great acting by Anthony Hopkins (again). I must say it's really a movie for women because it may be a bit sentimental for men. But it's a very nice movie. And if you're a fan of Sir Hopkins, you definitely must see this movie.

2 January 2002,Absolutely Fantastic !,"I originally watched this touching film when it was released in the cinema - and was thoroughly impressed by it. What makes this all the more amazing is that I'm more into the action genre of films (e.g. Con Air et al) than this more ""sentimental"" type of film.

However I was spurred on to write this mini review by the fact that I've literally just finished watching the film again on terrestrial TV - which reminded me just how good this film is ...

The cinematography is amazing, and some scenes whose themes where more complex than usual were handled with pinache. The music was good, although in my opinion it didn't lend itself to being released as a sound track to the film, it suited the film perfectly.

I don't think this movie won any awards or Oscars, which in my opinion is a crying shame - I personally rate this film above and way beyond films such as Titanic (starring Kate Winslet). Anthony Hopkins and Claire Forlani were excellently cast in the two main leads - I sincerely hope to see more films of this type soon, and would recommend that everyone watch it at least once ! :-)",10
7 April 1999,Forget the critics,"Forget all the bad press you've heard about this movie. ""Meet Joe Black"" is a wonderful celebration of life and, yes, death. Is the pace slow? Yes. Is the movie over-long? Yes. But the direction and the cast more than make up for it with deep, three-sided characters. All the pieces of the story fit together nicely and there are reverberations of certain lines throughout the movie. Words literally come back to haunt the characters (and the viewer). And that orgasmic burst of fireworks in the final frames of the film? In case you didn't pick up on it, that's a celebration of life and love! See this one to remember the important things in your life; see it with the one you love.

1 April 1999,Wasted Potential,"If there's one thing I can't stand in a film, it's when you have the feeling that this could have been a brilliant film, but some one along the line messed it up and now it's mediocre. I find those films harder to watch than the average twelve in a dozen action flix because I hate it when potential is wasted. And that's basically the story of Meet Joe Black.

It's slow, beautiful, and in places very intense. No special effects apart from some fireworks (I think that is worth a special mention these days), long studies of the emotions that play over the faces of the main characters. But it just doesn't make it really good. The long pauses have you grip your seat in frustration, the subplot involving a hostile take-over is just plain silly and messes up the main plot too much, and finally and most importantly the lines of Death are just not well thought out.

For some one who has looked at mankind since the beginning, he is surprisingly stupid. But if the plot requires, suddenly Death has the insight of ages again. I can imagine him marveling at new experiences such as taste and having a human body with tons of hormones running wild in it, but the script has him react like a total moron half of the time.

I can see why my friends, and so many other viewers liked it. But I left this film utterly frustrated and gave it a harsh verdict for not making what could have been a great film.",7
19 May 2005,A Compelling and Moving Film (with Jeffrey Tambor!),"So many people have left excellent comments here on the movie, that I'll encourage you to look to them for more insights. I just wanted to add that I thought that Jeffrey Tambor gave a great performance as the weak-willed, but good-intentioned, son-in-law Quincy. You gotta love the guy, especially his loyalty to his wife and her father. I love the scene where Joe Black puts his hand on Quincy's bald head to console him in a moment of anguished guilt. Of course, the leads did a great job, but it's also nice to see supporting characters fleshed out in such human depth.

And don't worry about the three hours - they're well spent.

6 May 2002,A truly enjoyable film,"Meet Joe black is not a stunningly good film, the concept is a good one, and much more could have been made of it, and yet I find that I am glad that there wasn't. The film details the last days of William Parish's (a rich businessman) life; played with great finesse by Sir Antony Hopkins, culminating on his birthday. However, death (Brad Pitt) decides that with this customer he wants to take a look at what life is like, and so spends a few days with the Parrish family. The film is done in a very dreamy style throughout, with a masterful soundtrack by James Horner which massively adds to the films dream-like feel. This is not the sort of film which you should go into expecting an exciting piece of cinema. It is the sort of film you should watch on a rainy night in the winter when you can just curl up with a bottle of wine and enjoy it, as I did.

20 May 1999,too good,"i watched this movie i think 5 times in theatre back when it was just out in november '98. it was one of those movies or stories that hit me so personally. i fully understood what i was supposed to get out of this story. i cried like a nutta, and then i realized how valuable our lives are. i realized how lucky i am to have my parents around still - i had to tell them i appreciated all they've done for me after i saw this. a couple of my friends have died since i've seen this movie (freak accidents *sigh*), and again, this topic of death washed over me again for a good few months. death is a part of our lives, and it's good to point it out now and then and remind us that we could lose loved ones anyday.

the acting was brilliant, and so was the musical score. yay for all the cast!

26 July 1999,"Long, but enjoyable.","This is a story worthy of interest: Death decides to take a holiday and visits the human race, during which time stands still for those about to die.

Death (Brad Pitt) visits a businessman (Anthony Hopkins) on the day he is to die and strikes a deal. If the businessman will give Death a tour of life, his death will be suspended until after he celebrates his birthday.

During his time on Earth, Death learns about matters of the heart and soul, as well as what peanut butter tastes like.

Although this is a flawed film -- mainly its length -- it is filled with charm and old-fashioned fun.

Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins have worked together before, in the award-winning ""Legends of the Fall,"" and they work well together.

The screenplay is flawed in that it stretches a rather thin story out to its limit, but the actors make the most of it. On that level the movie is a pleasure to watch. There are enough scenes of humor and charm to make it entertaining.",7
24 June 2002,Not for philistines,"You'd have to be utterly devoid of taste not to appreciate this movie. Claire Forlani's pulchritude & oozing sensuality makes up for her other debacles in acting, as do the stellar performances by Pitt & Hopkins. The plot, be it a remake of a 30s flick, is intellectually original & refreshing compared to the trash usually produced in Hollywood, and the artistry of the script & screenplay will leave a lingering sense of appreciation. Any moron on here deriding the plot and finding logical holes in it is obviously is too much of an uncouth twit of a boor to appreciate what the movie's really about. This film is a work of art - enjoy :)

15 February 2006,I absolutely loved this movie...,"I thought this movie was amazing. It takes a lot for me to really get interested in a film of this length, but I found myself running to take care of household tasks during commercial breaks. ( I saw it on AMC this morning) I am actually going to make it a point to purchase this movie. This film got a lot of bad reviews when it was released, and even until today, but I think the ones who gave it criticism were looking too technically at the film and not watching it for mere enjoyment. If you watch the movie with your heart and not with your eyes you may get to experience one of the most profound and moving films ever made I believe. I won't bother to get into details about the finer points of the movie, I believe the ones who watched it as I did, understand the feeling that this movie invokes. This will go on my shelf with ""Schindler's List, It's a Wonderful Life, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Imitation of Life, Godfather 1 and 2, Legend, The Heart of Me, etc"" If you know these movies and also appreciate them for the feelings they invoke and not necessarily the reviews and the poor acting (in some opinions)or whatever technical ""nonsense"" these critics use to view these films, then you will understand why I must own this film. Do yourself a favor, watch this movie with ""heart wide open"".

26 February 2008,Goose bumps,"What a fantastic achievement! I savored every scene, every moment. It took me 4 hours to watch because I kept rewinding to repeat the most luscious lines. They took a simple yet profound premise and slowly milked it for all it's worth. The acting is sublime, the cinematography gorgeous (saving their best work for the most intense scenes). The movie flows so well, it's often as if the actors are reacting emotionally in the only way they possibly could under the circumstances.

This is no movie to rush through, it's not for the impatient. I wouldn't want to watch while I'm feeling antsy or looking for something to dominate my attention. So wait for a peaceful evening, and relax.

27 April 2008,What a movie!!,"I have first seen the film many years ago and since then I saw it about another 20 times.Not many films drew my attention during my life,but this film surely did.Beautiful Cast,never failed the expectations of the film,excellent directing,superb photography,a story about the power of love and life that was escalating progressively,and an ending that belongs to all times best endings: Death Allmighty is beaten by The Power of Love and bows before it.This is the magnificent idea of the film and if anyone can't understand that go see JOHN RAMBO.It is the moment at the party where impersonalized Death gets defeated by the most simple and precious human emotion.But throughout the film this happens 3 times,each with its significance,so we can understand and reach the peak at the end.Then in just one film minute and accompanied by a divine music score,defeated Death withdraws and gives his place to Life through Love.New Hope is rising,and if you are asking what will happen next,I tell you that ''It will come to us''.Thank you.

11 April 2003,What a Curious and Romantically Compelling Mess,"Against my better judgment, I find myself truly liking this film. Sure it's too long, yet the lingering pace allows most of the characters to display a depth that gives a certain reality, so unusual in an era of thoughtless action and explosions.

The film is still tremendously flawed - any movie with such a string of credited screenwriters is sure to be a messy mongrel affair (and the horribly hacked-up tv version mangles things even further and leaves poor Jeffrey Tambor's character as a mere shadow). Marcia Gay Harden, wonderfully insecure, starts the movie with the promising theme of the neglected sister, but is in turn neglected by the screenwriters and withers away. Joe Black never even notices her. Bill Parrish/Anthony Hopkins, the patriarchal father, clearly regrets neglecting family matters, yet never gets an ultimate scene with them all together to express this. Susan/Claire Forlani is supposedly a medical resident, yet her character is given none of the aggressive and analytical traits needed in a doctor, and evidently only works around late breakfasts, long lunches, family dinners and afternoon dalliances anyway. Hopkins has a 65th birthday for his thousand closest friends, yet not one of his board of directors is in attendance, but instead are at an impossibly late-night meeting elsewhere, all personified in that sub-plot's supposed dramatic climax by a tiny desk speakerphone. The evil rival corporate raider never once appears on screen. And yet I loved the slow introspection, the quiet afternoons, and the loving relationship between doting father and devoted daughter, and am captivated by this odd movie.

But I found the biggest flaw, by far, to have been with Joe Black himself, ironically, since this was presumably a star vehicle for Brad Pitt. Sadly, he's not the actor for this role. True, Death could pick any body he chose, so why not Brad Pitt's, but I think the movie would have ""fit"" far better with an older man in the role who could have personified timeless wondering and yearning so much more understandably to a film audience. We expect more maturity somehow, more world-weariness in having ushered countless generations away from life. More appropriate that Death should already know little things like cookies and peanut butter and not waste time on that. It's the deep emotions of humanity that he was curious to feel, and that should have been the focus of his visit - frustrations of corporate life, sufferings of the dying, falling in love. But we are given a young pup who wanders empty halls aimlessly with a totally impassive visage where the very heart of this film should have been, and I think that is why it failed.

Had, ironically, perhaps a Robert Redford or even Al Pacino of maybe 45 years old been given this role, I think it could have worked. I can see those older faces taking in the new experiences of emotion, and dealing far more authoritatively, and eventually compassionately, with their hosts. Surely Susan/Claire Forlani would so much more naturally fall in love with an assuring father figure: clearly that's what she's seeking (I fell in love with Claire Forlani, by the way - stunningly beautiful, and I think did a fine job of portraying vulnerability and growing sagacity). Bill Parrish would have bonded far better with a more mature-looking Death as well. The movie, then, didn't need an hour less; it needed a more compelling Joe Black.

A final word on the film score... Thomas Newman has done wonderful work in such varied requirements as minimalist contemporary accompaniment for The Player and soulful introspection of Shawshank Redemption. This film is three hours long, much of it in justified silence. Perhaps because the screenplay was obviously hacked and shuffled about, some musical passages of an already fairly brief (relatively) score are simply repeated in different scenes. Nonetheless, Newman's wonderfully atmospheric and lusciously romantic score should be pointed out for its merit. I thought it was music of the highest order, tremendously enhancing the movie over-all. The romantic theme/melody is gorgeous, and I loved the passage at the close of the love scene: the delicate rocking almost barcarolle/lullaby. Someone else evidently liked it as well, as it's reprised at the very end of the credits (or else they needed an extra 30 seconds of something). Were I ever in charge of a romantic movie, I would steal this exact score for it.",
3 October 2010,Death In The Form Of Brad Pitt?,"I got to say of course I was skeptical about watching this whole entire movie and let me tell you movie fans I am glad I did! Amazingly acted by all the actors and actress and the chemistry between them all is outstanding.It moves along slow of course but every scene has meaning and plays out to the benefit of the watcher. By the end of this original peace I have to admit I did shed a tear or two. This is a masterpiece of storytelling and acting, the story will grip your heart and squeeze it dry of all moisture.Brad Pitt does a wonderful performance as ""Joe Black"" and convincing but Anthony Hopkins gets the nod and all the attention that's deserved by a seasoned well placed actor. A classic and a must see!

12 November 2003,"from acting to editing, great movie","The best movies, in my opinion, are those that seem to be about one thing but are really about another. An ingenious device playing Death as a real person, the concept goes as far back as Chaucer and even the bible but none-the-less is fun. So this movie would seem to be about ""death"" discovering this world. But that's only a small part of it. through death discovering the world we see life at it's fullest. the small intricacies of it, the subtle joy and happiness that is life. I loved this movie. everyone did an amazing acting job, and the direction and editing were great, plus the cinematography. Brad Pitt was amazing. He's absolutely one of the greatest actors of our time. Along with Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins was intelligent in acting. His subtle less is more aproach to his characters is a wholly realistic perfect representation to life as it is. thank you all.

27 December 2004,"Despite the hope that it would turn out to be interesting,","It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",1

29 June 2017,The perfect love movie,"This is a movie that I can watch over and over again. It shows how the mechanics of love work in real life. When Joe meets Sue, the chemistry between them is so real and the scenes with them are movie magic. When they leave each other, the question is, do they look back? And they do. There are countless other scenes in this movie that are well executed by the actors. The scene where Anthony Hopkins character comments upon his whole life is something that William Shakespeare would have penned today. I really love this movie for its writing, direction and acting. Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Tamborn also do great jobs portraying their parts and help the movie along. But Brad Pitt makes the movie and there is no question in my mind that he captures what being in love feels like on the screen.

9 August 2013,A must-see for people who like more from their movies,"Maybe it's the title that turns people off to this film, which is unfortunate, for this movie has the incomparable Anthony Hopkins,a luminous Claire Forlani, Brad Pitt showing some good acting chops, gorgeous production values and a glorious musical score. I was captivated by this film and its subject matter. I didn't care about its length. It was like curling up with a good book. Besides, I have become annoyed with all of the fast cutting of films these days with scenes of six seconds or so. Here, the camera lingers longer on these actors, who often take a minute or so to convey their thoughts/emotions--just like in real life. A good story will captivate viewers/readers. Death decides to ""vacation"" on earth and be guided by Anthony Hopkins' character, Bill Parrish, who is upright, smart, successful and wealthy. What better tour guide? And his fabulous NYC house with an indoor pool at the top: I want it! Death inadvertently finds that he digs Earth and its pleasures. Pitt conveys these nascent emotions very powerfully. Yes, there are some plot questions that one has at the end, but the overall story themes are the focus--don't go through life without having loved deeply. I've never seen the original or its remake, but, if you want a film that's a gorgeously made, thought-provoking ""what if,"" check this one out.",9
5 February 2005,How to be a human being,"I had saw this film years ago, I'd like that, but it not cause me a great impression - was only a good movie. But yesterday I had re-saw it, and can do a better analysis. First, the performances: Anthony Hopkins is ever great, no comments. The girls, as the daugthers, OK, good. But I'd like to give a little attention to Brad Pitt. He is handsome, OK, but usually his performances are strong by explosion, almost never too soft as Robert Redford (his ""alter-ego""??). But in this movie he can be seemed as a gentleman (in all movie there isn't bad words in his speaks), extremely sensitive and curious and lots of softly. Only for comparation, see ""Fight Club""...or anyone movie where he appears. In this Meet Joe Black he had a great performance, its impossible don't feel the emotion after every scene. This, and the story - unexpected at much moments, makes this a great movie to me. See it!

20 August 2019,Death. Love. Life.,"A very young Brad Pitt plays the role of ""death"" as he happens to fall madly in love with the daughter of the man whom he's supposed to take away from Earth. It's a very long three hour movie but the ending's payoff is very well worth the watch! There's a shorter version out there if you're willing to search for it due in part to airplane viewings when the film first came out. Lots of great undertone humor that highlights Pitt's upcoming acting career. You should enjoy this one if you have a good heart 💓

16 August 2018,Rather dull feature film considering the amount of talent involved,"Meet Joe Black is ultimately a disappointment and an an exercise in how one should understand the pacing of the movie. Starring Brad Pitt, Claire Forlani and Anthony Hopkins this is based on an older film called Death takes a Holiday (1934). Brad Pitt dies and is reborn as ""death"" and enters a wealthy mogul's life to understand the meaning of life, meanwhile falling in love with his daughter. The pacing is a killer and sorry to say but the acting is pedestrian- especially Brad Pitt. It seems they're all here to collect paychecks to buy mansion, the likes shown in this film.

15 November 1998,Death takes on a new and stylish face,"""Meet Joe Black,"" is one of those movies whose plot and cinematic beauty will keep you watching, even for three hours. Brad Pitt is interestingly reserved in his portrayal of Death in the guise of Joe Black. Death has taken the body of this handsome man to learn more about the other side; life. In the process he discovers love with Susan Parrish, played by Clair Forlani. Susan happens to be the daughter of rich tycoon William Parrish, played by Anthony Hopkins. Death/Joe Black is giving Parrish a few extra days on earth while he explores life and all things human. The cimematography is exquisite, the sound track memorable and haunting, especially the melody the comes up each time Joe and Susan are alone together. The love scene between Susan and Joe is stylishly sensual; the fireworks scene outdoes Hitchcock's from ""To Catch A Thief."" In all the film, though at times slow to move, is nonetheless a feast for the eyes and mind as Death takes on a new and stylish face in ""Meet Joe Black.""

15 February 2015,amazing movie,"Barring the logic and reasoning, the movie succeeds in describing and appreciating life to an uninitiated. It is not a sci-fi, more of philosophical and drama with a touch of fantasy. Great direction and acting, All characters played their part to the best. It had some powerful quotes and some moving scenes. ""Lightning could strike"" and ""multiple with infinity and take it to depth..."" were my favorite ones. The best parts were Brad meeting Susan in coffee shop and being too frank and straight forward (not sure if in real world that would work, but hey! u never know, lightning could strike!). Second one was when Joe kissed Susan the first time, I can imagine how ""death"" would have felt, such strong emotions. If such a thing happened to u, u'd want to freeze it forever.

18 November 1998,"A Great, Fun, Long Look At Death","""Meet Joe Black"" is a deliberative and contemplative story about discovering love for the first time, about passion and fire, and bursting anger. The movie's slow pacing makes the movie's calculating business intrigue storyline even more powerful and gripping while the first half of the movie's ironic humor captures the heart of romance. This is a great movie that gives depth to supporting characters especially the sister and the business associate (scenes which remind of ""It's A Wonderful Life""). There is a remarkable love scene that glows with passion and emotional power without graphic sex. And Anthony Hopkins closes in on death with a vengeance. Brad Pitt plays a cool character that has an undercurrent of inbred superiority and hard, icy edge underneath his bewildered exterior. His role like Kurt Russell in ""Soldiers"" are both powerful performances that require a fine talent to meld the various, complex personalities on screen.

14 November 1998,A testament to human nature,"I found ""Meet Joe Black"" to be a wonderful story of undying love. Brad Pitt basked in his own simplistic acting style while Anthony Hopkins came to life as a man seeing his last. Having not seen the original I cannot make an accurate judgement however I feel that this movie can stand on its own as a remarkable tale.

However, I cannot help but agree that the film had the quality of having been gone over with a fine tooth comb. I believe that many would feel that their last moments could be scriped out with such eloquence. Still, such minor details could not distract from the underlining message..... unconditional love is its own reward.

A movie worth taking a second look at.

5 July 2004,A Miracle about Death And Love,"It is one of my favorite movies, a brilliant look Death certainly takes your breath away, and that's not the only factor why i love this movie. It is well planned and carried out, with subtle changes of the characters, like the young man in the coffee shop and death, then the young man back when Death 's gone. I have to say I am so shocked when seeing the low rating of this wonderful movie, and even some users complained it's too long. But to me it's perfectly fitting every detailed the movie intended to tell us. It brings me thoughts, ""lighting might strike"", I respect other users' opinions, yeah we welcome the diversity in minds, but what I'm trying to say is that it is indeed a great movie in all times, and it's beautifully made and wisely presented by Brad, Anthony and others. I love the ending too, it's not like somebody else says as "" Hollywood ending"", I can't see why they put it that way. And I voted it 10/10. I love the love scenes in it, so pure ad sacred. I like the lines they said in the movies too. In all, a romantic and profound story you can't miss!

25 April 1999,Surprisingly enjoyable,"I was one of those people who heard all the bad reviews of this movie and Brad Pitt. A friend invited me over to watch a video without telling me what the movie was we were to watch. I was bit reluctant when I learned the film was 'Meet Joe Black' but was quickly surprised at how enjoyable the movie actually is. If you can get past the tinny/robot-like movements of Brad Pitt when we first meet Mr. Black, and those horrible pregnant pauses during dialogues, the rest of the flick is smooth sailing. I felt at times I was watching a soap opera that includes pregnant pauses to cut to commercials, but realized there was no break in the conversation -- just long pauses. I could have easily cut out about 15-30 minutes from the running time (yeah, like anyone's ever going to give me that opportunity). Overall, the plot is worthwhile and the acting acceptable and at times wonderful. Don't take the critics advice, decide for yourself!

Beautifully made, well written and of course well acted too. i think this film has been unfairly criticized for being long or whatever but once u see it u never feel its a three hour long film. It sustains ur interest til the end and it is not for all tastes....those who didnt like it should go and see that usual crappy hollywood zing-bang. The best thing bout the movie is the fantastic dialogues throughout the entire movie. They really make u think bout life, death and love. The cinematography is superb and give the film a true classic look. A simply amazing movie and i would recommend it to all who like to see some sensible stuff.

21 September 2019,A Personal Favorite,"I enjoy watching movies that touch me emotionally and this story certainly did not disappoint. Having lost my father many years ago, and my mother more recently, this wonderful story touches on how precious life really is.

I've never been a Brad Pitt fan. I actual think he's not a very good actor but he shined in this role. The chemistry among all the actors was so convincing. Anthony Hopkins was simply magic. This was the best role of his career, a truly great and underrated performance. Every scene he was in was powerful. The range of emotions he shows, and the way he delivers his lines...amazing!

Each time I watch the movie feels like the very first time. It is a testament to the director, writers and actors. It will stand the test of time. Do yourself a favor and watch it!

4 July 2004,Why always vulgarise the end?,"I thought I would give this film many points, but... - Oh, no buts for the length. A good story should be allowed to use the time needed. 4/5 of the time I enjoyed this wonderful film; fascinating idea with good acting (by all three of them in the lead).

'It must be based on a play', I thought, 'but somebody must have changed the end of it'.

How sad, they destroyed it by making a Hollywood ending! From something worth thinking about they turned it into a fairy tale. Why can't some people ever keep their fingers off the endings?

16 May 2005,The Grim Reaper wants to be human.,"I really thought this was one of the most flawed and boring films I've ever seen. Forget about the funniness about peanut butter. The Grim Reaper being so selfish just did not seem in character. Incredibly stupid for a sentient being who has been around for infinity. The subject matter itself is flawed, because we are talking about the Grim Reaper. There is no mystery as to how the film ends.

Anthony Hopkins was good- as he always is.

The actress playing Susan Parrish was good-looking.

Brad Pitt is good looking.

This movie can be summed up in two words: ""It sucked.""

24 February 1999,Box office disappointment doesn't= bad movie,"This was a very interesting film from Martin Brest. It was a very moving film with a great beginning and one of the most spectacular endings to a film I have seen in a long time. Anthony Hopkins gives one hell of a performance as a loving father, protecting his daughter. Brad Pitt gives a great performance as death. This was not a disappointment by any means, it was a surprise, a pleasant suprise. This movie should have made over 100 million. A great romantic movie!

There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",9
23 November 2010,A Rare Film,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say.

9 December 2007,Very Good Movie! (contains a spoiler or two),"I really liked this movie when i first saw it. It's almost 3 hours long, but that doesn't take a thing away from it. It's an interesting plot - death falling in love with a human being. Of course they had to get Brad Pitt to play that one thing that we humans will never escape. If they Danny Bonaduce play the lead part, it wouldn't have been such a winner, IMHO. Claire Forlani, who plays Susan Parrish, has the most beautiful pair of eyes in moviedom! I am awestruck by them, and can't get enough seeing her in movies so i can get another view of them. The rest of her is very beautiful, too. Anthony Hopkins (Bill Parrish) gave a great performance in this role of the communications tycoon who gets a few last days to enjoy himself on earth. It's a pretty good flick, with some funny parts mixed in. One of the oddball parts of the movie is Death's love for peanut butter. Certain scenes show him with a spoon sticking out of his mouth.

There is one part of the movie which confused me from the get go. Death inherited the body of Pitt's initial character, who is a patron of a coffee shop. After that character met Susan Parrish, and the two hit it off immediately, he gets flustered enough by her beautiful eyes and body to be stopped in the middle of the street, looking at her as she leaves the scene. Well, who hasn't been in that situation, your eyes and ears not paying attention to your surroundings because of a beautiful person who happened to catch your eye, and before you know it, you walk into something, or someone. Well, in this case, a car slams into the guy, killing him. Death inherits his body, and that's how he got around in the movie. Well, at the end of the movie, the person from the accident scene returns from the dead. He is seen talking to Susan, and seems confused how he had gotten where they were. I am just wondering why the director threw that part in there. Why did they choose to bring back a character from the dead? So we romantics would get teary-eyed, knowing that those two characters would be together again? OR, maybe that Death may let some of us escape, just when it seems as though our goose is cooked? It was interesting that they chose that ending, to say the least. Anyway, this movie is highly recommended!",8
18 February 2000,Mystery man attracts women most-great lesson for all men,"Wow! Could man be so calm? I don't think so-maybe The Death:)I think we saw the limit that man could achieve. Also great, great lesson of honesty, love (and falling in), tenderness and trust. I'm a ""regular one"" but still impressed by Brad Pitt's role and playing. We (men) can only learn how to deal with our biggest obsession - woman.

2 February 2004,boring,"this movie just bored the ass off me.the concept was stupid and the acting was wooden.nothing interesting happened in the entire movie.even when brad pitts charachter was making love to claire forlani,it looked like they were just going through the motions.i cant believe it has a rating of 6.5 on the imdb.i guess that a high number of pitt fans voted for it because i cant think of anyone else who would find this film remotely interesting. thank god i saw it on tv and didnt have to fork out to see this piece of crap.

30 March 2004,It's great in its own way,"This movie is mostly about showing the charisma of Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani, while the plot itself appears no longer important. It could be well appreciated by those who have an eye for what¡¯s behind its title. Another virtue of it that might not have been the director¡¯s original intention but does have some significance is: it makes death sound like another journey, an adventure into an unknown, but not at all horrible world. Perhaps, death isn't that terrible, isn't it? And isn't it possible that imagining death being a beautiful end would help one enjoy his worldly life more? A life without the ultimate burden of fear could be reached for the willingness to believe the unbelievable. The only pity is that Brad Pitt, a talented actor with his natural charm greatly enhanced by his acting skill, didn't do himself enough justice in the role of Death. Perhaps, it was the nature of the role that restricted his performance. I rate it 8 out of 10.

18 November 1998,"Absolute dominion over all living things, and peanut butter blows his mind?!","To be fair, I should admit that I haven't actually seen this entire film: my wife and I left after about an hour, unable to stand the torture any more. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen.

From the hackneyed use of ""media baron"" as a central character; to Brad Pitt's apparent decision to abandon all actual acting technique, and simply hope that his soulful staring and preening will tell us all we need to know about his character (it worked for me - I believed that he was a moron) - very little about this film appealed to me.

And let me see if I've got this straight: Death, who has absolute dominion over the fate of every living organism who will ever live, falls into a catatonic euphoria over peanut butter?! Come on! Give us a Death who is so jaded by his power, that he can barely resist the temptation to monkey with people's lives once he makes an appearance in the material world - and then - yes, I could stand it for the sake of marketability - have the true love of an unforgettable woman awaken him to all that is miraculous about ""our"" world. Don't give us Forrest Gump in a saggy suit.

In sum, I found this remake too ""by-the-numbers"" to be anything special. It's almost as if the makers simply checked off the ingredient list from a Recipe for a Successful Date Movie: ""Mix together a formidable foreign actor, a bankable Hollywood pretty boy, and a gorgeous young starlet. Have them play rich and beautiful people. Sprinkle in some quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo. Hope for movie magic.""

Didn't happen for me here ...",2
18 January 1999,Good but long,"Thanks to the Times we went to a free preview of this film prior to it's general release. The film was 45 minutes too long but I found it well made and enjoyable. Pitt and Hopkins in my opinion, but not the newspaper critics, worked well together. A further treat was the stunning beauty of the leading lady. I say ignore the critics and give it a try. 8/10

22 November 1998,POWERFUL,"I went to this movie expecting to see a sappy love story. I came out of it not believing what I had just seen. Check this movie out. It is a powerful, moving story with some laughs in it. Anthony Hopkins is excellent and so is Brad Pitt. The movie is about three hours long but the time flew by. You will want to see it again.

22 December 1998,"""Death"" nearly did me in...","Good heavens, this film needed an hour trimmed from it. Brad was obviously cast because the studio wanted the Stud-du-jour for box office bottom-line assurance, Anthony Hopkins to give it credibility, and Claire Forlani (who has successfully completed The Ally McBeal School of Nervous Vulnerability, Demur Gestures and Limited Eye Contact: was I the ONLY person to make the connection?) to utterly annoy us. I wish Death had taken her and left her father; at least he had personality AND acting ability. The supporting stars shown far more brightly than our two boring lovebirds. And frankly, I'd take Anthony Hopkins over Brad in a heartbeat.

Too bad; with appropriate editing, I would have given this film three and a half stars out of four. As it plays (and plays and plays and plays), it sadly warrants a measly two and a half.

Nice try, but we deserved better.

A long movie, but went by far too fast. Brad Pitt and Sir Anthony Hopkins were magnificent. Two of the best actors on screen right now...and possibly ever. The looks Brad would get on his face were so entrancing but childlike. Great ending. A must see movie and purchase on video.

3 January 1999,An excellent chosen cast makes this an enjoyable movie.,"A good movie. Not outstandingly excellent, but truly enjoyable. The cast choice was however above the average. Not one character was out of place. Sir Anthony (as William) was the highlight - again, of course, but Ms Forlani(as Susan), a first timer to me, played her role with passion. To me the other two outstanding choices for their roles were Jake Weber (as Drew - really very good) and Jeffrey Tambor (as Quince). Mr Pitt (as Joe Black) was acceptable. His character did however not give him space to get his head out of the clouds - and this floating-in-heaven look on his face got a bit irritating in the long run. But he did good of what was expected of him. The movie's length was not a known fact to me beforehand, but at no stage did it bother me to sit so long, but some of the long scenes were too long. The quality of the depth of what was said became a bit shallower. Life always has death blowing in its neck, and those who know of the time of door-knocking in advance, has a little advantage to put quality into what is left before opening the door. Joe Black's visit portrays this very good - if the supernatural parts are taken with a pinch of salt.

19 January 1999,"Hopkins perfect, movie boring, Forlani beautiful!","""Meet Joe Black"" shows (as ""Legends of the Fall"" did) that the combination of Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt is specially made for fans of the heart-break-genre. Although there are some funny dialogues between tears and breaking hearts, there are far too many of these sentimental non-sense scenes. Anthony Hopkins acted - as usual - perfect, in my opinion also Brad Pitt wasn't that bad some critics say he was. But I think, Johnny Depp would have been a better choice for this character! If the love-scenes weren't that long (and boring), I would like this movie, so I only like Claire Forlani!!

5 January 1999,Typical calculated Hollywood dreck that didn't know when to end.,"This movie should have been called City of Death (but as bad as it is it's not as bad as City of Angels which I fell asleep during and only saw because it was an inflight movie). Brad Pitt replacing Nicolas Cage as the ingenuous imortal who comes to Earth to get a taste a'life n' falls in love. One slick cliche followed by another for nearly three hours. The only redeaming things about the movie were occasional funny moments and Anthony Hopkins who played the only three dimensional character in the whole !@## film! It also seems as if they couldn't figure how to end the mess they started

It was based on a good premise too bad it wasn't better done.

An inferior and unnecessary remake? Check. One of the worst directors currently working in Hollywood? Check. Major logistical leaps? Check. Emotionless acting(I don't care if it's justified, it's not interesting to watch)? Check. Unmotivated character actions? Check. This film has got it all!

An utter indulgence from beginning to (when will it) end.

Proof that people are starving for romance so badly that they will grasp to anything that promises it.

15 November 2002,Almost good,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings.

28 January 2002,Meet Joe Black if you can stay awake that long !,"I don't mind long films provided the content in between 'opening credits' and 'closing titles' is worthy of watching. Meet Jo Black was for me however the most tediously long and drawn out drivel it's been my mispleasure to watch. Despite Hopkins best efforts with a dull script and Pitt's excellent acting ability (thought he was great in Fight Club, Twelve Monkeys and Se7en) it just does nothing for me. Perhaps other people enjoyed it but it really wasn't for me. I give this film a 2/10 and recommend it for all insomniacs.

24 April 2003,Awesome movie but could have been better...,"Yes, this was a really great movie. However, there were some flaws, however minor. When people who have seen the movie think of it they say, ""Oh, yeah, the one with Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins!"" They don't think of Claire Forlani, even though she was the lead actress. She seems to be in the shadow of the two men (particularly Pitt), either because her performance was not as good as their's or because the part she portrayed did not allow her to stand out very much. Pitt's acting in this movie was excellent, and I don't think I would have changed anything about his performance. He really fit his part well. Hopkins also did very well. He was able to become his character nicely, but he didn't really seem to be that afraid of Death, in the movie. Maybe that was the way it was supposed to be, but still, it might have helped. Claire Forlani was very good, too, but she seemed to be in Pitt's shadow way too much. It seemed like she was just in awe of him, as though he were a giant that she had to gaze up at in order to see. Also, it was three hours. I sat through the whole thing and it was excellent, but it wasn't worth the whole 3 hours. Thanx 4 reading my review!! XOXOXOXO --Gloria = )

13 February 2005,"To live life to the fullest, you need to have loved","""To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try. Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived."" This line delivered by William Parrish (played by Anthony Hopkins) in his customary charismatic and empowering way, encapsulates pretty much everything the movie is about. The way this thought is explored through the progress of the movie is very innovative, in terms of the personification of 'death' and the concept of 'his' being on vacation.

This movie talks about the life of a man who is, in essence, a success story. He is someone who believes in living life to the fullest and he wants people who he loves, to be the same way. He is a risk taker in every aspect of life and he strongly believes in taking all the drawbacks in his stride and thereafter bouncing back. His biggest weakness is his love for his daughter 'Susan' played by Claire Forlani. His love for her is so strong that it takes over him to the extent that he almost finds it hard to respect any of her decisions. This leads to him trying to control her life and decisions, though he has only good intentions at heart, while trying to maneuver her life, so that it can be ""perfect"" or at least what he thinks is perfect.

It is at this point that 'death' played by Brad Pitt walks into the scene in the body of a human being called 'Joe Black'. The purpose of his visit was to explore the human world and he chose 'William Parrish"" , to be his guide through this journey for two reasons; one being that Parrish was the perfect embodiment of a knowledgeable, successful and happy man and the other being that he wanted to pick someone who had lived his/her life to the fullest so he would be justified in taking him/her away from this world at the end of his 'vacation'.

What I loved about the movie was how ironic it was that whatever Parrish tried to convince Susan about living life, came back to haunt him as she decided to take the plunge by falling madly in love with the one person that only Parrish knew was 'death' and not suitable for her. It was amazing see a man who was not afraid of dying actually fear death because he did not want to let go of life until he was assured that his daughter was in good hands.

Another fascinating aspect of the movie was how 'death', in the short time that he spent in the real world, learned about love and sacrifice. As he explored the concepts of emotions and feelings, he grew attached to Susan and in due course of time was convinced he loved her. Despite Bill Parrish's continued effort to persuade him to not ruin Susan's life, he was stubborn in his will to be with her and take her with him. But even death, in his most ominous self, realized one of the strongest challenges in loving someone uninhibitedly; sacrificing something for the well being of the one you love. As this dawned upon him towards the end of the movie, he decided to leave Susan on earth and give her the chance to live life to its fullest. I feel that, it is in this act that the film maker tries to set 'death' as an example for us mortals and show us the right way to live and love.

I strongly recommend this movie to everyone mainly because it gives you a perspective on life and death and how everyone has his or her 'time' in this world.",
13 October 2001,Hopkins has a look on his face that carries the sting of a bad shave as Pitt looks for the final cut.,"All fragments of events collect around Joe Black as he steps into an abstraction of his own world to avoid reality.At least, the reality of life and death.A superb film ,foolish, whispering,thunder'd. How many bundled links do we find in the neural labyrinth.

31 January 1999,Days of our Lives meets The Twilight Zone,"Apart from an award winning car accident scene this movie would be one of the worst I have ever seen. Hours upon hours of people staring into each others eyes and saying nothing. I can't believe the Producers watched this film and still released it. I saw it at a free preview, so I couldn't demand my money back, but who's going to pay for the 3 hours of my life that I lost? If you don't believe me, go and see it, but take a cushion and a book and probably a cut lunch.

Yes it's true that this movie is about 20 to 30 minutes too long and the ending is weak, but other than that this movie is excellent and really makes you think about life and death. in the end.

14 November 1998,bring some coffee,"Definitely not as moving as the original ""Death Takes A Holiday"" (rather disturbingly left off the credits as the source material) with the inimitable Frederick March, nonetheless Meet Joe Black has its moments. It's too long, yes, and filled with pregnant pauses that don't always deliver brilliant offspring. But there are aspects of this film that provide the kinds of goods that cinema has always provided since the days of Valentino and Pickford: Beautiful people to look at. Claire Forlani is very appealing, and Brad Pitt is the best looking man in the movies today. Not enough?

OK. Anthony Hopkins is fine as the powerful media magnate who is bound for Jordan's banks. Without him this film could have been a chore.

Brad Pitt's character in the beginning of the film is very winning, but he disappears when Death takes him over. The Death character is less appealing and Pitt struggles with it, not always successfully. His best moments are the scenes with a dying Jamaican woman in a hospital. There his liveliness and intensity are evident. Of course, being Death, how lively can he really be?

And it's too long. Did I mention that?

The sub-plot about the boardroom takeover is somewhat labored and feels inorganic to the rest of the story. However, taken as a whole, this film is better than the critics are giving it credit for.

It's just too damn long.",6
28 May 2001,Much too long. Would be a great movie if it was edited down quite a bit.,"My wife described this movie as `boring and tedious'. While I liked it somewhat more than she did, I do think that it was much too long, and parts of it seemed to drag on endlessly. This movie tells a great story, but it could have told this story much better in two hours than in nearly three.

31 July 1999,Brad an Angel?,"I rented this movie mainly because it didn't run very long in my area. It was long, but I was pleased. I hadn't expected to be. I love Brad and Anthony Hopkins, but I had read it was a sleeper, for real. I don't think I would have wanted to set in the theater that long, but at home when you can stop and start, it was entertaining. I got scared it was not going to have a happy ending, though. I would rent it again, but I would not have paid twice to see it in the theater, since I didn't even pay once to see it.

12 April 1999,Dull and way too long,"The plot was promising but at 3 hours, how can it be nothing but poor direction. This was the dullest movie ever produced. Cut the length to 1/3 the time and maybe it would have been enjoyable.

The only redeeming point was Anthony Hopkins. He turned in a stellar performance. This is all that will make the film worth your time.

21 February 1999,This is not a Brad Pitt film - it's Anthony Hopkins',"Many people walk into Meet Joe Black expecting a Brad Pitt star vehicle. And while in many instances this is the case - the film really belongs to the character of Bill Parrish - stunningly played by Anthony Hopkins.

Hopkins is wonderful in playing a rare screen character - a billionaire who is not an evil, manipulative bastard.

Along with him, the entire supporting cast is excellent even though some of the material their characters are given are awfully cliche (Jake Weber's Drew)

Brad Pitt is fine as a somewhat bewildered Death, and Claire Forlani makes an excellent effort in her first major role.

Kudos go to the screenwriters too, as there is some great dialogue and speeches by all major characters in the film.

I saw this film in a sold out theatre which certainly added to the atmosphere, but it was an excellent film all round.

This is the one film in a long time where I have to completely disagree with the majority feelings of the critics.",9
7 May 1999,"An inspired movie about life, cynics stay home--a must see for everyone else.","I have never commented on a movie before, but I can't get this movie out of my mind and heart. It is truly one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is a movie for those who believe in life, with all of its ups and downs. I am not a teen-age idol of Brad Pitt, and expect acting ability in an actor in spite of his incredible good looks. In this movie I found both. .. Brad Pitt's dual portrayal of the guy in the coffee shop and death/Joe Black is testament to the depth of his acting ability. Contrary to the critics' opinions, I thought his portrayal of the character ""death"" was deeply emotional and powerful. There was a quiet calmness, a depth of character and even a certain peacefulness in this character which I found consistent with the eternity of death, in contrast to the boyish charm of the guy in the coffee shop. It almost made it seem possible that this character could exist. Anthony Hopkins portrayal of a man who is facing death in a matter of days or hours is realistic without being morbid, and was nothing less than spectacular. In fact, his performance makes the viewer believe that it really is possible to have no regrets if one can live a life with meaning and integrity. Truly ""a man like you, Bill"" would have no reason to be afraid. I have seen this film 5 times now, and each time I have found it more entrancing. If this film were one minute shorter, it would lose much of its power. It is in the silent looks exchanged between the characters, the pauses in the dialogue and the timelessness of many of the lines which give the movie its ""haunting"" quality. It is easy to see why the critics didn't like it--it is not a cheap Hollywood story. The movie makes you think and demands that you take a look at your own life and your relationships with those around you. It is a must see.",10
3 April 1999,Twice as long as it should have been,"If this were a community theatre play rather than a movie, the audience would have been convinced the actors didn't know their lines. Dramatic pauses can be effective, but long pauses between simple conversation bits is just ridiculous. This had a deadly slow pace throughout.

4 May 1999,A Great Movie!!!! (Could've had a different ending though),"It seems as though I have heard that 'Death is our companion throughout the whole of our lives'. This was a wonderful movie. I wanted to see it at the theatre, but alas, they all come and go in a blink! Brad Pitt was excellent and such a comedian. (I never would've guessed!) Anthony Hopkins!! Well, what need I say? He is classic! Claire Forlani, hmmm, well she is definitely beautiful but for some reason every time there was a scene where she looked at Joe, she looked as if she were going to cry. Maybe I am not used to her eyes. This movie certainly had those qualities to make you think a bit deeper about how we take each day for granted and yet we really don't have the opportunity that William Parish did. The opportunity to know when we are going and get things in order before we do. It is not death we should be afraid of, only dying. Oh well, great movie, but the ending could have been different.

18 August 1999,A good film -which is much these days,"Not a wonderful film obviously. But it has many merits -ie, the editing is perfectly suited for the story. When 3 hrs go by and you didn't notice, there must undoubtedly be something good there. It would have been better if it spared its last 5 minutes, but that's all too common and shouldn't bother much.

9 August 1999,Excellent Movie,"This movie gives me the feeling it was one made out of love for the story and the art of making it. Scenes were given the time they need to tell the story in real time instead the usual chopping off on the editing room floor to meet time constraints. My compliments to the director and actors. I will watch this movie again and again.

14 February 2013,Possibly the most underrated film of all time.,"This film is horrendously underrated. The brilliance of the storyline is matched by the incredible ensemble of actors and actresses compounded with brilliant directing. Death is flawlessly personified, and the uniqueness of this personification is what sets Meet Joe Black apart from similar works that personify death. The pace of the film is slow, but this is not a bad thing. The dialog is, of course, the aspect that makes up the vast majority of the film, and that is what truly demonstrates the phenomenal writing, directing and acting abilities inherent in this film. Do not let the length of this film deter you from seeing it; if you appreciate fine filmmaking, you'll love this film.

3 November 2022,Truly Awful,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",1
1 November 1999,"Well thought out drama with gorgeous camera work, and a cast and script to die for.","Very difficult to characterize but most pleasant and thought provoking to watch. We didn't know what to expect going in, but held on to the very end. Most satisfying performances.

Sometimes a film like this carries you along only to leave you flat at the end. Not this one. The ending offers a real resolution.

Great film.

19 August 1999,Too many twists and turns,"The coffee shop scene is the only worthy scene in ""Meet Joe Black"" (from now on, MJB). Pitt's and Forlani's characters seem genuinely interested in one another.

The rest is a complete failure because MJB asks too much from the audience; it makes the audience aware that this is a movie and the people they see on screen are actors trying to portray characters. A good movie should not do this! The audience, or reader, should be so enraptured by the events and the characters that the audience feels s/he is experiencing life. In MJF, however, there are too many gaps, too many unanswered questions, too many twists and turns. One wonders whether Susan is in love with Death or the man in the coffee shop. One also wonders the plausibility in the character of Death. How does Death play a role in the cosmic order, if he is a virgin to life? The happy ending in the affairs of Hopkins' character is just too much; to the attentive audience, it is obvious that these Hollywood writers are wrapping up what they have unfolded, suckering the audience without shame, without much consideration to the sensitivity of the audience: Death and Bill working together to reveal the swindle behind Susan's ex-boyfriend to the corporation, Susan meeting the guy in the coffee shop after everything is all over, among other things.

In an over all impression of MJB, Pitt is definitely miscast as Death (though he does a good job as the young man in the coffee shop). Hopkins does a superb job in revealing the strength and warmth of his character. The son-in-law and the two daughters character are plausible. Out of four stars, I give MJB one star!",
5 June 2000,Good gracious - what a stink,"There is no crueller thing than to force a right-thinking individual to view, in its entirety, a Merchant-Ivory film. They are ponderous and poorly cast - impossible to connect to in any way that is human, and more than likely infested with one or more of Helena Bonham Carter, Julian Sands, or Bernadette Peters. Imagine my horror then, in discovering that there is a darker pit of culturally misguided artistry in the breast of that most American of directors: Martin Brest. With a pedigree of such resoundingly poor films as Beverly Hills Cop (a film so woeful at its heart that Sylvester Stallone turned it down), Midnight Run, & Scent of a Woman, it is with an admittedly heavy heart that during my latest masochism-fest, I picked up his dream project - Meet Joe Black.

A remake of a film that I've never heard of before, 1934's Death Takes a Holiday, Brest's film is a light romantic fantasy about Death manifesting itself as Brad Pitt to see what it's like to really live. Judging by Pitt's performance, if Death really wanted to learn about life he probably should have chosen a better vehicle. Death reveals himself to Anthony Hopkins who plays Bill Parish - a successful businessman and father of two grown daughters who, on his 65th birthday, will suffer a fatal heart attack. Before that happens, Death asks Bill to act as His guide to human experience. Unpredictably, Brad Pitt's Death falls in love with Bill's youngest daughter, the very lovely but very grimace-y Claire Forlani, and finds Himself on the horns of a romantic dilemma.

Not enough plot for a three-hour film, you say? Fear not - Bill is being robbed of his corporation by a vermin go-getting, Tim-Roth-Lookalike and it's up to Death to save his legacy. He does this, not ironically, by posing as an IRS agent. Have I forgotten to mention that Pitt, at one point, imitates a Jamaican accent to better communicate with a dying old Jamaican woman? Oh yes, Claire Forlani (nurse Grimace as I like to call her), is a doctor of internal medicine and Death follows her on her rounds (HA!). Anyone that's seen Seven Years in Tibet recognizes the unadvisability of Pitt doing an accent. It would have been a nice thing if Pitt had done an imitation of a human being to better communicate with the audience.

Did I mention that this movie is actually 3 hours long? To be fair, the film is nice to look at and, were any of the actors to actually speak in a normal cadence rather than their ponderous, measured, drippy-faucet, mumbling, it would only be 90 minutes.

The film fails as a romantic drama. It fails as a romantic comedy (although the sensitive love-making scene is unintentionally hilarious, as is the scene where Pitt gets hit by two cars). It fails as a dark fantasy - and as a light fantasy. It fails as a drama of any sort - or anything that approaches whimsy or wit. Already faltering, the film grinds to a crashing halt when it attempts to handle a neurotic older sister and her competition for her father's attentions. In three hours, one has a reasonable right to expect some sort of reward. The ending, however, is a bizarre, hackneyed thing that is so poorly tacked on it resembles in spirit that paper tail of that beknighted donkey of children's party fame after the retarded cajun with the helmet has had his turn.

There are so many questions that are raised by this sad monstrosity. Chief among them:

1. why is Death, omnipotent as he is, so clumsy around people? Pitt plays him as some kind of Starman without the charming pathos (or the expected unfamiliarity of an alien with humanity). 2. why does Brad Pitt, so excellent in 12 Monkeys, Kalifornia, & Seven, suck out loud in this film? You feel like turning up the RPM's on the turntable. One wishes someone had told him the camera was on. 3. why is Anthony Hopkins in this film? I haven't seen Instinct yet, but I'm pretty sure this will be a question raised by that film as well. 4. why doesn't the daughter of the elderly Jamaican woman wonder why this young white man is mocking their accent so outrageously and poorly? 5. why did this film cost $90 million dollars and six months to make? 6. why did I watch the entire film?

There are more, but I wouldn't want to ruin it for you. The only reason, really, to watch the sad, beknighted thing is found in the marginal joy one gets from watching the hollywood very beautiful and the very rich fail spectacularly in spectacularly embarrassing ways.

Meet Joe Black is a mess of a film. It is the worst film that I've seen this week and I watched ten minutes of Vampires and all of End of Days. At one point, I switched the audio over to French and threw on the English subtitles. The acting immediately improved and the dialogue, although still idiotic and terminally stilted, was at least in French, that native tongue of the idiotic and the terminally stilted. You must realize that any film that seems good in French is probably catastrophically poor in English. You'd be right if this is what you realize.

scale of 1-100 = 10 diseases I'd rather contract than watch it again: anthrax, an explosive viral infection that occurs primarily in cattle best frame of mind to view this film in: sado-masochistic sugar delirium",
14 June 2003,too long too boring...,"This movie is 2 hours more than it should be brad pitt at one of his worst movies trying to sell himself as death but actually he sells the the death of his acting career.

the whole story is quite boring, it's actually a stupid love story. a simple family getting together. nothing more. really.

15 December 2002,Too long by about an hour,"I don't know what movie the others were watching, by this one really bugged me. Of course, I was watching it on TV, so the experience was a little different, but I found myself wondering when it was going to end. The dialog was alternately pretentious and trite. In his wonderful Disk World series of novels, Terry Pratchett has Death speak IN ALL CAPS, LIKE THIS. The script of this movie sounds as if it were written in all caps, with long pauses so we can all absorb its IMPORTANCE. Also, the adulation the author gives to the tycoon played by Anthony Hopkins irritated me. I've never met a CEO who everyone liked, although they probably pretended they did. Most of them are dreadful beasts. This is ""It's a Wonderful Life"" for the upper crust. Of course, it's a wonderful life, you dummy, you're rich! The choice of music in the final party sequence, which seemed to run in real time, was hokey in the extreme, though I guess most of the audience wouldn't recognize ""Our Love is Here to Stay"", ""Top Hat, White Tie, and Tails"", or even (this one is really abused) ""It's a Wonderful World"", all used to comment on the cheesy dialog.

Its funny, (the comedy lies in the ability to poke fun at death) insightful, (it makes you question your own mortality) and romantic. (Susan Parrish and Brad Pitt share some well acted intimate moments)There is no question that it is on a completely different level and it beats any of the usual suspects i.e pretty much anything with Sandra Bullock in it. Of course I have to mention the music throughout which is nothing short of spectacular and although it has a couple of cliche moments overall I'd give it a thumbs up! Oh and I would really like a piece of that birthday cake. It looked very yummy!

3 April 2000,"Great performance by Pitt and Hopkins, good score, stimulating","Both Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt give excellent performances. It's a wonder neither of them was nominated for an Academy Award. Claire Forlani also does a good job, but is far overshadowed by Pitt and Hopkins.

The plot is mostly believable. It is entertaining to see Death (Pitt) react to input from his five human senses and adjust to them. These inputs bring him very close to being fully human, thus confusing his job of ""taking people"" when their time comes to die. The camera angles change as Death becomes more ""human.""

I especially appreciated the movie's comments on what life and love are. They are definitely NOT trite, and leave the viewer with plenty of food for thought. I'm not much of a fan of love stories, but this one grabbed my interest, largely due to the characters involved. A love affair with Death is not everyday fare!

Lastly, the score is also excellent. It complemented screen action well.

This movie is highly recommended, especially for those who enjoy intellectual stimulation and philosophical debate.",10

8 September 2004,Sublime is all I can muster,"This movie was near perfect for me. I am not an expert on film, i.e. I do not have a degree in anything remotely to do with film. However, I watch a lot of them and this movie is amazing. I have yet to see anything on film about the beauty of life portrayed better than this movie. The dialogue was exquisite. Every line mattered. Nothing was left to chance and the result was a feeling of floating through it much like death must have felt taking the role of a human.

Marcia Gay Harding had a couple of scenes and the standout speech she gives to her father of why he need not concern himself that she was not the favorite was such a valuable lesson that the entire movie was worth the trouble just for that. Unbelievable. And to me every performance and every conversation was equally profound. I don't think I can watch this movie without sobbing for joy/sadness; just the emotion or tangle of to express life and death.

What better way to show power than to be quietly confident not questioning your own thoughts or words the way Death must speak. This same wisdom was mirrored by Anthony Hopkins' character and made the beautiful dance of admiration and fear both characters displayed toward one another until inevitably only love remains.

This is the kind of movie to see several times.

Do yourself a favor and make sure you are in the correct frame of mind to appreciate this, meaning, just sit down and relax and let the movie do its magic for you.",
15 August 2000,better than run-of-the-mill drama/romances,"""Meet Joe Black"" is made wonderful by great photography and the arresting presence of Claire Forlani. Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins, no doubt, worked their magic on screen as well. But, the story is conceptually amazing. It's not everyday filmmakers dream up a romance involving death and its acceptance of life.

10 March 2005,Warms up well,"This film begins with big Hollywood (hollow wood) glamour, and perhaps more than a bit uncertain in its characters. But it warms up -- gradually but surely with each scene -- into a movie to fall in love with. One falls in love with the boundless freedom and power of these characters' lives. One falls in love with Claire Forlani, as always. And one falls in love with the performances of Hopkins and Pitt, as always.

But what is it about, this film? We must recognize its devices. Forlani's character is engaged to marry the wrong man. Hopkins' character is very rich. Death enters their lives with a profound and sincere interest in Susan (Forlani).

There's no reason to presume that Pitt's character, immortal Death, has never been in a human body before or has never been in love before. Perhaps the last time was three hundred or three thousand years ago. We only know it was not recent -- it's uncommon to him. We know (presumably) that if he has taken on the mortal coil before, it could not have been in the life he chose this time. We know that love is -- this time, or always -- new to him. What can we know about the existence of the character Death? We know that the immortal played by Mr Pitt covets the mortal embrace of life, of Susan Parrish.

The film reminds us how life can be lived, and another loved, to make immortals jealous of our mortality.",7

16 November 1998,Painfully slow pace ruins the potential . . .,"Meet Joe Black offered an interesting premise that could have worked had the pacing been far faster (the running time on this film is 180 minutes). Susan (Claire Forlani) says it best within the first ten minutes of the film ""Give me the abridged version."" Forlani, by the way, lights up the big screen. She creates her own chemistry (i.e. no need for Brad Pitt as her leading man). Hopkins delivers his usual sound performance, and even Pitt pulled off his role rather well.

It also reminds us all to live life each day in the present with gratitude as it is a miraculous gift. I highly recommend it as it has evoked lots of wonderful, glorious feelings in my soul. The opulence in the picture was not over done. It simply was a feast to the eyes! What more is there to say, except that this movie was truly delicious to ever part of our senses.

11 April 1999,The Big Sleep!,"At $787,000 per minute, ""Meet Joe Black"" may be the most expensive afternoon nap Hollywood and American audiences have taken in years! With an inane and completely predictable plot, helpless actors who seem to have been told to count to 30 between each line of dialogue, laughably pompous production values and Brad Pitt's particularly lame performance as ""Death,"" this huge ship of fools sinks in three hours while the Titanic only took two!

The many reviews of this film both here and in the press have dealt with the more obvious shortcomings but one cannot deny that Claire Forlani gives the most mannered performance since Sandy Dennis. Her eyes seem to dart everywhere except into those of her fellow actors. She's truly painful to watch.

14 November 1998,A different take on life & love,"Meet Joe Black is certainly an original film and idea. Death takes a vacation to see what life is all about, and he ends up falling in love. Sir Anthony Hopkins gives a wonderful performance (as usual) as Bill Parish, the man that Death decides he wants as his guide on Earth, before he takes him. Brad Pitt is a pleasant surprise as Death/Joe Black. A scene in which he tries peanut butter for the first time, he gives off the impression that he truly is having it for the first time. The film's characters tend to say some overly-romantic things that make you wonder if the writers were trying too hard to make sure the audience can see the kind of ""head over heels"" love they are portraying. Also, there are a few over dramatic moments in which the score is simply blasting overture in order to create a special dramatic moment, that just seems to be pushing it too hard. At just about 3 hours, Meet Joe Black does feel a little long, but you don't seem to feel it until you reach the end. All in all, the film lets you think about how much time you really have and whether or not you can live your life to the fullest in the time that you are here on Earth. The question that you ask yourself at the end as you leave the theatre is, ""Has someone thanked me for loving them, and have I thanked someone for being loved?""",9
4 December 1998,"A nice surprise, considering I went for the SW1 trailer...","I admit it -- I went to see MEET JOE BLACK simply because it happened to be running the STAR WARS: EPISODE I trailer. Not being even remotely in the general category of ""Brad Pitt fan"" I was not exactly gung-ho about seeing this flick, but the fact that one of my favourites -- Tony Hopkins -- played one of the leads softened me up a bit. I'm glad it did. While this will not be everyone's cup of tea (it's more for the hopeless romantics), it's a very good film, which is wonderfully acted by all involved -- especially Jeffery Tambor -- and nicely directed by Martin Brest.

23 October 1998,well-done story,"I had the great possibility to see the movie early and I was truly overwhelmed by it. Anthony Hopkins as a lovable family-father (the direct opposite of our 'beloved' Hannibal Lector) and Brad Pitt as death, who re-used his 'Interview with a Vampire'-experiences. All in all a touching movie, although the storyline reminded me on 'City of Angels'.

23 March 1999,One of the best movies of the year.,"A lot of people have said that this movie was boring, too long. I disagree. All the pauses in the conversations were absolutely needed to make the film work. With excellent acting by the three main actors this was truly one of the best pictures of the year (1998).

25 November 1998,The chick flick that never ends,"First of all, let me say I'm not a romance fan. A friend recommended this film to me, and I am a big fan of Anthony Hopkins...I'm even willing to admit that I sorta like Brad Pitt, though I'm not female. But whoa...even granted my admitted skepticism and dislike of this particular genre, I found very little to like about ""Meet Joe Black"". Direction: missing. Editing: did the editor just take a long lunch break? There's no need for this movie to be 3 hours long. Take out the long lingering shots of Brad Pitt alone and the film would lose an hour. Music: ouch. Sappy, too much, too loud, far too manipulative. But the basic problem with the film is Brad Pitt. He's just awful. No direction, no focus, no development, no goals.Maybe I'm missing the attraction of watching a guy like Pitt fumble around embarrassingly and pretend like he's experiencing everything for the first time; as I said, I'm not a woman. But for me, Brad Pitt was absolute dead weight in this film, which makes for a bit of a sticky situation as he's one of the leads. The writing, on the other hand, was even worse. Hackneyed, trite, generic, cliched, tired; at times frankly insulting. Hopkins managed to save much of the script from itself (at least his bits), but these guys (Osborn and Reno) have little or no grasp of decent dialogue. Claire Forlani is certainly beautiful, but her facial expressions became tiresome fast, bordering on gimmicky before the film was half over (why CAN'T she make eye contact even once in awhile? She was like the lead singer of ""the Bangles""). Hopkins is marvelous, however; he truly is one of the finest performers of this or any other generation. I would rank this among the most workmanlike performances from him I've seen; given the atrocious script he had to work with. For me the bright spot of the film (outside of the pure joy of watching Anthony Hopkins perform) was Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Tambor. They were terrific. Harden's desperate need for her father's love and attention; Tambor's bumbling naivety and love for his wife; and Hopkins' endearing, dignified love for his daughters (Hopkins truly is, as Harden says, ""a wonderful father"") are the things I'll take away from this film, almost in and of themselves enough to save the film for me. But not quite. Maybe I just don't get it.",
9 October 2006,It may surprise you.,"I have watched this film a number of times and on each occasion find I am delighted all over again. Although the basic storyline remains with me I find new nuances not noticed previously. Not only are the actors each wonderful in their roles, but the overall package is both entertaining and absorbing. I find ""Meet Joe Black"" to be a thought provoking and mesmerizing concept. Sure, Death takes a holiday has been done before but I particularly like this version where we see Death learn the ways of humankind, and come to value life itself. I particularly enjoy the music. It is both haunting and evocative.I recommend it to anyone - not just Brad Pitt fans. It may surprise you (but bring tissues). Just one point though, the final scene. Susan appears to understand that her father has died and that Joe has reverted back to the man in the coffee shop. Although moving this scene always poses unanswered questions for me. However, the film remains one of my favourites.

4 December 1998,Sweet but not short,"""Meet Joe Black"" was a beautiful movie overall and definitely one of the best dramas this year. Much of the screen play was well imagined, many of the ideas were succinct and well portrayed, but the movie itself was slightly drawn out and repetitive. It was unique, though; as a parable I found Joe Black taught several important lessons about life in very emotional and dramatic ways. See if you can catch them all.

29 August 2021,Long boring frustrating movie!!!,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",1
25 January 1999,Perfect - for the first 20 minutes anyway.,"This movie had the perfect ending. Trouble is it was in a scene about 20 minutes into the movie - the sickeningly realistic scene where Brad Pitt gets killed. Leave the theater after that and you won't be anywhere near as disappointed as if you stay for the rest of it.

This movie would have to rank up there with `Beloved' as hot favorite for the award for `Best painfully drawn out, tried-too-hard interpretation of a potentially good story'. What's up with Hollywood at the moment? It really frustrates me to see so many badly done movies lately.

11 October 1999,A masterpiece that celebrates the joys of life and love!,"When I first heard of ""Meet Joe Black"", I thought '3 hours! I don't think so!' But when I sat down and gave it a chance, I immediately became engrossed in the film. Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt both give outstanding performances in this praise-worthy film. ""Meet Joe Black"" is a masterpiece that celebrates the joys of life and love, and touched my heart and emotions like no other movie I've ever seen in my life. The brilliant directing of Martin Brest and the charming story all made this film worthwhile. A truly inspirational and touching film! --- 10 out of 10

13 January 2007,Outstanding Cinema * Recommend Highly * Brad Pitt is Superb *,"This film is an outstanding example of well casted, well acted cinema - It touches the familiar feelings deep inside of all of us and has such clarity to how we deal with personal issues both positive and tragic - How we all make an effort to understand the long and winding road before us in this life and in any additional manner of life following -

also important to note, Brad Pitt being an Understudy in many was to the great Robert Redford - of course Redford having Brad Pitt play the very unique role in ""A River Runs Through It "" what many of you probably overlook -is that Robert Redford played a similar short role in a classic Rod Serling brief early in his career around 1962 - about an injured policeman who comes to an old woman's cabin - and he (Redford) is Mr. Death -

So it is very ironic that Brad Pitt should have this great chance at a similar role in Meet Joe Black - being the handsome young man coming to Hopkins as Death, just as similar was Reford, even more handsome when he was younger, coming to the old woman's house as Death -

Meet Joe Black should have been recognized far more by the academy - it is a must to see - and can be viewed quite often while still enjoying it, this is a 10 on scale of 1 - 10 and will hold up as the years go on - most certainly -

See this film - you will really enjoy it - If you like quality films - You really have to love this artistic piece -

Heres to world peace: Ponch *",10
14 February 2001,oh man did this take long...,"is this a so-called feelgood-movie? everybody being very nice to each other, except one guy who tries to spoil the fun but luckily ""death"" is there to correct the situation. well, i didn't feel good. if you make a movie 3h long you have to have a good reason, and this film doesn't. nothing, i repeat, nothing happens. then there are these close-ups of faces all the time, and people pause before they speak as though they have to say something important, but they don't. in fact they don't say anything at all, at least nothing that has any meaning. and the characters are just bull***t: a nice mediatycoon who also is a good father? how did the girl become doctor with a soft character like that? and ""death"" behaving like someone with iq below 40? and then all these unanswered questions with nobody caring about about the answer, me inclusive by the way. ok there are longer comments here which are 100% correct, i just felt that i had to add this one to save you from wasting 3h of your life.

2 September 2002,"cheesy, ridiculous, but good somehow","Seeing this movie was something laughable at the corny music playing in the back ground, it seemed purposely bad. But somehow, at the end of the movie, I felt that this movie was still good. Claire Forlani's acting is somewhat okay, but I have to say she is one of my favorites. Even though the script is poorly written, she still manages to pull it off. Brad Pitt is very nice looking in this movie. If you don't like cheesy movies, then this one is not for you. But if you just like Brad, go see it. You might like it just for that reason only.

8 April 2002,"These are relationships among Human, Death and Love.","Meet Joe Black is Ghost plus City of Angels. It contains great humor from death and very sensitive scenes, which sometimes make us cry. Brad Pitt is very cool and we can see the film with his eyes: the life is great, taste and beautiful. At the end of the film we feel that the Death isn't so bad. (Sorry, but my English knowledge isn't too good. :)))

15 May 2004,"This movie is just beautiful, great for daydreamers like myself!","I watched the movie when it came out, and now a second time.. I just gotta say I love this movie.. Brad Pitt is as always good, he doesn't make the mistake of overacting and I guess as always great for the ladies with his dashing good looks, Hopkins is great, but the one who is more or less breathtaking is Claire Forlani.. She really makes Joe Black/Death(Brad Pitt) come to live..

And for those who say this movie is to long, go see a Steven Seagal movie.. If the movie were shortened, even a bit, you would destroy this movies soul.. Just for the teaching part, in my top 100 of all time movies, perhaps 2 or 3 of them are under 2 hours..

So, if u want a beautiful movie and u don't have to be somewhere for the next 3 hours, see this one.. But as said before in other user comments, it's important to see this one in the right mood, perhaps alone so that u don't get disturbed by some chips eating monster.

17 April 2002,Was it really 3 hours? I didn't notice!,"It has come to my knowledge that most people think ""meet joe black"" is too long - although I must agree with several other reviewers that the 3 hours are well spent:

Meet Joe Black is that type of film where you sit and curiously wait for answers to questions like - Can ""death"" fall in love? (and if so what happens?), when will this nice young man show his ""darker"" side and carry out his mission? and so on...

The actors and actresses couldn't have been selected more appropriate for this film. Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt both deliver superb performances - probably because their characters fit them so well. Every time Claire Forlani enters the set my heart starts pounding and I'm completely paralyzed until the scene's over...WOW what a character, in my opinion unmatched in both beauty and personality! With this said I think it's a great(even grand) movie - not just another action or comedy-parody, but a heartfelt movie on the same level as perhaps ""Titanic"".

Thanks!",10

21 December 2003,"good cast, good cinematography, great score, no substance","I can understand why many users commented on how much they loved this movie, as I do agree that it had a decent cast, great musical score, good cinematography, but that isn't all that makes a good movie. This is one of those movies that had all those great things on the surface, plus an interesting premise (death personified, and in love), but no substance to back it up. During the whole [looooong] 3 hours, I was waiting for the movie to really start. When a movie is built on a premise as profound and abstract as the personification of death, one would expect it to have an equally profound and abstract message at the end, but in my opinion ""Meet Joe Black"" fails. The message about love is the same as every other movie (""these things have a way of working themselves out""), and the message about life is basically to live and die without regrets. Wow. Amazing. *insert sarcasm* I also had a hard time buying Death's love for Susan...her own feelings are understandable, as she thinks she's looking at the same man she met in the coffee shop, but he hardly knows anything about her or even spends any time with her, and the next thing we know, they're having sex.

So basically, if you like long, dramatic but pointless movies, then you'll love ""Meet Joe Black."" Brad Pitt fans, stay away from this one, and just go watch ""Legends of the Fall"" and ""Fight Club"" again...Anthony Hopkins fans, stick to ""Silence of the Lambs.""",

22 April 2012,Fabulous Movie---Claire Forlani is brilliant,"as an actor myself, if you watch the opening scene between Pitt and Forlani ( and at the end ) a couple of times, u can see the the brilliant work of two great actors. The opening scene is a wonderful scene that actors might want to try in class, Forlani oozes with vulnerability and sexuality and Pitt who plays kind of a naive but sincere kid looking for work in the big city really shows his talent and why he is an accomplished actor today. The movie is kinda of cheesy but it reminds me of all the bad reviews ""The Natural"" got with Robert Redford in 1985 and that movie now is considered the best baseball movie ever....don't know about Joe Black in 20 years but the love story hit home and my heart.

6 September 2011,Way too long for the plot which seems loosely based on a Twilight Zone,"Brad Pitt in this film looks very much like the young Robert Redford. And Robert Redford, before he was well known, appeared in a Twilight Zone television episode playing Mr. Death. It's hard to believe the screenwriters were unaware of that earlier program. The Twilight Zone episode is at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K78iduBHLpQ (Part 1) and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YKOhsM6CNc (Part 2). The Twilight Zone episode was over in 30 minutes. But the film, albeit with a more complicated plot than the TV program, was way too long. The gimmick in both the movie and the TV program is that Death does not have the usual ominous appearance but rather is an appealing looking young man. That premise can carry a short TV program but not a movie as long as this one.

13 June 2022,I want to love this movie,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",6

2 November 2008,Great Symbolism and Vision. What a way to leave this earth!,"This is one of those films that stirs every emotion found in every human being - love, hate, joy, sadness, grief, happiness, life, death! The fact that two of my favorite actors are part of it, is a tremendous bonus. I watch this movie as often as I can, so my comment has been a long time coming. Sir Anthony Hopkins embodies every perfect man in the imagination of every woman in the world. He is strong, gracious, dignified, respectful, charming, sexy, loving, gentle and gorgeous. Brad Pitt, well, he is just perfect. I believe the cast was carefully chosen to give this movie the sweetness and longing we cherish when we can only hope for goodness to touch our lives. Forlani, Weber, Tambor, Gay Harden... they are wonderful, seasoned and talented. Thank you for always bringing that element of hope and wonder to my life when I watch this movie.

8 August 2014,"Interesting Drama, well acted, lousy ending","I will keep this short as this movie has been reviewed many times before. There is some stellar acting in this movie, a truly excellent cast and a fantastic concept. Brad Pitt does an amazing job seeming truly alien in this movie. The ending however is just terrible and completely forced. I wont give anything away but the acting in the very last scene completely breaks down as characters are forced to act in unnatural ways to facilitate the ending that was scripted. It's not a matter of poor acting but a script that has characters behaving in ways that are completely contrived for the sake of the ending the writer or director chose.

31 August 2005,"Great story line, but far too drawn out...","When I started to watch this movie, I was extremely interested, but as it continued, I became less & less so. The story itself is awesome, but the movie was just too slow moving for me. Maybe I'm just someone who doesn't appreciate a slow climax, but this was just like peanut butter running up hill. With Anthony Hopkins & Brad Pitt being some of my favorite actors, I was rather disappointed.

Meet Joe Black, a movie with a handful of funny scenes, romance, and a few heartfelt ones as well. All in all, an average movie that could have been a lot better, had someone pressed fast-forward. If your not an action fan, it's definitely for you.

15 December 2002,Good movie that could have been better,"There are things about this movie that fascinate me. Anthony Hopkins once again shows his mastery of the craft. The only sad part is that I could see and feel others in the cast trying to come up to the level of Hopkins. Normally, this would have been helped by proper editing. Here it is amplified, especially in the case of Brad Pitt ... not a knock of Pitt, just the way his part came off in this movie. For me, the Jamaican accent came off a bit forced. Forlani came off well. I disagree with some who said her part did not have enough dialogue. Here, it would have made her character seem sappy. I will watch this movie again. Hopkins is just too good ... Today's Alec Guinness or Spencer Tracy.

2 August 2005,Please give it a chance just for the music!,"Amidst all the clamor about ""star's"" personal lives, I must say, Brad Pitt is the very handsome (wish he could have been like) Robert Redford type person in this film (as he was in The River Runs Through It) that makes us girls drool. The music is worth a full box of Kleenex, alone. It is beautiful to look at. Anthony Hopkins continues to amaze. The relationship with the heart melting Bayou woman is heavenly. The ""twist the tables on the creep"" part is grand. Plus, you will never look at peanut butter the same way again. I remember when the film came out, all the buzz was that it was a disaster and that it was too long. Another problem with it was the, ""why do they feel the need to remake such a wonderful film?"", problem. What gets me, in my old age, is that nobody ever stops to remember and realize that ***BROADWAY*** is always reviving the best of the plays and musical comedies with all new casts and sometimes variations on a theme and people don't stir up such a ruckus. In fact, now they have a ""Tony"" category for them. I had better get the DVD. I always watch this when I see it's on. I guess owning the soundtrack is not enough.",10
7 September 2023,A tragedy because of Pitt's 'muggingly' cute ambiguous portrayal,"What a story this could and should have been.

This film is embarrasingly obvious- the antithesis of death's dual attractions as peace and inherent repellant horrors- due in large part to the self conscious Brad Pitt, and spreading through to infect Anthony Hopkins and Jeffery Tambor.

If one wants to tackle the most abstract and ambivalent struggles of life and it's ending, he must spare at all costs the mugging self consciousness of Pitt's portrayal of Death incarnate.

Added into this is a martyred Anthony Hopkins, a truly gifted actor, who never remotely protests or questions why or how all of this supernatural mythological personification lands on him alone, and you have a pat, lazy, maudlin fantasy!

When I think of what MIGHT HAVE BEEN.......",6
19 January 2008,Mesmerizing eyes,"I watched this movie for the first time several months ago and could not miss one second of it. Joe through out the movie has such a wonderment and exciting learner about him. The scenes with Joe and Susan were so intense that it could have been a silent movie with their mesmerizing eyes seducing each other. Anytime they were together they were like magnets so drawn to each other.

Anthony Hopkins was excellent in this movie as was the rest of the cast. Each and every character was portrayed to the fullest extent of all of the actors.

The scene where Joe is at the hospital is magnificent..even the accent from the islands. The movie continues to build and there are no lulls......

I have watched this movie it over and over again even to the point of knowing the dialog! I LOVE IT!!",10
12 July 1999,Brad Pitt's best performance,"Meet Joe Black was a shock because it was emotionally deeper than I expected it to be. Deeper than I expected Brad Pitt to be able to play. His facial expressions are unbelievably good. As he experiences life, shock, sweetness, surprise, puzzlement and dawning comprehension war in his face. I can't imagine how he does it. We expect this level of role portrayal from Anthony Hopkins, he's been superb for many years; to have this level of acting from a man labeled as a ""pretty face"" was astounding. I highly recommend the movie.

14 September 2003,"really liked the movie,it's among my personal top 10.","It might sound strange having Death as one of the main characters of the movie, but what this movie really made me think of is actually ... life. How happy are we at the end of each day with the things we've done throughout the past 24 hours? With the way we've interacted with the people we crossed our path with that day? It seems to me that Mr. Parrish was an example at that, and that's what Death came to find out - what was the secret behind that. Of course - the answer is simple - LOVE. So, go out there - find your true love and be prepared to set an example worth following in the way you live your life!

31 December 2012,writing that brings up some huge questions of cosmic proportion and expresses them in soft spoken phrasings that resonate with the human soul.,"I was surfing channels today and came across ""Meet Joe Black"". I have seen this film several times over the years. I enjoy watching it every time. The power contained in this quiet understated story is unbelievable. I am amazing and inspired every time I watch it by the dialog; the depth of the conversations that define this story. Your writing brings up some huge questions of cosmic proportion and expresses them in soft spoken phrasings that resonate with the human soul. It is almost like you were given some extraordinary power from supernatural forces to bring this story to the world. It is a truly astounding movie and one that everyone should see. it challenges the watcher to ask themselves deep questions about who they are, where they are going, and if they have done enough to connect with those in their life. Thank you so much to Bo Goldman, Kevin Wade, Ron Osborn, and Jeff Reno for writing such an amazingly powerful script.

15 November 1998,"A good movie, though not fantastic","I thought that Brad gave a good performance, a lot of the film depended on his non-verbal communication of Joe Black's personality/innocence. Anthony Hopkins was good as well. I didn't like Claire Forlani or her character at all.

The movie is very long (3 hrs!) and a few plot parts are definitely drawn out. It felt as though it were about to end 3 or 4 times before it actually did. But overall, I wasn't bored or distracted, and it was fairly thought provoking.

3 June 1999,A beautifully made piece of cinema.,"I had quite low expectations before going in to see this movie, having heard so much bad press about it around the time of its release. How wrong I was, and what a great surprise it turned out to be. If, like me, you go in without any strong peconceptions of what it might/should be about then I think you'll love it. Claire Forlani is stunning, as is the chemistry between her and Brad Pitt. Hopkins gives what is surely one of his career-best performances and the film wanders along its superbly constructed narrative with class and wit. It is not, at 3 hours, overly long, any less and its conclusion would have been premature. Overall 'Meet Joe Black' is an extremely watchable piece of film-making without pretensions to be anything else other than an enjoyable story of love and yes, you guessed it, Death. Also, Look out for one of the most startling stunt scenes to hit the screens in recent times! Blink and you'll miss it.

11 December 1998,A Must See!,"This movie was well produced and despite the 3 hour length was enjoyable and worth the $$$. I would recommend this flick to anyone who enjoys the acting talents of Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt; their work in Legends of The Fall was exceptional and this film only serves to further enhance their credibility as fine actors. Meet Joe Black in a romantic movie which offers a lesson on love, and dares to question the after life.

13 October 2011,Not for Folks with ADD!,"I love this movie, but if you can't stand waiting for characters to thoughtfully and deliberately deliver dialog throughout a 3 hour film, you may want to skip this one.

Even aside from the concept of the movie, I was thoroughly captivated by the dialog and its pace. Perhaps it spoke to me of simpler times gone by and helped me reminisce of when people actually cared about what came out of their mouths and used actual conversation as the primary source of entertainment instead of television and the Internet.

Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it when it first came out almost 13 years ago, and again just last night. Loved it just as much.

11 November 1998,"Story was alright, enough slow moments to stand out.","After watching a preview of this movie, I found myself split on both liking and disliking it. At times, it seemed that the movie was trying to go for cinematography. There were moments of silence (w/o any background music) to try to engulf the audience, which can be fine, however I felt that it lasts much too long. ""Meet Joe Black"" could have been trimmed to a 2.5 hr movie instead of a 3 hr one. To its credit however, whenever things got slow (and you wanted to hit the Fast Forward button) a humorous moment followed as if to get the audience back into the movie. There were quite a few lines that were memorable and worth quoting with as well as humorous moments. But there were enough slow moments in the film that you walk away with at the end. The three hours went by relatively quickly enough, but again certain scenes could have been shortened and still retained the feel and intent of the scene itself.

31 May 1999,"Mixed, but quite seductive, bag","Meet Joe Black is in many ways a wonderful movie. It is grandly, shamelessly romantic in a way few movies these days dare to be, and quite successful on that level. Brad Pitt is certainly one of our best contemporary leading romantic men, and the lovely Claire Forlani is utterly compelling, both as love interest, and as daughter to the film's real star, the incomparable Anthony Hopkins.

In an age where we've come to expect virtuosic acting to club us over the head, a al Nicholson, DeNiro, Pacino, and Streep, Hopkins is a subtle master without peer. His greatest praise was for Silence of the Lambs, but his greatest role was in Remains of the Day, in which he expressed an astonishing depth of pain, solitude, and character with very few words or even over gestures and expressions. In Meet Joe Black, Hopkins gives us another magnificently etched, subtly towering performance. The theme is old and timeless: a man coming to terms with his life and imminent death. Hopkins makes it more than compelling.

In tandem, both he and Forlani, and he and Marcia Gay Harden (as his less-favored daughter) create remarkably believable and beautiful father-daughter relationships. I think it is in these areas that the film is most successful (I speak as the father of two daughters myself).

The film is a bit too long, and at times the writing betrays itself with a lack of subtlety. Also, while Pitt is marvelous in the Lead Romantic Male part of his role, he is not a particularly menacing Death. At times, particularly in scenes next to the Towering Hopkins, he seems positively puny.

But let yourself get swept away by this film, forgive it's couple of flaws, and you'll be enormously entertained.",7
3 February 1999,A great movie that you shouldn't miss!,"This movie was worth the six dollars. I went in expecting a semi-boring story line and characters that would get dull, but I got the opposite of that. I loved the story line and how well the characters acted. Brad Pitt was exceptional. He played the part beautifully and had great supporting actors. Anthony Hopkins deserves an Oscar for his all but perfect performance. He is a great actor and I thought that this movie just proved it even more. It had a great romance story plus you got a chance to laugh and cry. The beginning did seem kind of long but after they got into the story the movie went by much faster. If you feel like a good laugh, cry, and romantic story I recommend this movie.

17 August 2020,Creepy,"The actress who played Susan in my opinion is a less talented version of Jennifer Garner. She just didn't fit the role, and her acting was not convincing at all. And let's not talk about the dad kissing his two daughters in their Mouth. Is that normal? Am I the only one who finds it VERY creepy? I mean I understand that they want to display the idea of the dad being close to his daughters, but does that mean he should be kissing them in the mouth? This is beyond creepy.

7 February 1999,Great movie if you like Pitt.,"Although the movie was pretty long, it still held my interest. Anyone who ever thought about death, or destiny, or whatever, needs to see it and get lost in it. See it for yourself, the acting is great on everybody's part. Pitt is superb as usual, and of course it should be against the law to look that good.

6 February 2005,A fantasy about the reality of relationships and passion for life.,"Meet Joe Black is a fantasy that reflects the reality and the passion of relationships. This movie took the time to clearly define each relationship. I felt each character's ego was explored through great acting ability. I enjoyed every aspect of Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Bill Parrish and found it refreshing to watch a movie that celebrated a highly successful man whose character could not be compromised. A man who maintained love for his family, life work, and life itself with passion and dignity. I felt Brad Pitt's interpretation of death was delightful from the humorous to the darker sides. I enjoyed seeing death evolve through life's experiences. This movie made me laugh and cry and every time I watch it, I appreciate it more.

26 December 1998,Wonderful!!!!!,"Like others, I went to see ""Meet Joe Black,"" not knowing what I might expect, and found I loved every minute of it. Though almost three hours in length, I did NOT want it end.

This movie touched the depths of my very soul, and filled it with it's brilliant acting, direction, sound, color, imagery, etc. Certainly the most satisfying movie ever seen by these eyes.

It is my opinion that this movie should garner every Oscar award applicable. Best Actor, Supporting Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Music, ad infinitum.

Has anyone ever seen a more sensual, entrancing, bewitching movie? I certainly haven't.

Were I a published film critic critic, I would give 99.9 percent of the critics of ""Meet Joe Black"" ZERO stars for their criticism. What is it with most critics? I think they just wait for something to appear with Brad Pitt starring or Oliver Stone directing, and they get out their knives. What is their problem? Mayhaps we should start putting ""Critics"" in the same category with ""Lawyers"" ---- 10,000 lawyers at the bottom of the sea, etc.

Brad Pitt is the most underestimated actor of our time. Brad Pitt does more by doing less than any actor that comes to mind, with the possible exception of James Dean. He is a fine, true minamalist. Brad Pitt not only acts, but he reacts. Maybe we should have a new category for Mr. Pitt. Best Actor/Reactor.

Lest I fail to say it, this was the best assemblage of Actor/Actresses in the history of motion pictures. Every participant in this film deserves an Oscar.

Bravo, Bravi, and Bravum.",10
28 December 1998,Slow does not mean boring..............,"This was a thought provoking film. While the professional critics labeled it ""slow,"" I would disagree with the implication that it is boring. I was fascinated by the skill of Anthony Hopkins and the evolving depth of Brad Pitt. I hardly realized the film was lengthy until it was over and I looked at my watch.

6 June 2004,PLEASE!,"Though this film was well acted, I have a hard time relating with a poor little rich girl who loses Daddy (worth more than most people can fathom) and ending up with Brad Pitt, poor thing. She was calloused and wouldn't let any men close to her (good choice with Brad, I would have done the same). I don't know how I would have survived my life with such hardships. Come on people. Fantasies are welcome, but either be total fantasy (Ever After), or be something most people can relate to. I suppose if I was raised in Hollywood, or as the daughter of the CEO of a Fortune 500 Company,

I would find this movie charming; as a normal person I find it laughable and pathetic. Yeah!!! she found happiness amidst the horror and hardship of wealth, does this mean there's hope for the rest of us?

26 October 2022,One of my favorite all time stories,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",9
14 December 2002,Architectural Digest: The Movie,"This interminably long film should be shown only on the Style Network.

1 August 1999,"Most enjoyable film, fantastic acting","Never having seen the original I will now have to rent it. I found the film most enjoyable. Profanity was kept to a minimum as was the one love scene. Violence consisted of an automobile accident. The only problem I found was the whisper scenes it was difficult to understand some of the dialogue needed to comprehend the plot. The acting was wonderful and the sets marvelous. I would recommend it to anyone with taste. As it is 3 hours long you might want to rent the video that way you can do a snack run without missing something. Get it and enjoy your evening.

23 February 2005,To Clear things up,"People have wondered why the original character came back at the end. In my opinion, he was allowed to come back because Joe Black was in love with Susan, and because he wanted to see her happy. He would do anything to have her be happy, because he realized what love means, to be able to let someone go to be happy. Remember, he is death and could choose who he wants to take and when. So, he allowed the original character to come back to make sure that Susan would always be happy. And Joe Black probably figured that Susan originally fell in love with the first character. And also, I do think the original character would have some knowledge of what happened when he was ""dead.""

10 April 1999,"Long, but worth it.","This was a wonderful, life-affirming movie that was too long for its own good! Although the story was well told, I believe that too many frivolous scenes were put in, and unfortunately it causes the movie to drag in the middle. Ms. Forlani tends to look like she is on the verge of crying throughout the entire movie, even during the happy parts, but she performs very well and interacts flawlessly with Anthony Hopkins, who plays her father. If you have a few hours and aren't the least bit sleepy, catch this movie on video... the ending is worth the wait.

27 November 1999,"One of the top 5 movies ever, Excellent Cast and Writer","A movie that will touch your heart. For those of you that can think about life and love coming back to you, or staying with you. This is the movie for you. To quote the movie ""If you can wake up and say that I don't want anything else"" is one of the greatest lines that I have ever heard. This movie left me in awe. If you could give bonus points on a scale, this would get as many as possible. If you haven't seen it go see and if you have, I hope that you know what I'm talking about. WOW. For all the people that thought this movie was boring, maybe you should check inside your soul. Should have been nominated for an Oscar, Hopkins and Forlani for sure. Just because it was three hours doesn't mean a thing, this movie should start to compel you in the first half an hour. If the movie feels three hours to you then you probably didn't enjoy it. Think of Titanic. This movie definitely a must see!! Enjoy!!!

6 February 2005,One of the favorites Romantic movies.,"Firstable, Brad Pitt, My favorite actor, played by his own impressive attitude like always. (Mostly appearing in Ocean 11 and 12) So, Joe came in purpose of disturbing William Parish (Anthony Hopkins), the father of one of the sexiest and most beautiful woman (Claire Forlani, Susan Parish), who fell in love with Joe. William, of course, didn't accept that at the start, but after a while he realized that he can't really choose a man for his own grown daughter. At the end, he accepted that by his own will after he got to know Joe better.

I really liked this movie because of the great actors, I have to say, and because of a very nice story. For those who have not watched this movie yet, I really suggest you to watch it as soon as possible. I also suggest to read Brad Pitt's and Claire Forlani's biography.

Thanks for reading my comment ;).

12 July 1999,surprise surprise I LOVED it!,"Our library just got this flick and not being a particular Brad Pitt fan, I didn't think I'd really sit down and watch at 3 hours long.But since it was already a day late, it's 10pm and I'm still awake I said what the hey,you love Anthony Hopkins, just watch the first half. Right! Once I started there was no going back. My favorite thing about this flick is it wasn't what I thought it was going to be.I had some notion that Brad was death and falls in love with Anthonys daughter,blah blah blah. Just an interesting film that made me grateful for what and whom I have in my life and those are always worthwhile. I think the best surprise for me was the daughters reaction when Brad comes back over the bridge. Just a neat flick. Some good lines for Brad and Anthony and while 3 hours may be long, they maintained the pacing throughout so nothing seems rushed or suddenly put together and it hits you with a wallop. I will be watching again!

27 August 1999,Unexpected,"I went to this movie as a huge Brad Pitt-fan and I expected a lot, after seeing the trailer. However, it didn't meet up to my expectations. Although the story and the scenery were beautiful, it was too long. So long that at one point I got bored. This has never happened to me before with a movie with Brad in it. Saying this means that I feel that Brad shouldn't have done this movie. To me, in this movie he is only a pretty, naive boy who is playing way beyond his level. My appreciation for Brad hasn't become less, but I was a little disappointed in him. He can do better, way better. I will probably rent the video, just to make sure I really didn't like it. I hope Brad will star in movies with a little more body.

1 October 1999,Best movie of the year.,"Funny, touching, sad, and ultimately richly rewarding. The critics really missed the boat on this one. In fact, it has made me leery of ever trusting too much in their opinions again. To my knowledge, the only mainstream critics to embrace it were Roger Ebert and the late Gene Siskel.

21 March 2014,A life affirming movie that will leave you awestruck,"At the beginning of the movie, you will feel somewhat vulnerable for disappointment since you would think that this is your average romance movie. But the moment Brad Pitt struts into the film, you'll be fascinated by his charmingly witty attitude, which is enough for you to realize that this movie is unique.

I will not be providing a synopsis since I believe that each detail should be abruptly indulged in this particular movie especially to that it is directed by the underrated, yet brilliant, Martin Brest.

The most astounding part of this movie has to be the acting. Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins are breathtaking for they were at the highlight of their acting career. Every scene is exhaustive yet has a hint vagueness to keep the audience in a mood of suspense. The delivery from the whole cast leaves you in ecstasy and hungry for more.

Alas, I voted a notch shorter than brimming due to the ending that simply fell short from that lofty built up the movie offers, yet uplifting enough for you to reach there. For those who look for profound films and goosebumps, lots of them, this movie is what you're seeking for.",9

I love my friend, but I find his taste in movies terrible. Only Hopkins tried, he is an excellent actor. It was obvious that the girl got this part with other ways than talent, so fake. It started in a good way and I thought that it could be interesting but no. I do not recommend it at all.

24 July 2005,A slow psychological tidal wave of art,"This movie affected me on a very deep level. I agree with one of the other comments that in order to appreciate its message, you need to watch it several times with long breaks in between. For me, it was about the fluidity, fragility and powerlessness of life against the concept of death. It asks the unanswerable : who or what is directing our individual fate. It also implicitly discusses the superficial qualities of life : the different masks we all like to wear to impress. Death seems to come, only to wear a mask and study other masks, forcing the characters to see behind each other. In the end, death is forced to take off his own mask and suffer the experience of loss. It becomes more moving the more times you watch it. It is a slow-moving, psychological tidal wave of quality art. However, for those who don't wish to have their thoughts provoked about the mystery of life and death, it may be tiresome and a bit boring.

Bad acting all around, even from Hopkins, who in my book is a wonderful actor. What in God's name is he doing in this movie? Although he is not one of the best actors, Brad Pitt has been known to give some good performances (12 Monkeys, Fight Club), but his portrait of Death is an all time low.

6 August 2005,Beautifully human movie...,"Meet Joe Black was a fabulous movie! What excellent casting, and the acting shone. What was best, however, was the humanity of the story. It would have been easy to play these characters as clichés, cynics, or totally clueless. That didn't happen here. The characters are flawed, earnest, confused, and very true. Whether rolling in the depths of selfishness or attempting to find a life path for themselves, they all prove very real and fascinating, particularly as you have the opportunity to see humanity through Joe's eyes. The Joe character was another surprise. Who would have thought an immortal could be so human? Curious, quick, and self-involved to a fault. Wonderful! The fabulous acting and excellent story made the movie very easy to watch all the way through, something I have trouble doing... Worth a watch, definitely!

14 December 2002,Good and Bad,"One thing that bothered me greatly was that this man, who professed that he wanted this ""passion"" for his beautiful, younger daughter, a passion that he had for her, and his deceased wife, he did NOT have for his older, dutiful and much less attractive daughter. It's understood that his eyes did not light up for the more homely one when she walked in the room, as they do for the beautiful one. The fact that Death is personified in the form of one of the world's most beautiful men (Pitt) also makes the idea of this ""passionate, honest love"" seem to be tied much too much to physical beauty. And, the fact that the ""man"" she finally falls for is not a man at all makes the picture equally uninspiring. And the level at which this love seems held, seems simply unrealistic. As she walks off with the real Joe Black at the end, what is she going to do when he first shows signs of being a normal man? So, how are we mere mortals to feel about ourselves after seeing this movie?

15 August 2005,Absolutely awe-inspiring.,"This flick has one of the best casts I have seen for this type of drama. They act exquisitely well together, and it shows in the emotion brought forth in each and every scene. I love the way the characters pause between lines, as if they are truly living in the moment.

Anthony Hopkins uses his traditional crescendo and decrescendo in the conversations, and it makes every scene he is in wonderful to watch. Claire Forlani is absolutely breathtaking, as usual. She displays her emotions in this movie with such elegance. She appears to be a very strong woman, using her intellect even in the characters she plays. Her relationship with her father, Anthony Hopkins, is something every little girl dreams of. The couple played by Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Tambor display what appears like true affection for each other. They complement each other perfectly. If you love to hate someone in films, then ""Drew,"" played by Jake Weber is your man in this one. He is despicable.

In all, I have seen this movie a total of 20 times, or more. I lost count. However, I never grow tired of watching it. It is spellbinding and although I am NOT an emotional person by any means, I cry during this movie every time I watch it. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to see a truly great movie with a great performance from all actors involved.",10
24 December 2004,important note,"I loved this movie. Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt did a great job. HOWEVER if you see it or have a chance to rent it or buy it, make sure you only consider the long version. The short version deletes too many important story lines particularly as relate to what happens to Drew, Joe's main foe in the movie. seeing the short version cheats you of so much! Jeffrey Tambor plays a great character and Marcia gay harden is also an enjoyable character. Claire Forlani is super and very sexy. You start out not liking Joe, but he chooses to learn about life from Anthony Hopkins character. Joe flits back and forth between bad and good and in the end shows that he can make a decent choice although he is the grim reaper.

15 December 2002,Slooow Death,"I was unlucky to catch this movie on free tv(If I had rented it, I could fast forward). Since there was nothing on I let myself be trapped into waiting for the ending, now I know what it would feel like if an anaconda wrapped itself around me and slowly strangled me to death. The name - Martin Brest(the director) is etched in my brain. If you see this guy's name and it is a 4 hour movie, drop the ticket and run for your life. The movie, if you haven't gotten my drift, is sloooooow!. For those who are praising this movie, rolling your eyes and looking at everything else except the person in front of you is not acting! Waiting an hour before you reply is not acting!

1 June 2021,Joe in the coffee shop.,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",10
16 October 2005,i love it,"I think that Meet Joe Black, was casted excellently. The coffee shop scene makes my heart flutter. I love Bill (played by Anthony Hopkins) he is such a distinguished man. His love for his daughters runs deep and he takes known info about his upcoming journey with great stride. Joe (Brad Pitt) he is just so great, he's child like inquisitiveness is so adorable. He may be Death, though it may be dark, he learns to show compassion and he learns to be human. The two seem to become quick friendly. The whole movie is just beautiful, the music, the scenes, the homes, the party, the clothing. It is all so wonderful. Did I mention the Music. ****

28 October 2005,Death Takes a Holiday,"I know it's not a polite topic to discuss in public. However it's a topic that can't be overlooked and best discussed rather than spending so much in therapy. From the moment of life there's death. It awaits all things in life whether or not at the moment we believe it. So, how do we deal with it? Sometimes in self denial, sometimes in self abuse, sooner or later we all have to face it. This fallacy of positive thinking, always believing somehow we too can escape that grasp of death.

Now if you read this far, in that quest for knowledge. A seeking mind for the wisdom of truth. You will find in this journey it's all in our perspective, a matter of faith, belief in our own attitude. Ask any medical provider who strives to prevent it, ask any soldier who has to face it, clear down to the undertaker who must daily prepare it. Then talk to those that almost bought it! That Grim Reaper is there always when we least expect it. So, we tend to deal with it in movies, plays, poetry and song. An art form mirroring life as if it was just mere amusing entertainment.

We can put a spin on it in cd's like in the songs of Dido's ""No Angel"". Where we can feel the chords of melancholy of love long lost. We can find beauty in it in movies like ""American Beauty"", a journey of one man's mid life crisis and unfortunate life ending. Or, on the other hand, we can find that death can indeed take a holiday in a movie like ""Meet Joe Black"".

Most of these artistic expressions are epitomes of character assassination. However, in ""Meet Joe Black"" the twist is now, it becomes a matter of choice. Answering your own questions, dispelling your own doubts, overcoming fear and desire and our most basic emotions. Imagine a dialogue with Death, talking heart to heart with the Grim Reaper and at the same time teaching it all about life. This is a classic movie, excellent script of dialogue, love, compassion, innocence, honor and legacy with a splash of spin and clever twist. Centered around the simplest things in life, like peanut butter! The themes of inescapable reality, like death and taxes, feelings like hard to let go and cherishing those snapshots that in the end you take with you. It's great fodder to ponder, do we really converse with death in those final days and... would you?

So if you feel that you can cry every fifteen minutes in passion and compassion. If you feel you can watch a contemptuous dance with death for over three hours. If you feel it's a topic that merits just cause and deep contemplation to just bury the dead. Or if your just looking for good tear jerk emotions. Listen to ""No Angel"", take a deep look at ""American Beauty"". Turn up the volume of your DVD player to catch the whispers and ponder. Then ""Meet Joe Black""!",10

27 March 2006,Meet Brad Pitt,"I find it very difficult to express any kind words about this movie. When I saw that this movie has a 6.6 IMDb rating, it just reassured my opinion that unfortunately the public cannot be trusted when it comes to rating movies. This movie is really bad. Really, really bad! The only pleasure I have derived from this movie and ultimately viewing it's IMDb home is seeing the awards it has been nominated for and has received. I won't spoil the fun, just look for yourself. It would appear that the general selling point for this movie is the presence of the two stars, Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins. Both are outstanding actors who have been placed in roles where they are essentially not required to act. Brad Pitt basically stands around the whole movie with that cute Brad Pitt look on his face. Anthony Hopkins, bless his heart, seems to be saying ""What am I doing here? How could I have taken this role?"" Forget this bomb and go rent The Elephant Man or Fight Club.

19 February 2003,This great movie was so fluid in it's movement......,"This was a great movie! I never cared for Brad Pitt, but know now that I do. He is a great actor, excels greatly at his career.

I love the characters in this movie. I love the scenery. I think I have to say that for some strange reasons, this movie stirred within me passions of love. Feelings I have felt, but this movie sorta gives me the visual image to truly ""see"" those feelings that I was experiencing. People said it was a long movie, but the first time I seen was Sunday Feb 16th, 2003 on the SciFi channel with commercials no less. It wasn't long, it was a great movie. And if someone out there hasn't seen it, I suggest you do. You will appreciate Brad Pitt, Miss Forliano, and Mr. Hopkins excel....... Thank you.

14 December 2008,An Interesting Movie for Those With Open Minds,"This movie, I would say, would meet the criteria to be considered a ""Chick Flick."" Now having said that, I'll let you know what I thought about it.

The movie was quite interesting, yes, I was bored at first, the movie started with all the predictable signs of the standard ""Chick Flick."" However, I kept my mind open, and as the story unfolded I found myself leaning more forward as the movie went on. It has an interesting mix of emotions, and tries to keep the feelings of the people real. Which I must say, they did a lot better job in this movie than I have seen in many other ""Chick Flicks."" As the movie went on, I found myself laughing at a few points, smiling at others, and yes, even rolling my eyes. I find Brad Pitt's role in this movie rather comical, and to avoid any spoiler I'll leave his role at that. Anthony Hopkin's role rather profound me, I've seen him in other movies before, but his role was, I'd say, perfectly performed. I'm a rather decent fan of his older works, nowadays, seeing how I was too young back then to appreciate most of the movies.

Which brings me to my next point, this is not a movie for those who are young, and when I use that word, I am politely saying ""the kids."" This movie is too deep for children, I was a rather cultured child, and this movie would of been lost on me, had I watched it back then. This is move of a movie geared towards those who are likely to know the variety of experiences, emotions, and choice words being thrown about.

I gave this movie 8/10 because, yes, it is a rather good movie, yes the actors are good, yes it has a lot of emotion, etc. etc. etc. This movie has a lot of good things about it. What first peeked my interest was a few choice lines (that are in the Quotes section). After that I watched the movie more closely. This movie, I feel, stands out from average ""Chick Flicks"" having sat through quite a few myself, but I watch them with open minds so I can't ever say that once I was forced. However, having said that, I refused to give it a 10/10 because, it was rather predictable at a good amount of points, I even called somethings that probably would of surprised others. I just feel, it follows the guide lines of a general ""Chick Flick"" with some great acting and changes along the way, so I can't bring myself for a 10/10.

My advice to others; keep an open mind when watching this, you can't take this movie literally, Brad Pitt's role in the movie is unique, and you should not ruin the movie with your own personal beliefs. It's a movie, not real life, just keep that in mind. Also, advice to the 'guys' or anyone trying to get a guy to see this, keep in mind, ""Chick Flicks"" almost always have funny stuff in the movie for the guys. This one is no exception.",8
22 January 2005,Love it but is this an original screenplay????,"After all these years we have finally watched this movie. Found it quite well made and not at all too long.

Brad Pitt seemed to be missing that good old ""gleem in his eyes"" in some scenes but the other characters played sincerely. Hopkins in particular was wonderful during the long last scene waiting for Joe to take him away.

One strange thing was the movie left us with the impression that we have seen this story before - some old French or American movie from the 1940-50s maybe... anyone got any ideas? Nothing mentioned about this on the DVD nor here on IMDb though.

P.S. IMDb why not add a link to ""this film based on ...""? There are some many remakes these days and tracking them done is not always easy - especially when the remakes changes the title and change all the character's names!",7
4 July 2021,Great Flick,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",8
23 May 2005,Bad acting by Brad Pitt,"The wonderful talent of Anthony Hopkins simply isn't enough to offset the terrible acting by Brad Pitt in this boring, overbearing nonsense of a film.

A great movie means more than throwing together a bunch of beautiful actors and gorgeous scenery. It requires good casting, good performances from all the leading actors, good writing -- all of which this film lacks greatly.

Honestly, I'm not an actor in the least, but I could easily have played Brad Pitt's character far better than he does, with the whole dear in the headlights spacey thing he does throughout the movie. It's not convincing, and it's not charming. It ruins the film. If you don't think so, it's because you can't see beyond his good looks, which is apparently what the director was hoping for.

14 November 1998,When a picture's this good three hours fly by.,"This is one of the finest films I have ever seen. The three hours flew by. What impressed me most was Brad Pitt's different characterizations of the young man we see in the drug store, a pleasant, exuberant young man, and Joe Black. As the latter, he portrayed a naively caring person. I never saw Death Takes A Holiday, but it would be difficult for me to conceive how it could have been as heart-warming a picture as Meet Joe Black.

5 November 1998,"Smart, sensible, decent, serious but not lecturing; Europe will love it too.","Dealing with such heavy matters (death and missions of life) in Hollywood could have made the movie slip into a terrible or despisable experience. It never does here. Martin Brest did an amazing job in perfectly balancing all the elements to smartly entertain with taste while keeping the spiritual themes alive to feed our brains. Cliches and easy shortcuts are smartly avoided. Lot of finesse. Each actor is really brilliant and created true characters in such a way that you never think of their previous roles. They appear true to the heart. For those comparing it with the recent ""City of Angel"", this one goes many steps deeper. Congratulations and many thanks.

15 November 1998,Sensational movie all around.,"I am amazed at the amount of negative criticism this movie has received. By far, one of the best pictures I have seen this year, and I would go as far as to place it in my top 10 of all time. Comprised entirely all the elements I find essential to a great movie, I would be hard pressed to find anything bad to say about it. Brad Pitt serves up one of his finest performances in his role as Death. Now some critics say he came across as wooden and unemotional, and as rumor has it Brad has said this himself, but I would argue to the point that he is after all, Death. How lively do you want him? And judging from the sighs from the girls around me whenever Brad was on screen, Death never looked so good. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as usual. Playing the part of Bill Parrish, a wealthy communications mogul who is about to meet his maker, his performance is first rate. I have no trouble believing he is the character he portrays as is always the case. I only need to remember back when I thought he WAS Hannibel Lector to remind me of how gifted and versatile he is. Claire Forlani gives her best performance to date as the youngest of two daughters of Bill Parrish. She also plays love interest for Death in his time on earth, and again she is fits the bill perfectly. The supporting cast as a whole was on par with the stars of this film. The minor sub plots in this movie in which they are involved are just as good as movie in whole. Lastly, the soundtrack is genius, and I have come to expect nothing less from Thomas Newman. In closing Brad Pitt is NOT just a pretty face, so give him his due. Anthony Hopkins turns in another top rate perfomance. Claire Forlani is as talented an actress is she is beautiful and this movie can not be missed.

PS-I cried at this movie and if you didn't you're as heartless as the critics who hated it.

PSS-Legends Of The Fall is also in my top 10, so I can only hope that Brad and Anthony do another movie, because they are great together.",10
27 November 1998,It gets under your skin...,"Starting to watch what appears to be one of the many movies with a simple screenplay and very long duration you get to actually feel like something inside you ""connects"" with what is going on on the screen and begins sending shivers down the spine and tears down the eyes. We all have the same fears, but to see that you've got to watch this movie.

21 January 1999,"A True love legend in Film, worthy of award nominations.","Director Martin Brest has helped himself to an exquisite sense of film making. He has not only managed to portray a story full of glittering, genuine and young romance but he has also been able to include a philosophical questioning within the plot.

The question about death being a being just like humans, and if so, how would it be different from us in a sense of perceptions. Brad Pitt as death may not be what some of us will imagine it to be like but it sure is magical view from the director, that because it is unique turns out to be quite successful. Images that transmit a great spiritual meaning as well as a completely heart stopping quality in photography and music entertain the audience in what may originally seem a long period of time, but it is compensed with orchestration by Thomas Newman.

The actors' effort is surely exemplified on screen. Anthony Hopkins delivers a magnificent performance in a character that faces a difficult question in his own life: What happens when your death is also your own daughter's? Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani show great on screen chemistry and it seem that they are growing as actors, since it is evident that they have gone deeply not only into their character's actions but their emotions as well.

Overall an enthusiastic film, that in a dramatic and yet hilarious way teaches you about life, death and all kinds of love.",8
14 March 1999,A very different sort of movie,"I recently saw the movie ""Meet Joe Black"" and have read the comments on this site. Strangely enough they seem to be favourable to the ""big name"" stars but negative towards the script and the director. I don't think this is very fair at all. This is a very different type of movie that seems to have been misunderstood due to its subtle nature.

Unlike most artificial-adrenaline-action-packed blockbuster movies, this movie seems almost real. The dialogue and the speed of the plot developments seemed realistic instead of 'picture-perfect'. At times it almost seemed more like theatre than a movie. In fact, I think the director has managed to make an extraordinarily unbelievable idea, seem almost plausible. It may not be the ultimately ideal implementation of these ideas and techniques - but I think this movie deserves some credit for breaking new ground. It was very different and very interesting.

14 November 1998,Leave your cynicism in the theatre lobby,"The mere sight of Brad Pitt caused a movie audience full of women to gasp aloud. That doesn't make ""Meet Joe Black"" a bad movie, but it sure makes it harder to concentrate on the man's acting ability. The fact is however, that this film directed by Martin Brest (Scent of a Woman, Midnight Run) is full of passion, romance, drama, and great bursts of humour.

In ""Meet Joe Black"" William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) begins to suspect his mortality during an episode of crushing chest pains. Death comes for Parrish having manifested itself in the form of a mysterious and engaging young man, Joe Black (Pitt). Black decides to put off the inevitable journey for a few days so he can learn more about life from the human perspective. He chooses to experience life with the family of this extremely wealthy, highly successful businessman who is just days away from his 65th birthday. A gala birthday party fit for a king is being prepared by one of Parrish's daughters, Allison (Marcia Gay Harden). Her role as the fussing, detail driven party organizer is a moving one as she comes to understand that despite her overwhelming love for her father, she will never be his favourite. The role of favourite daughter is left to Susan (Clair Forlani) and Joe Black learns his most important life lessons as he and Susan fall in love.

The story unfolds naturally at a leisurely pace using up every moment of the 3-hour length without ever losing the audience. Anthony Hopkins, plays the role of powerful patriarch and business mogul with a strong dignified presence and says more with a raised eyebrow and half smile than any dialogue could impart.

It is interesting to watch Pitt as death, ageless by any standard, wise beyond comprehension stumble confused in his new human form. Pitt plays with this role and is not afraid to show an insecure almost goofy persona as Joe Black begins to experience life as a man. In the course of his activities with Parrish's life, Joe learns the human pain of ""letting go"" experiencing the greatest lessons as his love for Susan grows. Joe Black's slow awakening to love and the physical realities of expressed love are a pleasure to watch.

The theme is clear: Life can be endured if there is love, and love can only be sustained on a foundation of truth. And it's the truth that ultimately undoes Joe Black, the man.

Highly recommended. **** 4 STAR RATING ON A 5 STAR SCALE",8

4 December 2015,Eye Opener,"This film is not for everyone yet it is one I believe should be given a chance by anyone who is living. It deals with heavy life issues, the ones that are inevitable for all of us. Yes, it does contain a romantic element but the story is not overtaken by this at all. If one decides to give this movie a try and watch it through, many revelations are to be gained. Obviously interpretation is different from person to person so there will be some who dislike the themes presented while some will love it. It is important to note that this film is not easy to watch for a few reasons. One reason is that it deals with themes that are sad and out of our control. Yet in spite of the gloom there is light; clarity. ""You cannot have the dark without the light.""

14 November 1998,An Emotional Roller Coaster,"While my emotions took a tremendous roller coaster ride it is a ride I want to take again. This movie pulled emotions from me I had buried for some time. I must admit I do love Brad Pitt but he was just the frosting on the cake. This is a movie that would be wonderful even without him! WOW! Did I just say that? I MUST have really liked it! Anthony Hopkins was brilliant as usual. The supporting cast was wonderful and VERY believable.If the movie has a downside, I would have cast the female lead differently ...but that is just me. Also, I believe I detected a hint of Irish accent in Brad ....but here again it may be just wishful thinking. If ye get a chance, please go see this one ...... I doubt that ye will regret it!

15 September 1998,"Should appeal to all ages, but PG-13 rated","I was fortunate enough to see a preview of this movie.

Although it is long, the time seemed to fly by. Anthony Hopkins' performance is magnificent. Brad Pitt was very convincing to me in his dual role, and, to me becomes more gorgeous as he ages. I had seen Claire Forlani in another role, and became a fan after seeing this movie. Marcia Gay Hardin gives a wonderful portrayal as Claire's sister. Jake Weber plays the bad guy so well that I will probably glare at him should I ever see him. Jeff Tambor, whom I have loved on the Larry Sanders Show, showed a new (to me) and tender side in this movie.

Meet Joe Black gives an insightful picture of our society and the problems we all face of aging and human relationships. I recommend it heartily.

13 November 1998,"Gently paced, emotional comedy drama","""Meet Joe Black"" is well written, gently paced, very funny and very touching with tremendous performances from Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani and Brad Pitt.

Yes, I said Brad Pitt gave a tremendous performance as Death-Joe Black/Young-Man-in-Coffee-Shop. He plays the part of Death using Brad Pitt's classic body as if he has never been in a human body before. As an actor playing this role, Brad Pitt chose to walk stiffly with virtually no mannerisms as if he were a spirit inhabiting an unknown organism. I enjoyed watching him act out the consequences of this decision. He is also very funny throughout the movie acting in ways unlike any of the other characters. He especially stands out from the crowd in the boardroom scenes. He is amazing in scenes with a hospital patient who has recognized him for what he is.

Anthony Hopkins is marvelous as William Parish, head of Parrish Communications. Parrish finds out a few days before his 65th birthday that Death will take him as soon as Death is done experiencing life on earth. He knows the penalty for arguing the Death-Joe Black is instant death, and yet he stays true to himself to the end. This is seemingly casual performance by Hopkins is very strong. His heart attack sequence early in the movie is gut wrenching. He is tender with his daughters, decisive with his board of directors and mystified by his relationship with Death.

Claire Forlani is a find as Parrish's favorite daughter. There is a cool, reluctant and yet trusting chemistry between her character, Susan, and Joe Black. Their body language is enhanced by close camerawork in tender scenes, slow moving, emotion-filled scenes.

The movie is long. I looked forward to spending 174 minutes with Brad Pitt. But I hated his last movie with Anthony Hopkins (""Legends of the Fall"") so was instantly wary when I heard about the running length. Watching the film, I loved the care the directory takes with each scene, each line of dialogue, each nuanced use of the word ""yes"". The script is excellent. The ending was very satisfying. The film requires thought from the moviegoer. Some folks may not get the nuances, and may miss one of Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins best movies. I hereby nominate Claire Forlani for best supporting actress.",10
14 November 1998,Very enjoyable...funny and poignant,"My daughter and I laughed and cried as did most of the theater audience. Even though Brad Pitt is being panned in the reviews, he was fun to watch. We really enjoyed this movie as it was extremely clever & humorous. Anthony Hopkins was wonderful. The ending was just a bit too ""smaltzy"" for me, but very Hollywood!

14 November 1998,A romantic movie that touches the soul.,"Meet Joe Black is a movie that touches the romantic soul in everyone. From the very beginning through the bittersweet ending we are transported along with Susan Parrish(Clair Forlani) as she meets and falls in love with the surprisingly charming Joe Black(Brad Pitt). Clair Forlani pulls this character off with an unbelievable amount of charm and beauty, while Brad Pitt leaves us wondering what will happen next. Not to leave out Anthony Hopkins(William Parrish), his character is the glue that grounds this movie into every day reality and possibility. Although the movie is close to 3 hours, the incredible chemistry between the actors will have you paying attention to the romance instead of looking at your watch. Highly recommended as it is one of the very best movies I have ever seen. Not to ruin it, but the ending is as well done as I imagine it could be. Enjoy!

I also enjoyed Claire Forlani's performance. Joe Black was not an interesting character, cute but not interesting enough to watch fot three hours. This was not Brad's fault, but the script's.

15 November 1998,Best Movie Ever,"When I first say the preview for Meet Joe Black, I knew I had to see it! So, I grabbed my first chance at going to it and I got it! I wasn't sure how long it would be, but I knew it would be great! And not just great, it was the BEST movie I have ever seen. If you haven't seen Meet Joe Black, I urge you to get in your car and drive to the theater and wait for it to start! It was 3 hours long but there wasn't a minute dull. It's suspenseful, and you can feel the love between the characters. Needless to say there was exellent acting involved . I've always loved Brad Pitt, but as Joe Black, I wasn't turned on by his looks, I was turned on by the character, the love and gentleness that was there.

8 September 2014,This movie is a great one to own,"We all want the chance to tie up loose ends before we die, yet really, would that make it better? I remember watching this movie as a little kid on VHS and this one was a double one. I never notice the length of this movie when I watch it, but I have heard from a few people that is something they don't like. When this movie comes on I am drawn to watch it. You can't help but get caught up in the dialogue and music. This may be the best score on a movie I have ever heard. Such a wonderful movie to celebrate life, love, and friendship. Anthony Hopkins is the perfect actor for his character and Brad Pitt nails it in his prime with his 90's blonde hair.

16 November 1998,This movie has changed my attitude about life for the better!!!,"Meet Joe Black is absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is a must see! I saw it by myself and the 3 hours or so flew by so fast that I didn't even realize how long the movie was. It could have gone on for 3 more hours as far as I'm concerned. Anthony Hopkins was wonderful and if we all could have his character's attitude, the world would be a better place. Brad Pitt was handsome as ever and did a great job in his dual role. I can't say enough about this movie. I plan on going to see it at least 2 more times with other friends of mine. I need to memorize some quotes that ""Bill Parrish"" (Anthony Hopkins' character) says. This movie added meaning to my life and made me appreciate life and how beautiful it truly is! Don't delay - GO SEE IT!

15 November 1998,A great movie if you are not worried about time...,"A very romantic movie. Most people criticize the length of the movie. It will not seem long at all if you are really into the movie. I didn't even know 3 hours went by. Brad Pitt was charming and Anthony Hopkins was magnificent as usual. The surprising performance was that of Clair Forlani. She was beautiful and endearing as Susan Parrish. Some parts of the movie are inconsistent, ie Brad Pitt's naivety. Some of the music played in the film did not achieve the affect it was intended for. Overall, a good movie to see with your girlfriend/boyfriend/husband/wife.

16 November 1998,"a little long, but well done.","It's LONG. 180 minutes long. Personally, I think the way Martin Brest stretched out the scenes was additive to the movie rather than destructive. Brad Pitt plays the character of death (as written) marvelously, and Claire Forlani is above acceptable as Susan, but not exactly Oscar material either. Hopkins and Jake Weber (Drew) run away with the plot, Weber ranks next to Billy Zane (Cal from _Titanic_) as Hollywood's next great bad guy. Incredibly solid technically, the camera work and sets are incredibly well done, and it's very nice to see a beautiful movie that wasn't created on a Macintosh or Silicon Graphics computer in some studio, but in front of a real camera.

19 November 2015,Loved it,"""Meet Joe Black"" is one of two Brad Pitt movies which deal with the theme of human limits. A decade later followed ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" a story about a man who ages backwards. When we compare these two films, we see clearly how Pit has remained true to the quality of his performance; the actor is able to present the most complex characters with a timeless dimension. How much you will enjoy the movie depends on your acceptance of the (un)reality of the plot. The truth is that, behind the actions, lies a series of moments that will define why you love movies. The symbolism should be evaluated, how we all need to look back in our life, make a balance of what we have achieved and tell ourselves: ""I am satisfied"". There's an emotional core and good intentions that extends through the entire two and a half hours. I do not remember that I watched the story of death recorded with so many lives.

15 November 1998,Excellent!!!!!,"I absolutely loved this movie. And not just because Brad Pitt is the main character (although it doesn't hurt), but I enjoyed the whole story line. There were funny parts, sad parts and a great ending. I recommend for everyone to see this great movie.

16 November 1998,An Hour Too Long But Good Movie,"As always Anthony Hopkins is superb however this was a Brad Pitt Show-Case for roughly the first hour and a half of the movie. It could have easily been at the 2 hour limit, with the same effect. Joe Black leaves, the coffee shop guy returns, and just what is his name??? New ending for the writers, lightning should have struck Joe, as he sat, crying, on the bench, the coffee shop guy returns at that point and Mr. Parrish continues a long life as he possessed the true talent in this movie.

16 November 1998,Excellent,"I am baffled at all the negative reviews I've been reading; I think this is one of the best movies to come out this year. I'm not very often one to cry at a movie, but this one made me bawl. Every actor was extremely convincing, and I think for those who enjoy analyzing and contemplating what is truly important in life (and are also able to enjoy the concept of fantasy), this is about as good as it gets! I do agree w/most of the critics on one point; the time could have been edited down considerably without losing anything too important. However, I remained interested enough throughout that I never once wondered when it would end. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!

12 January 1999,Did Universal Die?,"I liked the movie. I even liked the technical accomplishments that Brest put together. However, Universal must have died because a) Brad Pitt's film was not targeted toward any market during the release, b) Thomas Newman wasn't accredited for giving the soundtrack its due, c)the publicity following the debut of the film sucked (literally), leaving the cast and crew treading water. Sometimes I wonder about the studios--all that money and absolutely no brains to spend it.....

6 May 2016,Breathtaking,"What an incredible movie. Photography, scenery, acting, editing, music of this movie are nothing but exceptional. This is what movie making is all about. After watching it dozens of times, it just gets better and better as you find little details you haven't seen before. Rating of this movie shows movie critics are ignorant and generally follow a political agenda. You'll not find black people in this movie, or sand people. Just successful white people (a no-no for the politically correct corrupt Obongo types) going about their business, no LBTG crap. Beautiful photography and scenery. No shortcuts were made during production. A true gem.

17 November 1998,Good Movie but upsets me a little,"Meet Joe Black was a good movie but it upset me to think if that really did happen with ""Death"" and everything. I know that it is a fiction movie, but just imagine if you were in Brad Pitts or Anthony Hopkins place. It did upset me when Brad Pitt got hit by a car. Death took his body, but how in the world did he get back in it???

21 November 1998,I loved it!,"I went to see this movie, mainly because it was with Brad Pitt, who I think is absolutely perfect, and as well as being a talented actor. Unlike the people I saw the movie with, I had high aspirations for the movie going into see it, but I was still impressed with it! Anyone that appreciates life, love and a good movie, will hold a special place in their heart for ""Meet Joe Black"".

23 January 2021,Definition of love to a T.,"The opening scene in the helicopter where Hopkins tells his daughter what he believes to be the definition of true love. It is a description of what I experienced with a woman some 20 years ago. I have never been able to shake it and I am still looking for it once more. I fear, as Joe Black gets closer, that, sadly, I may never experience it again.

24 November 1998,Could be nominated for Best Picture,"This was a quick movie for three hours. That is, it kept my interest throughout. At no time did I check my watch.

Although Brad Pitt was excellent in his dual role and Anthony Hopkins was as good as usual, the most outstanding performances were by Jeff Tambor (Quince) and Marcia Gay Hardin(Allison).

Jeff Tambor is my favorite character in the film. Even when in the background he had presence. When in the foreground he stole the scene. Quince's interaction with Joe, in the bar, was the icing on the cake for me. Quince's internal battle with his utter despair is as convincing a job of acting as I have seen in so many movies, and Marcia Gay is a close second for her performance. Go see this movie.

I highly recommend this movie to all adults and mature minded teens.",10
25 November 1998,Very smooth and seamless. Easy to watch & enjoy,"I was concerned about the critical knock about it's length. My

wife and I hardly noticed the time and we both felt the story

was laid out very nicely with an excellent cast and direction so

that the story and characters held our attention completely.

It's very easy to recommend the film to friends, family and

others. The romance, comedy, and drama are mixed at a smooth

and timely

11 December 1998,Brilliant movie. I don't know what movie some critics were watching.,"""Meet Joe Black"" is my favorite movie of 1998 (That includes ""Saving Private Ryan"") I have to wonder if some of the critics saw the same movie I did. I thought it was kind of humorous that some critics panned Brad Pitt's performance because he didn't show emotion. He played Death, I thought that was the whole point!! Normally, I don't like to suggest movies to other people, but this is one I have no problem suggesting.

22 December 1998,A simple review of Meet Joe Black from the eyes of a teenager,"When this movie first came out I thought, "" Oh great, another hokey love story!"" However, after I finally got bored enough to go see it, I was amazed! This movie builds you up and takes you through a ride of a million and one emotions. The actors/actresses do an amazing job and give a performance that will jerk on your heartstrings. My only complaint is that this movie, like most 3+ hours films, begins to drag towards the end. However, that aside- I believe this movie is definitely Oscar material. I would recommend it to just about anyone.(Heck, my 13 year old brother enjoyed it!) Just be sure to bring along the tissues.

13 December 1998,"Most touching, heart-warming movie","This movie was the most touching, heart-warming movie I've seen in a very long time. The performances by Mr. Pitt and Mr. Hopkins were superb. The set took my breath away. Truly a remarkable film. And who would have ever guessed that I'd feel sorry for DEATH at the end of the movie?!?

Mr. Pitt gave a remarkable performance....I loved his transition from the guy in the coffee shop...to DEATH. It was easy to believe the character. His acting showed a depth of awe and awaking I didn't expect.

Fantastic movie. I plan to take my mother next weekend.

20 January 1999,Amazing! It's long but it's worth it!,"It´s truly fascinating!! I listened to all types of critics before seeing the movie. I just didn't know what to expect!. The truth is that's a great film. I was not a very big fan of Brad Pitt, but as an actor he is getting better and better. I'm really sorry that the Academy doesn't like him that much, but his part on the film is brilliant. Yes it is long!! but the story makes you be seated until the end. It gives you time to think about it and really enjoy the moment. It's certainly one of the best films of last year and I think that Tom Hanks' part in ""Saving Private Ryan"" is much below the interpretation of Brad Pitt.

18 January 1999,"A warm and moving portrayal of love, life and all the passion it brings.","I found this film both moving and funny. There were superb performances by all members of the cast (notably Sir Anthony Hopkins) and the love story between Forlani and Pitt contains a real, humanistic, passionate element. Admittedly the time could have been reduced somewhat, there is often long, unnecessary silences and a few sub-plots that could have been removed. The film is however highly amusing if you allow yourself to be open to the humour. Pitt's portrayal of death is amusing, warm and well attempted since he couldn't exactly research the part! Hopkins, as always, gives a powerful, moving performance which really holds the rest of the cast and Forlani plays her part with a quiet dignity that suits Susan. Overall, the film may be a bit too long, but it is time well spent in this warm-hearted portrayal of love, life, and death.

29 November 1999,Is it over yet?,"I really wanted to like this movie. Everytime I thought it was getting better, it didn't. Honestly, if I had to watch one more minute of people just looking at each other I would have thrown my TV out the window. I was reminded of Holly Hunter's performance in ""The Piano"". But since her character was MUTE, it was bearable. And why was everybody whispering? If you cut all the unneccessary STARING, especially that Claire girl, the long and uneventful silences, and maybe given the focal characters some personality (excluding Hopkins, he was great), the movie would have been ok.

29 April 1999,Good movie but needs more research,"Anthony Hopkins was great. Brad Pitt actually impressed me with his island accent. Overall good movie but lacks realism with Brad Pitt playing a death angel. Also, if this is supposed to raise the question of angels giving up immortality for a sexual relationship it fails poorly. If angels do have the choice and Biblically there are references to angels leaving their first habitation, I doubt that God would allow his angelic messenger to ""sow his wild oats"" without consequence.

4 March 1999,Not bad at all!,"It was a social film which also had its funny and sad moments although some were a bit frightening if you really think about it (i.e. falling in love with ""death""...). However, it is something similar to ""City of Angels"" except that Death comes to earth instead of an Angel. Also the name of the guy at the cafeteria was never mentioned throughout the film. But a very good performance was played by Brad Pitt. The way he changed characters as if he really was a different person was exceptional. Overall, it wasn't bad. It was a movie with real life moments like having to deal with the fact that one day you're going to die only this time you know when!

29 May 1999,"A gift of a film, in more ways than one.","One of the nicest things a movie can do for us is make us feel better about being alive, and this movie does a fine job of that. The quiet triumph of good over not-so-good, the affirmation of our faith in helping each other to meet life's challenges, and a genuinely sweet appreciation of the richness relationships bring to our lives, all combine to put Meet Joe Black in that special group of films we usually associate with the Christmas season. Special thanks to Sir Anthony Hopkins for yet another marvelous performance, and to the absolutely luminescent Claire Forlani for what is not so much a performance as a reason to fall in love.

6 June 1999,*How* can I *love* this when I can't endure Brad Pitt??,"My first thought, after seeing about half this film, was that it had to be this particular studio & director's answer to/version of the Nicholas Cage/Meg Ryan '98 film ""City of Angels."" After all is said and done, isn't it just the Angel of Death coming to Earth, falling for a female mortal, and being disappointed in the end (as Death in this case, not as a human mortal male)? After about 20+ viewings this past week, this is what stays with me most, at any rate.

For those who totally panned this film, stop and rethink this POV: isn't this done *much* more ""tongue-in-cheek"" than ""City of Angels"" was? ""City"" seemed to take itself much too seriously, and it left me highly p****d off at Meg Ryan's character for being so foolhardy. ""Joe"" leaves me smirking, if not LOL, which BP constantly seems to be on the verge of doing due to some of the downright puerile lines he was given. Then again, if *I* were Pitt, I'd laugh my a**e off all the way to the bank, too. As for Sir Anthony Hopkins: poor man fared much better with ""Silence of the Lambs"" as Hannibal the Cannibal, didn't he? He seemed almost too restrained to me at most points, when he should have been raging against his all-too-soon-to-be fate (""I shall *not* go gently into this good night,"" and so on.). Several times I during the film, I wish to see the *originally* filmed version, instead of this editor's idea of something we should *pay* to see. I seriously doubt a ""director's cut"" will ever be available, but if so, I'd like to see it. Still, with all its flaws, and all the dumb lines and improbable situations there is something about this that's like Black's peanut butter (or better yet, a Lay's potato chip): I just can't put it aside. I find something new to love about it every time. P.S. Thought: I wonder who told the costume designer what Pitt's clothing sizes were *supposed* to be for this film? Whoever it was didn't do the job at *all* well, speaking as a clothier. JMNSHLO.",
10 May 1999,An amazing movie filled with incredible themes.,"I thought this film was amazing. Anthony Hopkins is one of the finest actors around. Brad Pitt was amazing. But the true winner was the script. It was filled with some of the most beautiful sentiments I have ever heard in a movie. Hopkins speech about love to his daughter, on the plane in the beginning of the movie was beyond compare. It makes a cynic like me, hope for the best, and dream that a love so amazing can truly be out there. I don't usually like romantic movies, but this one spoke to me. Maybe it's just the place I'm in right now.

30 May 1999,"It could be a masterpiece, but...","This movie would be a masterpiece, if it's an hour shorter. I was hooked in the first 2 hours, but lost my patience at the final hour. It seems that the director decided to drum up all the melodrama as much as he could in the finale. It's pretty insulting for a director to drum up the music whenever there is an emotional scene. Like the audience doesn't realize it's coming. There are a lot of good things in this movie. Anthony Hopkins is very believable as a millionaire, and the other performances are very good as well, including Brad Pitt.

4 June 1999,Pleasantly surprising and a bit of a tearjerker to boot . . .,"I have to admit that I didn't see this movie when it hit theatres primarily because the promos just gave no indication what it was about [that and I've never really cared for Brad Pitt]. However, despite problems with sound levels [which REALLY need to be worked out, everything being too soft, then the music cutting in and slamming you into the wall opposite the tv] the movie was a surprise. I really liked it, and Brad Pitt [Joe Black] does a fine job as Death, a being who has always been so locked into its job it has never had a vacation and calling upon Anthony Hopkins [William Parrish] to act as ""mentor"" in the world of mortality. Its three hour length may have been one thing that turned people off in the U.S. I don't recall ticket sales being that high for this movie. But the script needs those three hours to allow the audience a plausible reason to LIKE Joe Black, which is necessary for the story to work. A movie well worth renting for any evening.

7 February 2000,"Sappy, trite and reluctant to let B. Pitt offscreen!","The storyline is interesting and intriguing through to about 2/3 of the movie, then turns into just another love story with predictable results. The ending is particularly dull. Never fully develops the potential built into the plot, seemingly content to let Mr. Pitt's looks keep viewers. On the plus side, Anthony Hopkins is, as usual, brilliant. Overall disappointing due to unfulfilled potential.

10 August 1999,Surprisingly fresh,"I thought this picture would be a formulaic rehash of similar themes and thought Brad Pitt representing Death was a huge mistake. But the story was clean, involving and well thought out. Anthony Hopkins and Pitt were excellent as the unlikely universally-loved billionaire and Death. The flaw was in the female lead who I thought lacked the reach for her role and seemed oblivious to the change that we the audience could see easily. Beautifully made, with a clear glow.

3 September 1999,Needs some serious editing...,"This film has some nice moments and is fairly entertaining, but I wouldn't say that it is a good movie. I thought a lot of the scenes should have been shortened or eliminated (Especially the Jamaican woman subplot and the peanut butter scene- how boring!). I also thought the ending was a little too unbelievable (Claire Forlani's character looks pretty gullible when Brad Pitt says he must have woke up from a dream).

My advice?- Avoid this movie unless you are absolutely desperate.

17 December 2000,"so bad, I registered w/ IMDB to gripe about it","Like most folks here, I watch a lot of movies. Even if a movie doesn't knock my socks off, I can usually find one or two lines or scenes good enough to justify time and money ""invested"".

This movie was the second time in a looooong time that I genuinely wish I had not bothered AT ALL. (I won't tell you the other one, I am afraid to speak its name aloud).

I have a profound respect for Anthony Hopkins and generally enjoy Brad Pitt very much (his characterizations in Fight Club and 12 monkeys were amazing, in my view). And I am glad to find Jeffery Tambor still working.

NOBODY could save this movie. Watching it was like picking a piece of canned pineapple out of one's braces in a boring 6th grade lesson on an overcast day. For three hours. Watching it was like listening to a favourite record whilst someone randomly slowed down the playback with their finger, *just enough* to get under your skin and drive you nutty. And as for the ""Claire Forlani / Brad Pitt Limpid Eyed Gazing 'Fest '98"", I mean, sheesh, nuff said.

Go clean the grout on your bathroom walls with a toothbrush, it will be time better spent. Trust me.",4

25 April 2001,Awful Film,"I'm sorry but I found this film to be truly awful, with glaring inconsistencies and very very boring!

For a start when Anthony Hopkins first meets 'death' he invites him to have dinner with him, as if it happens to him all the time!

Brad Pitt can't seem to decide whether his character is oblivious to earth customs, as in 'what's peanut butter?' and 'how do I wear a tie?' in an annoying Crocodile Dundee type way. Whereas other times he understands everything and can even speak in different languages!!

Anthony Hopkins, who, as always, lights up the screen, seems embarrassed to be in this film. What a waste of talent!

The only thing 'meet Joe Black' teaches you about death, is that you have just wasted three hours of your own life!",
3 January 2002,"LOL, what a FUN movie!","I've never seen Brad Pitt being as funny as in this movie!! He's great playing Death and not knowing how to behave. Though the movie is way too long and the plot too slow, Brad Pitt did a great job. So did Anthony Hopkins, but that's no surprise. If you like B.P., you really have to see this film! He's not just funny, but REALLY sexy too!!

Furthermore i got really lost at the end anyway, what happened to Anthony Hopkins and was brad Pitt really what he said he was !!!! I have really enjoyed Anthony Hopkins in his other movies i have watched and also Brad Pitt he is also excellent, but the loud music spoilt this film for me entirely, sorry, but it has to be said.

7 February 2002,Now multiply that by infinity and take it to the depth of forever,"So much has been said about the length of this film and in my opinion without real need. The film works well being three hours long and gives a true sense of time in relation to the film itself. The plot isn't important, but this seems to have been lost within the plot driven minds of many. Characterisation is always the most vital key in films such as this. And this abounds. The performance of Anthony Hopkins is good but not awe inspiring but then again it doesn't need to be.It isn't his film. But he does portray the business mogul with a heart well and feels genuine. I bet most would like to wake up one morning and realise they 'want nothing more'. His relationship with his daughters is interesting as it shows that it is enough to know that you are loved. Clire Forlani is breathtaking. Not perhaps her acting at all points (esp. when she utters ""I feel like we're taking off"") but her look, timing and body language fits the role perfectly. But who is important is Brad Pitt. I was never a Pitt fan but gradually was turned with his roles in Twelve Monkeys and the Devil's Own (didn't think much to se7en) yet this was the first point I realised the guy can really act! Other comments have described him as 'dull' or 'rigid' but they are missing the point. The character in the coffee shop is engaging and perhaps the one everybody would have liked to see throughout but Death is where he comes alive!The best way to describe his portrayl would be as a cross between a blind person who has just gained their sight and is intriged and enchanted by everything around them and the look of interested bewilderment which young children have when seeing, say, the circus for the first time. This seems to fit beautifully into the film, ad feels right. The character is endeering through a childlike innocence yet partnered well with a hidden undercurrent of darkness.Pitt has the ability to command the scene over the seemingly more powerful Hopkins.Some have said that Forlani wouldn't fall for the 'stony Pitt' but stony isn't the right expression. He is repressed (not in a bad way) and it is this which makes him mysterious and ultimately captivating as an individual. He hides such yet is completey open,sometimes embrassingly so as he requsts peanut butter instead of a gourmet meal.The inner child rules all. Brad Pitt leapt in my estimation and I now look forward to seeing him on the screen.

If all this wasn't enough, the cinematography is unbelievable. The framing and spacing combined with the film's richness of apearance is wonderful. The ending, as he stands on the bridge, is one of the most beautiful scenes in cinema I can remember. The score also contributes immensly. It is soulful yet maintains the underlying hint of darkness.The orchestal arrangemnet of 'What a wonderful world' should be cheesy and over the top but somehow it works.

My only complaint in an otherwise beautiful film is the ending. I almost wish that Hollywood didn't exist or the film was british so that we wouldn't have to have the token 'happy Hollywood' ending. Though this is a minor point. Watch this film for a number of reasons. 1.Brad Pitt and 2. this is how a film should look!!",8
20 May 2008,Valuable to watch!!!,"I have seen this movie as much as...i not sure some, but about 6 times...and i will and i want to watch it again! I don't care this movie is not a box-office movie in 1998 and i don't care this movie is 2 and half hours long...what i know, the film is one of my favorite movies of all time! In terms of acting especially Anthony Hopkin is interesting to watch! The scrip and quotes in this movie is the most interesting especially ""Love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with? And how do you find him? Forget your head and listen to your heart. Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this. To make the journey and not fall deeply in love-well, you haven't lived a life at all."" This William Parrish quotes motivates me most in life...and how i met my future wife.

21 September 2008,strong film with a poor conclusion,"It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?

Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.

Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.

Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.

Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.

See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",7
29 September 2002,A Definite No For Any Sane Person,"I have seen quite a number of movies with dumb plots,but this one takes the cake.The plot can at best be described as inconsistent and the ending was totally cliched inspite of unusual storyline. Inspite of numerous opportunities which could have made it a great movie the script was totally unimaginative and totally lacked a sense of direction.

Brad Pitt goes throughout the movie with the same dead pan expression thinking that is how Death would do it. Clare (if its her name) seemsto have only one emotion of earnestness with lips protruding to kiss the Death throughout the movie. Anthony Hopkins tries to lend some sanity to the script with his portrayal but he too goes clueless towards the end.

A total waste of time if you watch it ,with an after effect of painful headache if you try to make any sense of it.

4 July 2003,I'm fascinated,"I think this was the first movie I cry for. I've seen many great movies, but this one was something I can't explain. Not even to myself.

I'm proud to be human.

P.S. Firstly i start to watching this movie because of actress. In my opinion is the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. At the end I found another great experience and I think I'll remember this movie for ever.

10 December 2003,Claire Forlani,"It's not as this is a Hemingway novel. However, I thought that Claire Forlani was stunningly attractive and sexy (especially in the final party scene when she was looked as if she were Eve in the Garden of Eden). My only question is why don't we see more of this beautiful woman and wonderful talent in other venues. Enough of Brad and Anthony in ""Fall of Whatever"" -- Ms. Forlani stold the movie. Let's give her the credit she deserves and give her more of deserving parts!

27 September 2004,I related,"I watched this movie for the fifth time last night. There is something about it that I connect with. I really like this movie and highly recommend it. Here are some of the reasons: I have three daughters. In the movie, William Parrish (Hopkins) simply adores his daughters. He gives them wonderful advice that is worthy of quoting. (I have). He is extremely successful it motivates me every time I see the movie. There is an incredible mystery about death that is intriguing. Nobody really knows what is on the other side of that threshold. The movie makes one examine his mortality. It gives meaning to family, character and relationships. The music is incredible. I have the soundtrack and it is a must have. On a lighter note, there are several plots that keep things interesting. Watch the movie and look for the pearls. They are there if you can find them. You never know, lightning could strike.

12 October 2004,Horrible...,"OK I had zero interest in this movie when it came out in the theaters but was forced to watch it recently when it was basically the only movie on cable TV... so i figured i would give it a chance...

My instincts were right -- the plot was stupid and pointless -- the only redeeming feature was Anthony Hopkins... I fell asleep a few times and still knew what was going on and just wanted to see how they would end the movie with Anthony Hopkins character and I should have just turned the channel since they couldn't even come up with a decent ending -- what Hollywood crap -- it was a like Hallmark card... predictable -- you know from the coffee shop scene the daughter and Brad Pitt would end up together... I am still upset i wasted my time watching it and don't understand why people like this movie -- anyway i am glad that there are a few others out there who agree with me...

5 November 2022,Unrealistic Approach towards showing death,"A completely unrealistic approach towards showing how a death comes on this planet. Completely hilarious movie. For the first time I realized that Brad Pitt has taken such a useless story / theme. How come a fictional death came in some human body is falling for someone on the planet earth. That body of Brad Pitt used by the death should not had feelings / emotions as of the normal human who feels attraction and being attracted by the opposite gender.

This story should have been casted keeping science fiction or some other genera to show this superhuman story.

This movie is totally a wastage of time.

7 April 2016,Should I be afraid? Not a man like you,"I'm always amazed how many people haven't seen this. It's easily one of my favourite movies of all time. Admittedly it's quite long at 3 hours but if you have the patience for it, it's well worth it. Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins are both fantastic, as are the supporting cast, but for me it's the soundtrack that stands out most in this movie, is incredible. I don't usually notice the music but in this Thomas Newman's score is amazing, particularly ""That next place"" towards the end.

Also as a slight aside, I have no idea where they got those cakes made but they looked incredible.

If you have a spare 3 hours, or are looking for something different to watch, give this a go. You won't regret it!

1 September 2015,"Unbelievably long, boring, and hokey","I usually expect far better from actors as revered as Hopkins and Pitt.

Each of the script's four writers must have wanted to take the plot in a separate direction, and their compromise (or lack thereof) is awkward and disjointed.

The nonsensical story could have been told in fifty minutes instead of 180. But instead, each scene contains several dramatic pauses interrupting exchanges full of blatant plot-explaining dialogue which leaves much to be desired in terms of chemistry.

The execution in making this movie clearly just sucked. The essential premise of death being led around to explore the mortal world doesn't end up teaching us anything about life and death other than how much we apparently undervalue the taste of peanut butter in our world (I wish I were joking).

Watch this movie only if you feel like cringing.",1
17 October 2005,death meets life!,"Isn't it ironic that Joe in this movie falls in love with his total opposite.

A woman whose life's profession is to preserve the highest quality of life.

A life of killing and murdering devirignized with the purity and innocence of life simple pleasures.

Who knew we had it so good and even better financially if we was a media Mogul!

That is true cinema...and true love!

True love is accomplish when one comes out of ones comfort zone to show affection.

NO BEGGING.. CHASING..JUST PURE ELECTRICITY!

Take that advise men and u wouldn't have to beg for it all the time!",8
13 April 2019,Not a masterpiece but worth a watch (if you like rom-coms),"What an interesting ""romantic comedy"" with a heavy dose of the romance and quite a unique take on the comedy. Some similarities with ""Ghost.""

16 February 2020,"Fell asleep once, even with a cuppa Joe handy","It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings.

26 June 2017,Well worth watching.,"A gorgeous and well written movie with some excellent acting; even pretty boy Brad Pitt shows he's able to act, occasionally. For me, the highlight was the beauty of actress Claire Forlani, who plays Susan Parrish. I swear when she smiles her eyes actually GLOW! I could could find only three minor faults with this movie. Pitt's character wasn't fully developed during the movie, but likely that's due to practical limitations to his ability as an actor. Second, it's longer than really necessary. Lastly, there seems to be an awful lot of mouth kissing going on between family members, especially Susan and her father! It made me uncomfortable and I kept hoping there was a good reason coming in the plot, but none was given. Maybe it was just so the other actors could get some lip time with the GORGEOUS ""Susan"" character. Who knows.
